<p>A political consensus that competition is the best mechanism to increase innovation and improve efficiency through the allocation of resources to where they will have the greatest impact is now accepted on the centre right. It is perhaps no coincidence that the word ‘competition’ (or its derivative) was used 48 times in the 30-page consultation document on the future of the probation service in England and Wales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0264550512467588">Ministry of Justice, 2012</xref>). The term ‘rehabilitation’, on the other hand, is hardly used. On another level it is not just the promotion of competition <italic>per se</italic> but its use as a mechanism towards further reducing the service delivery role of the public sector through the creation of commissioning mechanisms and financial structures that promote the influence of the private sector. Placed within this context, the changes experienced by the probation service can be viewed as part of a much broader project to reform and modernize the whole of the public sector. All too often, though, it seems that contemporary politicians promulgate a false dichotomy between the private and the public sectors. John <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0264550512467588">Richardson (undated)</xref>, who is an expert in critical discourse analysis, has analysed the language used by politicians when discussing privatization. He points out that private provision is often framed within the positive language of ‘reform, cooperation and partnership’. Whereas the public sector is repeatedly co-located with ‘spending’, the private sector is more likely to be framed as ‘finance’ which could be seen as a more positive term. These are strong metaphors within which to locate political debate but in reality, both sectors are of course mutually reliant on each other. As Polly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0264550512467588">Toynbee (2012)</xref> has noted, ‘Government will always contract and procure from the private sector, but it shouldn’t be a matter of ideology’. Further, in the context of criminal justice, Peter Raynor has eloquently argued that ‘criminal justice is not a commodity or a service but a transaction between the state and the citizen’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0264550512467588">Raynor, 2012</xref>: 947). Privatization can be seen as indolent policy making because it aspires to the abdication of state responsibility towards those with least power but greatest need. Financial return and cost savings should not be placed above social justice no matter how persuasive this may seem in times of economic austerity. Ultimately, it is the state through which we express our collective social obligations and pool our risks. That is why it matters who delivers criminal justice. The relationship between the state and civil society cannot be reduced to a zero-sum game where a public sector worker is replaced by a willing volunteer or private entrepreneur. Scandinavian countries that have a much stronger network of third sector organizations (including social enterprises) than the United Kingdom, are characterized by a supportive, not a shrinking state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0264550512467588">Wilson and Bloomfield, 2011</xref>).  </p>
<p>As the political philosopher Michael <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0264550512467588">Sandel (2012)</xref> has argued, we need to think carefully about how markets operate, what the limits of the market are, and the need to ensure that whilst the increasing penetration of public services by the private sector persists (as it seems invariably it will) that issues of legitimacy and public interest are at the forefront of these discussions. He argues that we have drifted from <italic>having </italic>a market economy to <italic>being</italic> a market society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0264550512467588">Sandel, 2012</xref>: 10). Whereas the former is a tool for organizing productive activity, the latter becomes a way of life in which market values encroach into every aspect of public life. Sandel questions the morality of market economies that reduce public goods to mere commodities that can be bought and sold to the highest bidder. He warns that such a situation not only widens inequalities but ultimately corrupts the values of society because ‘markets don’t only allocate goods; they also express and promote certain attitudes towards the good being exchanged’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0264550512467588">Sandel, 2012</xref>: 8). This raises an intriguing question as to the extent in which marketization and the profit motive undermine the values that the probation service should stand for.  Policy debates around probation practice cannot and should not be merely limited to instrumental means. Supporting and helping individuals towards achieving a better life and treating them with humanity is an ethical entitlement and not one contingent upon reducing reoffending at the lowest possible cost. </p>
<p>The probation service has a long tradition of working alongside other sectors and no one within probation would claim that the organization can, or should, provide all the services required to meet the complex needs of those supervised. The private sector may have a role to play in criminal justice in the provision of specific services but if the ultimate goal is the wholesale privatization of a public good then it is not only morally dubious but ultimately costly in practice as potential savings are inevitably offset by increased administration and bureaucracy. A recent report into the procurement of electronic monitoring technology has argued that it has provided poor value for money and in reality stifled innovation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0264550512467588">Skelton, 2012</xref>). In a wider context, it has been estimated that the private finance initiative (PFI) to build and manage schools, hospitals and prisons could cost up to £25 billion more than if the government had paid for them directly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0264550512467588">Milne, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Current developments that see Probation Trusts seeking to build alliances with private organizations to deliver services (some of which they currently deliver themselves) could be viewed as an inevitable and pragmatic response to contemporary politically driven changes that propose a much limited role for probation in the delivery of services. Such is the enduring ideological drive behind marketization that it could be argued that probation risks becoming isolated in this brave new world. Those Chief Executives of Probation Trusts responsible for such decisions invariably face unenviable dilemmas and it could be argued that in the current environment the reality is that some influence is better than none. Such moves, though, should proceed with extreme caution. Firstly, because by definition multinational corporations are expansionist (in that they need to obtain maximum profits for their shareholders through economies of scale) thereby creating new ‘private monopolies’. In reality, only a small caucus of multinationals have the capacity to tender for large-scale government contracts and as Zoe <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0264550512467588">Williams (2012)</xref> has highlighted, ‘The central problem is that it encourages companies to expand into areas in which they have no expertise and squeeze out smaller, often charitable enterprises already working in that area’. Secondly, perhaps more importantly, careful thought should be given to what signals such alliances send out. Despite the promotion of the private sector by successive governments, it is by no means assured that the public fully trust the private sector (estimates suggest that less than 40 per cent support the privatization of prisons).  Understandably private sector operators have been quick to see involving established providers in the tendering process as a means of legitimizing their involvement and demonstrating their sense of social responsibility. In the third sector this has been dismissed as ‘bid candy’. In asking the public to trust probation we are also asking them by definition to trust our private sector partners.  At least two of the private companies currently bidding to run offender services have been involved in highly publicized scandals centring on claims that they were manipulating results in order to meet their targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0264550512467588">
<italic>The Guardian</italic>, 2012a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0264550512467588">2012b</xref>). The high profile failure of G4S to provide sufficient security for the London 2012 Olympics has also brought into question the assumed efficiency of the private sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0264550512467588">Orr, 2012</xref>). As Jane Dominey notes in this issue of the journal, working with large private sector contractors clearly brings reputational and quality of practice risks.</p>
<p>The first two articles in this special edition provide a lens to locate contemporary debates surrounding the level of competition, marketization and privatization within a longer term enterprise to reform probation. The first article by Raymond Gard, ‘The creation of a “fully public service”: Probation in England and Wales between the wars’, serves a timely reminder as to why probation became a public service in the first place. He outlines the increasing dissatisfaction with the system of ‘dual control’ (whereby many probation officers were jointly funded by the state and religious societies) and the resultant inconsistencies in the organization of probation across England and Wales.  Whilst the journey towards a fully public service was by no means straightforward and there were familiar objections regarding the costs involved, the Home Office eventually assumed responsibility for ensuring the provision of probation on a national level. The author provides an insight into a less documented period in probation’s history but perhaps more importantly demonstrates that many of the concerns that dominated policy debates then would still be familiar to contemporary observers as they have their roots in these earlier developments.</p>
<p>The debates that dominated the organization and delivery of probation services between the wars can be seen as a response to, and reflection of, the wider economic, political and structural conditions of the time. This is nonetheless true today, as highlighted in Jane Dominey’s article ‘A mixed market for probation services: Can lessons from the recent past help shape the near future?’. The author traces the development of partnership work between the probation service and the voluntary sector since the 1990s to show that the current proposals can be seen as a part of an ongoing project to modernize the whole of the public sector. Using the past 25 years as a lens to consider the potential of the current reforms she warns that there are a number of important practice principles that should be heeded. She reminds us that rehabilitation is a complicated process requiring skilful and committed staff and that our knowledge and understanding of how the potential impact of a mixed economy of provision will impact on this work remains largely undeveloped. As such a careful and measured approach needs to be taken to ensure that appropriate services are not only provided but are also responsive to the diverse needs of those who require them. </p>
<p>Payment by results has emerged as the organizing principle for the governance of probation in this new competitive environment.  In ‘Is payment by results the most efficient way to address the challenges faced by the criminal justice sector?’, Chris Fox and Kevin Albertson consider the methodological and implementation challenges involved in achieving payment by results. Drawing on examples from other policy areas, such as health, employment and substance misuse, the authors provided a balanced overview that helps us to understand the attractiveness of the concept to politicians and commissioners of services. As Andrew Neilson has remarked ‘Who would argue for paying for failure?’  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0264550512467588">Neilson, 2012</xref>: 421). Here the authors take a more nuanced perspective to support the view that whilst there may be some potential benefits from the application of payment by results, its impact is likely to be somewhat limited and it is by no means a panacea for the perceived failings of the current system. At the time of publication it has been decided to suspend the development of a number of pilot payment-by-results schemes, including plans to contract out some aspects of probation service work in Wales, Staffordshire and the West Midlands. The decision was no doubt prompted by adverse publicity following the fiasco of the west coast mainline tendering process. It is clear, though, that the government still sees the application of payment by results to the delivery of offender services as a top priority and in this respect is merely giving itself more time to reflect on the strategic direction to take. The appointment of Chris Grayling as Justice Secretary would appear if anything to give momentum to the process given his previous role in overseeing payment by results whilst responsible for the Department for Work and Pensions and his attempts to ‘put some bite’ into his predecessor’s proposals to reform community punishments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0264550512467588">Travis, 2012</xref>). The new Justice Secretary would do well to heed the advice provided by Chris Fox and Kevin Albertson in their article to not only await the outcome of the current payment by results pilots before rolling out their plans but also use this pause in implementation to explore other innovative and potentially more productive approaches such as justice reinvestment and personalized budgets for service users.</p>
<p>Measuring the impact of what is done is undoubtedly important although devising appropriate mechanisms to do this is extremely difficult. This is particularly true in relation to the provision of services for women as highlighted by Loraine Gelsthorpe and Carol Hedderman in their article ‘Providing for women offenders: The risks of adopting a payment by results approach’. Drawing on existing research and literature, the authors warn how the introduction of a market into criminal justice could have a detrimental impact and undermine recent progress in attempting to provide more gender-informed services. Many of these smaller, locally based, providers are unlikely to attract investors as the numbers of women involved are too small and their needs too complex. As a result demonstrating their impact in terms of reducing reoffending will be more of a challenge and means that some existing providers will be unable to survive in this new competitive environment despite their undoubted value in providing a supportive environment for vulnerable women. It remains to be seen, therefore, whether or not the government has the political will to achieve its commitment to ‘delivering targeted services on the ground, with responsibility for providing gender specific and holistic services built into the fabric of every Probation Trust’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0264550512467588">Ministry of Justice, 2012</xref>: 40).</p>
<p>The Government clearly hopes that competition will facilitate new working relationships and, as previously mentioned, there is some evidence that this is happening across the sectors. It has long been acknowledged that professional relationships are central to effective partnership work but as Alice Mills, Rosie Meek and Dina Gojkovic point out, there has been scant attention to the context within which such arrangements operate. In ‘Partners, guests or competitors: Relationships between criminal justice and third sector staff in prisons’, the authors examine the relationships between third sector and prison staff in eight prisons establishments. They found that the intransigence and suspicion of ‘outsiders’ which has traditionally tended to characterize prison officer culture was less evident and professional rivalries rare although third sector workers were still in the main viewed as guests in the host environment. However, the authors warn that the progress made in breaking down professional and cultural barriers could be undermined by competition and lead to  the exclusion of some providers under the guise of ‘commercial confidentiality’ if they are not partners in the bidding process. As David <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0264550512467588">Faulkner (2012</xref>) has noted ‘Democratic accountability is hard to reconcile with commercial confidentiality’.</p>
<p>The final piece offers a personal account of the opening up of the market in offender services. In ‘We should be the customers’, Christopher Stacey considers these developments from his personal experience of the criminal justice system both as a former service user and as a campaigner with Unlock (The National Association of Reformed offenders). He raises the intriguing question that in a marketized economy, who is probation’s primary customer? Taking the logic of the market to its logical conclusion the author argues that it is the person serving the sentence who is the customer and that this should be taken into account by those commissioning and providing services. The author contends that there is an absence of hard evidence to demonstrate that marketization has improved services. Moreover, the tendency to perceive individuals as ‘objects’ of interventions has led to their needs been defined by intermediaries with their own agendas rather than the service users themselves. </p>
<p>Collectively, the articles in this special edition suggest that whilst there may be some potential benefits from introducing  a broader range of providers into offender services, the mechanisms currently being promoted to achieve this are still somewhat unformed and untested. The government’s decision to pause the payment by results pilots is an opportunity for reflection and for a more measured approach towards implementing such radical reforms. It is important that the gains in service delivery identified by some of the contributors to this special edition are not undermined by introducing ideological driven approaches to replace those that are tried and tested. For those Probation Trusts currently forging contractual alliances with the private sector, it might also provide an opportunity to reconsider their position. Competition by its very nature can be divisive if not properly regulated and coordinated and can have an adverse impact on accountability, particularly at the local level. All too often in the past, those representing probation interests have failed to speak with one voice but the current challenging and uncertain political atmosphere necessitates a unified and principled stance on an unprecedented level rather than  individualistic opportunism  driven by a desire to gain short-term competitive advantage. </p>
