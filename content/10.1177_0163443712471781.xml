<p>It is often claimed that in contemporary consumer society there is no fashion ‘<italic>only fashions</italic>.… No rules, only choices … [today] everyone can be anyone’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0163443712471781">Ewan and Ewan, 1992</xref>: 186–7, emphasis in original). For some, this assumption is celebrated as it holds the promise of an egalitarian society and suggests a move towards freedom and choice. However, this supposed shift has also generated anxieties that signifiers of cultural identity such as fashion will lose their symbolic value. Consequently, it has become increasingly important for the fashion industry to restore the symbolic meaning of fashion and secure its role as an important marker of cultural identity.</p>
<p>This perceived ‘new’ shift also coincides with developments in celebrity culture; in particular, the suggestion that there is a contemporary fascination with the private life (and lifestyle) of the celebrity (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0163443712471781">Gamson 1994</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0163443712471781">1</xref></sup> Of course, it has long since been argued that lifestyle is central to the construction of star personas, insofar as Richard Dyer defines the very concept of stardom as ‘an image of the way stars live’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0163443712471781">2004 [1979]</xref>: 35). Nevertheless, the increasing focus on lifestyle and fashion reminds us that the celebrity image has an important role in conveying the ‘meaning’ associated with material goods. Moreover, it is important to note that another central function of stardom is that it ‘reinforce[s] values under threat’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0163443712471781">Dyer, 2004 [1979]</xref>: 25). Indeed, recent claims regarding fashion and celebrity culture suggest that traditional understandings of class politics and social mobility are ‘under threat’.</p>
<p>Taking into account the increasingly symbiotic relationship between fashion and celebrity culture in the contemporary period (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0163443712471781">Church Gibson, 2011</xref>), this commentary suggests that celebrity images have a crucial role in mediating the symbolic value of fashion to audiences/consumers. In order to do so, this commentary uses Sarah Jessica Parker’s (hereafter SJP) star persona as a case study in which to examine this phenomena. SJP provides a useful focus precisely because she can be understood as symptomatic of this increasingly close relationship. For, as Deborah Jermyn argues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0163443712471781">2006</xref>: 68), SJP is ‘beyond an actress … she is a trend-setting icon and personal grooming guru, a prime aspirational figure for a contemporary “middle” youth (and arguably white, middle-class) women’. In other words, SJP’s celebrity image serves to educate audiences about fashion, taste and consumption practices and functions, to a certain extent, as a ‘cultural worker’ or ‘cultural intermediary’.</p>
<p>While the term cultural intermediary has been deployed in myriad ways (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0163443712471781">Featherstone 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0163443712471781">Hesmondhalgh, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0163443712471781">Negus, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0163443712471781">Nixon 1997</xref>), this commentary returns to, and expands upon, Pierre Bourdieu’s initial definition. That is, a cultural intermediary engages in ‘occupations involving presentation and representation (sales, marketing, advertising, public relations, fashion, decoration and so forth) … providing symbolic goods and services’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0163443712471781">Bourdieu, 1984</xref>: 9). Indeed, Bourdieu’s definition provides an appropriate framework for this case study insofar as it gestures towards the importance of those individuals who enjoy some form of visibility in the mass media (his examples include TV and radio presenters, and magazine journalists). With this in mind, this commentary seeks to advance the discussion of cultural intermediaries using SJP’s star persona as a useful lens through which to examine contemporary consumer, and celebrity culture.</p>
<p>In particular, this commentary concerns itself with the way in which discourses of class are foregrounded within extra-textual material surrounding her image. I suggest that while, in some ways, SJP’s star image seeks to promote the understanding that fashion can be ‘for everyone’, her construction and circulation within celebrity and fashion magazines operates within very distinct class boundaries and ultimately privileges middle-class notions of taste.</p>
<p>In order to produce this account, I consult a selection of celebrity and fashion magazines designed to address audiences with varying knowledge of fashion and cultural capital; these include, <italic>Harper’s Bazaar</italic> (which seeks to address the fashion cognoscenti) and <italic>People</italic> (designed for broader circulation).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0163443712471781">2</xref></sup> In so doing, I seek to draw out specific discourses of class that construct SJP’s star persona as an arbiter of middle-class taste.</p>
<sec id="section1-0163443712471781">
<title>Access to the canons of taste: SJP and <italic>People</italic></title>
<p>In an October 2000 issue of <italic>People</italic>, SJP’s image appears next to the headline: ‘Sarah Jessica Parker: Real Life Cinderella’. Below, the tagline reads: ‘[f]rom a hardscrabble Ohio childhood to fame, a great marriage and <italic>Sex and the City</italic>’. The emphasis on a difficult childhood and an initial lack of pedigree and economic capital is foregrounded within the main article. The opening paragraph details SJP’s experiences at the 2000 Emmy awards and reflects this:<disp-quote>
<p>Not one to let a little thing like not taking home her own Emmy ruffle her feathers, the diminutive actress is fixating instead on the pink plumage of her Oscar de la Renta gown. ‘Did you get a shot of this dress?’ She asks photographers, spinning round to make her skirt twirl. ‘This is my first experience with real couture! Each feather was sewn on one at a time!’ One should forgive Parker for sounding like a giddy Cinderella, but if the glass slipper – or the Jimmy Choo sandal – fits … (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0163443712471781">Anon., 2000</xref>: 118)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As the above passage makes clear, SJP’s success is articulated through dress – specifically through the ‘conspicuous consumption’ of ‘real couture’. In addition, SJP’s notable excitement evidences Dyer’s claim that ‘[t]he myth of success … suggests that success is worth having – in the form of conspicuous consumption’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0163443712471781">2004 [1979]</xref>: 42). In so doing, stars demonstrate their ‘access to the canons of taste’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0163443712471781">2004 [1979]</xref>: 42). Here, SJP displays her wealth and social mobility through fashion and endeavours to foreground the value of couture (she explicitly describes the labour involved in the garment’s production, thereby signalling its difference from mass-produced high street fashion). As such, SJP perpetuates the notion that, despite developments with regard to the ‘democratisation’ of fashion and taste, couture continues to occupy an important position within ‘legitimate’ culture.</p>
<p>Despite the pejorative connotations associated with conspicuous consumption (i.e. that it is ‘wasteful’, ‘vulgar’ and ‘unnecessary’; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0163443712471781">Veblen, 1990</xref>), SJP maintains a humility which allows her to traverse the boundaries between ‘acceptable’ and ‘excessive’ consumption, with no negative repercussions. Rather than presenting SJP as ‘spoiled’ or ‘undeserving’ the article is keen to remind readers of Parker’s deprived childhood. One paragraph in particular, is especially revealing and is thus worth quoting in full:<disp-quote>
<p>Yet even on Madison Avenue, memories of her ‘Dickensian’ childhood, as Parker once called it, are never distant. On a recent shopping trip, recalls the <italic>Sex and the City</italic> first assistant director Bettiann Fishman; ‘she saw something she liked and she stopped and said “Oh a little pricey”. I asked, “Why did that even come into your head?” And she said, “Well, you know what, let me take it and if it doesn’t work I can always return it.” She doesn’t forget.’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0163443712471781">Anon., 2000</xref>: 118)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>I wish to draw two interrelated points from this passage. First, the deliberate use of the term ‘Dickensian’ dispels any deprecatory associations with the working classes which, it has been argued, suggest a lack of cultural capital and ‘respectability’. For, as Beverley Skeggs notes in her book <italic>Formations of Class and Gender</italic>, the working-class woman has long since been associated with ‘immoral’ and ‘improper’ sexual behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0163443712471781">1997</xref>: 3). The term ‘Dickensian’, therefore, suggests a more wholesome image, since it is traditionally associated with Victorian Britain and connects Parker to a specific set of values which pivot on sexual propriety and hard work. Second, Fishman’s anecdote regarding her recent shopping trip with Parker characterises SJP as a ‘responsible consumer’. While it is clear that she can afford luxury goods, she carefully considers the value of the item. Both the reference to her ‘Dickensian’ upbringing, and the exchange between Parker and Fishman demonstrate SJP’s ability to exercise ‘restraint’. This ‘restraint’ is key to the construction of her ‘middle-class’ femininity.</p>
<p>The two passages cited above also demonstrate SJP’s knowledge and expertise in fashion. In the first, she demonstrates knowledge of the production practices and appreciation of the value of <italic>haute couture</italic>, in other words she possesses the ‘aesthetic gaze’. In the second, she demonstrates an ability to make judgements on ‘legitimate’ culture. In so doing, SJP justifies her status as a fashion icon; an aspect of her persona that is foregrounded in <italic>People</italic> magazine, in the weekly ‘Style Watch’ feature. Between 1998 and 2004, SJP appears regularly in the ‘Style Watch’ section. The feature is presented as an ‘insider’ look at not only celebrity fashion choices but also the ‘private’ and ‘real’ life of celebrities themselves. That said, the images used tend to foreground the ‘glamorous’ and ‘extraordinary’ lifestyles of the celebrities, as opposed to the ‘off-guard’ and ‘unkempt’ features often associated with tabloid/celebrity magazines. SJP, for example, is mostly photographed (albeit rarely in posed shots) at award ceremonies and benefits in and around New York City.</p>
<p>In addition, it is pertinent to note here that the images used within the feature and the accompanying articles present celebrities as the ‘dictators’ of fashion. In her article ‘Sharon Stone in a Gap turtleneck’, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0163443712471781">Rebecca Epstein (2007)</xref> traces the evolution of the Hollywood star (from classical Hollywood to the late 1990s) and suggests that recent shifts in celebrity culture have, in effect, repositioned ‘the popular actress from a <italic>dictator</italic> of fashion trends to a consumer of the public’s “wears”’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0163443712471781">2007</xref>: 207, emphasis added). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0163443712471781">Julie Wilson (2010)</xref> introduces the concept of ‘star testing’ in order to account for the ways in which celebrity magazines encourage readers to <italic>evaluate</italic>, as opposed to identify with celebrity images. Both Wilson and Epstein suggest that the increasing prevalence of features such as ‘best and worst dressed lists’ and ‘red carpet features’ in celebrity magazines invite readers to make judgements on the fashion choices of the celebrity. As Wilson points out, even regular features such as <italic>Us Weekly</italic>’s ‘Stars: They’re just like us’ sections are ‘structured in a way that promotes the quick evaluation of celebrity lifestyle and the day-to-day activity captured by the paparazzi’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0163443712471781">2010</xref>: 32). However, SJP complicates this notion of a shift, insofar as she is positioned primarily as fashion ‘icon’ and ultimately, <italic>People</italic> recognises and celebrates <italic>haute couture</italic> as ‘legitimate’ culture. This, of course, is not to suggest that evaluative judgements are not made by readers. However, rather than offering a critique, the ‘Style Watch’ section is for the most part celebratory, and can be seen to perform an ‘educative’ function; teaching readers about fashion practices and trends. The celebrity image is used in the ‘Style Watch’ feature to communicate the ‘symbolic value’ of fashion to ‘ordinary’ readers. In particular, SJP’s image is used to promote, and to some extent police, ‘appropriate’ models of femininity. In a June 1998 edition of <italic>People</italic>, SJP appears in ‘Style Watch’ promoting crinoline petticoats and ball gowns. Beside the main article, SJP is quoted as saying: ‘One of the best things about being a woman is that we get to look like women’ (in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0163443712471781">Anon., 1998</xref>: 114). In this respect, fashion is presented as accessible for <italic>every</italic> woman. Parker’s comments suggest that all women have the capacity to participate in fashion, however the accompanying image of her in couture reinforces economic boundaries which complicate this assumption.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0163443712471781">
<title>‘Fashion for everyone’: maintaining class boundaries</title>
<p>SJP’s understanding that fashion should be for ‘everyone’ became central to her star image in 2007 when she launched her first clothing line: ‘Bitten’. The low-price clothing line, designed by SJP was developed in order to allow women access to ‘quality’ affordable clothing (no item is over $100). In an interview in a June 2007 ‘Style Watch’ feature, SJP claimed ‘[t]his line is really about a philosophy – clothing for people in every economic bracket’. Similarly, the Bitten Clothing motto is that ‘it is every women’s absolute right to have a pulled-together fashionable, positive wardrobe with money left over to live’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0163443712471781">USFreeads, n.d.</xref>). In an interview which featured on the website,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0163443712471781">3</xref></sup> SJP specifically recalls her own childhood and lack of disposable income, explaining that watching her mother attempt to make eight children ‘presentable’ on a budget influenced the concept for ‘quality’, yet affordable clothing. She asserts:<disp-quote>
<p>I really loved the idea of making designer fashion accessible to every woman in this country despite the size of her bank account, despite her size, her shape and her ethnic background…The idea of liberating women with the democratization of fashion is extremely appealing to me. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0163443712471781">USFreeads, n.d.</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Moreover, this speaks to the postfeminist ideology of the female as an ‘empowered consumer’ and assumes that consumption plays an important role as a ‘strategy (and leisure as a site) for the production of self’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0163443712471781">Tasker and Negra, 2007</xref>: 2). Therefore, while SJP seeks to offer an ‘inclusive’ approach to fashion, this preoccupation has a distinct white middle-class address.</p>
<p>As the web interview makes clear, while it was her family’s financial struggles which inspired SJP, it was her acquired cultural capital and social mobility that afforded her the opportunity to create the line. Indeed, by the time of Bitten’s launch, SJP’s association with <italic>Sex and the City</italic> had confirmed her position as a fashion icon and thus contributed to her cultural capital. Therefore, she is now associated with the typically ‘masculine’ sphere of production as well as consumption. Indeed, this further legitimates her position as a ‘tastemaker’ insofar as she (as the designer) is responsible for producing the symbolic value of fashion (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0163443712471781">Kawamura, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The designs, described by Parker as ‘classic’ and ‘simple’, demonstrate the preoccupation with ‘respectability’ evident in the ‘Style Watch’ pages and therefore, continue to foreground class discourses which contribute to the construction of SJP’s cultural identity. Moreover, they demonstrate a ‘middle-class’ notion of ‘refined’ taste. Therefore, while SJP appears to outwardly celebrate the postmodern preoccupation with ‘fashion for everyone’ and individual choice, it is clear that these discourses remain closely connected to and couched within more traditional discourses of taste and class. Moreover, it is important to note that SJP’s association with couture remains central to the construction of her star persona, in order to maintain her position as a fashion icon.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0163443712471781">
<title>‘Why don’t you … [be respectable]?’ Lifestyle, class and cultural intermediaries</title>
<p>In 2009, SJP appeared on the cover of high-end fashion magazine <italic>Harper’s</italic>. The feature article and accompanying photo-shoot provide a useful lens through which to examine SJP’s star image post-<italic>Sex and the City</italic> and gives a sense of the competing discourses which surround her public persona. The article, which is positioned as a promotional piece for the launch of her fragrances, continues to foreground SJP as an advocate for the ‘democratisation’ of fashion and in a very revealing anecdote, SJP promotes the myth that ‘everyone can be anyone’. It reads:<disp-quote>
<p>It is fascinating, the fantasy that swirls around Sarah Jessica Parker. Few can resist its pull. Exhibit A: the scene in the MTV documentary on Britney Spears in which Britney is trying on a mini sweaterdress. She and her assistant agree that said outfit is very SJP. ‘[But] you’re Britney Spears,’ the assistant says. ‘You’re not Sarah Jessica Parker.’ ‘I can be her for a day,’ Britney replies. ‘I heard about that,’ Sarah Jessica says, clearly still computing. ‘God bless her. She can be whoever she wants to be for a day. We <italic>all</italic> can!’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0163443712471781">Brown, 2009</xref>: 374, emphasis added).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Indeed, these comments are inescapably bound up with class politics. Britney Spears, characterised within contemporary media culture as ‘white trash’, <italic>aspires</italic> to ‘be’ SJP. Here, SJP symbolises a notion of respectable middle-classness, despite the fact that her impoverished roots are well-documented in other celebrity intertexts. Thus a distinction is created between the kind of working-class femininity Spears continues to embody (despite her wealth) and the kind of respectable, humble working-class identity characterised by Parker. This distinction is crucial to Parker’s role as a style icon and cultural intermediary for middle-class women, insofar as her cultural capital, and her suitability for the role, could otherwise be called into question. Moreover, it is important to note that Parker demonstrates a loyalty to her working-class roots, which is parlayed into a sense of social responsibility. For example, directly following the above passage, SJP comments on her relationship with ‘ordinary women; she claims “I’m flattered by the connection with women … almost everything I do outside of work, I want to do it for them”’ (SJP in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0163443712471781">Brown, 2009</xref>: 374). While the invocation of an ‘impoverished’ background is common to many star/celebrity constructions, what I am suggesting here is that SJP’s image also balances this with a distinctly middle-class address. This is perhaps most apparent in second half of the <italic>Harper’s</italic> article, which consists of a photo-shoot in which SJP ‘paid homage’ to Diana Vreeland.</p>
<p>Vreeland, who was also famously referred to by her initials DV, was a ‘fashion icon’ and editor of <italic>Harper’s</italic> (1936–62). Her famous column, ‘Why don’t you …?’ offered fashion and lifestyle advice to readers. Vreeland fulfilled a function as a cultural intermediary in the most traditional sense – she allowed access to ‘legitimate’ culture (primarily <italic>haute couture</italic>) and sought to teach readers skills in fashion and consumption practices. The similarities between SJP and Vreeland are, for the most part, connected to fashion, taste and class. For example, the article reveals that both Vreeland and SJP are ‘fond of the word, <italic>vulgar</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0163443712471781">Brown, 2009</xref>: 374, emphasis in original). There are of course clear class connotations evident in this observation. Moreover, SJP’s response is equally situated within discourses of class. She claims: ‘We might connect over that, over people’s vulgarity, and how much we see it. It’s a very good word vulgar’ (Parker in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0163443712471781">Brown, 2009</xref>: 374).</p>
<p>Not only is the exchange demonstrating SJP’s ‘educational’ capital – displayed via her vocabulary but also the term itself carries strong class connotations insofar as the term describes a lack of sophistication or ‘good taste’. Therefore, SJP aligns herself with Vreeland as an arbiter of taste, and demonstrates her ability to decide what is and what is not ‘vulgar’. In other words, SJP and Vreeland have access to the ‘canons of good taste’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0163443712471781">Dyer, 2004 [1979]</xref>: 38). In addition, the term ‘vulgar’ is also primarily associated with/ thought to be a characteristic of the ‘lower’ classes. This reinforces the notion of <italic>difference</italic> which is vital not only in terms star/fan relationships, but also again signifies a difference in ‘class’ and ‘capital’.</p>
<p>Moreover, the following paragraph implies that the pair both possess the ‘aesthetic disposition’:<disp-quote>
<p>she [DV] really created a completely different way of thinking about aesthetics, living, and indulgence,’ she [SJP] says earnestly, ‘and the feeling of fashion.’ … The feeling of fashion is something Sarah Jessica understands implicitly.… She’ll readily acknowledge the transcendent power of a dress. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0163443712471781">Brown, 2009</xref>: 378)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Here, SJP affirms Vreeland’s position as a mediator of taste demonstrating that she possessed the competences necessary for appreciating, to use Bourdieu’s terms, ‘form over function’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0163443712471781">1984</xref>: 30). The comments of the <italic>Harper’s</italic> journalist then, seek to remind readers of the similarities between the pair – implying that SJP also understands the ‘symbolic’ value of fashion ‘implicitly’. In addition, the final sentence of the above passage also makes a connection between dress and social mobility insofar as it is claimed that fashion has a ‘transcendent power’. This, of course, speaks to the core of the ‘Cinderella’ motif, which features strongly in the construction of SJP’s star image in <italic>People</italic> magazine.</p>
<p>The parallels drawn between SJP and Vreeland are most explicit in the accompanying photo-shoot, in which SJP recreates famous images of Vreeland – which of course, speaks to her assertion that ‘anyone can be anyone for a day’. The artistic images not only seek to demonstrate the ‘quality’ of the magazine, but associate fashion, and SJP, with legitimate culture. That said, the images also function as advertising, insofar as details of the clothing worn are printed below.</p>
<p>The first image in the series recreates DV’s famous ‘garden room’. It depicts SJP in a red Salvatore Ferragamo gown lying on a chaise longue next to the tagline ‘The Red Queen’. The garden room is covered in red and gold patterned fabric, which also covers the chaise longue. Large oil paintings and decorative lighting features adorn the walls. The image therefore connotes luxury and ‘conspicuous consumption’. In the adjacent image SJP is dressing/styling a mannequin in couture in a museum (which is a direct reference to Vreeland’s later career, when she became a consultant to the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York in 1971). Parker is dressed in a 1970s-inspired outfit consisting of a rust-coloured Missoni tunic and trouser set ($5880) and appears next to a rack of couture clothing. The mannequins which feature in the background are also dressed in vintage couture. The overall colour palette is starkly contrasted to the earlier image – the background is much more sparse – the walls are a plain, dull sage colour against the monochromatic garments on the mannequins. However, the image still clearly seeks to signal luxury; the garments for example, although muted shades, are very detailed (with hand-sewn ruffles, feathers and sequins) and use expensive fabrics (silk and fur).</p>
<p>This image in particular seeks to affirm SJP’s status as a fashion icon and cultural intermediary; she appears ‘at work’, insofar as she is involved in the ‘creative’ labour of selecting and constructing outfits. She is, therefore, crucial in the ‘presentation’ of ‘legitimate’ culture and ‘tastemaking’. Though this labour is distinctly coded as ‘feminine’, she nonetheless demonstrates her access to ‘legitimate’ culture and cultural competences in fashion practices. Moreover, the location of the museum is not only crucial in signalling ‘legitimate’ culture, it also foregrounds the aesthetic function of the garments, implying that fashion can be considered as ‘art’. Indeed, the fact that SJP is dressing mannequins as opposed to individuals suggests that fashion carries symbolic meaning when it is not functioning as dress. Similarly, the final photograph featured in the series depicts SJP undertaking ‘intellectual’ labour. The image recreates Diana Vreeland’s office at <italic>Harper’s</italic>, with SJP seated on the desk surrounded by photographs of models – presumably to be used in a fashion spread within the magazine. Here, SJP adopts the role of fashion editor, which again requires a specific set of cultural competences in fashion practices and the ability to decide what is, and what is not, ‘good taste’. In terms of aesthetics and composition the image also contrasts with the first in the series insofar as no colour is used. The image is black and white and invokes an aesthetic of vintage, high-quality photography. As such, SJP is associated with more traditional notions of timeless elegance. It is also important to note that this final image of SJP is placed next to a ‘Why don’t you …?’ column penned by SJP. Therefore, it is not simply the image which confirms SJP’s position as a cultural intermediary, but also the accompanying written article which serves as ‘evidence’ of her cultural competences and tastemaking abilities.</p>
<p>The ‘Why don’t you …?’ column is not specifically related to fashion practices but general ‘lifestyle’ tips – the tagline reads: ‘Sarah Jessica Parker shares her tips for a chic and gracious life’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0163443712471781">Brown, 2009</xref>: 380). For the most part, SJP’s advice relates to feminine practices and, in some cases, seeks to police femininity/femininities. Several of the tips refer to diet, exercise and activities which position the ‘self as project’ (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0163443712471781">Tasker and Negra, 2007</xref>). For example, she suggests that one should ‘walk more’, keep a bucket filled with low calorie candy to ‘scratch the itch’ (i.e. stave off hunger) and ‘get eight hours sleep’ (Parker in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0163443712471781">Brown, 2009</xref>: 380). Similarly, she encourages readers to cook and bake from scratch, in order to boost self-confidence. The remaining tips seek to teach readers how to gain educational and cultural capital. She suggests that individual should use the library – thereby implying the value of knowledge. Similarly, she suggests that one should ‘read the editorial page of your local paper’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0163443712471781">2009</xref>: 380). She claims: ‘[i]t introduces you to opinion and can be terrifically provocative and perhaps a great motivational force for you to get involved in your community, regardless of your political ideology’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0163443712471781">2009</xref>: 380). This passage speaks to SJP’s loyalty to her working-class background insofar as the ‘tips’ above apply to <italic>all</italic> individuals regardless of economic status; rather, the ‘tips’ are designed to encourage self improvement within both the lower and middle classes through the acquisition of cultural and educational capital. Not only then, does the article seek to demonstrate SJP’s capital and affirm her status as the bearer of legitimate taste, it also makes an assumption about the readership/fan base of SJP. That is, the reader is characterised as female and, either middle class, or as <italic>aspiring</italic> to achieve social mobility. The final tip, in particular, communicates notions of appropriate, ‘respectable’ middle-class behaviour insofar as it invites readers to perform citizenly duties (i.e. give spare change to charities). Moreover, this preoccupation with the ‘self as project’ is equally bound up with notions of middle-class respectability and speaks to a decidedly feminine audience. Thus, within the material surveyed here, it is clear that class discourses continue to pervade contemporary consumer culture and the concept of a ‘postmodern self’ which resists traditional power structures is flawed.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>SJP’s representation within the material surveyed here proves a useful lens through which to examine the social significance of her star image. If read in the context of the postmodern assumption that society is moving toward a classless society, it is possible to trace the precise ways in which SJP’s star persona is constructed in relation to, and offers a ‘solution’ for, the problems this apparent shift may pose. As such, SJP is able to reinforce boundaries of ‘taste’, promoting a decidedly middle-class notion of appropriate feminine identity. While, as previously discussed, the move toward a classless society promises ‘individual choice’, the consequential emergence of ‘lifestyle’ media (such as fashion magazines and lifestyle television) has resulted in what David Bell and Joanne Hollows have termed an ‘over-democratization of taste’ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0163443712471781">2005</xref>: 12). For Bell and Hollows, ‘the over-democratization of taste … [has resulted] in a lifestyled sameness, radically devaluing the cultural capital that has been so carefully cultivated’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0163443712471781">2005</xref>: 12). SJP’s function as a cultural intermediary can thus be viewed as a response/corrective to this development.</p>
<p>While she promotes the assumption that fashion can be for everyone, her construction within <italic>Harper’s</italic> addresses a decidedly middle-class audience. It is this particular subsection of society which is in the privileged position to be educated in processes of discrimination. Both of these discourses must remain in play in order for fashion to have social and cultural meaning. As such, her star persona and the celebrity intertext within which it is constructed are informed by complex and contradictory discourses regarding fashion and social class. As a result, consumers of celebrity culture are encouraged to develop increasingly sophisticated consumer competences which allow them to <italic>read</italic> fashion as showcased within the wider contextual apparatus of fashion and celebrity magazines.</p>
<p>It is precisely this function, as this commentary seeks to argue, that allows celebrity to function as cultural intermediary in the Bourdieusian sense of term. Indeed, as previously suggested, Bourdieu’s initial discussion provides a useful framework for this study, and celebrity culture in general, because it allows for greater understanding of the role of those individuals with a strong media presence in contemporary consumer culture.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0163443712471781">4</xref></sup> In publicly mediating/restoring the symbolic value of fashion and material culture, celebrities contribute to the consumer experience. Given the supposed shifts in celebrity and consumer culture, the celebrity as cultural intermediary is likely to become increasingly pervasive.</p>
