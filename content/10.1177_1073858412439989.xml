<p>Over the past few years, an increasing number of studies have pointed toward the possibility that it may be feasible to repair the injured brain and spinal cord, via transplantation of neurons or their progenitors. However, whether transplanted neurons and progenitors can integrate into CNS circuitry as functional neurons with subtype diversity characteristic of normal neurons, so as to reconstitute functionally significant synaptic systems, has not been clear. Now Czupryn and others (2011) provide promising data from a study of transplanted hypothalamic neurons in db/db mice that are leptin receptor-deficient. To carry out this interesting study, the investigators generated physically chimeric hypothalami via the transplantation of small numbers of embryonic enhanced GFP-expressing, leptin-responsive, hypothalamic neurons into the hypothalamus of db/db mice which, as a result of deficient leptin activity, are morbidly obese. The investigators report that donor neurons differentiate into four distinct types of hypothalamic neurons, develop relatively normal electrogenic properties, and integrate into synaptic circuits where they form functional excitatory and inhibitory junctions. Notably, the transplanted neurons restored leptin signaling and ameliorated hyperglycemia and obesity in the db/db mice. These novel results provide proof-of-concept that transplanted neurons can support the functional reconstitution of complex neuronal circuitry within the mammalian CNS, in this case in a manner that underlies restoration of control of a complex phenotype.</p>

<p>Reorganization of the somatosensory cortex in animal models has now been demonstrated following limb or digit amputation, denervation, or central lesions. The effects of sensory and motor deprivation in the human brain, however, have been less well studied. Now Langer and others (2012) present a longitudinal study that has examined the effects of limb immobilization on the organization of the human cortex. In this study, they tested the hypothesis that immobilization leads to a reduction in cortical thickness in the contralateral primary and somatosensory motor cortex and in the integrity of the corticospinal tract, which are responsible for fine motor movements. They studied 10 right-handed human patients with injuries to the right upper extremity that required at least 14 days of immobilization. Patients underwent two magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations, initially within 48 hours postinjury, and then after 16 days of immobilization. They also carried out behavioral analysis. Most of the patients demonstrated significant enhancements of performance using the left (nonimmobilized) hand. MRI revealed a decrease in cortical thickness in the left primary motor and somatosensory areas, together with decreased fractional anisotropy of the left corticospinal tract. Notably, motor skill of the uninjured left hand tended to improve, and this improvement was correlated with increased cortical thickness and fractional anisotropy in the right motor cortex. This interesting study provides evidence, in human subjects, that thickness of the somatosenory cortex and integrity of the corticospinal tract change rapidly during immobilization of one arm, suggesting that these changes may be associated with transfer of skills from the immobilized to the nonimmobilized hand. The authors suggest that immobilization induces rapid reorganization of the somatosensory system and that the results may have implications for neuropsychological therapies such as constraint-induced rehabilitation therapy. Whether the changes demonstrated in this study are long-lasting is not yet known. It is hoped that future studies will address this and related questions.</p>

<p>It has generally been assumed that the intelligence quotient (IQ), which is widely used in numerous contexts, is stable throughout the human life span. Indeed, it has been assumed that childhood IQs can serve as predictors of adult educational and occupational achievement. The accuracy of these assumptions, however, has not been established. Now a group of investigators in London report that there can be changes in the verbal and nonverbal IQ in humans during teenage years (Ramsden and others 2011). Using a combination of structural and functional imaging, these investigators showed that verbal IQ can change, together with gray matter in a region known to be activated by speech. Similarly, nonverbal IQ can change, together with gray matter in a region activated by finger movements. On the basis of longitudinal assessments of the same individuals, the investigators obtained data that suggest that general verbal and nonverbal abilities are closely linked to sensory motor skills involved in learning. These results suggest the possibility that a given individual’s intellectual capacity can decrease or increase during teenage years. The authors note that further studies will be needed to determine whether this type of plasticity may be present throughout life and to correlate these findings with educational and occupational achievement. At a minimum, these results imply that intellectual potential may change during teenage years, a conclusion that could have substantial implications for education.</p>
