<abstract>
<p>Controlling for insecurities depends on a capacity to make inferences on the basis of experiences about the past, yet the use of knowledge about the past for anticipating and predicting future threats is highly problematic. This article examines the problem of governing individuals on the basis of what is available about their past deeds and social networks in governmental and commercial archives. It highlights the tension between administrative and private narratives about individuals, the former being constructed on the basis of minute details collected and stored about individuals since birth, and the latter referring to the accounts individuals offer of themselves. By applying the notions of <italic>ipse</italic> and <italic>idem</italic> identity developed by Paul Ricoeur, the article examines the two-way flow between memory and identity and the consequent concern that administrative narratives are blind to the ethical renewal of individuals, to the capacity of Man to extricate himself from the shackles of his past. To prepare the ground, the article considers some inherent limitations of biopolitics, pointing out that although biopolitics was classically concerned to govern both individual bodies and the body politic, administrative and governmental limitations have led states to govern the “average citizen” rather than individuals in their “individuality.”</p>

<p>Drew! I haven’t seen you since college, twenty years ago! My God, Drew—what are you doing with that gun?</p>

<p>We all feel the absurdity of making someone responsible for what he said twenty years ago. The person of twenty years ago is but a memory of the person today, the two are the same, yet they are not identical. There is a schism between permanence and change, because, while we assume the consistence of the unitary subject through time, at the same time, we also insist on man’s freedom to alter his identity. We believe it is legitimate and the most normal of things for someone to alter his opinion and his personality with the passing of time. Also, it is but at the most extreme violation of norms of human conduct where the flow of time—under the influence of amnesty or amnesia—would not alter the rigor of our judgment. In order to resolve the dilemma between permanence and change, Paul Ricoeur suggests turning out attention to narratives. By focusing on narratives, we may avoid the antimony of either asserting a too rigid conception of identity or regarding identity as anything but an illusion.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0304375412444817">2</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The problem this article seeks to elucidate is the incommensurable nature of two types of narrative accounts of the individual. The first is what we will call personal narrative, which is the account the individual offers of itself, while the second is what we will call administrative narrative created by governmental apparatuses on the information it gathers in administrative archives.</p>
<p>The documentation of the life of individuals is an essential component of governing modern societies. Social control has always relied on surveillance and the creation of governmental archives. As David Lyon suggested modern societies had a tendency from the start to become surveillance societies.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0304375412444817">3</xref>
</sup> The efficient use of administrative archives was greatly constrained, however, by the limited capacities of bureaucracies to process the information available for them.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0304375412444817">4</xref>
</sup> In recent decades, however, computerization revolutionized both surveillance and data processing technologies. We are entering the era of the surveillance society,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0304375412444817">5</xref>
</sup> which means not merely eyes watching every move we make but also an upheaval of archival technologies,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0304375412444817">6</xref>
</sup> with the pooling and analyzing of records using preprogrammed algorithms.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0304375412444817">7</xref>
</sup> Enhanced surveillance technologies with the connection of various databases make it possible to govern individuals by deriving inferences from administrative archives containing minute details of individuals’ pasts. As Eric Stoddart underlines in the 2006 Report of the Information Commissioner’s office:<disp-quote>
<p>It is not the ubiquity or technical sophistication of surveillance that has launched us into a new world. It is the mining of data, the connecting of diverse databases and the function of data-collection diversified across not only the state but commercial interests that has brought us to a surveillance society.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0304375412444817">8</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>A plethora of metaphors now suggest that attempts to build upon these data create “data doubles,”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0304375412444817">9</xref>
</sup> the digitized “doppelganger,”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0304375412444817">10</xref>
</sup> the “data self,”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0304375412444817">11</xref>
</sup> or the “virtual self.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0304375412444817">12</xref>
</sup> This digital potpourri is assembled via inferences built upon the traces of our lives stored in administrative archives.</p>
<p>The standard concern raised against such a mode of governing men is made in reference to privacy. This eventually ends up debating under which conditions agencies are entitled to linkup various databases for in-depth holistic analysis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0304375412444817">13</xref>
</sup> While we acknowledge these concern, in this article we point to a problem more of ontological and epistemological in nature. Namely, these modes of governing individuals rely on questionable assumptions concerning how individuals are constituted.</p>
<p>It is central to our understanding of Man that he is capable for self-emancipation—namely that he is capable of decoupling himself from his past and undergo ethical renewal. This ethical renewal, however, often requires individuals to recast their personal life narrative by rewriting it from the present toward the past, in order to make their present self consistent with their past self. The concern is that administrative narratives are blind to such renewals and create a totality of the past by relying in the governing of men on inferences made on the basis of information accumulated about their past. However, such administrative narratives based on men’s past may overshadow their present and hinder individuals from extricating themselves from the weight of the past they have long left behind. Putting it differently, governmental narratives tend to overlook the two-way flow between memory and identity. On one hand, our memories serve us well by keeping track of where we come from. As Luis Buňuel noted, “You have to begin to lose your memory, if only in bits and pieces, to realize that memory is what makes our lives. Life without memory is no life at all [. . . ] Our memory is our coherence, our reason, our feeling, even our action. Without it, we are nothing.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0304375412444817">14</xref>
</sup> On the other hand, however, our memory also serves us well by selectively adapting to our evolving self, with the memory of the past frequently being tailored to match our present: “As historians of our own lives we seem to be, on the one hand very inattentive and, on the other, revisionists who will justify the present by changing the past.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0304375412444817">15</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>This article elucidates this problematic in four parts. The first part sets the stage by explaining the link between governing individuals and populations through statistical information and probabilities. The second part points out that the enormous amounts of information that modern states collected to control societies far exceeded the capacity of bureaucratic apparatuses, as the result of which governance was not truly geared at “individuals in their individuality” but was geared at the “average citizen.” This processing bottleneck was overcome, however, by recent developments in computerization and connectivity, which radically altered the way administrative apparatuses operate, bringing to the fore contradictions calling for discussing the link between identity and memory. The third section builds on Paul Ricoeur’s notion of ipse and idem aspects of the self and their interaction in order to capture how individuals make ruptures in their life narrative and decouple themselves from the determinacy of their past.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0304375412444817">16</xref>
</sup> Finally, the fourth section turns to administrative narratives and points out that they (1) fail to take into account the disposition of man for ethical maturation and (2) implicitly assume that the past has a determining influence on the present and the future.</p>

<title>Life as Probability: The Odds of Security/Insecurity</title>
<p>In his investigations of the genealogy of the modern state, Michel Foucault calls governmental technologies that gradually evolved since the eighteenth-century biopolitics. Foucault argues that a study of government should encompass all aspects of the rationality underpinning particular technologies of power. Along these lines, in order to understand the context in which biopolitics came to the fore, we should identify the epistemological turn that prepared the ground for its appearance. At the center of this epistemological turn was the modern world becoming obsessed with statistics, which provided the backdrop for the governmental practices of biopolitics, which were geared at, on one hand, individual “bodies” and, on the other hand, at the “body politic” as an aggregate entity.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0304375412444817">17</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>By the nineteenth century, the modern world was fully obsessed with counting and classifying things, translating everything into numbers, from the slope of hills, resources of the land, the number of men and women, or the number of mothers who argued with their mothers-in-law.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0304375412444817">18</xref>
</sup> Already Goethe was conscious of living in “statistically minded times”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0304375412444817">19</xref>
</sup> in which the statistical approach dominated evolving methods of governing states and their populations. As the Italian statistician Giuseppe Sacchi noted in the early nineteenth century, authorities needed detailed information in order to administer the state, “To municipal authorities and public functionaries who have to provide for local needs, statistical tables must offer all those minute details that concern that part of the country which is in their care . . . [so that] . . . nothing may escape their gaze. . ..”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0304375412444817">20</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>With the development of administrative surveillance, enormous amounts of data were created that needed to be categorized and given meaning. Making inferences from the data required statistical methods; such methods, however, presupposed a completely new mode of perceiving the phenomena of the world. The statistical perspective assumes that the study of aggregated phenomena can reveal information about the world that individual cases cannot. Statistical methods offer to uncover the properties of aggregates by revealing averages, trends, rates, properties that are possessed not by individual cases but by populations.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0304375412444817">21</xref>
</sup> With Poisson’s 1835 discovery of the Law of Large Numbers,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0304375412444817">22</xref>
</sup> the idea of probability came to the forefront, along with the notions of normality, regularity just as much the notion of the outlier, the abnormal, the exceptional, or the delinquent and its species.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0304375412444817">23</xref>
</sup> It was through the study of the abnormal and deviant (suicide, crime, vagrancy, madness, and prostitution) that law-like regularities were sought for.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0304375412444817">24</xref>
</sup> This statistical approach worked in two ways: it reinforced the identity of the outlier, the abnormal and the pathological and also contributed to homogenizing societies by defining standards and points of reference.</p>
<p>This shift led to a mode of governance that Foucault identified as <italic>biopolitics</italic>, suggesting that governance was geared both at the individual but also at the body politic as an aggregate entity, meticulously ordering/administering the social body and individuals within.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0304375412444817">25</xref>
</sup> Through the collection of data, the histories of societies were recorded, which led to the creation of administrative archives that provided the input for the bureaucratic machinery to administer the population. Although Foucault emphasized the modern state’s disciplinary aspects and its role in “moral accounting,”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0304375412444817">26</xref>
</sup> the modern state also needed detailed information on its citizens to enhance their freedom. Economic rights and welfare provisions required detailed monitoring of the lives of citizens.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0304375412444817">27</xref>
</sup> Information gathering practices of the modern state are, therefore, Janus-faced, operating both as a source of liberation and as a source of enslavement,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0304375412444817">28</xref>
</sup> where it is a constant struggle to make the former to outweigh the latter.</p>
<p>Although biopolitics addressed as its object of governance both the “population” and the individual “bodies,” it captured the latter not in its individuality but in its general qualities and in its relation to the average citizen. The population was a statistical artifact that could be addressed in its generality—public health, birth rates, crime rates, and so on, where the individual was looked upon just as one constitutive element of a category.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0304375412444817">29</xref>
</sup> In cases of medical practice, for example, the individual was foremost the constitutive member of a cohort of patients with similar symptoms, and not an individual in its uniqueness. The invention of the disease itself required an aggregation and categorization of man and symptoms with the object of inquire to be focused not on characteristics of the patient but on characteristics of the illness.</p>
<p>In order to capture the essence of this logic of governing the world, it is worthwhile to compare it with that of earlier times, which were significantly different in thought and practice. The vitalist tradition of medicine—D’Amador, for example—criticized the new approach to medicine in the eighteenth century. He asserted that each patient was a unique case, not comparable to others.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0304375412444817">30</xref>
</sup> Hence, it is in vain to “treat” the symptoms of a disease, because the doctor should treat the ill person holistically in its “individuality.” Medical practice is absurd to rely on experts specializing in certain parts of the body, treating patients’ ears, legs, hearts. Similarly, the Ancient Greeks were not looking at the world with a statistically oriented mind-set. No wonder that, despite their erudition in geometry, the Ancient Greeks made no advances in probability. This was inimical to their worldview. For the Greeks, Man was subject to his or her fate and was not subject to the rules of probability. One was either favored or not by the Gods, being subject to their grace or the subject to the caprice of their anger. The idea that the odds of making Zeus angry were seven to one would have been absurd for an ancient Grecian.</p>
<p>The seemingly paradoxical implication of thinking along the lines of probabilities was, for the world to become less deterministic, turning the realm of fortuna into the realm of probabilities, contingency, and risk assessment. With probability coming to the forefront, Man became the master of his fate as he could work on improving the odds of his success and change them from, say 4:1 to 2:1. Nevertheless, we must recognize that the odds are the attributes of the population and not the individual man. Thus, if one does not smoke, he may decrease the chances of getting lung cancer, nevertheless the idea of “chance” and “odds” refers to the population of man: of the 1,000 individuals, if they smoke 56 would have lung cancer; if they do not smoke only 21 would have it. It is by regarding himself as part of the species and projecting these odds to himself, that man is just as much governed as he controls his future.</p>

<title>Limits of Biopolitics— Governing Man in Its Individuality</title>
<p>The modern state relied on an extensive collection of information on its citizens and the buildup of administrative archives of knowledge about the governed. This aspiration to learn about the doings of citizens confirms to the dream of all those who govern, “Panopticon is the oldest dream of the oldest sovereign: None of my subjects can escape and none of their actions are unknown to me.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0304375412444817">31</xref>
</sup> A scenario, which was difficult to realize both during classical times and in the modern state, as states were soon overloaded with information. Data were gathered, archived but there was no capacity to process it meaningfully. Pierre Nora pointed out that the files of the French social security system reached over 300 km, reflecting modernity’s obsession to record and archive an amount of detailed information that overburdened state capacity.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0304375412444817">32</xref>
</sup> Hence, despite of the enormous amounts of information stored about individuals in administrative archives, there was no way for governmental apparatuses to use this information in an individualized level (with the exception of extreme emergencies).</p>
<p>One way to deal with this bottleneck of governing capacity and the overload of information was through the compartmentalization of administration. Through compartmentalization, information was divided between various branches of the state, creating a range of field-specific histories of men. As Sheldon Wolin notes sarcastically “Diversity is the nightmare of bureaucracy. The bureaucrat’s response to it is either to invent another classification or, in the corporate world to manufacture fifty-seven varieties.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0304375412444817">33</xref>
</sup> The bureaucratic solution was to devise distinct compartments of administration, which focused solely upon specific aspects of the citizen. He was regarded as a medical case, a criminal case, a case for the educational apparatus, a case for the tax office, a professional with a relevant résumé; a man in the network of old classmates or a credit history. In each field, the citizen’s field-specific profile could be created and compared to the relevant normal profile of the field.</p>
<p>On exceptional occasions, additional means of surveillance were introduced (like tapping phones and opening mail) and various field-specific profiles of the individual were pooled. “Police may keep constant watch over a small group of conspirators, or the staff of the hospital may exercise something like total surveillance over those in the intensive ward.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0304375412444817">34</xref>
</sup> However, such a mode of keeping an eye constantly on the citizen was prohibitively costly, where costs concerned not only the collection but also the efficient processing of data.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0304375412444817">35</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The introduction of punch cards in the 1950s was the first step toward the automatization of data processing and the enhancement of the state’s administrative capacity.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0304375412444817">36</xref>
</sup> While attempts for centralized databases date back to the 1960s,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0304375412444817">37</xref>
</sup> it was only with advances in the field of computer technology that the means were created for the administration to address its subjects in their individuality. Complex algorithms of data mining and analysis allow today to inspect all data available on the individual’s past in an integrated manner.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0304375412444817">38</xref>
</sup> This technological breakthrough means that governance can finally look at the individual in a holistic manner, enabling an “individualization” of administration that was inconceivable earlier, creating what Perri 6 calls the personal information society.<disp-quote>
<p>We live today in a personal information society, in which one of the principal uses of the global networks is to exchange detailed profiles of individuals’ characteristics. Personal information is the fuel on which much of modern economy runs; millions of basic decisions—about employment, insurance, lending, risk assessment, benefit entitlement, arrest, taking children into care—are made on the basis of the vast quantities of personal information which are now produced and manipulated on an industrial scale.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0304375412444817">39</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The outcome is a radical recasting of governmental operations. Although the general epistemological stance which characterized modernity since the Enlightenment has not been altered, and we are still living in the statistically minded times recognized by Goethe,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0304375412444817">40</xref>
</sup> the way information can be processed is radically different. Concomitantly, governance of citizens does not need to rely on governing the “average citizen” but can dig deep into how the particular individual differs from others. Hence, whereas before governing of individuals relied on focusing on similarities, today’s technology permits focusing on differences: on the characteristics specific to the given individual. An example may help flesh out the difference. Before, a man stepping into a bookstore was assumed to be interested in cars, sports, historical novels according to prevailing stereotypes (where stereotype pertains to what is known or assumed about the average man). Today, however, it is on the basis of the information about all the books he checked and bought at Amazon in the past that Amazon websites offer its customer tailor-made suggestions on yoga or postcolonial feminist theory. An element of comparison is there in both cases, but in the latter case, the group of customers with which the given customer is compared is so narrowly defined that it is no longer stereotypes but an individual’s specific characteristics that count.</p>
<p>The way Amazon focuses in on the specific characteristics of the given customer is prevalent in all fields of administering man, from target therapy in medicine (i.e., a molecular-level analysis in order to decide which medication would be efficient in case of the particular patient) to putting together the picture of the unknown terrorist in the security field.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0304375412444817">41</xref>
</sup> In all these cases, governance is geared not at the average citizen but the individual in its individuality.</p>
<p>There are concerns that because the burdens of this zooming-in-of-suspicion fall upon only a disproportionately small part of the population, it does not resonate widely and thus does not provoke widespread resistance.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0304375412444817">42</xref>
</sup> While we recognize the validity and severity of these concerns, here we focus on a different problem. Namely, the problem that such novel technologies of governing individuals rely on a questionable implicit assumption that, with the more detailed information gathered and processed, governance becomes increasingly capable of securing the future by anticipating and even predicting future threats.<sup>

<title>Identity and Memory— A Two-Way Flow</title>
<p>I remember that at the time when I was a kid, we planted an acorn in front of the window of our home. Is the oak tree in front of our window today identical with that acorn? What makes it identical with it?<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0304375412444817">44</xref>
</sup> With the passing of time, we are never exactly the same; nevertheless, we believe ourselves to be identical with the person we used to be. We remember earlier moments, which we believe to have transformed into the always present.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0304375412444817">45</xref>
</sup> Remembering creates the tie between past and present, and as Erikson points out, our identities rely on “a subjective sense of continuous existence and a coherent memory.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0304375412444817">46</xref>
</sup> But, who is the one doing the remembering? In the case of the oak tree, we stand there as the external observer, yet what happens when we look back upon ourselves? Is the observer then the same as the observed? Or identity duplicates when it observes both past and present manifestations of itself?</p>
<p>Faced with this conundrum of identity and memory, Paul Ricoeur introduced the notions of ipse and idem, distinguishing two aspects of the self. Where and how these two relate to one another offers the means to clarify the relationship between permanence and change.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0304375412444817">47</xref>
</sup> The former, idem, refers to identity as sameness, where sameness allows the self to provide a coherent answer to the question: What am I and what are the characteristics that define me? Ipse, on the other hand, refers to selfhood identity, which is the self-reflexive unique core that looks upon itself and which can be captured by answering the question “Who am I?” The distinguishing between these two aspects of the self offers the means of capturing the dialectic of continuity and change of identity.</p>
<p>The answer to the question of “What am I?” defines the character of the individual, with the sum of all its qualities making it distinct from any other entity. Although the individual shares many of its characteristics with others, it has a unique composition of qualities, which defines its identity. As time passes, the individual enters into various situation and social contexts, which leave their imprints on the individual, piled up in the individual’s mental storehouse of memories. On this basis, idem composes a continuous, coherent narrative through which the history of self is arranged in order to assure its permanence in time.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0304375412444817">48</xref>
</sup> This self-sameness catered for by idem is, however, only one aspect of self taking care of its permanence in time.</p>
<p>Idem identity is supplemented and frequently overwritten by ipse. Ipse provides a constant reflection of self from an ethical perspective. It offers a dimension of critical judgment on the coherence of self on ethical grounds where the criteria for judgment (in the words of Ricoeur) is whether self has been faithful and trustworthy. Here, being trustworthy means for the individual both to be trustworthy in the judgment of others and at the same time to be able to regard himself as an ethical person. This latter means for the individual to be able to look straight into the mirror saying, “I have been living according the ethical premises I value greatly.”</p>
<p>What the individual considers proper, however, may change with time. As Nietzsche points out, there are moments when one feels the need to drag the past “to the bar of judgment” and condemn the future it offers for him or her.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0304375412444817">49</xref>
</sup> Here, if ipse remains “trustworthy” under the new understanding, a rupture enters into idem’s narrative as there is a break in the continuity of the past and the present. Although identity through idem would prioritize on the continuity of the narrative of self-sameness, ipse is superimposing itself over it, in order to emancipate the self from the established narrative and reevaluate the past. A rupture is inserted into the narrative of the self, nevertheless continuity is established on a different—ethical—plane by the self being able without rupture to answer the question: “Who am I?” Hence, idem and ipse are in a dialectic relationship, providing <italic>two modalitie</italic>s [for identity’s] “permanence in time.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0304375412444817">50</xref>
</sup> This interpretation is in line with narrative approaches emphasizing the nonessentialist and multidimensional character of identity and the self.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0304375412444817">51</xref>
</sup> As Ricoeur underlines, “narrative identity is not stable and seamless identity. Just as it is possible to compose several plots on the subject of the same incidents [. . . ] it is always possible to weave different, even opposed, plots about our lives.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0304375412444817">52</xref>
</sup> Depending on the social, political, cultural context, in order to fit the ‘expectations of the moment’—which include ethical aspects emphasized by ipse—the narrative offered by idem is contingent, nevertheless, permanence in time requires idem, to provide, at every moment, a coherent narrative of the self.</p>
<p>Upon interferences by ipse there are two options for maintaining the continuity of idem. First, points of ruptures—made upon inferences of ipse—may be preserved in the memory of the individual and may be consciously reflected upon in the narrative of idem. Thus, they can turn into basic points of reference for the self to define itself. The second option to maintain idem’s continuity is to “rewrite” the past and create “a past from which one would like to be descended in opposition to the past from which one descended.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0304375412444817">53</xref>
</sup> Such erasures of the past are not exceptional instances but are a daily necessity for us to create and recreate our self-image and to be able to face the world “anew.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0304375412444817">54</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>This means that even though we can assert that identity is intimately tied to memory, there is no direct link from the latter to the former, as identity and memory mutually construct one another. Identity is in a sense forward looking, it recasts the past to be congruent with its present, and also defines its present by looking into the future, where identity is not about being but about becoming,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0304375412444817">55</xref>
</sup> with the flow between identity and memory being two directional.</p>
<p>The point to make is that the image of man to have the capacity for ethical renewal (where renewal could also mean turning for the worse) implies that our memories are not depositories of what has happened to us from the point of view of an external objective observer, but subjective storehouses of our past filtered through the point of view of our present position. Thus, when judgment is made concerning an act, there are reasons to call for decoupling the act from the agent who committed it, because as Derrida points out, the one who committed the act is not “through and through the guilty party but already an other, and better than the guilty person.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0304375412444817">56</xref>
</sup> Putting it differently, the idea of the emancipation of man implies a touch of necessary amnesia in order for our past not to oppress us. Although some pasts are a must to remember—like preserving the horrors of the holocaust—other pasts are better to cover with the veil of oblivion. Evolving modes of holistic profiling technologies offer no room for such benevolent amnesia and the accompanying amnesty, as they entertain a deterministic view of the tie between past–present and future.</p>

<title>Administering of the Individual Who is by Then is an Other</title>
<p>Recent decades witnessed a revolutionary change in methods and means of the collection and processing of governmental data. With the help of computer technology formerly segmented databases can be pooled together and the data they contain can be processed in a holistic manner. On the bases of these, general administrative narratives of individuals can be created—which could be called data-self, doppelganger, or virtual-self—each referring to the construction of individuals’ virtual-life-narratives, their “virtual-idem” on the basis of extensive administrational archives of administration.</p>
<p>Amazon offers a nice illustration to capture how virtual-idem—here derived from the individual’s past activity on Amazon website—offers the basis for Amazon to make suggestions on what products may be of interest for the individual.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0304375412444817">57</xref>
</sup> Such social sorting may be referred to as “categorical seduction,”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0304375412444817">58</xref>
</sup> where archived information is used purportedly to provide better and better services for the individual. Google’s chief executive officer, Eric Schmidt, pointed out, “with your permission you give us more information about you, about your friends and we can improve the quality of our searches . . . We don’t need you to type at all. We know where you are. We know where you’ve been. We can more or less now what you’re thinking about.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-0304375412444817">59</xref>
</sup> The concerns for data privacy are obvious. There are, however, other unintended consequence of these methods we should be aware of.</p>
<p>The more refined the profile is, the more the individual finds as the result of a search on the Google website his own past “looking back at him.” While he may have the illusion that potentially the whole world is out there for him to see, in reality the search engine works with a “conservative bias,” providing links and information that match the profile of the individuals. Thus, what he finds tends to be what he already believes in, what is customarily present in his lifeworld. There is a minimal element of surprise, the results on the screen tend to reinforce the established identity of the person sitting in front of the screen. In a way the system becomes a serendipity killer by protecting the individual from what is unexpected for him on the basis of his profile. The lack of being confronted with difference may actually hinder his ethical renewal.</p>
<p>When these methods are used not to serve the individual but to secure others from potential threats (posed by him), we may talk about “categorical suspicion.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-0304375412444817">60</xref>
</sup> It is foremost here in case of security concerns that reservations of pooling together data from separate archives are easily overcome. As Dworkin pointed out, referring to security concerns makes the “law to speak with a muted voice creating a new balance between security and liberty.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-0304375412444817">61</xref>
</sup> Once reservations are overcome for a pervasive connecting of administrative archives both of the state administration and of the service sector—including mobile phone providers, search engines, insurance and financial companies, medical agencies—the virtual-idem of the individual may be built in a holistic manner. This virtual-idem, however, despite of using all sorts of minute detail archived over the past of the individual necessarily creates a distorted image of man. Partly this distortion is embedded in the selection process of archiving. Any process of archiving necessarily distorts reality because as Derrida pointed out, “archivization produces as much as it records the event.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-0304375412444817">62</xref>
</sup> Partly, however, the distortion is rooted in building the virtual-idem on the basis of the past, because it implies the assumption that the past of the individual determines his future. However, as we pointed out, the individual of the present is not identical with the individual of the past in a trivial manner.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Bauman believes that modernity has turned identity “from the matter of ascription into achievement” making identity the responsibility of the individual.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-0304375412444817">63</xref>
</sup> Underlying this thesis is modern man’s assumed agentiality, that is, the assertion that the individual can always extricate himself from his social and psychical context, thus the modern man is conceived to have the opportunity to choose his identity freely.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-0304375412444817">64</xref>
</sup> This agentiality, however, is not merely a possibility but it is an ethical demand on man that under certain conditions he should extricate himself from his past. Even under the most unfavorable conditions, we tend to (at least hope to) believe that man’s future is not determined by his past deeds, but that he has the capacity to emancipate himself and not to be fully bound by his circumstances and his former deeds.</p>
<p>It is a direct implication of this that in our judgment we should let bygones be bygones and look at not who one used to be, but what he is, what he became. This implies a benevolent amnesia and the generous offering of amnesty.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-0304375412444817">65</xref>
</sup> What the virtual-idem does not contain is exactly this emancipatory aspect, this benevolent amnesia. The logic of inferences made on the basis of the archives of the past—by the throughout knowledge of the individual’s past stored in mnemonic apparatuses of the administration—creates an image of man on the bases of what he used to be. Worse, it may create the most negative image of man by keeping track of mistakes, which may have since than turned into formative moments for the individual’s ethical renewal. The individual of the present may actually define himself exactly in opposition to his past self on the basis of which the administration makes its judgment and calculations. Hence, what is administered is not man, but the virtual individual built upon administrative archives, where in fact the two images of man may hardly overlap. The latter may actually be the future that the individual resolutely tries to divert himself from; nevertheless the administrative apparatus not only keeps on reminding him of this hypothetical future but in fact judges him on the basis of it. Putting it somewhat differently, the inherent danger is that the individual is not able to extricate himself from his past and thereby his past to haunt him, exploited by the administrative algorithm of the day, with the ambition to preempt and to anticipate future threats.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-0304375412444817">66</xref>
</sup> Arguably, asserting that we can preempt the future by conceiving “astrological” modes of governance<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-0304375412444817">67</xref>
</sup> is problematic not merely because of the enormous complexity of the world out there. There is the even greater problem that men are self-reflexive beings, who “alter” not only their future but also their past, which questions the ontological status of predictions based on the basis of their past concerning their present and their future.</p>
<p>A few decades ago, Milan Kundera wrote in <italic>The Book of Laughter and Forgetting</italic> that the “struggle of man against power is the struggle of man against forgetting,” suggesting that totalitarian systems try to strengthen their hold on the population by trying to make the official narrative of the shared past to prevail.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-0304375412444817">68</xref>
</sup> While indeed, Kundera, as so often, was very precise in his observation, one could perhaps add that man’s struggle against power must also include the right for forgetting, the right for a benevolent amnesia, and the right to have one’s past left behind and to be judged upon who he is and not who he used to be.</p>
