<abstract>
<p>This study reports the case of a 71-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes whose paronychia rapidly progressed to the right middle finger and then to the whole dorsal aspect necrosis of the right hand. After admission, the diagnosis of diabetic hand ulcer was established and <italic>Streptococcus agalactiae</italic> found as the pathogen. The authors controlled glucose, used 3% hydrogen peroxide and sulfadiazine silver in routine dressing, as well as surgical debridement, topical negative pressure, and skin grafting. The wound closed in 32 days after surgery. Diabetic hand ulcer is often developed from a small wound. The wound, if neglected, will expand very quickly and may lead to amputation and even death. So early diagnosis, standardized treatment, and postoperative rehabilitation is very important.</p>

<title>Case Report</title>
<p>Diabetic foot, due to its high amputation and mortality rate, is receiving more and more attention as one of severe diabetes-related complications. However, diabetic hand is inadequately recognized and usually overlooked by clinicians. Hand ulcer with infection can lead to more serious outcomes such as gangrene,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534734612457032">1</xref></sup> amputation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534734612457032">2</xref></sup> or even death.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534734612457032">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>The patient, a 71-year-old female, has had diabetes for 30 years. Twenty-seven days before admission to our hospital, she received incision and drainage surgery due to right middle finger paronychia and postoperative penicillin treatment. However, the hand infection was getting worse. In 3 days, the wound infection expanded to involve the whole right middle finger. The patient received debridement, drainage, regular dressing change, and systematic antibiotics. But the infection was still spreading and the wound finally covered the whole dorsal aspect of the right hand and right wrist. Severe inflammation reaction was found in adjacent areas. More than 1 hospital believed there was risk of amputation proximal to wrist level. The patient finally came to our hospital.</p>
<p>The following results were obtained during laboratory examination on admission: white blood cells, 6.1 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L; hemoglobin, 114 g/L; platelet, 439 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L; plateletcrit, 0.475%; hemoglobin A1c, 9.5%; blood glucose, pre-dinner 15.3 mol/L; and blood pressure, 140/80 mm Hg. Serologic studies excluded human immunodeficiency virus infection.</p>
<p>The patient presented with swollen right hand and gangrene of distal end of middle finger. There was an open wound from the right middle finger (wound: 7 × 2 cm) to the dorsal aspect of the right hand (wound: 6 × 5 cm). Skin of volar aspect was red and swollen. Massive necrotic tissue in the wound and necrotic tendons were seen. There was a large amount of exudate with odor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1534734612457032">Figure 1A</xref>). The necrotic lesion extended to the wrist joint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1534734612457032">Figure 1B</xref>). No crepitus was noted. Computed tomography angiography showed increased branching of vascular at ulnar side of the right middle finger and a disordered structure, which was interpreted as posttrauma chronic inflammatory angiogenesis. Bacteria culture was performed and result turned out to be positive for <italic>Streptococcus agalactiae</italic>.</p>

<p>The patient was diagnosed as having hand ulcer. An extensive surgical debridement was promptly performed. In the subsequent days wounds were dressed daily with 3% hydrogen peroxide and 1% silver sulfadiazine cream, and minor debridement was performed at bedside. On the fourth day of admission, the patient received wound debridement. Topical negative pressure (TNP; pressure dosage of 0.017-0.060 MPa) with polyvinyl alcohol foam was applied on the middle finger and dorsal wounds. Blood glucose was controlled by insulin.</p>
<p>TNP was removed on the sixth postoperative day. Necrosis decreased and wound granulation was red and fresh (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1534734612457032">Figure 2</xref>). With better adjacent inflammatory reaction and hand swelling, we determined that the infection was controlled. In the next 2 days, we used 1% silver sulfadiazine cream and 3% hydrogen peroxide. TNP was applied for another 8 days. Dorsal wound had good granulation and only small amount of necrotic tissue was left. After further debridement, right middle finger interphalangeal amputation was performed followed by skin grafting and flap grafting on the middle finger stump (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1534734612457032">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

<p>Regular dressing change was performed until 1 month after surgery when the wound healed completely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1534734612457032">Figure 4</xref>). We did not use any systematic antibiotics throughout the whole treatment.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Hand ulcer with infection in diabetes patients was first described in the United States in 1977.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534734612457032">4</xref></sup> However, since 1983, most of reports were from African countries, and hand ulcer with infection has also been termed as <italic>tropical diabetic hand syndrome</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534734612457032">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>We believe that tropical diabetic hand syndrome provides a great reference to the analysis of this case. The prevalence of tropical diabetic hand syndrome is 1.4% to 3.2%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534734612457032">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534734612457032">7</xref></sup> This condition is usually due to small injury such as mosquito bite and has the tendency to develop gangrene. Poor glucose control on hospital admission is a major factor to the quick spreading of the wound. Reports show that the major pathogen of the syndrome is <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, with an infection rate of 44%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534734612457032">8</xref></sup>; in this case, the pathogen is <italic>Streptococcus agalactiae</italic>, which is relatively rare.</p>
<p>The wound, if there is no evidence of soft tissue or bone infection, need not necessarily be treated with antibiotics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534734612457032">9</xref></sup> In this case, the patient’s wound, accompanied with soft tissue and bone infection, was not controlled even with systematic antibiotics. It was local anti-infection and NDWT treatment that controlled infection well and speeded up granulation. Tropical diabetic hand syndrome must be treated immediately and actively, otherwise there will be a high risk of amputation and death.</p>
<p>In sum, tropical diabetic hand syndrome is relatively rare when compared with diabetic foot ulcer. Long diabetes history, poor glucose control, and poor attention to small wounds are the important factors that lead to tropical diabetic hand syndrome. Regarding its treatment, relatively longer dressing change time is needed to remove necrotic tissue and create a good environment for new tissue. Meanwhile, systematic glucose control and effective local antibiotics are critical. Skin grafting, while closing the wound, must be followed by postoperative rehabilitation such as prevention of scar formation and hand function recovery.</p>
