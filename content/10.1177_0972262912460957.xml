<p>The nature of consumption and its precedents naturally arouse interests of all concerned—from academicians to managers. The domains of such enquiries depend upon their context for which one is studying these phenomena and the known relationships among consumption’s causal factors. Thus, consumption literature is mostly focused upon the economic, social, psychological and even physical factors. Among the physical factors the concentration is generally upon biological, geographical and macro environmental factors. Modern anthropologists have, however, started delving into the relationships between human consumption and man-made products and their backdrops. This is a very welcome epistemological step as it opens doors for understanding interactions between man’s creations with man’s consumption. This is a great leap from the knowledge about man’s interaction with generic objects like wheel and fire to the likes of singular designs of houses we live in or furniture or the mobile phone that we use. However, there seems to be a gap between the understanding of generic objects and specific products in use.</p>
<p>Mile’s book is a very meaningful attempt in this direction as it extends the understanding of human consumption in the context of urban landscapes of cities. With the bulk of consumerist society living in modern cities the urban bias for the setting of this exposition is quite acceptable. The canvas of post-industrial cities has enabled the author to span a wide array of urban features from its architecture, artificial events, social rituals to episodic creations. In fact, four chapters of the book deal with architecture, shopping, mega events and theme parks.</p>
<p>The book follows an illustrative style to highlight the relationships between emerging cities and their effects on consumption. It provides some interesting hypotheses or patterns therein for a holistic understanding of the area of study. But, it does not reach to any important firm conclusions. Accordingly, the future designers or planners of cities will have to be satisfied with a richer understanding of the issues involved and make their subjective inferences to be tested over time. Similarly, the book does not provide any hard metrics, albeit qualitative, for any rigorous future research.</p>
<p>The canvas of the book is wide covering different continents and cultures. This is very useful to help make some basic, though tentative, generalization at this early stage of this fascinating branch of knowledge. However, the author has chosen not to highlight the theoretical underpinnings to support the insights into the observations made. Perhaps, it is to avoid making the book too heavy on theory in contrast to its present anecdotal style.</p>
<p>The modern principles of marketing have been shown to be working well for city planning as well. These include identification of key theme of the city and its people, providing identity to the city, branding of cities and their constituents, promotional activities and communication to the key stakeholders. The key take-outs from the book are the provoked thoughts around the subject and the confidence that the book generates about the viability of managerial efforts to build customized cities. Even if customized cities may be distant dreams today some parts of the city elements must pass through the scrutiny of its consumer needs, that is, its citizens and visitors. The analysis given in this book is mostly post hoc. Methodological details of the drawing board stage have been left out. They need to be explored and developed by the next generation of researchers and authors. Without such guidelines the subject area will lack its immediate practical utility. Perhaps a hybrid of anthropological tools with the other social science research tools may be waiting for some kind of standardization here.</p>
<p>The author presents modern city as a stage for celebration of consumption. It shows through several examples as to how consumers have been tempted, facilitated and exhilarated through appropriate city design features. Therein is perhaps the most important message from the book that our future cities can be designed to optimally coordinate between the consumption needs of its people and the discipline of urban planning. Hopefully, we shall be able to see more such books from varied settings and converging towards developments of generalizable principles and methods to apply them.</p>
