<p>This wide-ranging, international collection considers many of the practical, ethical and political questions raised by the proliferation of genetic research and testing around the world. At its best, this volume challenges the reader to contemplate fascinating ethical dilemmas and ponder questions about the nature of personal identity. For example, one chapter raises quandaries such as the appropriateness of the Argentinean state forcing individuals to undergo genetic testing in order to try to undo a wrong created by the former military dictatorship, the question of whether or not there is a human right to “identity,” and if so, what makes up that “identity.” Another chapter challenges us to consider whether it is racist for a criminal justice system to maintain a vast genetic database that may make it much more likely that any randomly selected member of a racial minority group in Britain can be personally identified or at least linked to a close family member than any randomly selected member of the majority group.</p>
<p>This book is not an introduction to basic ideas about DNA, genetic testing, ancestry and identity as they are used today. If you have never thought about the tensions between our understanding of “race” as socially and politically constructed and the use of genetic testing in genealogical searches or “ancestry” testing, for example, this volume will probably not be a good place to start. Most of the authors assume at least some familiarity with the issues involved. For example, the authors do not spell out all of the reasons that it might be difficult for consumers to correctly interpret “genetic results” that purport to tell them their ancestral origins. Certain basic facts, like how these companies offering genetic testing to consumers actually construct their genetic databases and compare an individual’s genetic profile to that database, are not ever addressed in detail, which means that some of the fundamental limitations of these methods of collecting and analyzing DNA data are never fully described. If however you already know at least a little about questions around race, ancestry, identity, and genetic testing, and you are interested in reading about how the implications of these genetic tests vary by country or racial background, you are likely to find chapters here that will expose you to new and interesting ideas.</p>
<p>The volume deals throughout with how genetic information is used, interpreted and contextualized by various interest groups: researchers publishing in <italic>Nature Genetics</italic>, the criminal justice system and the British Police National DNA database, individuals involved in assisted conception and transnational adoption, the government of Argentina, and consumers in Ireland, Switzerland and the United States seeking information about their personal genetic background. The key strength of the volume therefore, is in its breadth and diversity of perspectives, as well as its nuance in dealing with complex issues that are too often reduced to very simplistic terms. Almost all of the chapters deal in a sophisticated way with questions about how ideas of identity, race, and kinship are being shaped by their interaction with genetic technologies and the way those technologies are being interpreted. Some of the chapters also use multiple sources of information in creative ways, such as examining not only the materials used by companies to market their personal DNA tests, but also interviews with the individuals running the companies and comments from consumers of the tests who are discussing their results in online forums with other consumers.</p>
<p>It will not surprise most sociologists that the research published in a genetics journal often ignores questions of the social construction of categories, or that ethnic minority groups are overrepresented in the British database of forensic DNA, or that a “racial” signifier is included in that forensic database based entirely on what the criminal justice officer thought of the appearance of the individual. Still, the book provides ample interesting material sociologists can use to argue for one of our favorite truisms: context matters. The variation in the examples across contexts and the particularities of how these technologies are being used to achieve social and political ends provide powerful illustrations of the power of specific contexts. The use of personal genetic testing (provided by commercial entities) to establish one’s “roots” has, for example, particular power for many African Americans today because of the historical experience of having their family connections stolen during the slave trade. In today’s version of <italic>Roots</italic>, companies promise African American clients that their tests can provide answers when genealogy is stumped, and this promise to reconnect individuals with their own history has a power that is profoundly rooted in the social relationships of our time and place. The centrality of these questions—about identity, belonging, kinship, and citizenship—to our social lives makes it essential that social sciences engage in this kind of work, rather than ceding the realm of the biological to the biologists alone.</p>
