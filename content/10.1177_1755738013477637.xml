<p>Case study A 34-year-old teacher, who has fair hair and blue eyes, presents to you concerned with facial flushing. She feels her face is constantly red and is distressed that her acne has returned. The symptoms are worse when she is stressed, hot and after eating spicy food. She has tried multiple different facial moisturisers and also spent a lot of money on facials from her local beauty therapist.</p>
<p>This is rosacea.</p>
<p>Rosacea is a chronic facial rash typically affecting women, many of whom have a fair complexion, between the ages of 30 and 60 years old. It is often recurrent and persistent. Aetiological causes are unknown, but ultraviolet (UV) light, skin bacteria and allergic responses to facial creams or oils have been implicated. In this condition inflammatory papules affect the nose, forehead, cheeks and chin which can then become dry and flaky. The face feels flushed, hot and sensitive. Often the symptoms are aggravated by sun exposure, alcohol and spicy food. Rosacea is associated with blepharitis and rhinophyma.</p>
<p>People with rosacea feel self-conscious about their condition and will often seek out treatment from other avenues before seeing their GP. This can lead to increased sensitivity to make-up and moisturiser used prior to seeking treatment.</p>
<p>Diagnosis is clinical. Differential diagnoses include all other skin conditions that affect the face such as atopic eczema, acne vulgaris, sebhorreic dermatitis or irritant contact dermatitis.</p>
<p>Reducing triggers, such as avoiding factors that cause facial flushing, avoiding oil-based creams and using adequate UV protection are important. Rosacea should not be treated with topical steriods as although there may be some initial improvement, typically the rash becomes more severe when treatment is discontinued. Topical treatment such as metronidazole gel/cream or azelaic acid applied morning and evening after washing with a mild cleanser, can be effective. If this is ineffective oral tetracyclines can reduce the rash.</p>
<p>All treatments should be continued for at least 8 weeks to determine whether they are beneficial before discontinuing. Referral to a dermatologist is not often necessary but should be considered in cases of diagnostic doubt or failure to respond to usual treatment. Patients may consider private laser treatments to associated telengectasia or prominent superficial veins.</p>
