<p><italic>Objective</italic>. Postoperative external auditory canal (EAC) stenosis is the most common complication after congenital aural atresia (CAA) surgery. The authors applied an ear mold or hearing aid as an EAC stent following surgery and analyzed the impact on postoperative EAC stenosis.</p>
<p><italic>Study Design</italic>. Historical cohort study.</p>
<p><italic>Setting</italic>. A tertiary hospital.</p>
<p><italic>Subjects and Methods</italic>. Ninety-six patients who underwent canaloplasty between 1996 and 2010 were included in this study. To discover factors contributing to postoperative EAC stenosis, clinical parameters, including age, sex, Marx grading, Schuknecht classification, Jahrsdoerfer score, surgical approach, triamcinolone injection, and use of stenting with an ear mold or hearing aid, were reviewed and analyzed. Each stent was used for at least 6 months postoperatively. Pure-tone audiometry was performed preoperatively and 3, 6, and 12 months after canaloplasty.</p>
<p><italic>Results</italic>. Postoperative EAC stenosis was the most common postoperative complication, occurring in 8 (8.2%) cases with a mean time interval of 4.1 months.

<body>
<p>Congenital aural atresia (CAA) is a congenital disorder manifesting as aplasia or hypoplasia of the external auditory canal (EAC) and is often associated with abnormalities of the auricle and middle ear.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599811426257">1</xref></sup> The most important surgical goals for CAA are rehabilitation of hearing by restoring the normal sound-conducting mechanism of the ear and creating a clean, well-epithelialized, patent EAC. However, a high frequency of postoperative EAC stenosis and unsatisfactory hearing results remain a significant challenge.</p>
<p>Postoperative EAC stenosis or poor hearing results generally require revision surgery. A recent study has revealed that EAC stenosis or chronic drainage due to stenosis or unhealthy canal skin accounts for 77% of the main indications for revision surgery in patients with CAA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599811426257">2</xref></sup> Therefore, prevention of postoperative EAC stenosis is imperative to reduce the rate of revision surgery. Numerous techniques, including covering the lateral part of the EAC with a periosteal flap, short-term packing with wick or foam earplug, and/or injection of steroids have been made to prevent postoperative EAC stenosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599811426257">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599811426257">6</xref></sup> However, results reported in the clinical literature for the prevention of postoperative EAC stenosis have not been satisfactory. The reported rate of canal stenosis after canaloplasty has varied from 14% to 31%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599811426257">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599811426257">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599811426257">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599811426257">9</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>The process of wound healing following surgery is complex, and scarring is an unavoidable consequence of healing after any surgical procedure. Postoperative EAC stenosis in patients with CAA can be caused by both soft tissue hypertrophy and bony overgrowth. Soft tissue hypertrophy is characterized by excessive deposition of fibroblast-derived extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, especially collagen, and by persistent inflammation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599811426257">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599811426257">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599811426257">11</xref></sup> Therefore, reducing scar formation and bony overgrowth is essential to prevent postoperative EAC stenosis. Pressure therapy has become more popular for the primary management of hypertrophic scars.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599811426257">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599811426257">14</xref></sup> A previous study reported that mechanical pressure modulates the remodeling phase of wound healing by altering the activity of matrix metalloproteinase-28.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0194599811426257">15</xref></sup> In addition, it has been proven that osteocytes act as mechanosensors and that mechanical pressure also leads to bone remodeling in the early stage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0194599811426257">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0194599811426257">17</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Consequently, it is reasonable to hypothesize that placing a stent and applying mechanical pressure for an appropriate duration of time on the newly made EAC would be effective in preventing postoperative EAC stenosis. However, pressure therapy has been used for a relatively short period in prior reports. In addition, applying a foam earplug or cotton wick may not provide enough pressure to prevent scar formation. The acrylic mold material commonly used to make hearing aid molds can be easily used as a stent in the EAC and seems to serve this purpose. However, little is known about the association between placing an ear mold following canaloplasty and postoperative EAC stenosis in CAA patients. The purpose of this study was to identify the effect of long-term application of an ear mold or hearing aid on preventing postoperative EAC stenosis.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<sec id="section2-0194599811426257">
<title>Patients</title>
<p>A retrospective case review of 96 patients (98 ears) with CAA who consecutively underwent canaloplasty at Samsung Medical Center from 1996 to 2010 was performed. Only primary operations with a follow-up period of 12 months or more were included in this study. High-resolution computed tomography of the temporal bone was checked in all patients during the preoperative period, and every image was reviewed according to the Jahrsdoerfer classification system for CAA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0194599811426257">18</xref></sup> The severity of microtia was classified according to the Marx classification.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0194599811426257">19</xref></sup> Grade I represents auricles with a mild deformity, such as a normal-shaped but small pinna; grade II corresponds to abnormally small auricles with some anatomical structures distinguishable; and grade III describes auricles with few or no recognizable auricle landmarks. All available audiometric test results were collected. The air-bone gap (ABG) was calculated using 4-frequency pure-tone averages (500, 1000, 2000, and 3000 Hz) of air and bone conduction. ABG was analyzed preoperatively and at 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-ups for patients who underwent hearing restoration procedures.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0194599811426257">
<title>Surgical Technique for Canaloplasty</title>
<p>The majority of enrolled patients underwent surgery using the anterior approach. First, anteriorly based skin flaps were elevated, leaving the periosteum on the mastoid cortex. Next, cartilage and soft tissue were removed, and anteriorly, superiorly, and inferiorly based periosteal flaps were elevated as previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0194599811426257">20</xref></sup> An external canal was created by drilling using the middle cranial fossa dural plate and the posterior aspect of the temporomandibular joint as the superior and anterior landmarks, respectively. The pneumatic mastoid air cells were as little disturbed as possible during drilling. The canal was constructed with a diameter of 1.5 cm, large enough to allow for later narrowing from scar formation. The atretic plate was removed with diamond burrs, curettes, or laser, and the ossicular mass was identified. Bony shelf or tympanic membrane (TM) reconstruction was made slightly medial to the ossicular mass. After assessing ossicular chain mobility, if necessary, ossicular reconstruction was performed using a partial ossicular prosthesis. An onlay temporalis muscle fascia graft was performed on the malleoincudal complex or on the ossicular prosthesis. Exposed air cells were covered with sliced cartilage. Periosteal flaps were sutured to the skin to cover the lateral portions of newly made external canals. A 0.008-inch thick, 6 × 6-cm split-thickness graft was obtained from the inner thigh using a dermatome. The skin was used to line the newly made EAC from the grafted temporalis fascia to the meatus, covering all bone and periosteal flaps as previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599811426257">7</xref></sup> A disk of silastic sheet was placed over the TM to make the anterior tympanomeatal angle. The lateral edge of the skin graft was sutured to the meatal skin, and pieces of Ambrus Merocel wick (Medtronic Xomed Surgical Products, Jacksonville, Florida) were placed in the EAC and meatus. Continuous facial nerve monitoring was used for all cases.</p>

<title>Postoperative Follow-up and Application of Ear Mold or Hearing Aid</title>
<p>Postoperative surgical outcomes, including EAC patency and ABGs in pure-tone audiometry, were evaluated at the regular follow-up visits. If there were signs of soft tissue hypertrophy, including swelling and erythema, 10 mg of triamcinolone (TA) was injected into the hypertrophic site. Around 4 weeks postoperatively, when epithelialization was completed, an ear mold was made using an impression taken of the patient’s newly established EAC. The ear mold was made of acrylic and had a minimal length of 15 mm to cover the soft tissue meatus and bony entrance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0194599811426257"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>). The mold or hearing aid was applied to most patients as a stent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0194599811426257"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref>), and the minimum required period for using a stent was 6 months. If patients were compliant and used their stent for most of the time (≥8 hours a day and ≥50% of the follow-up period), they were classified into the “user group.” However, some patients were not provided with or did not use their stents, and other patients lost their ear molds. These noncompliant patients (&lt;8 hours a day or &lt;50% of the follow-up period) were designated to the “nonuser” group.</p>

<p>Postoperative EAC stenosis was defined as follows: (1) minimum meatal diameter of less than 3 mm in all dimensions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599811426257">2</xref></sup> or (2) narrow canal with persistent discharge. A narrow meatus larger than 3 mm in any dimension and healthy epithelialized EAC skin was not considered postoperative EAC stenosis. The interval for development of postoperative EAC stenosis was evaluated. Associations between postoperative EAC stenosis and various preoperative clinical factors, including age, sex, Marx grade, Schuknecht type, Jahrsdoerfer grading, surgical approach, TA injection, and use of ear mold or hearing aid, were assessed by statistical analysis.</p>
<p>Fisher exact test or χ<sup>2</sup> test was undertaken to clarify contributions made by various factors to the development of postoperative EAC stenosis. Statistical analyses were performed using the PASW Statistics 18.0 software program (SPSS, Inc, an IBM Company, Chicago, Illinois). The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Samsung Medical Center (2011-05-077-001).</p>

<title>Demographic Data</title>
<p>There were 64 male and 32 female patients. Age at the initial surgery ranged from 3.7 to 62.4 years (mean [SD]: 4.4 [8.7] years), and the follow-up duration ranged from 12 to 162 months with a mean of 36.0 months. Sixty patients underwent auricular reconstruction prior to canaloplasty. The anterior approach was used in most cases (93 ears, 94.9%), and the posterior approach was used in 5 (5.1%) cases that had problems caused by cholesteatoma.</p>
<p>The mean (SD) Jahrsdoerfer score was 8.32 (1.01), and 81.1% of patients scored more than 8 points. According to the Schuknecht classification,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0194599811426257">21</xref></sup> type C was most common, found in 68 (69.4%) ears, and type B was found in 30 (30.6%) ears. According to the Marx classification system, normal or microtia grade I was found in 37 (37.8%) ears, microtia grade II was found in 27 (27.5%) ears, and microtia grade III was found in 34 (34.7%) ears.</p>
<p>Of the 82 patients who used a stent, 18 patients (22.0%) used a hearing aid. Among these patients, 6 patients switched to an ear mold because they could not adapt to their hearing aids.</p>

<sec id="section7-0194599811426257">
<title>Occurrence of EAC Stenosis</title>
<p>Postoperative EAC stenosis occurred in 8 (8.2%) of 98 cases during the follow-up period. Descriptive findings in patients with postoperative EAC stenosis are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0194599811426257"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>. The mean (SD) time interval to stenosis detection after canaloplasty was 4.1 (2.4) months (range, 2-9 months). The main causes of postoperative stenosis were soft tissue hypertrophy in 3 cases, bony regrowth in 1 case, and combined stenosis in 4 cases. All patients who developed postoperative EAC stenosis underwent revision surgery (meatoplasty or canaloplasty) to obtain a sufficiently wide EAC. The mean (SD) time interval between detection of postoperative EAC stenosis and revision surgery was 10.1 (6.88) months (range, 3-22 months).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Surgery for CAA remains one of the most challenging procedures in otology, mainly due to the difficulty of the technique and the relatively high postoperative complication rates. The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the surgical results in 96 patients (98 ears) with an emphasis on postoperative EAC stenosis.</p>
<p>The complication rate in canaloplasty is high. Revision surgery is needed in about one-third of cases. Postoperative EAC stenosis is the most common complication following canaloplasty, with a reported rate of 14% to 31%, and is also the most common indication for revision surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599811426257">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599811426257">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599811426257">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599811426257">9</xref></sup> With severe canal stenosis, the ear cannot be cleaned and squamous debris is trapped in the canal, causing inflammation and discharge. EAC stenosis can lead to conductive hearing loss and even canal cholesteatoma. Therefore, it is essential in canaloplasty to reduce the rate of postoperative EAC stenosis and need for revision surgery.</p>
<p>We attempted a regular long-term pressure therapy using an ear mold or hearing aid after canaloplasty for preventing postoperative EAC stenosis. A marked difference in terms of postoperative EAC stenosis was observed between ear mold or hearing aid users (4.9%) and nonusers (25.0%) after at least 12 months of follow-up. To the best of our knowledge, regular use of an ear mold or hearing aid after canaloplasty has not been attempted, and this is the first comprehensive report focusing on the preventive effects of long-term stent use for stenosis.</p>
<p>Surgical wounds inevitably heal with scarring. Both soft tissue hypertrophy and bony regrowth are responsible for postoperative EAC stenosis in the previous report<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599811426257">2</xref></sup> and in this study. Oliver et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599811426257">2</xref></sup> reported that, out of 62 revision cases for EAC stenosis, 31 (50%) had meatal and/or soft tissue stenosis, 27 (44%) had new bone formation, and 4 cases had a combination of both. Hypertrophic soft tissue scars are characterized by proliferation of dermal tissue with excessive deposition of extracellular matrix proteins, such as collagen, and persistent inflammation. These effects typically develop 4 to 8 weeks after reepithelialization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599811426257">11</xref></sup> According to international clinical recommendations on scar management, treatment of hypertrophic scars is most successful when the scars are immature but the overlying epithelium is intact.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599811426257">14</xref></sup> Therefore, we applied an ear mold or hearing aid around 4 weeks after canaloplasty, when epithelialization of the entire EAC was just completed. In addition, it is generally recommended that pressure be maintained for 6 to 12 months for this therapy to be effective.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599811426257">14</xref></sup> We developed a clinical protocol following this recommendation and advised patients to use an ear mold or hearing aid for more than 6 months.</p>
<p>In terms of pathologic scarring, many prior studies have concluded that prophylactic management is preventive and should be applied immediately after wound healing and full epithelialization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599811426257">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0194599811426257">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0194599811426257">23</xref></sup> In other words, it is more efficient to prevent hypertrophic scars than to treat them.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599811426257">14</xref></sup> To prevent hypertrophic scars, a variety of methods, including pressure therapy, silicone materials, intralesional corticosteroid injections, laser therapy, cryotherapy, radiotherapy, and vitamin E, have been introduced.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599811426257">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Among these methods, pressure therapy is known to be preventive for both bony regrowth and soft tissue hypertrophic scars. Mechanical stress, such as pressure, is known to change the macro- and microscopic morphology of bone. The strain force modulates the activities of ion channels, focal adhesion kinases, and the structure of the cytoskeleton of the osteocytes. In addition, loaded pressure activates osteoblasts and osteoclasts to cause bone formation and resorption. As a result, applying pressure can result in bone remodeling through such molecular events.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0194599811426257">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0194599811426257">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0194599811426257">25</xref></sup> Previous studies have demonstrated that pressure controls collagen synthesis by limiting the supply of blood, oxygen, and nutrients to the scar tissue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599811426257">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0194599811426257">26</xref></sup> Pressure also induces realignment of collagen bundles already present and inhibits myofibroblasts and vascular cells by apoptosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599811426257">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0194599811426257">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>Hard (acrylic) ear mold materials were used for stents in this study. Acrylic is a popular hard plastic that is used for hearing aid molds. It is easy to fine-tune and does not shrink or change over time. In addition, it is inert and causes minimal tissue reaction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0194599811426257">28</xref></sup> It is therefore an ideal stent candidate, and for most otologists, it is relatively easy to provide patients with an ear mold. In addition, patients can easily insert or remove their ear molds by themselves. For those who have a large ABG after canaloplasty for various reasons, hearing aids can serve not only as sound amplifiers but also as stents for preventing postoperative EAC stenosis.</p>
<p>Previous studies have shown that grade II or III microtia and younger age (≤12 years old) are poor prognostic factors for postoperative EAC stenosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599811426257">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0194599811426257">20</xref></sup> However, the occurrence rate of postoperative EAC stenosis was not different between younger patients and older patients in this study. Marx grading also did not influence postoperative outcome for EAC stenosis in this study. A possible explanation for the different results of this study is that ear mold or hearing aid use outweighs the effects of various intrinsic factors, including younger age and degree of microtia. According to our results, using an ear mold or hearing aid following canaloplasty can be expected to substantially reduce the rate of postoperative EAC stenosis.</p>
<p>A number of studies have reported hearing results in canaloplasty. De la Cruz<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599811426257">7</xref></sup> found that 47.8% of patients achieved an ABG of 30 dB or less after long-term follow-up. In another study, closure of the ABG within 30 dB was seen in 74% patients both in the short and long term.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0194599811426257">29</xref></sup> At 6-month follow-up, 58% of patients in our series achieved an ABG of 30 dB or less, and this ratio decreased to 48.7% at 1-year follow-up. These results are comparable to prior studies, but long-term follow-up is necessary to assess final hearing outcomes.</p>
<p>A possible limitation of this study is the relatively short follow-up duration for some subjects. Although it is reported that postoperative EAC stenosis mostly occurs from 6 to 18 months after canaloplasty,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599811426257">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599811426257">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0194599811426257">20</xref></sup> most stenosis occurred within 6 months postoperatively with a mean of 4.1 months in this study. However, stenosis results after long-term follow-up may be more convincing for the preventive effects of an ear mold or hearing aid.</p>
<p>In addition, because of the observational nature of our study, confounding factors regarding noncompliance of the EAC stent might influence the outcomes. However, in our case series, the main cause not to use the EAC stent seems to be a stigma of the appearance rather than negative surgical results, such as sensitive skin, narrower canal, and granulation tissue. Every patient in the study period was educated and encouraged to use the EAC stent in the same way.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our results demonstrate that long-term stent use has the potential to significantly reduce the occurrence of postoperative EAC stenosis after surgical correction of CAA. Therefore, applying an ear mold or hearing aid after canaloplasty might be a useful tool for reducing complications and avoiding revision surgeries in CAA patients.</p>
