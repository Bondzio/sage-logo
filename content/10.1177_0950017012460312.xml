<abstract>
<p>We examine the impact of involuntary job loss on psychological distress and investigate whether the impact differs by educational level using a sample of men drawn from the British Household Panel Study. We expect higher-educated men to suffer less from job loss because they have more resources and better re-employment chances. Alternatively, it could be that, in the long run, lower-educated men adapt better to continued unemployment or downward mobility. Fixed effects regression analyses show that job loss increases distress, but over time the effect wears off and is limited to non-employed men. We find that higher-educated men experience less distress following job loss. These educational differences in the impact of job loss become smaller over time and are mainly driven by re-employment chances.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Losing one’s job can be one of the most stressful events to happen to an individual over the life course (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0950017012460312">Paul and Moser, 2009</xref>). It is often the start of a spell of unemployment, and can have long-term negative effects (‘scarring’) on a person’s labour market career (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0950017012460312">Arulampalam et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0950017012460312">Gangl, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0950017012460312">Stevens, 1997</xref>). A long tradition of sociological research has examined the relationship between job loss, unemployment and mental well-being. Since the seminal work of Jahoda (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0950017012460312">Jahoda et al., 1972</xref>) many studies have documented the negative effect of job loss and unemployment on health and well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0950017012460312">Bartley, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0950017012460312">Burchell, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0950017012460312">Paul and Moser, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0950017012460312">Warr, 1987</xref>). Jahoda’s deprivation model stresses the latent functions of paid labour, such as structure and regular activity, identity and status. Unemployment deprives individuals of these functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0950017012460312">Burchell, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0950017012460312">Nordenmark and Strandh, 1999</xref>) and this has a negative impact on well-being. Another perspective puts more emphasis on the financial consequences of losing one’s job (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0950017012460312">Fryer, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0950017012460312">Fryer and Payne, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0950017012460312">Gershuny, 1994</xref>). These explanations are not mutually exclusive and can operate simultaneously.</p>
<p>Although the proposed mechanisms linking unemployment and mental health offer a lot of room for individual and group differences in the impact of job loss, most previous research has treated job loss as a homogeneous event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0950017012460312">Paul and Moser, 2009</xref>). At least two divergent arguments about socio-economic differences in the impact of job loss can be distilled from the literature. On the one hand, it can be argued that a higher social position confers psychological, social and financial resources that may buffer the impact of job loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0950017012460312">Burgard et al., 2007</xref>). Higher-educated people may have better re-employment chances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0950017012460312">Barbieri et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0950017012460312">Mooi-Reci, 2008</xref>) which reduces the likelihood and/or duration of being deprived of the positive functions of employment. On the other hand, unemployment and downward mobility could hurt higher-educated people more if work is more important for their status and identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0950017012460312">Burgard et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0950017012460312">Turner, 1995</xref>). Some studies report findings on socio-economic differences in the impact of job loss and unemployment on mental health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0950017012460312">Andersen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0950017012460312">Clark et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0950017012460312">Dooley et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0950017012460312">Gallo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0950017012460312">Kuhn et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0950017012460312">Strully, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0950017012460312">Turner, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0950017012460312">Whelan, 1994</xref>) but few make it the focus of research. Moreover, these studies show mixed and even conflicting findings. Some studies find stronger negative effects among higher socio-economic groups (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0950017012460312">Clark et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0950017012460312">Dooley et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0950017012460312">Whelan, 1994</xref>). Other studies find stronger effects among lower groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0950017012460312">Andersen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0950017012460312">Gallo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0950017012460312">Kuhn et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0950017012460312">Strully, 2009</xref>), still others find no differences at all.</p>
<p>This is an important issue to study as socio-economic variation in the impact of job loss may have ramifications for inequalities in health and may shed light on the workings of the labour market. We investigate this issue by addressing the following two questions: to what extent do the short-term and long-term effects of job loss differ between lower and higher-educated people? How can these educational differences be explained? We focus on educational level because it is a prime indicator of human capital and of one’s social position. Furthermore, it is not directly affected by job loss, contrary to, for instance, social class or income. We will study the impact of job loss using 18 waves of the British Household Panel Study (BHPS).</p>
<p>We aim to make four contributions. First and foremost, since few studies explicitly investigate variability in the experience of job loss, we formulate competing hypotheses about the moderating effect of educational level and examine the role of re-employment processes. In doing so, we contribute to the two lines of research mentioned earlier: the literature on unemployment and mental health, and the literature on the socio-economic gradient in health.</p>
<p>Second, we focus on job loss rather than unemployment, which is the focus of the few studies that examine variability (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0950017012460312">Gallo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0950017012460312">Kuhn et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0950017012460312">Strully, 2009</xref>). We prefer to focus on job loss because it rules out an important source of selection bias. Unemployment as <italic>an</italic> outcome of job loss may become less likely with increasing educational level. Individuals who become unemployed and remain so long enough to be observed in a survey form a selective subset of those who involuntarily lost their jobs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0950017012460312">Stewart, 2001</xref>). We therefore study all individuals who lose a job regardless of successive employment or unemployment duration.</p>
<p>Third, we extend the literature by incorporating non-employment and job mobility in the analysis of the moderating effect of education. The information in the BHPS makes it possible to differentiate between characteristics of the lost job and of the person losing that job. That is a feature lacking from previous research but it is important as education is positively correlated with occupational status, income and employability. We investigate the role of successful re-employment and downward mobility by incorporating information on the lost job’s social status and relative income.</p>
<p>Fourth, we study the impact of job loss over a period of six years. Previous research was restricted to shorter periods (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0950017012460312">Clark et al., 2001</xref>). It is important to study the longer term as well because both negative and positive buffering effects of education are conceivable.</p>
<sec id="section2-0950017012460312">
<title>The psychological impact of job loss</title>
<p>Job loss may have instantaneous and long-term repercussions on psychological distress. Job loss can increase psychological distress in at least three ways: first, through stress because of involuntarily losing one’s job (irrespective of what follows); second, through effects related to being out of employment for those who do not find re-employment; and third, for those who find re-employment, through downward job mobility. We expect that the impact eventually wears off. It is an open question, however, how soon this occurs. In the following section we first discuss the mechanisms in more detail. In a second step, we discuss why educational attainment may influence the effects of job loss. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0950017012460312">Figure 1</xref> gives a schematic overview.</p>

</fig>
<p>First, the process of job loss itself is inherently stressful. Traditionally there has been little attention to the effect of the event itself as one focused on the subsequent state of unemployment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0950017012460312">Jahoda, 1982</xref>). However, uncertainty about the future and the (initial) blow to one’s identity and self-esteem may cause stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0950017012460312">Pearlin et al., 1981</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0950017012460312">Jahoda, 1982</xref>, for the importance of status and identity). In addition, people lose returns to job-specific investments and contacts with their colleagues. These losses can be offset by a new job, but settling into and adapting to a new work environment and building new relationships can be stressful too, especially because the change was involuntary.</p>
<p>Second, an unwanted job loss often leads to unemployment or labour market exit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0950017012460312">Arulampalam et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0950017012460312">Burgard et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0950017012460312">Stevens, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0950017012460312">Strully, 2009</xref>). As mentioned earlier, the literature on unemployment and mental health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0950017012460312">Burchell, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0950017012460312">Hanisch, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0950017012460312">Jahoda, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0950017012460312">Paul and Moser, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0950017012460312">Warr, 1987</xref>) shows how the unemployed lose the positive functions that work may provide (and how becoming re-employed provides these functions anew). Work connects people with society at large, gives a sense of purpose, lets people share in collective goals, provides a way to structure time and is important for identity and status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0950017012460312">Hanisch, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0950017012460312">Jahoda, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0950017012460312">Paul and Moser, 2009</xref>). All of these are positively related to mental health. Traditionally, much less attention has been paid to the financial consequences of job loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0950017012460312">Fryer, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0950017012460312">Fryer and Payne, 1986</xref>). However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0950017012460312">Pearlin et al. (1981)</xref> show that part of the relationship between job loss and depressive symptoms is mediated by increases in economic strain.</p>
<p>The third factor concerns the type of employment after job loss. Meta-analyses suggest that, in general, re-employment nullifies the negative effects of unemployment on mental health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0950017012460312">Hanisch, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0950017012460312">Paul and Moser, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0950017012460312">Strandh, 2000</xref>). Re-employed individuals regain the positive functions of work and, in general, improve their financial situation. However, the quality of the new job may be lower than before because people may experience downward mobility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0950017012460312">Burgard et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0950017012460312">Dooley et al., 2000</xref>). In various respects, from commuting time to job security, the new job may be less attractive and lead to lower well-being. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0950017012460312">Burchell (1994)</xref>, for instance, shows that people who found insecure re-employment were worse off psychologically than those who were securely re-employed. As a consequence, even people who find re-employment may experience increased levels of psychological distress.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0950017012460312">
<title>Why education softens the effects of job loss</title>
<p>The outlined effects of job loss on psychological distress may depend on the level of educational attainment (dashed arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0950017012460312">Figure 1</xref>). First, education may decrease the effects of the direct stress of job loss (A). Second, education decreases the chances of negative employment outcomes after job loss (B). Third, education may influence the impact of non-employment and downward mobility on psychological distress (C).</p>
<p>Higher-educated individuals may be better able to deal with the stress of job loss (A) because they have a stronger internal locus of control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0950017012460312">Schieman and Plickert, 2008</xref>), have higher levels of social support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0950017012460312">Bartley, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0950017012460312">Ross and Wu, 1995</xref>), use more active coping strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0950017012460312">Christensen et al., 2006</xref>) and have higher socio-economic resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0950017012460312">Bartley, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0950017012460312">Ross and Wu, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0950017012460312">Stronks et al., 1996</xref>). Socio-economic resources, such as higher savings and investments, may make daily life easier and reduce worries in a period of financial crisis and uncertainty about the future.</p>
<p>The higher-educated may be better able to avoid negative employment outcomes after job loss (B). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0950017012460312">Gallo et al. (2006)</xref> suggest that a bigger financial buffer, which the higher-educated tend to have, allows individuals more time to find suitable re-employment. In general higher-educated people are more attractive to potential employers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0950017012460312">Mooi-Reci, 2008</xref>). We expect the higher-educated to suffer less from job loss as they are less likely to become non-employed and experience downward mobility. However, as the higher-educated are also more likely to have a job with a higher social standing and income, they may be more likely to experience a sharper drop in status and income when they lose their job. The positive relationship between educational level and social position may suppress the supposed buffering effect of educational level. Fortunately, we can take these counteracting mechanisms into account by controlling for the level of the lost job.</p>
<p>The way people deal with the negative consequences of non-employment or downward mobility after job loss may also depend on educational level (C). The income drop may be felt less hard for higher-educated people because they have more savings. Furthermore, the higher-educated may be better able to deal with the stresses associated with being unemployed or non-employed through the resources mentioned earlier. Moreover, higher-educated people may have more alternative options to find purpose in life other than paid work as they are more likely to do volunteer work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0950017012460312">Wilson, 2000</xref>), so they may be more able to avoid the negative effects of idleness and the loss of daily routine. In sum, we expect the higher-educated to experience less psychological distress following job loss because they have more resources to deal with stress and negative employment outcomes, and have better re-employment chances.</p>
<p>There is an alternative view of how educational level moderates the effect of job loss. The basis for this competing view lies in the higher aspirations among higher-educated people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0950017012460312">Turner, 1995</xref>). Having higher aspirations on the labour market may make it harder to accept being unemployed or moving to a new job on a lower level. Furthermore, the stigma of unemployment may be felt more strongly by the higher-educated. Findings with German panel data are in line with this view, as they show that over time the lower-educated adapt to unemployment but the higher-educated do not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0950017012460312">Clark et al., 2001</xref>). These mechanisms would lead to a contrasting expectation, namely that education increases the negative effects of job loss for those who become unemployed or downwardly mobile. We expect that such negative effects of educational level are limited to the longer term because people are likely to consider unemployment and downward mobility in the short term as temporary concessions in a search for adequate re-employment.</p>

<title>Data</title>
<p>We used data from 18 waves of the British Household Panel Survey (1991–2008; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0950017012460312">BHPS, 2010</xref>). We selected men aged 25–54. The employment careers of men and women differ markedly and women have more socially acceptable alternatives to employment, which complicated a simultaneous analysis. Observations of individuals younger than 25 were excluded because young people may be less attached to the labour market (job hopping, temporary student jobs). The upper age cap excluded (involuntary) early retirement as an alternative form of job loss. This produced 52,914 observations of 7,691 men with face-to-face interviews (we discarded proxy and phone interviews).</p>
<p>We followed individuals from the point in time at which they become at risk of job loss (i.e. are employed). Individuals were included in the sample if they had at least two observations of which the first was in employment. We used an unbalanced panel design as individuals can temporarily exit the observation window if they have not been interviewed for one or more waves. Individuals exit permanently once they turn 55 or once they leave due to sample attrition. The 918 respondents who reported job loss were followed for five subsequent waves (i.e. about one to six years post-job loss). We discarded observations after that period. The number of observations after six years became too low (only about 50% of the men who originally lost their jobs remained; see bottom row of Table A3 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0950017012460312">Appendix 1</xref>). In the analyses we have limited ourselves to observations with full information. The final sample comprised 40,509 observations of 5,348 men (more details in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0950017012460312">Appendix 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Psychological distress</title>
<p>Our dependent variable was measured with the 12 item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). The GHQ-12 was originally developed as a screening instrument for psychiatric illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0950017012460312">Goldberg et al., 1997</xref>) and is frequently used as a general measure of psychological distress (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0950017012460312">Thomas et al., 2005</xref>). The self-completion questionnaire included six negatively and six positively worded statements about how people had been feeling the last few weeks. Examples of negatively worded items are: ‘lost much sleep over worry’, ‘felt constantly under strain’; examples of positively worded items are ‘been able to concentrate on whatever you’re doing’ and ‘been able to face up to problems’. Responses were given on a four-point scale ranging from 0 to 3, with 0 being the best score (e.g. ‘not at all’ for a negatively worded item). We created a scale ranging from 0 to 36 by summing the individual items (Cronbachs’ alpha 0.89). We extrapolated the score based on the answered items in case one or two items were missing (&lt; .5% of observations).</p>

<p>Respondents reported on their current labour market status and retrospectively on previous spells from the previous year to the present. We adapted Stata programmes written by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0950017012460312">Maré (2006)</xref> to construct job histories. Respondents can cite one the following reasons for a job ending: promoted, other job, made redundant, dismissed/sacked, temporary job ended, health reasons, retirement and other reasons (includes family care, education). We considered those who were made redundant or dismissed as having involuntarily lost their jobs. Ancillary analyses that included additional indicators for job changes due to these other reasons gave similar results.</p>
<p>For reasons of simplicity and parsimony, we considered only the first reported job loss. Moreover, people may be more at risk of job loss after the first job loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0950017012460312">Stevens, 1997</xref>). Therefore if we included the effect of additionally reported job losses we might underestimate the effect of the first reported job loss. Job endings occurring before the first wave of observation were not considered (i.e. reported in the first observed wave) because the design required a pre-job loss observation of psychological distress. Furthermore, in the wave prior to a job loss the respondent had to be employed and not report another job loss. We observed 918 involuntary job endings: 811 redundancies and 107 dismissals.</p>

<sec id="section8-0950017012460312">
<title>Educational level prior to job loss</title>
<p>We distinguished four levels of academic educational attainment: (1) no qualification; (2) some qualifications (an O-level, General Certificate of Secondary Education [GCSE], CSE, etc.); (3) A-level or equivalent; (4) higher qualifications, degree or higher.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0950017012460312">
<title>Characteristics of the lost job</title>
<p>We use two measures for characteristics of the lost job: a social prestige and a relative income measure. Social status was measured using Treiman’s Standard International Occupational Scale (International Standard Classification of Occupations 1988 coding frame; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0950017012460312">Ganzeboom and Treiman, 1996</xref>). This scale measures the social attractiveness of a job. The relative income (in percentiles) of the lost job is based on the annual income distribution of all employed/self-employed BHPS respondents aged 18–65. Both measures were standardized to the sample distribution of job characteristics. Respondents who did not experience job loss were assigned a score of zero.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0950017012460312">
<title>Employment after job loss</title>
<p>We used two measures for the employment situation after job loss. First, we differentiated between the people who became unemployed/non-employed versus those who became employed/self-employed. Second, we incorporated interactions with downward mobility. We used two measures of downward mobility: in terms of social status if the current job had a prestige score at least five points lower than the lost job, and in terms of income if the drop in relative income was at least five percentage points.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0950017012460312">
<title>Controls</title>
<p>We controlled for the number of physical health problems, as deteriorations in physical health may affect labour market opportunities as well as psychological distress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0950017012460312">Mandemakers and Monden, 2010</xref>). In addition, we controlled for non-employment due to long-term illness. Relationship status was controlled for with a set of dummy variables (single, cohabitating, separated/divorced/widowed). The analyses included standardized age (divided by 10) and its square. We also included interactions between age and job loss because the impact of job loss may depend on age and age is correlated with labour experience, type of work and educational level. We included dummy variables for regions in the United Kingdom (UK), and year of interview to take into account spatial and time variation in labour market opportunities.

<title>Model</title>
<p>We used fixed effects to model the impact of job loss on psychological distress. These models control for unobserved time-invariant differences between people that may affect the chance of job loss and psychological distress (e.g. personality traits or ambition). Fixed effects models take into account that individuals who involuntarily lose a job may be more distressed in the first place. We hypothesized that job loss increases psychological distress but that the effect levels off over the following six years. We modelled this process with a dummy variable that indicates whether people had experienced job loss and a second variable that counts the number of years since job loss (which ranges from 0–6; 0 before job loss, 1 in the wave in which job loss is reported, 2 in the wave after that, etc., to 6). The <italic>ever lost job</italic> variable captured the supposed increase in distress after job loss and the number of <italic>years since job loss</italic> allowed for a levelling-off effect. This set-up proved to give an adequate and parsimonious reflection of the process of job loss (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0950017012460312">Appendix 1</xref> for details). Further sensitivity analyses are described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0950017012460312">Appendix 1</xref>. We tested our hypotheses by including interactions with educational level and characteristics of the lost job. As these variables are time constant the main effects drop out of the models. Interactions with <italic>ever lost job</italic> affect the overall size of the job loss shock and interactions with <italic>years since job loss</italic> affect how the effect of job loss changes over time.</p>
<p>Selection of unhealthy individuals into job loss poses a threat to studying the impact of job loss on psychological distress. Our design thwarts this threat in three ways: (1) we used fixed effects models, so the effects of job loss reflect inter-individual psychological distress changes; (2) we were able to control for the type of job loss. Job loss due to health reasons was an answer category offered to respondents in the BHPS, which may be more socially acceptable than dismissal or redundancy. We therefore feel that it is quite unlikely that people who lost their jobs due to health reasons said that they were dismissed or made redundant. Health selection may thus be less of a problem in this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0950017012460312">Burgard et al., 2007</xref>). Still, it is possible that employers choose less healthy individuals to fire. (3) We incorporated controls for change in physical health. The number of health problems reported and whether people were ill in the long term covers health selection.</p>
<p>In preliminary analyses, we noticed that psychological distress increases in the wave before job loss is reported. This suggests an anticipation effect of losing one’s job and measurement inaccuracy. We included a dummy variable to indicate the wave before job loss to avoid underestimating the effect of job loss on psychological distress. Results without this dummy variable do not differ substantially (results available upon request).</p>

<title>Descriptive</title>
<p>We observed 918 respondents who involuntarily lost their jobs, which is 17.2 per cent of the sample. We followed them for a maximum of six years following job loss. In the first year, 72 per cent had found a new job and 28 per cent had not. Of the men, 55 per cent found a job at an equal or higher prestige than the job they lost (44% in terms of relative income), so 17 per cent experienced downward mobility in terms of job prestige (28% for income). In the second year after job loss, about 84 per cent were re-employed, but more men were downwardly mobile. The percentage of people who were re-employed increased over time to 90 per cent, whereas the percentage of downwardly mobile men remained quite stable after the second year. For more details we refer to Table A3 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0950017012460312">Appendix 1</xref>.</p>

<title>The impact of job loss</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0950017012460312">Table 2</xref> presents the results of the fixed effects regression. The first model includes the dummy for <italic>ever lost job, years since job loss</italic> and a set of controls. The model shows that job loss increases psychological distress and that the effect of job loss wears off over time. Job loss increases psychological distress by 0.65 points (= 0.87 – 0.22 × 1). Time heals, as after about four years there is no longer an effect on psychological distress (= 0.87 − 0.22 × 4). The significant increase in psychological distress in the year before job loss suggests that people anticipate job loss. The control variables show expected patterns and have consistent effects across the models; they are not discussed further.</p>

<p>The second model investigates whether education buffers the effect of job loss on psychological distress. We interacted educational level with <italic>ever lost job</italic> and with <italic>years since job loss</italic> simultaneously, allowing for different trajectories by educational level. The <italic>ever lost job</italic> effect now indicates the effect for respondents with no qualifications and <italic>years since job loss</italic> captures the levelling off for men with no qualifications. The significant negative interaction effects of A-level and degree+ with <italic>ever lost job</italic> show that higher-educated men suffer less from job loss than those with lower levels of education. The lack of a significant interaction with <italic>years since job loss</italic> indicates that the speed at which the impact of job loss on psychological distress levels off does not differ significantly by educational level. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0950017012460312">Figure 2a</xref> illustrates these results graphically. It shows the predicted change in psychological distress due to job loss overall and by educational level (setting the control variables to the mean and deducting the predicted pre-job loss level of psychological distress). The dark line for the overall job loss crosses zero on the y-axis after about four years, so after that period there is no longer an increase in psychological distress compared to the situation before job loss. The wide spacing between the lines for each educational level shows that there is indeed much variation in the effect of job loss by educational level. It demonstrates that the effect of job loss is limited to men with no qualifications and men with some qualifications, as the lines for men with A-level and degree+ are close to zero throughout.</p>

<p>Previous research failed to take into account both characteristics of the job and the person who loses the job. Model 3 improves on that as it takes into account the social position of the lost job. In addition, two other factors that may shape the impact of job loss on psychological distress are investigated: dismissal versus redundancy, and age at time of job loss. Losing a well-regarded job appears to be especially bad compared to jobs held in less esteem; the effect of losing a job with one standard deviation more prestige is about 0.5 points worse. The effect of losing such a job levels off faster, but for the first four years (0.49 / 0.12 = 4) the effect of losing such a job is still higher. The relative pay of the lost job does not matter once job prestige is controlled for. The interaction with age is negative but not significant. The type of job loss, however, is important. As may be expected, men who were dismissed experience a 1.2 points higher increase in distress compared to men who were made redundant. Being dismissed can be considered as a more stressful experience than becoming redundant.</p>
<p>As expected, adding these interactions increases the buffering effects of educational level (compare the interaction effects of model 2 and 3). The buffering effect is more apparent now because we take into account the suppressor effects that the higher-educated tend to have better jobs and have therefore more to lose. In addition, they are less likely to be dismissed (see Table A4 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0950017012460312">Appendix 1</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0950017012460312">Figure 2b</xref> depicts the predicted job loss trajectories by educational level once we control for these effects (constructed similarly to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0950017012460312">Figure 2a</xref>). When we compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0950017012460312">Figures 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0950017012460312">2b</xref> it becomes clear that models that do no control for reason of job loss, age at time of job loss, and the social position of the lost job may show suppressed effects of educational level. This is evident as the lines between the educational levels are spaced wider apart in 2b compared to 2a.</p>
<p>Now we investigate reasons why educational level moderates the impact of job loss. We expect that higher-educated men experience less distress (in part) because they are less likely to experience negative employment outcomes after job loss. We show models that control for the post-job loss employment situation. We add interactions between being re-employed and job loss from model 4 onwards (non-employment is the reference category). We first focus on re-employment (model 4). We add interactions with downward mobility in terms of job prestige in model 5 and in terms of relative income position in model 6. These interactions may mediate the buffering effect of educational level.</p>
<p>In model 4, the main effect of ever losing a job increases because it now reflects the effect of becoming non-employed. The changed coefficient of the job loss effects and the interaction with re-employment show that men who become re-employed after job loss suffer much less from job loss than those who become non-employed. In the first year after job loss the re-employed suffer an increase in distress of about .5 points (3.99 − .40 − 3.32 + .27), which is significantly different from zero, <italic>F</italic>(1, 35122) = 2.74, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0981/2. The effect of job loss after three years for those who are non-employed in that year is an about 2.8 points higher level of psychological distress compared to pre-job loss (3.99 − .40 × 3 = 2.79), whereas for those who are re-employed in that year it is only about 0.3 points higher (3.99 − 3.32 + [−.40 + .27) × 3 = 0.28). This shows that the impact of job loss is mainly limited to people who become non-employed; they suffer most in terms of psychological distress. Note though that only a minority becomes non-employed after job loss and the number decreases over time; in the first year about 28 per cent is non-employed, which stabilizes to about 10 per cent after four years.</p>
<p>Controlling for re-employment clearly reduces the interaction term between educational level and job loss (compare models 3 and 4). This is in line with our expectation that higher education buffers the impact of job loss by shielding people from negative employment outcomes. In the first year of job loss 75 per cent is re-employed among those with A-levels, whereas only 64 per cent among those without qualifications. Re-employment increases over time, but the lesser educated remain more likely to become non-employed. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0950017012460312">Figure 3a</xref> shows the predicted impact of job loss by educational level based on model 4 (constructed similarly to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0950017012460312">Figure 2</xref>). The lines are crooked because the composition in terms of non-employed and re-employed men changes; the non-employed experience a larger increase in distress than the re-employed but, overall, fewer people are non-employed over time. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0950017012460312">Figure 3a</xref>, there is considerably less variation than in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0950017012460312">Figure 2b</xref>, which demonstrates that re-employment processes mediate the buffering effects of a higher educational level. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0950017012460312">Figure 3b</xref>, we show the predicted change in psychological distress by educational level and re-employment status simultaneously. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0950017012460312">Figure 3b</xref> clearly shows that those who become non-employed suffer more psychological distress, as the lines are well above those of the re-employed. This figure also shows that the long-term effects of job loss are limited to the non-employed.</p>

</fig>
<p>Note that controlling for re-employment diminishes the interaction of being dismissed with job loss (model 4 compared to model 3). This implies that men who were dismissed suffer more from job loss than men who become redundant in part because they have lower re-employment chances. Controlling for re-employment has the opposite effect for the interaction with age at time of job loss. Older men appear to suffer less from job loss once we control for re-employment. This could be because older men may have lower re-employment chances, but they may be less attached to the labour market so that job loss hurts less.</p>
<p>In model 5 and 6 we investigate these re-employment processes further by adding interactions with downward mobility (three-way interactions). Men who find a job with lower prestige – that is, who move down the social ladder – do not differ from those who find a job with similar or higher prestige (model 5). In model 6 we define downward mobility in terms of a drop in relative income (at least five points). Unlike a loss of job prestige, a drop in relative income appears to be important. The interactions are positive, so getting a job which pays less increases psychological distress. The significant interaction with years since job loss indicate that this disadvantage diminishes over time; after about four years the effect of having a lower paid job is no longer apparent (.78 / .18 = 4.3). Still, men who experience a drop in income are better off than those with no earned income (non-employed); compare 3.95 for the non-employed to 3.95 + (− 3.63 + .78) = 1.1 for the downwardly mobile. Note, however, that being downwardly mobile cannot fully compensate for the negative effect of job loss (1.1 is significantly different from 0, <italic>F</italic>[1,35120] = 6.5, <italic>p</italic> = .01). The interaction effects of educational level are again diminished but remain significant once we control for these compositional effects (compare model 6 with 4). This suggests that the buffering effect of education occurs in part because higher education helps people to find a new job and prevents downward mobility.</p>
<p>Next we test the alternative view that claims that the higher-educated suffer more from job loss, in particular in the long term. Non-employment after job loss would hurt the higher-educated more because of their higher aspirations. We tested this possibility using models in which we added interactions between re-employment and educational level, and models in which we also added interactions between downward mobility and educational level (see Table A5 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0950017012460312">Appendix 1</xref>). The results show that educational level does not consistently moderate the impact of re-employment or downward mobility. The lower and higher-educated appear to benefit in equal measure from being re-employed after job loss. The impact of downward mobility does not differ systematically by educational level either. In sum, there appear to be no systematic differences along educational lines in how the experience of re-employment, non-employment or downward mobility after job loss affects psychological distress.</p>

<title>Conclusion and discussion</title>
<p>This article investigated the impact of being dismissed or made redundant on men’s psychological distress. It brings together two lines of research – the literature on the relationship between job loss and unemployment with mental health, and the literature on socio-economic inequalities in health – by investigating to what extent the impact of job loss differs by educational level. We argued that higher-educated people will experience smaller increases in distress because they have more resources to deal with stress and negative employment transitions, and have better re-employment chances. For the longer term we formulated a competing expectation, namely that higher-educated people suffer more from job loss if they experience non-employment or downward mobility because they attach more value to work.</p>
<p>We tested our hypotheses on 5400 men of working age in the BHPS, of which 918 experienced job loss. We examined the impact on psychological distress during six years following job loss using fixed effects regression techniques. We find that job loss increases psychological distress. The impact is largest in the first year since job loss and decreases each year so that after about four years there is no longer an overall effect on psychological distress. As expected, higher-educated men experienced smaller increases in distress. Educational differences in the impact of job loss are largest shortly after job loss and diminish over time. So we do not find evidence for the idea that, in the long run, the higher-educated suffer more from job loss.</p>
<p>In a second step we investigated why educational level moderates the effect of job loss. As expected, we find that re-employment processes play an important role. Those who become non-employed suffer the most, followed by those who become downwardly mobile, and the successfully re-employed suffer the least. In the longer term the effect of job loss is driven by men who become non-employed and to a lesser extent by those who become downwardly mobile. These findings illustrate again the importance of re-employment following unemployment and job loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0950017012460312">Paul and Moser, 2009</xref>). As such the findings seem to support the traditional Jahoda perspective of positive functions of work (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0950017012460312">Cole, 2008</xref>, for a critical discussion of this strand of research). Once we incorporate information on transitions to non-employment and downward mobility the buffering effect of educational level decreases substantially, which suggests that education may shield people from negative labour market transitions after job loss.</p>
<p>Why do we find very strong effects in the short term but hardly any effects in the long term (i.e. five or six years)? It is unlikely that statistical power explains the lack of evidence for a long-term effect as the number of cases in the BHPS seems large enough. It is more likely that over time people ‘move on’: most of them find new jobs, few remain unemployed. In the longer term, the event of job loss is for most people only a small bump in the road, one that will be overcome. The long-term effects are limited to the relatively small group of people who may be unable to pick up their lives.</p>
<p>To what extent are individual health responses to job loss socially patterned? The BHPS allowed us to simultaneously investigate the buffering effects of educational level and job characteristics. This set-up allowed for some interesting findings. The higher-educated tend to have better jobs in terms of income and social status: therefore they may have more to lose from job loss. As expected, the buffering effect of education increased when we took characteristics of the lost job (job prestige and relative income) into account. This suggests that the benefits of education are not only tied to their higher occupational standing, but that education has independent buffering effects on psychological distress in case of job loss. Furthermore, men who lost higher status jobs experienced a more severe increase in psychological distress. Interestingly, losing a relatively well-paid job was not that important. This, again, could be interpreted as evidence for the importance of non-financial latent functions of work. For downward mobility, a decline in income increased distress whereas a drop in status did not. Perhaps having <italic>a</italic> job following job loss is most important for the status dimension, whereas the generated income is important because it mitigates financial strain caused by the job loss. These findings require further study and highlight the complexities that are introduced once variability in the impact of job loss becomes the subject of investigation.</p>
<p>By examining both personal and job characteristics we offered a novel way to study variability in the impact of job loss. This novel approach made it possible to present a more comprehensive picture of how job loss affects psychological distress. Moreover, it may help to shed light on previous research that showed mixed and conflicting findings on socio-economic differences in the impact of job loss/unemployment. Two opposing mechanisms may play a role: higher socio-economic groups have resources that can buffer the impact of job loss, but the loss of a job can also diminish these resources. Unless both mechanisms are modelled simultaneously, future findings may be hard to reconcile.</p>
<p>For the short term, we showed that job loss increases psychological distress even if we controlled for employment transitions. This illustrates the importance of looking at job loss as an event in addition to studying the effects of being unemployed or non-employed. These states are <italic>outcomes</italic> of job loss: a focus on unemployment therefore does not tell the whole story, especially not as educational level shapes re-employment chances following job loss. The dominant deprivation model for the effects of unemployment does not explicitly consider the event of losing a job as such. Our findings suggest that here lies a challenge for further research.</p>
<p>This research showed that the impact of job loss on psychological distress was much worse for the lower-educated than for the higher-educated. The higher re-employment chances of the higher-educated played an important role in this difference. The research also showed that having <italic>a</italic> job following job loss is better than having no job at all. This implies that re-employment programmes and social plans have potential to reduce the burden of lay-offs, especially for the lower-educated. It also has implications for our understanding of the social gradient in health. Part of the health gap between socio-economic groups, especially in cross-sections, can be attributed to differences in the occurrence and impact of negative life events. Although life course approaches have become more popular over the last 10 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0950017012460312">Bartley, 2004</xref>), job loss has hardly been studied in this context. The recent increase in job losses due to the financial crisis makes this an even more relevant issue for further research.</p>
<p>Finally, we need to discuss a number of limitations and possibilities for future research. We focused on the role of educational level and employment processes in the link between job loss and psychological distress. This overlooks many other important areas and determinants that may also shape the impact of job loss. One such area is that of social capital. It could well be envisaged that the impact of job loss is structured by people’s networks. Also, the networks of higher and lower-educated people differ, which would be interesting to investigate. Most importantly, future research should pay more attention to variability in the consequences of job loss and unemployment. Furthermore, there is a need to study the variability in the impact of negative events such as job loss with other relevant outcomes, such as physical health, and ‘softer’ outcomes such as self-esteem and loneliness. Finally, it would be interesting to replicate this type of analysis for other countries and, of course, it is high time to extend this research to women.</p>
