<abstract>
<p>The military benefits from fostering an “us-feeling” among its members. On what basis is this formed? Rooted in the discipline of religion, the following article explores how religion feeds into the selective conscription practices of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). Combining legal documents with data gathered through interviews with thirty-four soldiers in a combat battalion, it is argued that the IDF’s conscription practices are sensitive to the contents of religion. The IDF applies a multifarious concept of religion with significant impact on the IDF’s ability to foster a sense of “us.” The IDF recruits draftees on the basis of a twofold definition of Judaism, either as an ethnic group or as a theological concept. Both definitions help determine whether one is drafted. Interviews with soldiers expand on this definition, drawing attention to the integrative as well as disintegrative consequences of this notion of religion within the IDF.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Conscript armies rest their recruitment on the principle of obligation: will is an advantage but not a prerequisite. Individuals do not become part of a conscript army because they want to, but because they have to, and while not everyone <italic>can</italic> become a good soldier, not everyone is <italic>allowed</italic> to serve. Conscript armies therefore carefully assess and categorize potential manpower, drafting some while excluding others. These policies contribute to drawing a boundary between “us” and “them.” Still, like any community, the military benefits from fostering a certain “us-feeling” among its members. On what basis is the “us” formed? What integrates diverse conscripts into a larger whole?</p>
<p>Rooted in the discipline of religion, this article explores how religion feeds into the selective conscription practices of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). Cultural, religious, and ethnic factors create crucial lines of conflict at the regional level (Israel–Arab conflict), the local level (Israeli–Palestinian conflict), and the national level (secular–religious divide between Israel’s Jews). Incorporating religion into the analysis draws attention to how the military processes the challenge of creating a sense of unity among its selected recruits, while simultaneously creating the necessary boundaries between recruits and nonrecruits. The combination of written legal data and interview data on the IDF indicates that the IDF solves this puzzle in part by applying a multifarious concept of religion, which comes into play when the IDF selects and recruits its manpower. Religion is applied both as an ethnic marker, accentuating the IDF as a Jewish community, and as a theological concept, highlighting the different forms of Jewish practices within the military. These different definitions in turn have both integrative and disintegrative consequences on the IDF’s recruits. The IDF thus provides a revealing case in the analysis of both the form and the functions of religion within the context of military.</p>
<p>The irreconcilable conflict of interest between military command and the fulfillment of religious practices is receiving increasing attention among scholars. Studies focus on issues such as the attempt to find conscription mechanisms for religiously practicing men and women<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0095327X12449429">1</xref>
</sup>; the use of Zionist soldiers in combat units as a way to gain veto power<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0095327X12449429">2</xref>
</sup>; or, the changing role of the military’s rabbinical branch.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0095327X12449429">3</xref>
</sup> Yet, focusing on explicit religious forms overlooks the fact that religion extends far beyond explicit practices or normative theology. Religion is inherently social and incorporates a collective referential framework, cultural practices, and a unifying collective discourse. Religion is an important factor in societal integration and potentially strengthens the bonds between the individual and the society.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0095327X12449429">4</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Written IDF documentation is limited. Hence, the analysis uses a combination of legal documents and interview data. Notably, whereas the written documents indicate that religion is a significant variable for conscription, the interview data accentuate and expand this indication. The data reveal that the concept of religion is applied with reference both to ethnicity and to theology. Consequently, a “dual face of religion” is visible in the IDF. Thus, religion serves integrative functions by marking distinct external community boundaries between Jewish and minority communities and disintegrative functions by marking distinct internal boundaries that accentuate fault lines between different Jewish groups.</p>
<p>To develop this line of argument, this article is split into three parts. First, the official policy that regulates conscription into the IDF is clarified. This is done with particular reference to the concept of religion as applied at the institutional level. Second, analysis of the interview data draws attention to the consequences of the IDF’s religion policy on its ability to foster a sense of “us” among recruits. Third, this article concludes with a discussion of conscription and the effect of religion in constructing a military community.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0095327X12449429">
<title>Data</title>
<p>Official data on the IDF are highly limited. To compensate for data scarcity, this article triangulates oral and written data. The written data are comprised of the official documentation on conscription practices, published by the IDF and other official Israeli state agencies. These data are supplemented with thirty-four in-depth interviews with soldiers in the IDF’s 50th Battalion. Both forms of data are used because they acquire fuller meaning when combined: No legal framework is exhaustive nor can it detail all (formal and informal) conscription practices institutionalized throughout the years. Interview data are needed to grasp how legal principles are operationalized. Interview data thus add content to legal principles.</p>
<p>Informants were selected using theoretical<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0095327X12449429">5</xref>
</sup> criteria which strategically minimized differences between interview subjects in order to accentuate typical traits and enhance data coherence.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0095327X12449429">6</xref>
</sup> The selection of the 50th Battalion was based on three primary criteria. First, interviewees from this battalion served in the IDF during 2005–09. Second, they were primarily religiously nonpracticing recruits, representative of the majority of the IDF’s conscripts. Third, these soldiers passed through the same military training and served under the same conditions. This study, thus, primarily attempts to shed light on how nonpracticing religious recruits affect the military in contrast to previous studies which have focused on a minority of religiously observant recruits.</p>
<p>Semistructured and open-ended interviews (one-to-one and Focus Groups) took place over a period of four years (2006–09). The interviews focused on the soldiers’ sentiments toward the IDF’s mission, the cultural character of the IDF, the role of religion to soldiering, and attitudes and experiences regarding the state of Israel’s application of universal conscription. Unanswered or supplementing questions were discussed with interviewees either in follow-up face-to-face interviews or through e-mails, “chat rooms,” or social media. All interviewees were given the opportunity to add complementary comments or information.</p>

<title>Reflections on Method</title>
<p>Studying the military through the discipline of religion is unorthodox but nevertheless beneficial. Religion is a significant aspect of social life, and the social dimension is in turn an important part of religion. At the same time, religion is not limited or confined to specific areas of social life and may have an important impact on the military. Religion shapes people’s relationship with each other and how they look at the world. The military is not exempt from such relationships and perceptions.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0095327X12449429">7</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Scholars of religion, such as Jonathan Z. Smith, treat the core object of analysis as a generic term: “Religion is solely the creation of the scholar’s study. It is created for the scholar’s analytic purposes by his imaginative acts of comparison and generalization.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0095327X12449429">8</xref>
</sup> Definition is thus largely a function of research methodology. As a general rule, scholars of religion approach religion by focusing either on its function or its substance, or both. While a substantive analysis says something about what religion <italic>is,</italic> a functional analysis emphasizes “what religion does for the individual and social group. Accordingly, religion is defined by the social functions it fulfills.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0095327X12449429">9</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>This article applies a “classical” and explorative approach to the study of the role of religion within the military and therefore examines both the concept of religion as applied within the IDF and the consequences of the application of such a concept. Emphasizing the function of religion does not imply the idea that religion “as such” has agency, but rather that “the ascriptions to religion by social actors observed by scholars can, when analyzed with regard to their regularities, be said to function within models.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0095327X12449429">10</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>A crucial function of religion is its ability to integrate its followers into a larger community. Religion is thus a factor which contributes to social unity. This unity, however, comes at a price: it contributes to creating a boundary between “us” and “them,” defining some as outsiders and others as insiders. It follows that religion contains disintegrative features, as the creation of a community also implies creating boundaries. Yet, social integration is a double-edged sword. Thus, the importance of religion in serving as “an expression of a group’s unity also makes it significant as an expression of that group’s conflict with another group.” The military is a large institution, which attempts to integrate a large and heterogeneous population into a united whole. The symbols, values, and meaning system of the military must hence be wide—perhaps even vague—in order to seize to the entire membership of the group. Religion means different things to different people. For religious practitioners, religion has a distinct theological character and positive associations. Nonpractitioners, however, distance themselves from theology and may have negative associations with religion. The IDF thus defines “Judaism” in terms of theology and ethnicity, appealing both to the Jews who define themselves according to their religious practices and those who define themselves as merely belonging to an ethnic community.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0095327X12449429">
<title>IDF’s Legal Framework for Conscription</title>
<p>Needless to say, conscription is subject to a series of regulations. Several scholars have pointed out that conscription is becoming increasingly selective, a trend Israel shares with Western European countries.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0095327X12449429">11</xref>
</sup> Inherent to the IDF’s conscription practices are a number of built-in ambiguities. In addition to physical and mental readiness, the IDF screens draftees according to more fluid and overlapping criteria, such as ethnic affiliation and degree of religious observance.</p>
<p>As will be shown below, the IDF applies two different notions of religion in parallel. On one hand, religion is applied with reference to a community’s ethnic and cultural affiliation (religion as ethnicity). On the other hand, it is applied with reference to a narrower and more theological fundament (religion as theology). Whereas the former accentuates the distinction between Jewish and non-Jewish groups, the latter is applied to various religiously observing Jewish groups. The written documentation, thus, indicates that religion influences the IDF’s conscription framework based on a twofold definition of the concept of religion.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0095327X12449429">
<title>The Defense Service Law</title>
<p>The legal basis for the IDF as a conscript army is formed by the <italic>Defense Service Law</italic>, where it is stated that any “ordinary resident”—defined as “a person whose ordinary place of residence is within the territory in which the law of the State of Israel applies”—is in principle obliged to serve in the IDF.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0095327X12449429">12</xref>
</sup> The only legal exemptions from military service are either women who have children, are pregnant and/or married, or women who find military service contradictory to “reasons of conscience” or “reasons connected with her family’s religious way of life.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0095327X12449429">13</xref>
</sup> In addition, conscription is regulated by three supplementary screening factors, two of which are based on community affiliation with roots in religion: fitness, ethnicity, and religion.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0095327X12449429">14</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<sec id="section6-0095327X12449429">
<title>General Criteria: Fitness and Health</title>
<p>In order to establish mental and physical readiness for service in the IDF, potential recruits are taken through a so-called first notice, that is, the <italic>tsav rishon</italic>, a series of tests that gauge suitability and unit placement. Here, the IDF unilaterally screens the draftees according to two basic parameters: One is the physical “<italic>Profil,</italic>” which refers to a numeric medical profile of physical readiness.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0095327X12449429">15</xref>
</sup> The other is the <italic>Kaba</italic>, which measures intellectual potential and is comprised of an intelligence test and a personal interview, the latter being only for combat-destined men and women.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0095327X12449429">16</xref>
</sup> The combination of these two scores—the <italic>Profil</italic> and the <italic>Kaba</italic>—affects the conscript’s fate throughout most of his or her military career.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0095327X12449429">
<title>Religion as Ethnicity: The Case of Non-Jewish Groups</title>
<p>IDF’s conscription practices are highly sensitive to ethnic and religious affiliation, reflecting the degree to which cultural, religious, and ethnic pluralism affects the state of Israel on all fronts. To illustrate the heterogeneity of Israel’s population, Arabs make up 1.6 million of Israel’s total population of 7.7 million<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0095327X12449429">17</xref>
</sup>; over 80 percent of this group is Palestinian.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0095327X12449429">18</xref>
</sup> Among Israel’s Arabs, Muslims—including Bedouins—make up 82 percent, with around 9 percent Druze, and 9 percent Christians.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0095327X12449429">19</xref>
</sup> Still, while Israel’s population is composed of a series of highly different ethnic and religious groups, the demography of IDF’s 176,500<sup>20</sup> regular recruits does not reflect this mosaic.</p>
<p>A decisive policy dating back to Israel’s early years extends an exemption to non-Jewish Arab groups living in Israel within the “1967-borders.” This policy is ambiguous, since Bedouin, Circassian, and Druze men do serve in the IDF. In practice, therefore, the exemption applies to Arab Palestinians rather than specific ethnic or religious affiliations. The IDF argues that this exemption is shaped by the ongoing Israeli–Palestinian conflict and reflects concern for a blend of ethnic, moral, and security issues. Thus, the exempt are “a community [Palestinians] finding itself a minority in a country that they had not chosen—and one at war with neighbors of their own religious and ethnic persuasion—presented a potential security risk; even where this was not the case, Arabs [Palestinians] could hardly be expected to serve in situations where they would be required to fire on their own kin.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0095327X12449429">21</xref>
</sup> The estimated 5,000 Palestinians who do serve in the IDF are therefore not called up but have rather enlisted voluntarily.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0095327X12449429">22</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Both Druze (a non-Muslim Arab minority) and Circassians (a Sunni-Muslim minority) are subject to compulsory military service. The Druze have been subject to compulsory military service since 1956.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0095327X12449429">23</xref>
</sup> The Circassians joined the IDF during the 1948 war and have since 1958 been subject to compulsory service. Circassian men comprise the only Muslim group with compulsory IDF service, “making their structural position within Israel similar to that of the Druze minority.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0095327X12449429">24</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Still, the impact of these minorities on the character of the IDF is small: studies assert that although an estimated 85 percent of Druze men in Israel serve in the IDF, and although in 2007 there was a 10 percent increase in Israeli–Druze enlistees,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0095327X12449429">25</xref>
</sup> there are still less than 2,000 Druze in the IDF. The figures are even smaller when it comes to the Circassians: Although Circassian men are subject to the legal obligation of military service, they only comprise approximately 3,000 <italic>in total</italic> in Israel and the amount of enlistees is thus negligible.</p>
<p>In contrast to the Druze and the Circassians, the Bedouins are exempt from military service. At the same time, there is a long-standing Israeli government policy of encouraging Bedouins to volunteer by offering them various inducements. Bedouin communities tend to take the opportunities that military service offers, and an estimated 5–10 percent of the Bedouin population of draft age volunteer for the IDF. Nevertheless, the Bedouin population in Israel currently numbers 170,000 in total. Thus, although the Israeli government’s active promotion for voluntary army service for Israeli Arabs has paid off, the numbers are still small: Bedouin recruits are still estimated to make up less than 1 percent of the IDF’s draftees.</p>
<p>All three minorities view IDF service as a key to social mobility and a step stone into an Israeli society non-Jewish groups experience exclusion from,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0095327X12449429">26</xref>
</sup> which underscores the military’s role as a stepping-stone in civil society among impoverished. It should nevertheless be emphasized that Bedouin, Circassian, Druze, and Palestinian Arabs still comprise small minorities within the ranks of the IDF.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0095327X12449429">
<title>Religion as Theology: The Case of Jewish Groups</title>
<p>According to section 36(3) in the Defense Service Law, no Jewish groups are exempted from military service on the basis of religion. In other words, ultraorthodox men are not exempted by law from regular or reserve duty for “education, settlement, national economy, or family reasons” or other reasons. However, a special exemption from mandatory military service is nevertheless given to the ultraorthodox. In practice, the IDF has given the ultraorthodox groups the possibility to devote their lives to the fulfillment of Jewish religious commandments rather than to military service. Theology thus comes into play.</p>
<p>This exemption from the universal conscription is regulated through a temporary political arrangement called the Tal Law.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0095327X12449429">27</xref>
</sup> The Tal Law is legally based on the same section, which allows for the deferment of service by religious men attending Jewish academies (<italic>yeshivas</italic>). The Tal Law is applied to two groups: one is the group of young men engaged in religious studies who are not enlisted in the army as long as they study at the Jewish academies. This group is exempted from service. The other is a group of students at the Jewish academics who enlist in special units combining military service with religious studies. This group is given special arrangements within the army that allows them to focus on their theological studies. This group—the so-called <italic>Yeshivot Hesder</italic>
<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0095327X12449429">28</xref>
</sup>—is included in the fighting setup of the IDF.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the IDF considers the soldiers’ aspiration to exercise their Jewish religious duties to be of such significance that it qualifies for special arrangements in the military. Hence, for Jewish groups, religion is interpreted as a theologically defined concept.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0095327X12449429">
<title>From Macro Level to Micro Level: The Functions of Religion</title>
<p>Seen from the above, the IDF’s conscription practices are sensitive with reference to the contents of religion. The IDF recruits draftees on the basis of a twofold definition of Judaism: to be a Jew is either to belong to an ethnic community or to devote one’s life to Jewish religious commandments. Both definitions determine whether or not one is drafted. These definitions are in line with those of the state of Israel, where a Jew is defined either as one born of a Jewish mother, or as based on the civil criterion of an individual’s identification with Judaism.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0095327X12449429">29</xref>
</sup> When shifting the focus from legal practices on the macro level to the actor-oriented micro level, the ambiguity of religion becomes apparent. The interviews with the IDF soldiers did not only confirm the ambiguities of how the IDF defines and applies the concept of religion. Interviews also accentuated the consequences of the definition. The functions of religion could be inherently contradictory, and while “religion may arguably function to generate social cohesion, the activities of religions often point to disruptive effects.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0095327X12449429">30</xref>
</sup> Accordingly, interview data suggest that this “dual face of religion” is at work not merely between the Jewish community and other groups but also internally within the Jewish community. The explicit internal adaptations spurred by religion are examined in the following section.</p>
<sec id="section10-0095327X12449429">
<title>Religion as Integrative</title>
<p>In addition to confirming that religion is crucial in the IDF’s conscription practices, it  became apparent throughout the interviews that IDF policy had crucial impact on the creation of a sense of “us,” as opposed to “them.” Where “us” is defined in terms of “Jews who serve,” “them” is defined both as “non-Jews” and “those who do not serve.” The Jewish society in Israel is made up by the secular and the religious, observant and nonobservant. The majority claims that the relationship between the religious and the secular is not good (66 percent).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0095327X12449429">31</xref>
</sup> However, as the combat soldier Nadav said, “In the army, you discover that the difference between the secular and the religious is much smaller than you thought before. It is not so black and white.” In other words, serving in the army supersedes and reduces the crucial fault lines between different Jewish groups that exist in civil society.</p>
<p>Furthermore, interviews with secular soldiers demonstrated how the IDF’s overall accentuation of religion as ethnicity for conscription also has integrative consequences, since it contributes to stressing the cultural similarities that exist among Israeli Jews. Talal Asad, a noted anthropologist, has reiterated the important point that belonging to a tradition does not necessarily include theological pondering or engagement: “The selectivity with which people approach their tradition doesn’t necessarily undermine their claim to its integrity.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0095327X12449429">32</xref>
</sup> Hence, members of the 50th Battalion—first and foremost a secular group—accentuate their compliance with the IDF having a particularly strong Jewish cultural imprint. Religion and Judaism are, thus, first and foremost, community markers. To exemplify, “Tsvi,” a middle-class Ashkenazi Jew from Northern Tel Aviv, was asked what it meant to him that the IDF is not merely an Israeli army, but a <italic>Jewish</italic> army:<disp-quote>
<p>Everything. I am secular, but…It is what we do, you know. But I really wanted to. I am very proud of the army…Really. You know, we are Jews. So, taking religion away from the IDF…you can’t. You would take <italic>us </italic>away. It is not just a job, you know. […] But for us Jews it is more than that. For us it is a moral issue—it is a<italic> Jewish</italic> issue.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Tzvi’s answer is one among several similar examples that demonstrate how soldiers evoke Judaism as the core element in the construction of solidarity and identity in the IDF. Scholars of Judaism have repeatedly emphasized the diversity of Judaism, approaching it as the complex of distinctive customs and practices of the Jewish nation. As a consequence today, we can witness how “Jewishness,” “Israeliness,” and Judaism are inextricably linked.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0095327X12449429">33</xref>
</sup> Judaism entails a dual reference, and has both a religious and an ethnic “dimension.” Accordingly, “Although all who practice and affirm Judaism are Jews, not all Jews affirm(ed) and practice(d) Judaism.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0095327X12449429">34</xref>
</sup> It is hence a weighty and effective community boundary marker, which allows for wide internal variations based on a limited set of culturally constituted “variables,” wherein the Biblical scriptures serve as an ethnic marker that unites both secular and religious groups of the population with a common cultural heritage.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0095327X12449429">35</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Consequently, the secular soldiers in the 50th Battalion drew, on one hand, a clear distinction between the religious and the nonreligious. At the same time, they considered the practitioners as the ones who preserve the essence of Judaism and also the ideas constitutive of the collective “Us.” As explained in a Focus Group:<disp-quote>
<p>They have had a tremendous role in preserving our culture up through a tough history. They have made us not forget, to be Jews, not like everyone else. Personally, I don’t do all the rituals. But I want the religious [Jews] to feel welcome. […] Many times I don’t agree in the whole God-stuff. But they [the religious] are important for remembering who we are. You know; it is they who are actually practicing something that we all are in debt to, you know. They have brought our culture forwards. They have had a tremendous role in preserving our culture up through a tough history. They have made us not forget, to be Jews, not like everyone else.</p>

<p>Being part of a religious community is not necessarily about faith or theology; it is also a matter of culture and tradition. As explained by “Yaron,”<disp-quote>
<p>We are Jewish in the IDF. That can be many things. But it is not just about soldiering. I learned a lot about who I am and what it means to be Jewish while being in the army. It gets under your skin, it really does, it—it is to be Jewish…I can’t really explain it…</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Thus, juxtaposing “Jewish” or “Judaism” in the Israeli context may inevitably lead to problems of definition; these terms are multireferential, ambiguous, overlapping, and at times even contradictory. Whereas Judaism is a religious category with particular practices and commandments, “Jewish” is an ethnic category with reference to a specific group membership. In other words, inherent to these categories is the ambiguity of ethnic and theological affiliation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0095327X12449429">36</xref>
</sup> Nevertheless, whereas these quandaries lead to internal collisions, they still contribute to creating a macroseparation boundary between “the Jewish” and “the non-Jewish” in Israel.</p>

<title>Religion as Disintegrative</title>
<p>Conscript armies not only serve military purposes; in most contexts “conscription is legitimated with reference to its virtues in constructing community.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0095327X12449429">37</xref>
</sup> The IDF is no exception. Taking great pride in being a conscript “People’s Army”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0095327X12449429">38</xref>
</sup> the IDF has a significant nation-building and immigrant-absorbing role.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0095327X12449429">39</xref>
</sup> Yet, despite the integrative consequences embedded in the principle of universal conscription, accommodation of religious demands carry with them a multiplicity of religious laws and practices with disintegrative effects. Integrating “the people” is complex and challenging. Religious practices, intrinsically tied to Judaism’s 613 commandments, make adherence to Jewish law a <italic>way of life</italic>. Integrating religiously observant groups complicates implementation. Accordingly, the IDF organization allows for and regulates military action in coordination with religious praxis. As a consequence, religion has explicit disintegrative consequences among different Jewish groups recruited into the IDF.</p>
<p>Commenting on recruitment into the IDF, “Haim”—a combat-soldier who fought in the Second Lebanon War in 2006 and the Operation Cast Lead in Gaza in 2008–09—made the following statement:<disp-quote>
<p>If you’re religious […] you have a weird face, and they won’t take you. Or not necessarily. It depends. They try to, though—they stretch quite far. With me who just listen to the iPod on Shabbat and don’t do all that ritual stuff—with me it was more, well, a command. Not much stretching, to put it that way, he he.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>“Haim”’s statement refers to two types of conscription criteria: fitness and religion. All armies must set minimum standards for their manpower’s mental and physical fitness. Many of these standards are measurable and thus based on apparently “objective” criteria. With the<italic> Kaba</italic> and <italic>Profil</italic> the IDF applies such criteria to differ between fit and unfit for service. Nevertheless, these categories are in practice subject to fluctuations in socioeconomic class, individual motivation, and religious observance. In addition, mental health fitness requirements may be fluid because they are often viewed as a pattern of bargaining rather than an objective condition.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0095327X12449429">40</xref>
</sup> With regard to the judgment made on the basis of the combination of the <italic>Kaba </italic>and the physical <italic>Profil</italic>, it is noteworthy that the ultraorthodox groups in Israel are generally of poorer physical and mental health than the secular middle class with respect to fitness for military service.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0095327X12449429">41</xref>
</sup> Thus, there is more than a spurious link between religion and physical health: those who practice religion tend to be of poorer physical health than secular soldiers.</p>
<p>More importantly, “Haim” draws a distinct line between the religiously observant and the secular. Undoubtedly, the integration of religiously observant Jewish groups required different adaptations than the integration of secular recruits. The setup of the IDF reflects Ben-Gurion’s credo, namely, that both religious and secular citizens had equal civil obligations: “the entire IDF framework had to be structured in ways which would not alienate religiously observant troops by requiring them to contravene the dictates of traditional Jewish law.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0095327X12449429">42</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>As a prolongation of this argument, the interviews also demonstrated how the soldiers associate the IDF’s principle of universal conscription with two other aspects: burden-sharing and a collective Jewish identity. The degree to which burden-sharing and “us as Jewish” are seen as intertwined with military conscription implies a balancing act between integration and disintegration. Conscript armies rest their recruitment on the support of the civil population, whereby a civil–military “contract” allows governments to demonstrate their immense power by imposing military service.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0095327X12449429">43</xref>
</sup> Using rational choice theory, scholars argue that “the fate of conscription” rests on “how legitimate it is understood to be.” The legitimacy of compulsory conscription rests on the populations’ consent, the <italic>fairness</italic> of selection, and “how enchanting the myths about it are.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0095327X12449429">44</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The exemption granted to the ultraorthodox represent a potential deathblow to the IDF’s attempt to create a sense of “us” among its conscripts. Conscription compliance was discussed in a focus group with combat soldiers, who were completing their military service after having participated in both the 2006 Second Lebanon War and 2008–09 Operation Cast Lead. The following statement by one member of the group received applause:<disp-quote>
<p>Listen. We respect the religious people. They do a lot of good stuff for all of us. But the fact that some of them don’t serve in the Tsahal—I mean…give me a break! I deeply, intensely and sincerely oppose that arrangement. I cannot agree. I simply cannot. Don’t you see?? Here I am, cannon fodder for millions of Arabs who want to kill me. And then…I don’t agree with the ultra-orthodox who don’t do service. We should <italic>all </italic>contribute! I mean, we risk our lives to defend them! Shouldn’t they also do the same for us? Are their lives worth more than ours? We’re all Jews and in this together! This is what we Jews do.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A similar disintegrative effect among Jewish recruits is caused by the orthodox settlers: orthodox settlers are drafted but also live in the Occupied Territories, due to their religious conviction. Needless to say, the settlements have critical impact on the military service of IDF soldiers. Whereas Arab groups all constitute an unequivocal other, the settlers—being Jewish—are part of the same “us” as the soldiers. Identity is constructed in opposition. There is no inherent meaning in the term “us.” It appears through a process of contrasting group characteristics. The soldiers’ taxonomy is thus jeopardized by the settlers, as it questions who constitutes the “we.” Accordingly, in the case of the settlers, soldiers are faced with a potential “us versus us-friction.” Whereas the Palestinians belong to an undifferentiated “them,” the settlers appear much more difficult to categorize to the secular recruits of the IDF’s 50th Battalion. Accordingly, the interviewees expose ambivalent sentiments toward the settlers. Yitzhak elaborated on the relationship between the secular soldiers and the settlers:<disp-quote>
<p>[silence]. Well…it [the relationship] is not really so good, you know. You do your job and then…They are so…They belong to us, but what they do is so…I mean, we…It is Jew against Jew, and it doesn’t really match…They are there because of religion, but…</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Different religious aspirations also impact and accentuate the specific military unit identities. “Shlomi” explains in line with the above:<disp-quote>
<p>For the most part I would say that when people go to the drafting centre—unless they are ultra-orthodox and have either gotten an exemption or are someone dodging the service in another way or you express yourself in ways so that the IDF doesn’t want you there—then you are sent to where the service needs people. And in general, you can end up anywhere. Yet, we all know that it isn’t necessarily so—that we’re placed with likeminded.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>“Shlomi’s” statement is based on the assumption that all are in principle placed where the army needs personnel. Still, he lists a number of ideologically, culturally, and religiously founded criteria that are key to where one actually ends up serving. Despite Ben-Gurion’s rejection of allowing religious recruits to serve in separate units, there is today a firm practice of allowing just this. One is the so-called <italic>Yeshivot Hesder</italic>, literally translated “Talmud Academy Arrangement,” which carries the connotation of a compromise between the IDF and the national–religious community. This practice allows recruits to combine military service with Talmud studies. A similar alternative is the<italic> Shiluv</italic>, litt. “combination,” initiated by the religious kibbutz movement.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0095327X12449429">45</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The 50th Battalion, to whom the interviewees in this article belong, is another example. Conscription into the 50th Battalion is somewhat unusual. There are two recruitment methods. First,<italic> Gibush</italic>, a two-day military trial period prior to so-called first notice, that is, the <italic>tsav rishon</italic>, and involves various physical, mental, and sociometric challenges. The Gibush is for youth from the ideological, agricultural settlements (kibbutzes and moshavs). Second, the <italic>Garinin</italic> (pl.; literally means “seeds”) which includes “member cells” within a larger youth movement and youth groups with strong bonds between the members. Once recruited into the 50th Battalion, soldiers generally serve longer than the thirty-six months by legal obligation because they combine military service with various civil education service or community work.</p>
<p>In addition to accentuating the unit identity, another crucial consequence of the policy of placing likeminded recruits in similar units is the extent to which it affects how the soldiers view the other units and battalions. Like “Rami,” the 50th Battalion said: “I wanted to be part of something that I would fit in to.” Serving together with likeminded soldiers contributes to maintaining fault lines between different Jewish groups also inside of the military.</p>
<sec id="section12-0095327X12449429">
<title>Deviations: Non-Jewish Groups in the IDF</title>
<p>As mentioned above, ethnicity is not merely an identity marker. It also highlights overall, religious demarcation lines. The crucial boundary is created between Jewish–Israelis and “everyone else,” reflecting that in order to provide fertile soil for forging a “we,” the military “must conscript a large number of people who are committed to the collectivity’s goals […] Thus, the service must be universal, compulsory, and at the same time semi-voluntary.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0095327X12449429">46</xref>
</sup> Several scholarly works—as well as IDF Personnel—have argued against this intrinsic <italic>Jewishness </italic>of the IDF. Lt. Col. (Res.) Louis Williams, for example, addressed this issue: “It might be natural to assume that the IDF is, by definition, an exclusively Jewish army. However, the army does number among its ranks representatives of the minority communities—some as conscripts and other as volunteers, both in the standing and regular echelons.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0095327X12449429">47</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Williams is correct when he claims that the IDF is not merely an institution for Jews; seen above, the IDF drafts several non-Jewish minorities. There is, however, little doubt that culture of these units has little impact on the identity of the IDF, and that conscription of these groups is conditional. “David,” a 24-year-old interpreter in the IDF, fluent in Arabic, French, and English, was asked to what extent the IDF is a mixed-up Jewish Army and not merely an Israeli army. His explanation follows:<disp-quote>
<p>There is no doubt about it—I mean, that the IDF is not just any mix, but a <italic>Jewish</italic> mix. None. (Long pause). Although, you know, there is a little asterisk: the Druze units—they have their own rules in terms of Shabbat, dietary thing, so…there are Bedouins who come in the army with their tractors and everything, so each unit will be subject to its own regulations to its reasonable extent. Like—in Haifa bus run on Saturday, in Jerusalem that wouldn’t work. So there are variations. But <italic>within reason</italic>. The concept is that there shouldn’t be more variation than to keep the Jewish identity of the state. And the moment the Druze or the Bedouins or whoever don’t accept that—trust me, they’re out.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Today, IDF’s minority groups tend to serve in separate units. A “Minorities Unit”—the so-called 300 Brigade established already in 1948, consists mainly of Druze, a limited number of Circassians and some Bedouins. The IDF also put together the <italic>Trackers Unit</italic>—made up primarily by Bedouins but also with some Druze—on the basis of their alleged “familiarity with the terrain to play a key role in border patrols.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0095327X12449429">48</xref>
</sup> Today, the Druze serve in the <italic>Herev</italic> Infantry Battalion, which is a ground force battalion in the regular forces of the IDF. The battalion was established in 1974, following a decision to integrate all minority units under one command.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0095327X12449429">49</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>This accentuates and maintains the IDF’s “Jewish character, operating out of moral obligation to the historical traditions of the Nation of Israel, and in accordance with her spirit.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0095327X12449429">50</xref>
</sup> Bruce Lincoln employs a polythetic and flexible delimitation of the research object, including four <italic>domains </italic>that indicate the potentially all-encompassing or pervasive attributes of religion: (1) discourse, (2) a set of practices, (3) a community, and (4) an institution.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0095327X12449429">51</xref>
</sup> If we apply Lincoln’s model of religion, there is little doubt that Judaism is fused into the institution of the IDF, not merely as an ethnic indicator but also with reference to “traditional” religion: it is emblematically represented by a tripartite symbol comprised by a sword and an olive branch in the middle of the Star of David, which points to the army’s responsibilities for both martial action and provisions of peace, while at the same time signifying how the IDF is representative of the Israeli–Jewish religion and culture. Furthermore, Judaism is upheld by the Military Rabbinate, which provides <italic>all </italic>units with religious and spiritual guidance. Its tasks are among others to “enhance the spiritual &amp; ethical force of the IDF units and commanders by direct involvement in all military activity; to form a common military environment with a Jewish identity and respond to the religious needs of every soldier and commander; to be a unifying factor between the varied populations of the IDF.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0095327X12449429">52</xref>
</sup> With reference to practices within the institution, it is noticeable that the IDF follows the Jewish orthodox calendar. It also celebrates all Jewish religious holidays, not merely those of secular and national character.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0095327X12449429">53</xref>
</sup> The IDF thus provides many indications that religion is a qualifying factor in the construction and maintenance of the military.</p>
<p>The IDF acknowledges and rewards their Bedouin soldiers, and regularly present them as an emblematic example of religious and ethnic pluralism.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0095327X12449429">54</xref>
</sup> Yet, this unanimous identity of the IDF accentuates the alienation of the minorities. For example, in addition to the simple fact that Hebrew is the preferred language, which provides de facto preference to Israeli Jews, the alienation of Bedouins within the IDF is reflected in the announcement of the IDF Spokesperson’s Unit that Bedouins were given an additional day of education about “the history and heritage of Jewish combat in order to connect the soldiers to the land they defend, especially because, unlike most IDF solders, they are not Jewish and are not obligated to serve.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0095327X12449429">55</xref>
</sup> The cultural boundaries between the Jewish majority and other minorities also finds expression through repeated claims of uneven treatment, such as Druze claims that they are prevented from climbing the ranks in contrast to their Jewish colleagues.<sup>

<title>Concluding Remarks</title>
<p>Conscription into the IDF is complex and multifarious, as it is relative to a number of fluid and contextually contingent forms of categorization. The combination of both written and oral data indicates that religion offers an encompassing and pervasive framework that allows the IDF to foster a sense of “us” in complex sociopolitical environs.</p>
<p>Conscript armies are in a peculiar situation, being part of—yet, distinct from—civil society.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0095327X12449429">57</xref>
</sup> The IDF is sensitive to its sociocultural setting but operates in unruly environs. Nevertheless, the IDF is required to perform its wide variety of tasks. Jacob Neusner et al. stress a crucial point when they assert that how institutions and communities legislate and create boundaries “concerning the outsider—that other who falls beyond the social world that reaches expression within the system—reveals the system’s deepest convictions about itself.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0095327X12449429">58</xref>
</sup> The question concerning who is drafted and who is not ought therefore to be seen in relation not only to the physical abilities of the potential soldier but also to the degree of consistency between the drafted soldiers’ worldviews and the overall “meaning system” that the military conveys.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-0095327X12449429">59</xref>
</sup> Anthony P. Cohen argues that communities rest upon a shared meaning system, defining both its collective unity, individual differences and its external boundaries. He writes that a<disp-quote>
<p>
<italic>range</italic> of meanings can be glossed over in a commonly accepted symbol—precisely because it allows its adherents to attach their own meanings to it. They share the symbol, but do not necessarily share its meanings. Community is just such a boundary-expressing symbol. As a symbol, it is held in common by its members; but its meaning varies with its members’ unique orientations to it.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-0095327X12449429">60</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In other words, a community is based on the members’ sense of belonging. This argument has two consequences. First, members must experience that they belong. Second, conversely, those who do not have that feeling are also not wanted by the community’s establishment. The consequence is that cultural systems and mechanisms act as instruments for mobilization and loyalty, excluding those whom they identify as outsiders “while simultaneously establishing their own internal hierarchy, based on varying degrees of adherence to those values that define the group and its members.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-0095327X12449429">61</xref>
</sup> Thus, the combination of religion, community, and a shared meaning system make up a particularly strong boundary construction process.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-0095327X12449429">62</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>This article departed from the problem of forging a sense of “us,” which enables cohesion, by adopting an approach based in the study of religion. Religion is thus identified as a significant factor in the IDF’s conscription practices, which has a crucial impact on the IDF’s ability to develop the “us” feeling that the military necessitates among its recruits. In other words, Judaism integrates separate members into a larger whole within the IDF.</p>
<p>Conscription into the IDF is relative to a number of fluid and contextually contingent categories. On a macro level, the IDF’s conscription practices are sensitive to the contents of religion: the IDF recruits draftees on the basis of a twofold definition of Judaism. Both ethnic and religious definitions determine whether or not one is drafted. At the micro level, interviews revealed that soldiers not only confirmed but expanded on the concept of religion as applied by the IDF at the institutional level. The soldiers also emphasized the consequences of this view of religion.</p>
<p>Thus, religion is both an analytically determining factor and an empirically ambiguous factor. Religion, as an analytical category, entails functions that are potentially integrative and disintegrative, while as an empirical category religion ambiguously refers to degree of religious observance, ethnicity, and culture. The IDF navigates a complex sociocultural environment, as it attempts to foster the sense of “us.” Religion provides one analytically determining factor that assists the IDF in this navigation. Thus, religion remains a crucial factor for the IDF’s conscription practices and continues to take precedence over any other social or cultural factor in the Jewish community.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-0095327X12449429">63</xref>
</sup> Now, we can perhaps start to understand how an IDF officer explained what he saw as the crucial identity of the IDF soldier:<disp-quote>
<p>Soldiers in the<italic> Tsahal</italic> [Israel Defense Forces] are just as much Israeli as a result of the military. But, then again, the military is Israeli…Or, I mean, it is not just Israeli as in citizenship-Israeli. It is, after all, <italic>Jewish</italic>. Well, yeah. <italic>Tsahal</italic> soldiers represent the truly Jewish. First and foremost.</p>

In September 2009, the law was again up for discussion but was eventually extended for another fifteen months, after a lengthy tug-of-war in the Israeli Cabinet and High Court of Justice.
