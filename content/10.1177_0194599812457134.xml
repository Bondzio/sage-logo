<p>The “Cochrane Corner” is a quarterly section in the Journal that highlights systematic reviews relevant to otolaryngology–head and neck surgery, with invited commentary to aid clinical decision making. This installment features a Cochrane review “Modifications of the Epley (Canalith Repositioning) Manoeuvre for Posterior Canal Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV)” that finds no evidence of benefit for mastoid oscillation applied during the Epley maneuver nor any clinically important benefit for post-Epley postural restrictions in comparison with the Epley maneuver alone.</p>

<p>Of the more than 5 million annual office visits in the United States for a primary complaint of dizziness, between 17% and 42% of patients are ultimately diagnosed with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599812457134">1</xref></sup> Although BPPV may affect either the posterior or the lateral semicircular canal, up to 95% of cases are posterior canal BPPV as diagnosed by the Dix-Hallpike test. Whereas the Epley (canalith repositioning) maneuver is effective for treating BPPV, modifications have been proposed that include mastoid oscillation, post-Epley vestibular exercises, and post-Epley postural restrictions. The Cochrane review highlighted in this discussion summarizes data from 11 trials involving 855 participants to determine the impact of these modifications on patient outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812457134">2</xref></sup></p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a syndrome characterized by short-lived episodes of vertigo associated with rapid changes in head position. It is a common cause of vertigo presenting to primary care and specialist otolaryngology (ENT) clinics. BPPV of the posterior canal is a specific type of BPPV for which the Epley (canalith repositioning) manoeuvre is a verified treatment. A range of modifications of the Epley manoeuvre are used in clinical practice, including post-Epley vestibular exercises and post-Epley postural restrictions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0194599812457134">
<title>Objectives</title>
<p>To assess whether the various modifications of the Epley manoeuvre for posterior canal BPPV enhance its efficacy in clinical practice.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0194599812457134">
<title>Search Methods</title>
<p>We searched the Cochrane ENT Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 15 December 2011.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0194599812457134">
<title>Selection Criteria</title>
<p>Randomized controlled trials of modifications of the Epley manoeuvre versus a standard Epley manoeuvre as a control in adults with posterior canal BPPV diagnosed with a positive Dix-Hallpike test. Specific modifications sought were: application of vibration/oscillation to the mastoid region, vestibular rehabilitation exercises, additional steps in the Epley manoeuvre and post-treatment instructions relating to movement restriction.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0194599812457134">
<title>Data Collection and Analysis</title>
<p>Two authors independently selected studies from the search results and the third author reviewed and resolved any disagreement. Two authors independently extracted data from the studies using standardized data forms. All authors independently assessed the trials for risk of bias.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0194599812457134">
<title>Main Results</title>
<p>The review includes 11 trials involving 855 participants. A total of nine studies used post-Epley postural restrictions as their modification of the Epley manoeuvre. There was no evidence of a difference in the results for post-treatment vertigo intensity or subjective assessment of improvement in individual or pooled data. All nine trials included the conversion of a positive to a negative Dix-Hallpike test as an outcome measure. Pooled data identified a significant difference from the addition of postural restrictions in the frequency of Dix-Hallpike conversion when compared to the Epley manoeuvre alone. In the experimental group 88.7% (220 out of 248) patients versus 78.2% (219 out of 280) in the control group converted from a positive to negative Dix-Hallpike test (risk ratio (RR) 1.13, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05 to 1.22, P = 0.002). No serious adverse effects were reported, however three studies reported minor complications such as neck stiffness, horizontal BPPV, dizziness and disequilibrium in some patients.</p>
<p>There was no evidence of benefit of mastoid oscillation applied during the Epley manoeuvre, or of additional steps in the Epley manoeuvre. No adverse effects were reported.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0194599812457134">
<title>Authors’ Conclusions</title>
<p>There is evidence supporting a statistically significant effect of post-Epley postural restrictions in comparison to the Epley manoeuvre alone. However, it important to note that this statistically significant effect only highlights a small improvement in treatment efficacy. An Epley manoeuvre alone is effective in just under 80% of patients with typical BPPV. The additional intervention of postural restrictions has a number needed to treat (NNT) of 10. The addition of postural restrictions does not expose the majority of patients to risk of harm, does not pose a major inconvenience, and can be routinely discussed and advised. Specific patients who experience discomfort due to wearing a cervical collar and inconvenience in sleeping upright may be treated with the Epley manoeuvre alone and still expect to be cured in most instances.</p>
<p>There is insufficient evidence to support the routine application of mastoid oscillation during the Epley manoeuvre, or additional steps in an ‘augmented’ Epley manoeuvre. Neither treatment is associated with adverse outcomes. Further studies should employ a rigorous randomization technique, blinded outcome assessment, a post-treatment Dix-Hallpike test as an outcome measure and longer-term follow-up of patients.</p>

<title>Comments on Cochrane Review</title>

<title>Comments by Eby</title>
<p>This is the fifth systematic review published in the Cochrane Library on the efficacy of the Epley maneuver for BPPV. For most otolaryngologists, it will reaffirm that what they do in clinical practice has a valid scientific basis. After the simple treatment of canalith repositioning became widely popular, the initial Cochrane report in 2002 gave limited support for it, concluding there was some support for it as a safe and effective treatment for posterior canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812457134">3</xref></sup> In that study, only 2 of 11 randomized trials were used because of the high risk of bias in the others. Since then, Cochrane reviews have added more support to the Epley maneuver with analysis of more randomized trials.</p>
<p>This is the first review focusing on modifications of the Epley maneuver, including postural restrictions, which are commonly recommended, and on using mastoid oscillation, which is uncommon. Concluding that postural restrictions improve outcomes slightly compared with the Epley maneuver alone conforms to clinical experience (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0194599812457134"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>). Conversely, that there is insufficient evidence for routine use of mastoid oscillation does not preclude the possibility that it may benefit some patients.</p>

<caption><p>Forest plot of randomized controlled trials comparing the Epley maneuver (canalith repositioning) for posterior canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo with (treatment) and without (control) post-Epley postural restrictions. Success is defined as Dix-Hallpike conversion from positive to negative. Individual study results are expressed as the risk (rate) difference, with a horizontal line showing the 95% confidence limits and a black box for the point estimate. The overall random effects estimate (black diamond at bottom) of 0.078 indicates an absolute increase in the success rate of 7.8% attributable to the intervention. Data adapted from Hunt and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812457134">2</xref></sup> and reanalyzed using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis Version 2.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812457134">4</xref></sup></p></caption>

</fig>
<p>As mentioned in the review, the favored understanding of the pathophysiology in BPPV is canalithiasis, or floating debris in the membranous posterior canal. The Epley maneuver, therefore, helps to move this debris away from the posterior canal cupula. There may be some cases of cupulolithiasis in which the debris is attached to the cupula, as originally described by Schucknecht.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599812457134">5</xref></sup> These cases may be refractory to treatment and benefit from addition of mastoid oscillation, at least on a theoretical basis.</p>
<p>As with other Cochrane reviews, the rigorous scrutiny of the existing clinical data leaves us reassured about the validity of the conclusions but also leaves other questions unanswered. This review does address BPPV involving the horizontal semicircular canal and alternative treatment methods, but does not address interventions other than the Epley maneuver. A clinical practice guideline, however, has been published that offers a much broader evaluation of existing evidence on managing BPPV.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599812457134">1</xref></sup> Although the Epley maneuver was found most effective, the Semont maneuver was also considered of benefit. In contrast, Brandt-Daroff exercises were not recommended.</p>
<p>The successful resolution of BPPV with no treatment except observation in 35% to 50% of patients indicates the rate of spontaneous recovery as part of the natural history of this condition. There are also guidelines for assessing and treating horizontal canal BPPV. As clearly stated in the guideline,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599812457134">1</xref></sup> the evidence for some of the recommendations and especially the options is not strong. Interestingly, the BPPV guideline did not support adding postprocedure postural restrictions, a conclusion that is challenged by this Cochrane review. The use of a mastoid oscillator was not discussed in the Academy guideline.</p>
<p>Even with the accumulation of evidence supporting the use of the Epley maneuver, there will be further questions to answer with well-designed clinical trials. Suitable topics for future research have been published,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599812457134">1</xref></sup> and this Cochrane review suggests rigorous adherence to research methods to ensure the validity of the results. While we await the outcomes of these studies, most practitioners will be reassured that current practice has a solid foundation in clinical evidence.</p>

<title>Comments by Burton</title>
<p>The original Epley maneuver review<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812457134">3</xref></sup> in the Cochrane Library and this second review looking at modifications,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812457134">2</xref></sup> the abstract of which appears above, occupy an interesting place in the history of the Cochrane Ear, Nose &amp; Throat Disorders Group portfolio of reviews.</p>
<p>In 2011, the editorial base of the group received funding from the United Kingdom’s National Institute for Health Research as part of a Cochrane Engagement Award. The purpose of the particular grant was to investigate barriers to the use of Cochrane reviews by a variety of users, including primary care physicians (general practitioners [GPs]). In the United Kingdom, the vast majority of patients who experience BPPV are seen initially (and sometimes solely) by their GPs. As we know, BPPV is common, so the diagnosis is usually made initially by these physicians, and many will be prepared to undertake something as noninvasive as an Epley maneuver.</p>
<p>However, our research identified 2 barriers to GPs treating BPPV in this way; many were uncertain how to perform the Dix-Hallpike positional test to make the diagnosis, and many were equally uncertain how to carry out the Epley maneuver. GPs reading the Cochrane review therefore felt unable to apply the results in their daily practice.</p>
<p>To facilitate this, and making use of the unique ability to update Cochrane reviews because of their electronic format, we included in the 2 reviews links to 2 new video clips, created by the reviews’ author, demonstrating both the positional test<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599812457134">6</xref></sup> and the maneuver.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599812457134">7</xref></sup> We plan to evaluate whether this has improved the usability of these Cochrane reviews.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the same project found that GPs would be more inclined to recommend another intervention demonstrated to be effective in a Cochrane review (saline irrigation for chronic sinusitis)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599812457134">8</xref></sup> if the review had contained more detailed information about the exact composition and method of administration of the saline. We are now working with the authors of that review to make the necessary adjustments to improve its applicability.</p>

<title>Comments by Rosenfeld</title>
<p>A quick glance at the Forest plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0194599812457134"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref> shows a statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> = .048) benefit for post-Epley postural restrictions, which might lead an astute reader to question the following conclusion by the review authors: “There is insufficient evidence to either recommend or refute the benefit of associated mastoid region oscillation or additional steps in the Epley maneuver for BPPV.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812457134">2</xref></sup> For mastoid oscillation, there were only 2 randomized trials that, individually, and in aggregate, showed no benefits. But how can we dismiss the significant benefit of postural restrictions in the 9 trials pooled in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0194599812457134"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>?</p>
<p>The simple answer is that despite 9 randomized trials, our confidence in the evidence is limited by heterogeneity, low precision, and a small effect size. The absolute risk difference of 7.8% means that roughly 12 patients would need to be treated (NNT) with postural restrictions to have 1 additional successful outcome beyond the control group. Moreover, the 95% confidence limits for the risk difference range from 1% to 15.6%, meaning that trivial or negligible differences cannot be excluded, even if the interval does not contain unity (eg, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05).</p>
<p>Most importantly, the variations in study quality (risk of bias) and the specific type of post-Epley postural restrictions used (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0194599812457134"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>) make it difficult to draw conclusions about which restrictions, if any, are truly beneficial. One might further wonder if the review authors were justified in combining these trials at all. Not lying on the affected ear and sleeping upright for a few days may seem prudent, but without confidence in the benefits that accrue, why subject patients to the attendant reduced quality of life? Ditto for cervical collars, avoiding sudden head movements, and not participating in sports. Despite this being the fifth Cochrane review on this topic, as noted by Dr Eby in his remarks, we will likely have to await yet another review—and more clinical trials—before postural restrictions can be recommend with confidence.</p>
