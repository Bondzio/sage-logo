<abstract>
<p>The rapid changes in social and economic conditions in many populations may have significant impacts on health, including child oral health. Understanding trends and variations between and within countries will assist in the development of effective preventive programs. This review aims (1) to document time-trends in child caries experience of countries with different levels of social and economic development, and (2) to compare factors affecting the caries experience of children in two contrasting countries. A time-trend analytical approach of ecological data from countries with different levels of social and economic development and individual data of the two contrasting Vietnamese and Australian child populations were used. The analysis found a significant decline in caries experience of children, mostly driven by the improvement in populations with high social and economic development. Significant variations in caries experience and in associations with risk factors between and within countries were observed. Socio-economic inequality in child oral health existed within developed countries and between countries with different levels of development. Population programs aimed at improving upstream factors are of priority in further improving child oral health in different populations.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In many populations, dental caries has been identified as one of the most prevalent chronic conditions. In children in industrialized countries, dental caries is up to five times more prevalent than the second most prevalent chronic condition, asthma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022034511434355">USHHS, 2000</xref>). Dental caries is a major cause of pain and infection which can have severe consequences for the quality of life of the affected children and their families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022034511434355">Casamassimo <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>). The second important characteristic is that dental caries in children is mostly preventable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022034511434355">Fejerskov, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022034511434355">Fisher-Owens <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022034511434355">Selwitz <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). Hence, a challenge is to understand why dental caries is still highly prevalent, and why some individuals and some populations have higher levels of caries experience than others. Responding to that challenge remains a high priority in international dental research.</p>
<p>The global social and economic changes of populations have occurred at a fast pace in recent times. However, the rate of change is not similar for every population. Countries differ vastly by economic circumstances, distribution of wealth, availability of technological advances, and even access to basic human needs such as childhood education. Within a population, there are also marked differences in the way individuals live and prosper. All these differences can have an effect on human health, including oral health. There has been extensive literature on this issue since the Black Report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022034511434355">Townsend <italic>et al</italic>., 1992</xref>). The same marked differences by social and economic circumstances have been widely reported in dental research literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022034511434355">Watt and Sheiham, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022034511434355">Hobdell <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022034511434355">Bernabe and Hobdell, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022034511434355">Sheiham <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>). However, there have been few studies looking at the distribution of oral health at both population and individual levels. Furthermore, it is important to investigate whether countries with different levels of economic and human development differ in the trend of caries experience across the last few decades.</p>
<p>Researchers investigating variation in diseases between and within populations can find inspiration in the seminal work by Geoffrey Rose, “Sick individuals and sick populations” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022034511434355">Rose, 1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022034511434355">2001</xref>). Rose’s discussion of the determinants of individual cases and the determinants of incidence rate in the population is an important distinction in understanding disease occurrence and in planning appropriate preventive measures. Such an approach can be of considerable interest in the study of factors affecting child oral health. A deeper understanding can be gained by taking the global as well as the individual view of oral health determinants.</p>
<p>This review aims to contribute to the literature investigating differences in health between populations and individuals by attempting (1) to document variations in trends in child dental caries experience of countries with different levels of economic and social development over the last few decades, and (2) to compare factors affecting child dental caries experience of two contrasting countries. A time-trend analytical approach using ecological data from countries with different levels of social and economic development will be used to achieve the first aim, and a multivariable analysis of cross-sectional data of the Vietnamese and Australian child populations to estimate individual effect as well as population impact measures will be used for the second aim.</p>

<title>Country-level Caries Experience—Changes Over Time</title>
<sec id="section3-0022034511434355">
<title>Country-level Data</title>
<p>Methods of country-level data collection for this analysis are detailed in the Appendix. A total of 43 countries were selected that had at least three data-points on child caries experience during 3 or more time periods from pre-1980 through to the present (Appendix Table). Values of decayed, missing, or filled permanent teeth (DMFT) for 12-year-old children in each country were used as the outcome variable in the analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0022034511434355">
<title>Country-level Indicators of Economic and Social Development</title>
<p>Several indicators are available to measure country-level economic and social development (see Appendix). Three indicators are: the United Nations’ Development Program Human Development Index (HDI), <italic>per capita</italic> Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and a measure of income inequality, the Gini index. HDI is a composite indicator which measures social and economic development. The higher values of HDI indicate a higher level of social and economic development of a country. The HDI values of the included countries ranged from 0.494 to 0.938. <italic>Per capita</italic> GDP of the countries based on 2008 $US was used in this analysis. The Gini index measures a country’s income-related inequality, which ranges from 0 (absolute equality) to 1 (absolute inequality). Values of the 3 indicators were for the period 2000 to 2010, and one data value was selected for each of the 3 indicators for a country.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0022034511434355">
<title>Analytical Methods</title>
<p>Six time periods starting with the pre-1980 period were used in the analysis: pre-1980s, 1980 to 1989, 1990 to 1994, 1995 to 1999, 2000 to 2004, and 2005 to present. This ordinal variable of time was used as a categorical random factor in a series of longitudinal models for the mean DMFT scores. SAS ProcMixed was used to fit these models to examine the intercepts and slope of the trends and the between- and within-country variations. The variable “Country” was used as a level-2 variable in these models. First, quartiles of the country-level indicators were used to illustrate the time-trends of caries experience. The country-level indicators and their interaction with the time factor were subsequently used in sequential longitudinal models as grand-mean-centered continuous variables to examine the relationships of those indicators with the time-trend of caries experience.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0022034511434355">
<title>Time-trend for Caries Experience and Associated Factors</title>
<p>The time-trend for child dental caries experience showed an overall decline from pre-1980 to the last decade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022034511434355">Fig. 1</xref>). Mean caries experiences of countries by quartiles of the 3 country-level factors were adjusted for between- and within-country variations. These graphs show distinctive patterns for time-trends between quartiles. Countries in the 2 highest HDI quartiles had higher dental caries experience in the pre-1980 period than did the other 2 quartiles. However, these higher HDI quartiles showed steeper declines in their dental caries experience over time, while the lower HDI quartiles showed fluctuation over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022034511434355">Fig. 1a</xref>). Similar patterns were observed in time-trends of caries experience of countries by quartiles of country GDP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022034511434355">Fig. 1b</xref>). The difference in mean caries experiences of countries by quartiles of the Gini index was less notable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022034511434355">Fig. 1c</xref>).</p>

<p>The time-trend of caries experience was further examined in more formal statistical analyses with SAS ProcMixed to model the random effect of time (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022034511434355">Table 1</xref>). There were significant variations in mean caries experience between countries and between time periods. The null model (Model 1), with intercept and time period as random factors, indicated a significant reduction over the 6 time periods in caries experience. On average, the global caries experience declined by half of DMF teeth over each time period. However, there was significant variability in between-country intercepts and slopes of the time trends, 2.31 and 0.12, respectively. There was also an inverse covariance between intercepts and slopes of change over time (-0.40, p = 0.025). This inverse covariance indicates that countries with higher initial mean caries experience (intercepts) had significantly higher reduction over time (slopes of change) compared with those with lower caries experience in the past. The between-country variability comprised 11.7% of the total variance of the change over time, as indicated by the Intra-Class Correlation (ICC) value.</p>

<p>Model 2, where HDI was used as a fixed-effect covariate, indicated that HDI scores were not significantly associated with initial caries experience. However, HDI scores were significantly associated with the time-trend in the interaction analysis. The higher the HDI score, the larger the ‘over time’ reduction in mean caries experience. HDI scores explained almost a half of between-country variability in the time-trend (ICC reduced to 6.0%). Similarly, the interaction between <italic>per capita</italic> GDP and the ‘over time’ change was significant in Model 3. Gini index scores were not significantly associated with the initial status and the ‘over time’ trend (Model 4).</p>
<p>Model 5 examined the ‘over time’ change with all 3 country-level covariates as fixed-effect covariates. The time-trend remained significant with a coefficient of -0.58. In this multivariable model for change, all 3 covariates were significantly associated with the initial status of caries experience, adjusted for other factors in the model. Only the HDI score was found to be significantly associated with the time-trend (p = 0.002). Countries with higher HDI scores recorded a significantly sharper decline in child caries experience. Variability between slopes and covariance between intercepts and slopes were no longer statistically significant in this model after adjustment for the 3 covariates and their interaction with the time-trend. This model also had a significantly lower Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) value (662 <italic>vs.</italic> 725), indicating significantly better model fit than the null model. The 3 country-level indicators explained a significant proportion of between-country variance in the time-trend of caries experience of 12-year-old children.</p>

<title>Changes in the Global Distribution of Child Caries Experience</title>
<p>The above analyses document the changes in the distribution of dental caries experience in the child population of a large number of countries. The overall level of caries experience in children has declined significantly since the pre-1980 period. This trend was mostly driven by the sharp decline in countries with higher economic and social development. This finding was in line with the recent major reviews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022034511434355">Petersen, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022034511434355">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022034511434355">Whelton, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022034511434355">Dye <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). This is a significant achievement brought about through numerous public health measures, such as community water fluoridation, improved oral hygiene including widespread use of fluoridated toothpaste, and better disease management, along with improved living conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022034511434355">Spencer <italic>et al</italic>., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022034511434355">Petersen, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Social and economic development measured by HDI was found to be significantly associated with the decline in the global caries level. Similar findings have been reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022034511434355">Hobdell and co-workers (1999)</xref>. This composite index may be a marker of significant changes in living conditions, access to preventive dental care, and availability of effective population preventive programs such as water fluoridation and toothbrushing with fluoridated toothpaste and a change to a healthier diet.</p>
<p>A major feature of the change in caries experience is that over the last century caries had changed from a disease of affluence to a disease of deprivation at the global level. Countries with higher economic and human development recorded a significantly higher level of the disease in the pre-1980 period than countries lower in the development ranking. However, that global distribution has changed sharply toward the beginning of this century, where positions in terms of caries levels have reversed between those countries. There has been no significant improvement in caries experience in the populations at a lower economic and human development level, which comprise the majority of the world’s population. Improving oral health status in those populations is required if improvement in the global oral health in children is to be achieved.</p>
<p>To summarize, there are significant variations between countries in the levels of child caries experience as well as changes over time in caries experience. At the global level, inequality existed in child oral health of different countries, with caries changing from a disease of affluence to a disease of deprivation in the last few decades of the century. While the composite indicators of a country’s social and economic development have been found to be associated with caries experience and its trend over time, better understanding of factors affecting caries experience within populations is required. Comparative analysis of individual effect and population impact measures of contrasting countries will significantly add to that knowledge. Such an attempt will help to explain the variations between as well as within countries.</p>

<sec id="section9-0022034511434355">
<title>Population-based Surveys of Child Oral Health in Two Countries</title>
<p>Data for a between- and within-country comparison were collected in two population-based studies: the Vietnam National Oral Health Survey 1999-2000 and the Australian Child Oral Health Study 2002-2005 (see Appendix). Data from these two studies were previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022034511434355">Do <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022034511434355">2011</xref>). Vietnam and Australia were both included in the analysis in the previous section. The two countries were in contrasting levels of social and economic development as measured by the 3 UNDP indicators. By HDI and GDP, Vietnam is in quartile 1 (lowest), while Australia is in quartile 4 (highest). Australia is in quartile 1 (most equal), while Vietnam is in quartile 3 by the Gini index.</p>
<p>For this analysis, primary caries experience (dmfs scores and prevalence of caries) was estimated for 5- to 10-year-old children, while equivalent outcome measures of permanent caries were estimated for 8- to 15-year-old children. Equivalized income was estimated based on reported household income and number of people dependent on that income (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022034511434355">Do <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). The equivalized income quartiles were then estimated to group individuals of each population into ranking order by relative socio-economic status, allowing for between- and within-country comparison. Other comparable covariates were age of commencement of toothbrushing with toothpaste, residence, and parental education. All estimates of the outcome variables were adjusted for age and sex.</p>

<title>Association between Income and Oral Health</title>
<p>The Vietnamese child population had significantly higher caries experience in both primary and permanent dentitions than the Australian child population of the same age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022034511434355">Fig. 2</xref>). The group with the lowest caries experience in Vietnam had twice as much disease than the group with the worst level of caries experience of either primary or permanent dentition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022034511434355">Figs. 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022034511434355">2b</xref>) in Australia. The differences in the prevalence of caries were similar but somewhat less notable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022034511434355">Figs. 2c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022034511434355">2d</xref>). Given that the absolute income values observed in Australia were significantly higher than those in Vietnam, it can be concluded that the richer population had significantly better oral health than the poorer population.</p>
<p>There are contrasting pictures of the distribution of dental caries by income levels between these populations. In the Vietnamese child population, there was a tendency of increasing prevalence and caries experience as income increased, although the only statistically significant difference was observed in the mean dmfs scores between the lowest and highest quartiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022034511434355">Fig. 2a</xref>). In contrast, in the Australian child population, the prevalence and experience of dental caries in either dentition were significantly reduced as income increased.</p>

For this comparison, caries experience in the permanent dentition among 8- to 12-year-old children was used. Several comparable factors were included in the multivariable models for each population as well as child age (grand-mean-centered) and sex. The weighted distribution of the factors in the populations is also presented. The models were generated by Poisson distribution with a robust variance estimation method. Rate ratios were estimated for each of the included factors adjusted for other factors. The adjusted Population Attributable Fraction (PAF) of each factor was estimated as a percentage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022034511434355">Bruzzi <italic>et al</italic>., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022034511434355">Benichou, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022034511434355">Rowe <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>).

PAF: Population Attributable Fraction. PAF indicates proportion of the disease in the population attributable to factor of interest. PAF may sum up to over 100%, since the factors are not mutually exclusive. Last dental visit was not included in the model for Australian children, because it was the population of children attending school dental services.

<p>There are similarities as well as contrasting differences in both the individual factors and the population impact measures between the two populations. The most contrasting differences in the distribution of factors are the almost total lack of population preventive programs in Vietnam, namely, water fluoridation and toothpaste use. Two-thirds of Australian children compared with just 4% of Vietnamese children had access to fluoridated water. Most Australian children commenced toothbrushing with toothpaste before the age of 3 yrs, while just 6% of the Vietnamese children did so. Given the well-documented effectiveness of water fluoridation and timely use of fluoridated toothpaste (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022034511434355">CDC, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022034511434355">MRC, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022034511434355">NHMRC, 2007</xref>), the lack of these programs may be one of the main reasons for the difference between countries as observed in the first part of this review.</p>
<p>The two populations shared a similar direction of effect for most factors, such as intake of sweets, sugar, and soft drinks, residence, brushing frequency, and parental education level. The last factor is of importance in explaining variation between and within countries. It indicates that social and human development can deliver positive impact on health. It may help to explain the significant association between HDI and the global change in dental caries experience as described earlier in this review. The importance of upstream factors in shaping oral health has been discussed in a number of seminal publications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022034511434355">Watt, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022034511434355">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022034511434355">Sheiham, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022034511434355">Marmot and Bell, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022034511434355">Pitts <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022034511434355">Sheiham <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>A significant difference between the two countries is the association between income and caries experience. There was a lack of a significant income-gradient in Vietnam in contrast to the significant inverse income-related gradient in child oral health in Australia, as is often reported in industrialized countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022034511434355">Pitts <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022034511434355">Sheiham <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>). The situation in Vietnam can be explained by more access to cariogenic sweets, sugar, and soft drinks among children of higher-income households. Such a situation was present in the industrialized populations after World War II, when caries was a disease of affluence. Therefore, income-related inequality in child oral health may not be a universal phenomenon. There is significant variation between populations with different levels of social and economic development that needs to be taken into account.</p>
<p>The comparison between the two countries should take into account considerable difference in sample sizes. Several associations were not statistically significant in the Vietnamese population because of small group size, despite notable practical significance. The Australian sample size was larger. Therefore, confidence intervals, which are more conservative than p-values, were used to assess practical significance of effect size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022034511434355">Rothman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022034511434355">Akobeng, 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>Sick Individuals and Sick Populations — a Case with Child Dental Caries Experience</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022034511434355">Rose (2001)</xref> discussed two distinct issues: the determinants of individual cases and the determinants of incidence rates, leading to two corresponding approaches in disease prevention: the high-risk approach and the population preventive approach. Rose observed that it is possible that “a large number of people at a small risk may give rise to more cases of disease than the small number who are at a high risk”. This interesting epidemiological phenomenon was observed in the comparison between the Vietnamese and Australian child populations. Although in the Vietnamese population the association of age of commencing toothpaste use with caries experience was borderline non-significant, the high prevalence of late commencement produced a potential significant population impact. Should all Vietnamese children commence fluoridated toothpaste use before the age of 3 yrs, the caries level in the population could be reduced by 18% from its current level. The effect size of commencement of toothpaste use was similar in Australian children. However, the PAF estimate in the Australian population was only 3%. Introduction of water fluoridation would produce an even larger population impact in the Vietnamese population. The effect of exposure to fluoridated water in Vietnam was not significant because of the small size of the reference group. However, the population impact of water fluoridation could potentially be some 24% of the current caries experience level in the Vietnamese child population. These two population programs combined could potentially explain 42% of the current level of dental caries experience in the Vietnamese population. These findings are in line with the current recommendations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022034511434355">CDC, 2001</xref>; MRC, 2001; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022034511434355">Petersen and Lennon, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022034511434355">NHMRC, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The study findings indicate that both population and high-risk approaches are applicable in these two countries. However, population preventive programs in Vietnam would deliver significantly higher benefits than the high-risk approach. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022034511434355">Rose (2001)</xref> argued that a total population shift in the distribution of the disease would bring significantly higher benefit. This scenario is applicable to the Vietnamese population (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022034511434355">Figs. 3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022034511434355">3b</xref>). The population programs in Australia must be maintained at least at their current level. Further expansion of toothbrushing with fluoridated toothpaste and water fluoridation may bring relatively smaller (albeit important) improvement. However, reduction of those programs would bring a substantial worsening of child oral health in Australia.</p>

<list-item><p>global variations in diseases and their presentations, taking into account variations within as well as between countries; and</p></list-item>

<p>This review attempts to assemble evidence to address the two above-mentioned tasks in relation to dental caries in children. To fulfill the task, we used a combination of ecological data and various country-level indicators of social and economic development with individual-level data, and used a sophisticated longitudinal modeling technique and a combination of measures of individual risk with measures of population impact. Variations between and within countries were accounted for in the attempt to identify factors responsible for the differences. Numerous findings can be made, as follows:</p>
<list id="list2-0022034511434355" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The global level of dental caries in children has declined significantly, mostly driven by the improvement in socially and economically advantaged populations. However, the majority of the global child population still carried significant level of the disease.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>There are significant variations in the levels of caries experience as well as in the time-trend of caries experience between populations with different levels of social and economic development.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The likely reasons for the between- and within-country variations range from more upstream population-level determinants to individual level factors.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Socio-economic inequality in child oral health has become a significant issue within the developed populations and between populations of different levels of development.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>There are significant variations in caries experience between and within populations. Those variations are related to common risk factors between populations as well as factors specific to a population.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Caries experience was more widespread within populations with lower levels of social and economic development, while was more confined to small sub-groups in the more developed populations.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Population programs must remain the main preventive measure in all populations.</p></list-item>
