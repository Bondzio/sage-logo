<abstract>
<p>This article examines the rationale for the limited use of sport by a range of paramilitary organizations in Northern Ireland to supplement their wider political and ideological aspirations. In any divided society all aspects of life are recruited to reveal and occasionally contribute to this separation and periodically, when seeking to attack or undermine ‘the other’, their sporting pursuits and interests become part of any military offensive. Whilst it is wrong to suggest that sport was a consistent or substantial factor in the ethno-sectarian conflict in Northern Ireland, which unfolded over the latter part of the 20th century, it was used in a strategic manner by terror organizations and thus its deployment was rarely ill-conceived even if the outcomes of their actions were almost always unjustifiable and, ultimately, futile.</p>

<title>Introduction: Sport and terrorism</title>
<p>Any full analysis of the activities of terrorist organizations, either at a national or international level, should consider whether a peculiar set of conditions exist during which groups are more likely than not to utilize sport to advance what they believe to be a legitimate cause (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1012690211433483">Boyle and Haggerty, 2009</xref>). Does the existence of a certain set of circumstances mean terrorist grouping regard sport’s use in this way as being broadly appreciable, if by no means acceptable, by sections of wider society? Reflection upon a number of international case studies appears to show commonalities between the social, cultural and political centrality of sport in those countries that have witnessed its use by terrorist organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1012690211433483">Richards, 2010</xref>). Alongside this, in other settings, the presence of a set of ideological conditions – often concerning the sovereignty of the nation in question – can be significant when understanding the motives of terrorists in those specific locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1012690211433483">Arthur, 1990</xref>). The issue at hand therefore is whether there is something inherently distinctive about the Irish case study, and of Northern Ireland in particular, which means sport’s embroilment in the actions of terrorist groupings there, becomes somehow inevitable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1012690211433483">Bairner, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>The activities of both Irish Republican and Loyalist paramilitaries and ongoing ethno-sectarianism throughout Northern Ireland over the latter part of the 20th century created an extremely polarized society. With more than 3500 deaths since 1969 as a result of the conflict in Northern Ireland, the ‘troubles’ directly impacted upon social interaction between Catholics and Protestants, meaning that normal relations with people from the ‘other side’ of the community were virtually non-existent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1012690211433483">Community Relations Council, 2010</xref>). Consequently, people often defined themselves, in the first instance, as group members, meaning personal identities or one’s freedom to choose yielded to the collective will of the group to which the individual subscribed, or was conscribed into (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1012690211433483">Hamber and Kelly, 2004</xref>). Whilst a direct result of the terrorism that struck fear into the lives of many people living in Northern Ireland, symptomatic of this was intermittent violence and discrimination evident within the realm of sport, on the field of play, amongst spectators on the terraces and even within boardrooms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1012690211433483">Bairner, 1999</xref>). This lack of interaction amongst the two communities in Northern Ireland in time created a society in which Protestants and Catholics lived and worked apart and witnessed them engage with sport separately too. Some activities, such as rugby union and cricket were, for much of their recorded history in Ireland, regarded as Unionist sports whilst other codes, such as Gaelic football and hurling, were understood by Protestants to be as purely a Catholic activity as attending mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1012690211433483">Harris, 1986</xref>).</p>
<p>Yet such a simplistic analysis fails to account for the nuances of individual choice or, more significantly perhaps, the recent emergence of a consensus-seeking, largely apolitical and affluent section of society who are determined to ‘move on’ and achieve real, direct interaction with their erstwhile opponents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1012690211433483">Hamber and Kelly, 2004</xref>). Such groups, many of whom emerged immediately following the Belfast-Good Friday Agreement of 1998, deploy sport as a tool to engage the attention of ‘both sides’ of the community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1012690211433483">McEvoy-Levy, 2006</xref>). Most of those involved with these groups might argue that their intervention has been worthwhile even if the supporting evidence remains unconvincing at best. Instead, the temporary ‘feel good’ factor experienced during the actual programme in question, as interpreted by an already sympathetic body of advocates, may blind some in to believing that sustainable progress is taking shape when in fact the ultimate affect of this work can only be ascertained some months or even years hence. A more cynical view might suggest that sport’s case in this regard is deliberately overstated to secure employment for those offering otherwise well intentioned interventions and is underpinned by questionable evaluations of the same which, not surprisingly, confirm the often ambitious goals of such programmes to have been realized.</p>
<p>What can be stated with certainty is that there exists a long history of sporting organizations becoming embroiled with politics (if not directly impacted by acts of terrorism) in Ireland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1012690211433483">Sugden and Bairner, 1993</xref>). Apart from the well documented cases involving the GAA, other organizations such as the National Athletics and Cycling Association, formed in 1922, was suspended by the International Cycling Federation in 1935 when it would not recognize the Irish border or the legitimacy of Northern Ireland when selecting athletes to compete for Ireland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1012690211433483">Coogan, 2000</xref>). Other governing bodies, including those with responsibility for field hockey and athletics, have suffered in a similar manner as the permeability of the border separating the two jurisdictions in Ireland, especially with regard to Catholics living in Northern Ireland, means that they interpret competing for the Republic of Ireland as quite normal and, on occasion, even desirable. A series of high profile cases featuring young Catholic footballers from Northern Ireland declaring their intention to represent the Republic of Ireland (having previously played for the country of their birth at youth level) emerged from 1998 onwards and became particularly prevalent over the decade from 2002 to 2012 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1012690211433483">Hassan et al., 2009</xref>). Of course, it was in August 2002 that Northern Ireland’s most high-profile player of that era, Neil Lennon, retired from international football following a death threat, thought to have been issued by loyalist paramilitaries, which forced his withdrawal from Northern Ireland’s home international against Cyprus. This incident, whilst roundly condemned, reminded onlookers of the cultural significance of sport, the influence of terrorism upon every aspect of life in Northern Ireland, and the consequences, however ill intended, of their interrelationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1012690211433483">Murphy, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Even after the cessation of most terrorist activity in Northern Ireland its spectre continues to cast a long shadow over many aspects of life in that country. The decision in May 2008 to decline an opportunity of constructing a multi-sport stadium on the site of the former Maze prison, eight miles south of Belfast, was made partly because of a failure to secure agreement over the nature of a ‘conflict transformation centre’ proposed by Sinn Fein, a party with strong republican underpinnings, adjacent to the proposed new stadium. The suspicion amongst unionists was that this was an attempt by republicans to construct a ‘terrorist shrine’ on the site of a former jail in which 10 republican prisoners had died as a result of a hunger strike in 1981 whilst campaigning for special status as political prisoners. In this case a stadium that had the potential to encapsulate a new beginning to life in Northern Ireland was sacrificed due to a failure to properly draw a line under its disputed past (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1012690211433483">Hassan, 2005a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1012690211433483">2005b</xref>).</p>

<title>Terrorism in Ireland</title>
<p>Thus in order to explore the impact and significance of Ireland’s divided and often violent past it is first necessary to define what is understood by the use of the word ‘terrorism’ in this context. Typical definitions include violent acts carried out by groups or individuals to further political, social or cultural objectives, often underpinned by clear disagreement around the future sovereignty of the island, especially the disputed claim of Britain over Northern Ireland. Acts of terrorism are typically designed to coerce governments or individuals to pursue a particular course of action. Violent attacks are normally either targeted at state forces/infrastructure or political opponents and may impact upon innocent civilians or, at the very least, witness groups engage in activities that display little regard for the safety of non-combatants. The debate over the nature and definition of terrorism in the specific setting of Ireland is significant as for some organizations their actions fall short of a common understanding of the term terrorism and instead represent entirely justifiable forms of violent resistance. This is important because, as made clear at the outset of this analysis, the deployment of sport in advancing the cause of terrorist groupings there can only be fully understood by appreciating the ultimate aims of those who use violence (albeit those who did so) on this small island situated along the western periphery of Europe.</p>
<p>Nonetheless for most people ‘terrorism’ in Ireland is synonymous with the actions of the Irish Republican Army (IRA) and, more broadly, the ‘troubles’ in Northern Ireland over the latter decades of the 20th century. However, to analyse the origins of terrorism in Ireland it is necessary to examine the annals of Irish history to appreciate a conflict that has existed between Britain and Ireland over the last 200 years at least; indeed some would argue that this particular dispute has been ongoing since the Anglo-Norman invasion of Ireland in 1169 AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1012690211433483">Roche, 1995</xref>). For the purposes of this article, however, the divisions that remain in present-day Northern Ireland will adopt as their starting point the ‘Plantation of Ulster’ which unfolded during the 17th century. In fact, most scholars of Irish political history argue that the recent ‘troubles’ can be directly traced back to the Plantation period, which began under the direction of King James I of England in 1608. This process saw six counties in the ancient northern province of Ulster (currently Northern Ireland) colonized by settlers from England and Scotland. The vast majority of these settlers were Protestant or Presbyterian people whilst the displaced Irish were Catholic. It can be argued therefore that this event created a society segregated between Protestant settlers and Catholic natives, thereby laying the basis for centuries of ethno-sectarian strife and conflict in Northern Ireland as a festering resentment on the part of the indigenous people was never fully addressed. There is, however, also an argument to support the assertion that the link between Northern Ireland and the UK emerged more as a result of the country’s close proximity to Scotland than as a direct result of the Plantation of Ulster, and that while the Plantation of Ulster did create a British interest in Northern Ireland it was later emigrations that produced the divided society typical of Northern Ireland today.</p>
<p>Despite being officially disbanded over the last decade the IRA was a paramilitary organization committed to establishing a socialist Irish republic throughout the island of Ireland and advanced these aims over the past century with acts of violence against functionaries and property of the British state amid a programme of activity associated with the common definition of terrorism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1012690211433483">Coogan, 2000</xref>). The IRA was formed as a result of the ‘Easter rising’ against British rule, which took place in Dublin on 24 April 1916. This rebellion, which was organized by another Republican society, the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB), was unsuccessful but the execution of the leaders of the rising created broad public support in Ireland for republican aims and the growth of a concomitant anti-British sentiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1012690211433483">Lee, 1991</xref>). This directly led to the formation of the IRA and the Anglo-Irish War (also known as the War of Independence) from 1919 to 1921, which in turn resulted in the partition of Ireland and the creation of a 26-county Irish Free State. The six counties in the northeast of the island came to be known simply as Northern Ireland, which because of its large Protestant and Anglo-centric population, remained under British rule.</p>
<p>Following this partition of Ireland the IRA continued to carry out its armed offensive with the primary aim of bringing about a ‘united Ireland’. The most notable IRA campaigns since partition have included the 1939 bombings in England, the ‘border campaign’ in Northern Ireland from 1956 to 1962 and its lengthy campaign carried out in Northern Ireland from 1969 to 2000, which officially ended with an IRA statement on 6 May 2000 renouncing violence and committing the organization to exclusively peaceful means. This was exemplified through the full decommissioning of all IRA weapons, which took place in the period immediately following the historic announcement of an end to its longstanding military offensive. During the course of the ‘troubles’, other republican paramilitary organizations also emerged, including the often volatile Marxist group, the Irish Nationalist Liberation Army (INLA), the Irish Peoples Liberation Organization (IPLO) as well as, in latter times, a raft of so-called dissident republican splinter groups that have continued to emerge post-2000 and are opposed to the IRA ceasefire and the ‘peace process’ generally. The latter, of whom the activities of the Real IRA are most infamous following some particularly merciless attacks upon innocent civilians, remain a chief concern for security forces in Northern Ireland and elsewhere, including those charged with security at the Summer Olympic Games 2012 in London.</p>
<p>Predictably a raft of oppositional groupings emerged from the Protestant community during this same timeframe, often portraying themselves as ‘defenders’ of the loyalist and British people of Northern Ireland. Whilst there were certainly a level of threat exercised against the majority Protestant people in the country by republicans, not to mention the fact that the security forces rank and file in the country remained overwhelmingly Protestant and thus sympathetic to a continuation of the status quo, for the most part republicans were focused on direct attacks upon the British state. Nonetheless, this often resulted in somewhat ill-founded attempts to separate and justify the position held, for example, by a local Protestant recruit to the Royal Ulster Constabulary, the principal police presence in Northern Ireland until 2001, from his/her occupation, which was to uphold the sovereign law of the land. The inevitable result was that the unionist population in Northern Ireland viewed the security forces as more aligned with their way of thinking, and as loyalist terrorists were similarly minded but crucially engaged in illegal violence, there was occasionally a blurring of the lines between what might be considered proper policing and those who would seek to eradicate the threat from republican sources whilst using somewhat more questionable forms of direct action.</p>
<p>Thus it was the events surrounding the Easter rising of 1916 in Dublin which were the catalyst for prolonged periods of violence across Ireland throughout the 20th century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1012690211433483">Caulfield, 1995</xref>). The so-called ‘Provisional Government of Ireland’ that led the rising published a ‘Proclamation of the Irish Republic’ and which has since become a seminal document in Irish history and wider society, especially within republican circles. This document constituted a determined attempt on the part of a small group of Irish men to reclaim Ireland from British rule. The 1916 Proclamation states ‘in every generation the Irish people have asserted their right to national freedom and sovereignty. Six times during the past three hundred years they have asserted it in arms.’ In its broadest sense this was an attempt by the IRB to create a tradition of armed rebellion against Britain by glorifying unrepentant opposition to British rule. The failure of the rising perpetuated the romantic myth that it is a noble thing to fight and die for the cause of Irish freedom; this fact is echoed in the poem ‘Easter 1916’ by W.B. Yeats when he claimed ‘all is changed, changed utterly, a terrible beauty is born’. These prophetic words by Yeats foretold the century of political violence and upheaval that the 1916 rising precipitated.</p>
<p>The ‘six times’ when the Irish people rose up against British rule, which are mentioned in the proclamation, refer to the 1641 rebellion in Ulster, the 1688–1691 ‘War of the Three Kings’ or ‘Glorious Revolution’, the 1798 rebellion, the 1803 rising of Robert Emmett, the 1848 Young Irelanders rising, and finally the Fenian uprising of 1867. However, these risings and rebellions differed significantly from the violence of the 20th century, which took place after 1916, as the earlier rebellions involved mostly pitched battles against standing armies. In contrast, the violence of 20th-century Ireland involved guerrilla warfare and activities more commonly associated with our understanding of ‘terrorism’. To appreciate the reasons for this divergence it is important to return to the organization which led the 1916 rising, the IRB.</p>
<p>Indeed, the group most directly linked to modern-day terrorism in Ireland is the IRB or Fenian movement, a secret oath bound society founded in the mid-19th century. The IRB adopted something of an ‘underground’ or clandestine approach to its strategic resistance against the British as it felt that the open political organizations of the past, such as the United Irishmen, had been too easily suppressed by the British government. The IRB received considerable support from the USA, which was as a result of the large-scale emigration to that country from Ireland, which took place during the Great Famine (1845–1848) when millions left Ireland and moved to many parts of the world, including North America, never to return. This created a significant Irish-American political force in the USA, in particular, which provided finance and support for organizations such as the IRB and continued to offer backing to other republican groups, principally the IRA, during the 20th century. This financial backing from America, which the original IRB received, coupled with its status as a secret oath bound society gave the group a new dynamic that previous Irish republican organizations did not enjoy. Although the IRB staged an ill-fated rising in 1867, it continued to plot in secret and gather support that ultimately led to the Easter rising of 1916, which as has been indicated, was the pre-cursor to the formation of the IRA.</p>
<p>Evidence that the IRB assumed a new approach to the conflict with Britain is exemplified by a political assassination undertaken in 1882 by a faction of the IRB. On the evening of 6 May 1882, the Chief Secretary of Ireland, Lord Frederick Cavendish and Thomas Henry Burke, the permanent Irish under-secretary, were assassinated as they walked in Phoenix Park. These ‘Phoenix Park’ murders shocked wider society, both in Ireland and Britain, as such callous cold-blooded political killings had rarely been attempted in Ireland before and thus marked a new departure in the war against the British presence in Ireland. Indeed, most violent republican acts prior to this one had taken place during times of open rebellion, pitched battles or throughout periods of martial law. This was a novel, strategic approach on the part of Irish Republicans and one that they continued to use to chilling effect throughout the 20th century.</p>
<p>In terms of sport and terrorism in Ireland the emergence of the IRB in the late 19th century was mirrored by the rise of the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA), which was established in 1884. The GAA’s primary aim was and is to promote Irish sport and culture and it proved extremely successful in doing so as Irish constitutional nationalist (and Protestant) Douglas Hyde succinctly observed shortly after its formation, ‘The GAA has done more for Ireland in the past five years than all the speeches of politicians’ (Hyde, 1894, taken from ‘The necessity of de-Anglicizing Ireland’). As membership of the GAA was almost exclusively Irish-Catholic many historians view the early meetings of the GAA as constituting something of a breeding ground for Irish Republicanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1012690211433483">de Búrca, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1012690211433483">Murphy, 2009</xref>). In fact, with this in mind, the leadership of the IRB made a conscious effort to infiltrate the GAA during its formative years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1012690211433483">de Búrca, 1991</xref>). However, the extent to which this was successful remains debatable as that other dominant force in late nineteenth-century Ireland, the Catholic Church, was opposed to the IRB and the cause of Irish Republicanism in general. Indeed, it openly discouraged members of the Catholic Church from joining the GAA due to the attempt by the IRB to seize control of that organization in 1886, which also drew considerable opposition from many non-politicized members who understood the value in promoting an ailing Irish cultural identity in the country at that time. This resentment is illustrated by the fact the membership of the GAA fell from 52,000 in 1889 to 5446 by 1892 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1012690211433483">Kee, 1989a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1012690211433483">1989b</xref>). Once the IRB abandoned its coup against the GAA, the Catholic hierarchy once again offered its support to the organization and the GAA’s membership returned to healthy levels, even if its development in Ulster was modest at best for several decades thereafter.</p>
<p>The evolution of the IRB into the IRA, and the post-1916 development of Irish Republicanism, was keenly observed by unionists in Ulster. Their determination to respond to the growth of the republican position led to the formation of the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) in 1913 to ‘defend Ulster’, and, following the partition of Ireland, to ensure the six counties of Northern Ireland remained aligned to Britain. A resurgent UVF also played an important role in the ‘troubles’ in Northern Ireland from 1969 onwards as it carried out a terrorist campaign against Catholics and Nationalists living there. In fact, the UVF and other loyalist paramilitary organizations that were subsequently formed in Northern Ireland, such as the Ulster Defence Association (UDA), the Ulster Freedom Fighters (UFF), the Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF) and the Red Hand Defenders, all identified members of the ever popular GAA as ‘legitimate’ targets, liable to attack resulting in death or serious injury. Indeed, throughout the five-year period either side of the late 1980s/early 1990s loyalist paramilitary organizations engaged in a campaign of particularly focused attacks upon GAA clubs and their members, notably in south Derry, County Antrim and outlying parts of north Belfast.</p>

<title>GAA and terrorism in Northern Ireland</title>
<p>The arguably disproportionate success enjoyed by teams and individuals from Ireland competing overseas confirms that sport does indeed play an important role in the lives of many people living on the island. Whether as participants, coaches or officials Irish people have consistently made their mark on international sport at all levels, including the Olympic Games. Alongside this the peculiar strength of the indigenous sporting body, the GAA, its democratic and amateur ethos’s and its organizational reach throughout the island means that it also imbues a sense of pride, ownership and attachment amongst its almost 1 million members that could be considered atypical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1012690211433483">Hassan, 2005b</xref>). If an organization, as is the case with GAA, also represents a particular cultural identity it can have added significance beyond the established boundaries of that body (and of sport itself) but can also fall foul of the non-sporting ambitions of its opponents. In exercising caution around its possible exploitation, and occasionally falling victim to this, the GAA demonstrates that it is not a conventional sporting body and for those with a limited understanding of its workings or seeking a platform for their opposition to the cause of Irish nationalism, its perhaps not surprising that the GAA has been targeted by loyalist terrorist groupings in Northern Ireland and occasionally by rogue elements of the British state, both of whom remain innately suspicious of its motives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1012690211433483">Sugden and Bairner, 1999</xref>). Indeed, it is entirely reasonable to conclude that few other governing bodies of sport anywhere in the world have been as consistently targeted by terrorist groupings as the GAA has been in Northern Ireland over the past four decades and more. The murders of Sean Brown (1998) and Gerry Devlin (1997), both claimed by the LVF, alongside that of Mr Devlin’s club mate (at St Enda’s GAC, Glengormley) Sean Fox (1993) undertaken by the UVF represent only three examples of how GAA personnel were targeted by loyalist terrorists over the course of Northern Ireland’s recent past (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1012690211433483">Fahy, 2001</xref>). In fact, St Enda’s Glengormley had its premises attacked and destroyed on no fewer than five separate occasions (1983, 1986, 1992 and twice in 1993). The early 1990s witnessed a concerted campaign of violence against the GAA in Ulster and was often defined by arson attacks upon remote GAA outposts on the County Down peninsula and north Antrim, whilst other acts of vandalism, such as strewing glass across playing pitches and daubing graffiti on the sides of buildings, was also commonplace. It was an unpleasant time to be a member of the GAA in Northern Ireland yet ironically, on the field of play, it coincided with a remarkable period of success for Ulster teams in the All Ireland senior football championships as Derry (1993) and Down (1992 and 1994) claimed the ultimate prize in Gaelic football (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1012690211433483">Fahy, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>The troubled history of the GAA in Ulster actually serves as an important reminder that in any divided society sport can easily be appropriated as a point of division for those who wish to use it as such. Different sports, teams, symbols and ethos’s mean sporting bodies, wilfully or otherwise, become embroiled in the broader politics of division. Whilst some have argued strongly that they are innocent victims of a pervasive sense of partisanship evident in the country others have either accepted that they could have done more to condition how they are viewed by those who would not typically form part of their membership or have sought to make amends for previous recalcitrance through positive outreach work, especially in areas they might not have considered working in until recently. It is also important to recognize that others, including journalists, commentators and even academics have a responsibility to properly convey the considerable efforts made by some organizations, for example, the Irish Football Association (IFA), in addressing previous shortcomings in this realm. It behoves everyone writing about these issues to ensure they are sufficiently well informed of the most recent work being undertaken in the fields of community relations, outreach and inter-departmental relations. A failure to do so only perpetuate an inaccurate view of certain sporting organizations, allows for their ongoing demonization in the eyes of their often unrepentant opponents and underwrites the rationale of those who believe attacking personnel, property or the organization as a whole achieves some justifiable end.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding this, in keeping with the above comments, there is also clearly a role for the organizations themselves in proving proactive when deconstructing the perceptions of others who would seek to criticize or even attack them. Existing as a reservoir of meaning for one community may do little to assuage the perceptions of others and there was undoubtedly a time in their recent histories when the main sporting bodies in Ireland could have done more to address the reticence of ‘outsiders’ to engage with their work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1012690211433483">Hassan, 2005a</xref>). A failure to adequately do so simply compounded a fear of the unknown, which for some ultimately turned to loathing, and in turn provided justification for the approach of certain terrorist groupings who argued it was possible to target these organizations because of what they represented and their apparent reluctance to distance themselves from a broader ideological project, such as the cause of Irish unification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1012690211433483">Fahy, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>In attacking sport, in Ireland or elsewhere, terrorists are also demonstrating that they are prepared to go to considerable lengths to achieve their strategic goals. Sport therefore becomes a victim of its apparent peripheral status in society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1012690211433483">Giulianotti and Klauser, 2009</xref>). If terrorists are prepared to engage sport, the logic follows, there are few if any targets that remain beyond this form of irrationalism. Indeed, an attack upon sport seemingly has further, added value, as on top of its obvious media significance, the global attention it commands and the immediacy of its impact there remains something fundamentally sacred about sport that appears to set it apart from everyday life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1012690211433483">Falcous and Silk, 2010</xref>). Sport represents a quantum leap in the thinking of terrorists who, if their goals are political in nature, are prepared to take their cause outside these boundaries into the cultural domain. This makes sport both a vulnerable and comparatively soft target for certain terrorist agendas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1012690211433483">Coaffee, 2010</xref>). It gives rise to much greater levels of revulsion, it underpins the desire of terrorists to be taken seriously, to reveal their utter fearlessness and willingness to attack any target that may, in some small way, promote favour amongst their own and, conversely, force those who would oppose them to formulate a response.</p>

<title>Strategic use of sport within Irish terrorism</title>
<p>Perhaps because of its perceived importance in Northern Ireland rarely has the use of sport by terrorist organizations there been unplanned, even if a great number of attacks were ill-conceived and achieved no meaningful end. Thus sport’s engagement should not be read as a sustained or central component of terrorist activity but periodically its deployment was undertaken for very specific purposes and to achieve predetermined outcomes. That said, many observers only became fully cognizant of this when it was deployed in high profile cases, such as the decision of the Scotland and Wales rugby union teams not to travel to Dublin in the spring of 1972 to fulfil games against Ireland in the Five Nations Championships for fear of attack from the IRA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1012690211433483">Sugden and Bairner, 1993</xref>). Of course, there were undoubtedly other occasions when athletes became unintentionally involved in the actions of the IRA. In April 1987 the republican group detonated a booby trap bomb on the main Belfast to Dublin road which claimed the lives of Lord Chief Justice Maurice Gibson and his wife, Cecily. Travelling in the opposite direction were three Irish international rugby players, David Rainey, Nigel Carr and David Irwin. Their vehicle was caught up in the bomb and the injuries they sustained resulted in their early retirement from the game, cutting short the playing careers of three of Ireland’s most promising rugby footballers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1012690211433483">Van Esbeck, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Thus it is too simplistic to suggest that sport’s role in the conflict that dominated life in Northern Ireland was opportune or confined to the warped logic of extreme elements on both sides. As a counter-hegemonic organization for much of its history the GAA unashamedly advanced an unrepentant Irish nationalist agenda and, as has been suggested, for those who opposed this, GAA members and clubs became so-called ‘legitimate targets’. In 1991, the UFF stated that it was singling out GAA members because, it alleged, they were supporting the ‘republican war machine’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1012690211433483">Fahy, 2001</xref>). Equally for organizations like the IRA, the INLA and a raft of other minor groups ‘domestic’ sporting tournaments that confirmed Northern Ireland as part of the UK, British sports teams (particularly national sides) and individual athletes promoting a British identity in Ireland were both unwelcome and occasionally targeted but mostly had their plans disrupted and were inconvenienced. The question remains therefore, in what precise way did terrorists use sport as part of their wider strategic ambitions in Ireland? How, for example, did Irish republicans believe that targeting international teams, events and athletes assist them in achieving their aspiration of a sovereign, independent and free Ireland? Likewise loyalist terrorists clearly strategized that earmarking individuals, teams and organizations where Catholics and nationalists were in the majority constituted an appropriate riposte to ongoing republican violence intended to convince Britain to withdraw from Ireland.</p>
<p>Thus to fully appreciate the evolving nature of terrorist activity, specifically in the context of sport in Ireland, it is important to establish a primary objective for its deployment in the first instance. It remains the most immediate goal of terrorists to break the bonds that link society to those in power and thereby to imply that the government of the day is incapable of properly protecting its citizens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1012690211433483">Shirlow and Murtagh, 2006</xref>). By targeting specific high profile games, for example, the World Cup qualifier at Windsor Park, Belfast on 27 February 1985 between Northern Ireland and England, republican terrorists (in this case, the INLA) were intent on promoting panic, confusion and a sense that no aspect of life in that part of Ireland could continue to be unaffected by events unfolding around it. A bomb alert in the narrow streets of south Belfast following a high profile game against England is likely to achieve considerably greater propaganda than any amount of press releases, protests and fund raising for a minor paramilitary cell. This strategy, of targeting large sporting events or social gatherings, was a consistent aspect of republican activity in Northern Ireland during the latter part of the 20th century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1012690211433483">Arthur, 1990</xref>). Indeed, this continues to be the case to this day with repeated declarations from British government ministers that dissident Republican groupings, foremost amongst them being the Real IRA, are intent on targeting the London Olympics to be staged during August 2012 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1012690211433483">Dodd, 2009</xref>). By seeking to break the bond that links the individual to the expansive, collective psyche of a people and in turn to those in power the intention has been to recalibrate the epicentre of authority and redefine what constitutes credible representation for the masses. Sporting events served the additional purpose of being one of the last apparent vestiges of ‘normality’ in Northern Ireland and with their increased targeting emerged only a growing sense of disorientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1012690211433483">Hassan, 2005a</xref>). The net result was often the eclipsing of any semblance of sporting achievement on the part of athletes actually partaking in the events in favour of a ritualistic process of condemnation, and on the other side, apparent justification of the terrorist’s activities by elected representatives.</p>
<p>It would be wrong however to suggest that the use of sport in this way somehow convinced wavering bystanders to the conflict unfolding or, more to the point, apathetic but potential political actors to enter the field of political theatre. Sport doesn’t retain that form of agency but more accurately there was definitely a view on both sides of the community in Northern Ireland that targeting sporting events represented a futile pastime. Catholics enjoyed representing and supporting Northern Ireland’s sports teams over this period (many still do) every bit as much as their Protestant counterparts and they suffered fear and disorientation as a result of the targeting of sport in precisely the same way as their erstwhile opponents. Where there was a difference perhaps was an occasional belief in the minds of some that such terrorist activity was part of a wider unification ‘project’ and, perhaps for nationalists, this allowed a minority to rationalize these practices at a certain level, even if they found the actions and their consequences to be reprehensible. Targeting international teams, especially England, became almost predictable and whilst this may have created revulsion amongst many, there was a largely ritualistic feel about much of this activity and more often than not such actions only resulted in inconvenience, anger and frustration, rather than death or injury, for those affected.</p>
<p>But of course this was never the principal aim of terrorist activities in Northern Ireland in the first place – again an often misunderstood assumption. Instead the primary goal for both republican terrorists and their loyalist adversaries was indeed the creation of disruption, confusion and panic. Only by severing the bonds that linked large sections of the people (both Protestants and Catholics) to the state could the process of rebuilding that society begin. It was, in the eyes of republicans, a necessary first step. Loyalist terrorists, principally the UDA but others like the UVF, UFF and the particularly violent LVF, adopted a strategy that was in some way a derivative of this (perhaps more accurately a mirrored response) in which sport was again implicated. The targeting of GAA members, arson attacks against that organization’s property and violent assaults against supporters of certain ‘nationalist’ football clubs were all designed to break the resolve of Catholics, and to encourage them to withdraw any support they may have for the actions of republican paramilitaries. On 5 November 1991, the UFF, an established pseudonym for the UDA, admitted throwing a hand grenade over the perimeter wall at Windsor Park where Cliftonville FC supporters (considered to be predominantly Catholic) had congregated to support their team (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1012690211433483">Sugden and Bairner, 1993</xref>). In a statement claiming responsibility the loyalist terror group linked its attack to an IRA bombing three days earlier at the military wing of Musgrave Park Hospital, Belfast. The latter attack claimed the lives of two British army soldiers and injured 18 civilians. Thus the creation of fear, mistrust, a certain degree of resentment and suspicion, and an overwhelming questioning of the apparent futility of the republican agenda, remained the key goals of loyalist paramilitaries in Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>During this initial stage the response of the government is of critical importance. The same could be said of other arms of the state and elements of what might be termed ‘recognized’ civil society. The funding of sport, access to sporting facilities, coverage of sport through the media (that in any divided society should at least be equitable), appointments to publically funded sporting bodies and recognition of sporting success by civic authorities all fall under closer scrutiny in any such context. Any sense of partisanship – and there was clearly evidence of this in the case of Northern Ireland against the minority Catholic population – only undermines the legitimacy of the state to withstand the growing sense of alienation felt by its people, which was undoubtedly disproportionately the case for some. In this regard, sport provides the evidence of why society, in the eyes of terrorists, must be reformed, whilst in a setting where sport is wedded to the cultural identity of a populous it can prove a powerful weapon for insurgent groupings.</p>
<p>Indeed, convinced by the efficacy of sport to extrapolate its message amongst all sections of British society, it was not surprising that the IRA would use it as part of its wider exportation of terrorist activities to Britain. This two-pronged approach, of attacks against agents of the state in the occupied territory alongside those in the colonial metropolises and, more specifically during celebrations of national significance within the latter, became part of the republican strategy in the late 1980s, and sporadically prior to this point. By the time of the staging of the 150th Grand National at Aintree, Liverpool on 5 April 1997 the IRA had already undertaken a number of terrorist operations in Britain. The abandonment of the race, one of the most high profile steeplechase meetings in the horse racing calendar, followed the receipt of two coded bomb warnings from the IRA, and ensured worldwide coverage of the event albeit for all the wrong reasons. Ironically, as if to demonstrate the remarkable pace of events towards the close of the 20th century, barely a year later witnessed the signing of the Belfast-Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland and the establishment of a devolved power-sharing executive.</p>
<p>It is timely to make reference to the political outworking of internal conflict in Northern Ireland because its self-evident that in engaging one’s opponent in violent dispute – be they similar yet ideologically opposed sub-groupings or the state itself – terrorism is ultimately about exacting concessions that either lead to outright victory or at the very least significantly enhance circumstances that might have otherwise not been achieved had terrorist activities not taken place. Counter-hegemonic insurgency and direct military offensives create predicaments for governments and other resource holders that are not easily addressed. The republican campaign in Northern Ireland and the subsequent negotiated political cessation of violence undoubtedly led to a shifting response from the British state to the lives of the minority nationalist population resident in that country. The New Labour government, which was in office at the time of the signing of the Belfast-Good Friday Agreement, like most other administrations before it, tended to overreact to terrorist campaigns. It was motivated as much to reassure the population at large that it retained absolute authority as it was, in a more simplistic if vain manner, to crush the insolence of the insurgents whose temerity led them to undertake their campaign in the first place. In Northern Ireland, the position ultimately evolved so that the British government arrived at the view that supporting the everyday activities of the minority, especially the moderates amongst the nationalist community, could actually result in wider support for its preferred stance. By continuing to portray terrorists as unrepresentative of the community they purported to emerge from whilst at the same time embarking on a virtual charm offensive amongst that sub-population’s moderate majority it very quickly became clear that progress could be made. Heavy investment in GAA facilities in Northern Ireland, the support for public leisure centres that were otherwise chronically underperforming but were crucially located in predominantly nationalist parts of the country, subventions from the British tax system for athletes who competed for Ireland in international sporting competitions (and continue to do so) whilst underwriting teams and associations who compete primarily in the Republic of Ireland represented examples of this behaviour in practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1012690211433483">Hassan, 2005b</xref>).</p>
<p>The difficulty with this approach in Northern Ireland was that whilst it had some limited effect in reality it allowed the British government’s agenda to be read as one that was weak on terrorism by rewarding those that would seek a mandate for such a position in the form of state investment. Those who lived in the country were, for the most part, of course more than sophisticated in their thinking around the intricacies of this practice to appreciate what was actually taking place but for opponents of such measures any form of support was to be resisted vociferously and typically was. Thus the overriding policy of the British government in Northern Ireland was to target moderates, persuade them to distance themselves from extremist elements and then underpin their new position by supporting their cultural interests, including sport. Of course, all of this is fine if the approach of the state remains ethically sound. In contrast, if the line between the core and the periphery is compromised it is typically as a result of perceived or actual malpractice on the part of agents of the state.</p>
<p>However, focusing too readily on one source of potential insurgency risks neglecting the activities of others, which may strengthen the hand of so-called ‘pro-state terrorists’. Loyalist paramilitaries, apparently evermore frustrated at the inability of the British government to deal effectively with the ‘enemy within’, increasingly decided to take matters into their own hands and engage in what they considered to be ‘revenge’ attacks upon the nationalist and republican people of Northern Ireland to make clear their opposition to the apparent pacification of the republican threat. Violence and the threat of violence, often motivated by little more than sectarian hatred, resulted in random attacks upon Catholics and their sporting practices. Occasionally supplemented by members of the state forces, the latter experiencing a heighted state of alert, this activity had little or no ideological basis. When coupled with what nationalists understood to be deliberate ‘stop and search’ tactics by the British Army and various arms of the local police presence in Northern Ireland when on the way to sports matches, often resulting in these contests starting late or not at all, this did little to dissipate suspicion amongst the minority population that some degree of collusion was in fact taking place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1012690211433483">Fahy, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Perhaps the final stage in any terrorist campaign is establishing and then embedding legitimacy for the new conditions that have emerged as a result of the disorientation of the wider population and the subsequent response from the authorities. In this case, communication with the population at large, explanation of practices and activities they may not be familiar with and policy changes or new forms of thinking that serve to lend credence to its claim to be taken seriously all represent important and worthwhile pursuits. In any recalibration of society there is an onus, especially in a post-conflict setting, for all sections of that society, including sporting bodies, to demonstrate their genuine commitment to a new beginning. Typically, this means introducing amendments to certain rules and regulations around membership and access, the relaxation of policies that were otherwise thought to be non-negotiable, genuine attempts to re-create conditions so that they appear and subsequently become more equitable and, inevitably, the establishment of outlets that provide a safe-haven for those sections of society that would prefer not to engage in the tribalism of division and instead exist in a benign form of isolation. All of these consequences of terrorism and conflict in Northern Ireland have their manifestation in sport and act as a reminder that the outworking of terrorist activities in this context proliferate throughout all aspects of life there, including amongst those for whom the ethno-sectarian conflict passed by largely without impacting upon them. A good example of this is the emergence of various forms of sports entertainment in Belfast, primarily the growth of the Belfast Giants ice hockey franchise and the understanding that a professional basketball team, the Belfast Titans, will be the next team to join the British basketball league for the 2012/13 season. Alongside the hosting of the recent MTV Europe Music Awards in Belfast there clearly is an attempt on the part of local and national politicians and civic leaders to recast Northern Ireland’s image in the eyes of outsiders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1012690211433483">Hassan, 2005b</xref>).</p>
<p>Ultimately, it remains entirely a matter of debate about whether the actions of terrorists in Northern Ireland achieved those aims that they had established at the outset of their campaign or even those that evolved along the way. What is certain is that the consequences for sport were profound. It splintered society in many different ways and exercised a negative influence upon what should have been a merciful release from civil and political unrest. It meant the exclusion of some, the growth of other sporting forms and the emergence of sporting projects and initiatives that were aimed at being politically neutral and occasionally profited from been regarded as such. The sporting landscape in Northern Ireland therefore remains a hotchpotch of organizations, many of which are in perilous financial situations and whose facilities are largely outdated, all of whom were affected by or at the very least struggled through the latter part of the 20th century in a country ravaged by internal dispute.</p>
<p>Finally, perhaps the most telling relationship between sport and terrorism in Northern Ireland was how the pervasiveness of violence, whilst only occasionally directly affecting sport, nevertheless exercised a remarkable impact upon it. It is very interesting that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1012690211433483">Sugden and Bairner’s (1993)</xref> seminal text, reflecting on much of the troubled history of life and sport in Northern Ireland and published whilst violence continued across the country, makes very little explicit reference to terrorism. Rather contained within the book there is an implicit suggestion that the relationship between sport and politics in Northern Ireland existed because of the contested notion of sovereignty for that part of the UK when in fact the issue of identity politics in sport was being continually reaffirmed and redefined by the terrorist actions unfolding on a near daily basis across the country. The various republican campaigns of bombing and shooting made Catholics, nationalists and republican’s extremely wary of how their actions were perceived by their own community; it made Protestants, unionists and loyalists conscious of becoming overly acquiescent with the sporting pastimes of ‘the other side’ (Catholics and Nationalists) and, beyond this, did little to encourage teams from outside Northern Ireland to travel there. All the major sports in which athletes from Northern Ireland excelled required performers to travel overseas with many international tournaments notable only by their absence from the country throughout the 1970s and 1980s. The organizers of those events simply never considered the possibility of staging their tournament/event in Northern Ireland and sadly many, to this day, continue to hold true to that view.</p>
<p>Likewise loyalist violence had a profound effect upon the sporting exploits of the minority community in Northern Ireland. Apart from direct threats against members of the GAA, which sometimes resulted in death, arson attacks upon premises and other, comparatively low-level forms of activity, there was always a sense in which the absence of a defined ideological basis to loyalist terrorism meant that simply targeting Catholics, disrupting their freedom of movement and assembling in intimidating gangs around domestic sport involving predominantly Catholic teams constituted their <italic>modus operandi</italic>. A salient example of this was the trouble that again surrounded Irish League side Cliftonville FC during the early part of the 1996/97 domestic football season in Northern Ireland. Whilst blame undoubtedly existed on both sides the stoning of Cliftonville FC supporter buses and the subsequent prevention of fans from attending the Portadown versus Cliftonville league game at the former’s home ground unfolded in a part of Mid-Ulster where the LVF, under the direction of its now deceased leader Billy Wright, was very well embedded. Again in much the same way that the attack on 18 June 1994 by the UVF in Loughinisland, County Down, which resulted in the deaths of six civilians and serious injuries to five others, was staged to coincide with the screening of the Republic of Ireland versus Italy World Cup game during the USA tournament, so the LVF in Portadown recognized that by attacking supporters of Cliftonville FC it was effectively conducting an offensive against the imagined nationalist and republican people of Northern Ireland. These two examples confirm the belief that during the course of Northern Ireland’s sectarian and troubled past sport, despite performing a peripheral role, was only very occasionally introduced into the conflict unintentionally. Instead, it represented a strategic platform upon which a spectrum of discrete yet forceful messages could be promoted and reinforced.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>During the latter part of the 20th century, and continuing to the present day, Northern Ireland became something of a byword for Western terrorism and home to one of the most renowned paramilitary organizations anywhere in the world, the IRA. A range of other terrorist bodies similarly committed to the concept of Irish unification also emerged during the course of civil unrest that marred life in Northern Ireland over the closing decades of the last century. Not surprisingly terrorist bodies that sought to ‘defend’ the Protestant people of Ulster also exercised their presence in a conflict that had essentially three sides to it: the actions of republican terror groups, those of loyalists and functionaries of the British state in Northern Ireland including the police and British army. All aspects of life in the country were impacted by the ill-effects of this dispute meaning little if any form of established normality could take hold within wider society.</p>
<p>It should come as little surprise therefore that sport became part of the strategic goal of terrorists. Sport was already heavily politicized but it was its strategic deployment, a thesis advanced consistently throughout this article, which makes a study of it in Northern Ireland particularly compelling. Either through direct attacks, bomb warnings, disruption or simply unfulfilled threats, terrorist organizations there saw sport as a very powerful means of confirming their presence or advancing their ideologically driven aims. Its use was strategic, if occasionally ill-conceived. Republicans saw attacks upon teams representing Britain as justifiable within their broader campaign for Irish freedom and independence whilst loyalists, resolutely committed to retaining Northern Ireland’s link with the rest of the UK, routinely launched attacks upon teams and sporting bodies, primarily the GAA, which they perceived to be underpinning an Irish presence in Northern Ireland – the so-called ‘enemy within’. Both republicans and loyalists, if perhaps the former in the main, had a set of guiding principles designed to break the established influence of the state in Northern Ireland and saw sport (albeit in a minor sense) as a way of partially achieving this goal. Yet, in an overall sense, the relationship between sport and terrorism in Northern Ireland is essentially a story of an array of loyalist paramilitary groupings using sport as a platform upon which to launch attacks upon Catholics and their teams and organizations in order to foster resentment within the nationalist community against the actions of republican terrorist organizations. In contrast, the latter only rarely chose sport as a medium through which to promote their causes, which is turn helps to locate sport’s wider role in the activities of terrorist groupings in Northern Ireland more accurately.</p>
