<abstract>
<p>Scant research has examined how children of different races or ethnic backgrounds manifest consequences of neglect. We examined multiple domains of functioning (academic/intellectual, social/behavioral, and psychiatric), three theories (racial invariance, double jeopardy, and resilience), and potential confounding variables. Children with documented cases of neglect (ages 0–11) and matched controls without such histories were followed up and interviewed in adulthood (<italic>N</italic> = 1,039). The sample was 47.3% female, 62.4% White, 34.3% Black, and 3.4% Hispanic. Black and White neglected children showed negative consequences for IQ, reading ability, and occupational status compared to controls. Compared to same race and ethnic group controls, neglected White children showed extensive mental health consequences, Black children showed more anxiety and dysthymia, and Hispanic children showed increased risk for alcohol problems. Black and White neglected children differed in risk for violence compared to same race controls: Neglected Black children were arrested for violence two times more often than Black controls, whereas neglected White children were more likely than White controls to report engaging in violence. Findings provide some support for each theory (racial invariance, double jeopardy, and resilience). Understanding the factors that account for similarities and differences in consequences requires further investigation. Implications for research and policy are discussed.</p>

<p>Neglect is the most common type of child maltreatment in the United States, accounting for more than 60% of cases reported to Child Protective Services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1077559512460728">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2010</xref>). With this recognition, an increasing number of studies have reported negative consequences of neglect across a number of domains of functioning, including lower levels of academic and intellectual functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1077559512460728">Perez &amp; Widom, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1077559512460728">Wodarski, Kurtz, Gaudin, &amp; Howing, 1990</xref>) as well as economic well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1077559512460728">Currie &amp; Widom, 2010</xref>) and higher rates of delinquency and crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1077559512460728">Maxfield &amp; Widom, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1077559512460728">Smith &amp; Thornberry, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1077559512460728">Widom, 1989b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1077559512460728">Zingraff, Leiter, Myers, &amp; Johnsen, 1993</xref>), victimization (McIntyre &amp; Widom, 2011; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1077559512460728">Reid &amp; Sullivan, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1077559512460728">Tyler, Johnson, &amp; Brownridge, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1077559512460728">Widom, Czaja, &amp; Dutton, 2008</xref>), suicide attempts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077559512460728">Borger, Cox, &amp; Asmundson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1077559512460728">Widom, 1998</xref>), and psychiatric symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077559512460728">Borger et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1077559512460728">Johnson, Cohen, Brown, Smailes, &amp; Bernstein, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1077559512460728">Johnson, Smailes, Cohen, Brown, &amp; Bernstein, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1077559512460728">Widom, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1077559512460728">Widom, DuMont, &amp; Czaja, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1077559512460728">Wright, Crawford, &amp; Del Castillo, 2009</xref>). However, little has been written about the extent to which the consequences of childhood neglect are similar or different among individuals of different racial or ethnic backgrounds.</p>
<p>Existing theories lead to divergent predictions about the consequences of neglect for children of different races and ethnic backgrounds. One theory predicts similar consequences (racial invariance), one predicts worse outcomes for neglected Black and Hispanic children (double jeopardy), and the third predicts fewer and less severe negative outcomes for neglected Black and Hispanic children (resilience) compared to nonneglected Black and Hispanic children, relative to neglected and nonneglected White children.</p>
<p>The “racial invariance” hypothesis would predict that the effect of neglect would be similar for children of different races or ethnic backgrounds. Proponents of this theory argue that the impact of social influences on negative outcomes should be similar across race or ethnicity if there is equivalent exposure and distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1077559512460728">Sampson &amp; Bean, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1077559512460728">Sampson &amp; Wilson, 1995</xref>). Observed racial differences in outcomes are presumed to be due to different social circumstances. This theory postulates that race and ethnicity should make little difference if individuals are exposed to similar social circumstances and risk factors. Existing research and theory has focused almost exclusively on criminal outcomes, typically homicide, and community-level risk factors such as poverty, racial segregation, or residential density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077559512460728">Chauhan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1077559512460728">Feldmeyer, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1077559512460728">Steffensmeier, Ulmer, Feldmeyer, &amp; Harris, 2010</xref>), and there is some evidence supporting the racial invariance hypothesis in Blacks and Whites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1077559512460728">Sampson &amp; Bean, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1077559512460728">Sampson &amp; Wilson, 1995</xref>). However, differences in the magnitude of these effects across races have called into question the extent of invariance. In addition, most of this research has focused on Blacks and Whites, and studies that have included Hispanic populations have described a “Latino Paradox,” whereby Hispanics exposed to extreme levels of disadvantage nonetheless exhibit low levels of violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1077559512460728">Feldmeyer &amp; Steffensmeier, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1077559512460728">Sampson, 2008</xref>). In the current study, we extend the racial invariance literature by applying it to consequences of childhood neglect, to a range of negative outcomes, and to Hispanics as well as Blacks and Whites. If racial invariance exists, we hypothesize that the consequences of neglect will be similar in direction and significance among Black, White, and Hispanic groups.</p>
<p>A second possibility is that the consequences of neglect for children of different races and ethnic backgrounds will differ substantially and that the effects will be magnified for Black and Hispanic neglected children, representing a form of “double jeopardy” (McLeod &amp; Owens, 2004). For children of minority races and ethnic backgrounds, this theory posits that the effects of neglect may be compounded by experiences of racism and exposure to other forms of victimization and violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1077559512460728">Wyatt, 1990</xref>). This perspective has been applied to understanding differences in outcomes related to health and psychological well-being (McCLeod &amp; Owens, 2004; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1077559512460728">Pearlin, Schieman, Fazio, &amp; Meersman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1077559512460728">Wyatt, 1991</xref>) but has not, to our knowledge, been evaluated in terms of the consequences of childhood neglect. According to the double jeopardy hypothesis, we would expect to find a stronger relationship between neglect and negative outcomes for Blacks and Hispanics, relative to Whites, due to the compounding effects of minority ethnoracial status.</p>
<p>A third possibility is that the effects of neglect on Black and Hispanic children, relative to White children, might be smaller in magnitude because of resilience developed through living in environments with more common and chronic stressors and cultural factors that may buffer against the effects of neglect. For example, religion and involvement of extended kinship networks have been found to protect against negative outcomes in Blacks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077559512460728">French, Finkbiner, &amp; Duhamel, 2002</xref>). Similarly, scholars have suggested that strong ties to one’s cultural heritage and community cohesion may help to insulate Hispanics from the effects of poverty and social disadvantage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1077559512460728">Steffensmeier et al., 2010</xref>), supporting the Latino Paradox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1077559512460728">Feldmeyer &amp; Steffensmeier, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1077559512460728">Sampson, 2008</xref>). Consistent with this theory of “resilience,” Black youths are reported to have lower rates of alcohol and drug use than their White or Hispanic peers, although this pattern reverses by middle adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077559512460728">French et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1077559512460728">Watt, 2008</xref>). Scholars have also noted that the suicide rate for Blacks in the general community has consistently been lower than the rate for Whites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077559512460728">Centers for Disease Control, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1077559512460728">Vanderwerker et al., 2007</xref>). Although some have questioned the validity of those findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1077559512460728">Vanderwerker et al., 2007</xref>), others have suggested that Blacks have greater protective factors than Whites that prevent suicide completions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1077559512460728">Garlow, Purselle, &amp; Heninger, 2005</xref>). Other authors have speculated that risk factors for suicide may be more relevant for Whites than Blacks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1077559512460728">Vanderwerker et al., 2007</xref>); Blacks may tend to underreport suicidal ideation and attempts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1077559512460728">Watt &amp; Sharp, 2002</xref>); or Blacks and Whites may not differ in their rates of suicide, but Black suicides may be more often misclassified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1077559512460728">Rockett, Samora, &amp; Coben, 2006</xref>). There is also research suggesting that the use of self-report methodologies may not be reliable within the Black community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1077559512460728">Morrison &amp; Downey, 2000</xref>). Nonetheless, based on the theory of resilience, we would expect to find an attenuated effect of childhood neglect on Blacks and Hispanics compared to the effect of neglect on Whites.</p>

<title>Childhood Neglect and Race or Ethnic Differences in Consequences</title>
<p>There is sparse research on race or ethnicity differences in the consequences of child maltreatment, and existing findings are inconsistent. Even less work has focused on the consequences of neglect. A few studies have reported a race differential in the extent to which maltreated children are at increased risk for being arrested for a violent crime compared to nonmaltreated children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1077559512460728">Maxfield &amp; Widom, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1077559512460728">Zingraff et al., 1993</xref>), although others did not find such differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1077559512460728">Grogan-Kaylor, 2005</xref>). One study of foster care children found that sexually abused non-Hispanic girls reported greater posttraumatic stress symptoms than both sexually abused Hispanic girls and nonsexually abused non-Hispanic girls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1077559512460728">Canez, 2000</xref>). In married cohabiting couples who reported abuse as a child, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077559512460728">Caetano, Field, and Scott (2003</xref>) found that for White males and females, childhood physical abuse was associated with alcohol problems in adulthood, whereas among Black males, observing parental violence was associated with alcohol problems in adulthood but physical abuse was not. More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1077559512460728">Roberts, Gilman, Breslau, and Koenen (2011</xref>) reported that among those exposed to trauma, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) risk was slightly higher among Blacks, lower among Asians, and about the same for Hispanics, compared to Whites, after adjustment for characteristics of the trauma exposure (including child maltreatment), age and gender. However, not all studies have found race and ethnic differences related to mental health outcomes associated with childhood maltreatment. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077559512460728">Lau, Litrownik, Newton, Black, and Everson (2006</xref>) did not find race or ethnic differences in emotional correlates of punitive parenting. In another study, race and ethnicity did not moderate the relationship between documented cases of maltreatment and internalizing and externalizing symptoms in youths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077559512460728">Hatcher, Maschi, Morgen, &amp; Toldson, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In sum, there is scant research on the extent to which neglected children of different races and ethnic backgrounds manifest similar or different consequences. Most existing studies focus on child maltreatment (combining abuse and neglect) or on physical or sexual abuse. Most studies are cross-sectional in design, making it difficult to determine temporal relationships. Finally, studies often rely on retrospective reports of abuse or neglect that introduce ambiguity into the meaning of the relationships reported.</p>
<p>The purpose of this article is to examine whether the consequences of childhood neglect are similar for neglected Blacks, Whites, and Hispanics compared to Blacks, Whites, and Hispanics who do not have documented histories of childhood neglect or abuse. For each of the outcomes examined, we evaluate three competing hypotheses based on theories of racial invariance, double jeopardy, and resilience. We do not suggest that these theories are mutually exclusive across outcomes or that a single theory will apply universally.</p>
<p>Traditionally, research has examined race differences by cross-group comparative analyses, allowing researchers to infer whether there are group differences in specific characteristics or outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1077559512460728">Roberts et al., 2011</xref>). However, it is not our goal to examine race or ethnic differences across these children in general but to examine whether the impact of neglect differs within these race and ethnic groups. Within-group analyses are particularly suited for the questions guiding this research and the unique design of this study. We do not assume that the three groups are the same in terms of base rates of occurrence of these characteristics and outcomes. Indeed, there is a sizeable literature that reports race and ethnicity differences in psychiatric disorders or symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077559512460728">Asnaani, Gutner, Hinton, &amp; Hofmann, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077559512460728">Breslau et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1077559512460728">Roberts et al., 2011</xref>) as well as differences in arrest rates and in levels of poverty or education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1077559512460728">Lin &amp; Harris, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1077559512460728">Sampson &amp; Lauritsen, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1077559512460728">Snyder, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1077559512460728">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1077559512460728">U.S. Census Bureau, 2012</xref>). Blacks are more likely than Whites to be arrested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1077559512460728">Tracy, Kempf-Leonard, and Abramoske-James, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1077559512460728">U.S. Department of Justice, 2010</xref>). Compared to Whites, Blacks are also less likely to graduate from high school, especially during the time period examined in the present study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1077559512460728">Leach &amp; Williams, 2007</xref>), to gain and maintain steady employment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1077559512460728">Fairlie &amp; Sundstrom, 1999</xref>), and to marry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1077559512460728">Franklin, Smith, &amp; McMiller, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>The design of this study offers at least two major advantages that are relevant to the issues of concern here. First, the matching procedure used in the original archival phase of the research explicitly controls for possible confounds, such as demographic characteristics. Despite statistical controls in some of the large-scale epidemiological studies, these and other confounds may still have an effect on findings. However, in this study, because the “experimental” and “control” groups are matched on the basis of age, race, sex, and childhood neighborhood, children in each race or ethnic group (neglected and controls) are similar on these dimensions. Thus, matching allows us to isolate the effect of neglect on outcomes and to compare the effects within race and ethnic groups. Second, our use of within-group analysis allows us to avoid using Whites as the “normative” group, a practice criticized as evidence of “monoculturalism” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1077559512460728">Okazaki &amp; Sue, 1995</xref>). This is a particularly important issue, given the possibility of systemic biases that may impact consequences for neglected children.</p>
<p>Given the dearth of information on the effects of child neglect, this article represents a first step in determining the extent to which children of different races and ethnic backgrounds manifest the consequences of childhood neglect in similar or different ways. The broader conceptual framework that forms the basis of our work is a modified ecological model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1077559512460728">Widom, 2000</xref>) that recognizes the importance of context in understanding the consequences of child abuse and neglect and explicitly recognizes that characteristics of the child, family, or neighborhood may have an independent effect on outcomes. For example, a child who is irritable, has temper tantrums, and fights with other children and siblings is more at risk for certain types of deviant behavior outcomes than children with less difficult temperaments and personality characteristics, regardless of whether or not he or she has experienced childhood abuse or neglect. As such, we also consider potential confounding variables that might influence the findings. Ultimately, the results from this study will guide more targeted multivariate and multilevel analyses of the relationships uncovered here.</p>

<title>Design and Participants</title>
<p>Data were collected as part of a large prospective cohort design in which abused and/or neglected children were matched with nonabused and nonneglected children and followed into adulthood. Because of the matching procedure, the subjects are assumed to differ only in the risk factor; that is, having experienced childhood sexual or physical abuse or neglect. Since it is not possible to assign subjects randomly to groups, the assumption of equivalency for the groups is an approximation. The control group may also differ from the abused and neglected individuals on other variables nested with abuse or neglect. For complete details of the study design and subject selection criteria, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1077559512460728">Widom (1989a</xref>).</p>
<p>The original sample of abused and neglected children was composed of all victims of substantiated childhood physical and sexual abuse and/or neglect whose cases were processed during the years 1967 through 1971 in the county juvenile or adult criminal court in a metropolitan area in the Midwest. The rationale for identifying the abused and neglected group was that their cases were serious enough to come to the attention of the authorities. Only court-substantiated cases of child abuse and neglect were included, indicating that the sample is composed of relatively severe cases. Abuse and neglect cases were restricted to those in which the children were 11 years of age or less at the time of the abuse or neglect incident. Excluded from the sample were court cases that represented (1) adoption of the child as an infant; (2) only “involuntary” neglect, which typically resulted from the temporary institutionalization of the legal guardian; (3) placement only; or (4) failure to pay child support.</p>
<p>A comparison group of children who did not have documented cases of abuse or neglect was established, with matching on the basis of sex, age, race, and approximate family social class during the time period of 1967 through 1971. Matching for social class was important because it is theoretically plausible that any relationship between child abuse or neglect and later outcomes is confounded or explained by social class differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1077559512460728">MacMillan et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1077559512460728">Widom, 1989b</xref>). It is difficult to match exactly for social class because higher income families could live in lower social class neighborhoods and vice versa. The matching procedure used here is based on a broad definition of social class that includes neighborhoods in which children were reared and schools they attended (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1077559512460728">Watt, 1972</xref>). The control group establishes the base rates of outcomes in individuals from comparable circumstances who did not come to court attention as victims of child abuse or neglect.</p>
<p>Children who were under school age at the time of the abuse and/or neglect were matched with children of the same sex, race, date of birth (± 1 week), and hospital of birth through the use of county birth record information. For children of school age, records of more than 100 elementary schools for the same time period were used to find matches with children of the same sex, race, date of birth (± 6 months), and class in elementary school during the years 1967 to 1971. Overall, matches were found for 74% of the abused and neglected children. Nonmatches occurred for a number of reasons. For birth records, nonmatches occurred when the abused and neglected child was born outside the county or state or when the date of birth information was missing. For school records, nonmatches occurred because of lack of adequate identifying information for the abused and neglected children or because the elementary school had closed over the last 20 years and class registers were unavailable.</p>
<p>The initial phase of the study compared the abused and/or neglected children to the matched comparison group (total <italic>N</italic> = 1,575) on juvenile and adult criminal arrest records (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1077559512460728">Widom, 1989b</xref>). This article uses data from follow-up in-person interviews that were conducted during 1989–1995 and during 2000–2002. Although there was attrition associated with death, refusals, and our inability to locate individuals, the composition of the sample has remained about the same (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1077559512460728">Table 1</xref>). There were no significant differences in sex, race, ethnicity, age, and group (neglect versus controls) across the waves of the study.</p>

<p>The present analysis includes only the neglected children and matched controls (<italic>N</italic> = 1,039). The current sample was average age 29.1 (standard deviation [<italic>SD</italic>] = 3.8, range 19–39), 47.3% female, 62.4% non-Hispanic White, 34.3% Black, not of Hispanic origin, and 3.4% Hispanic (based on self-reports) at the time of the first interview and 39.4 (<italic>SD</italic> = 3.5, range 30-47) at the time of the second interview in 2000–2002.</p>

<title>Procedures</title>
<p>Interviewers were blind to the purpose of the study and to the inclusion of an abuse/neglect group. Participants were also blind to the purpose of the study and were told that they had been selected to participate as part of a large group of individuals who grew up in that area during the late 1960s and early 1970s. Institutional Review Board approval was obtained for these procedures and participants provided written, informed consent. For individuals with limited reading ability, the consent form was presented and explained orally.</p>

<title>Childhood neglect</title>
<p>Childhood neglect was assessed through review of official records of documented court cases processed during the years 1967 to 1971. Neglect cases reflected a judgment that the parents’ deficiencies in child care were beyond those found acceptable by community and professional standards at the time and represented extreme failure to provide adequate food, clothing, shelter, and medical attention to children.</p>

<sec id="section8-1077559512460728">
<title>Race and ethnicity</title>
<p>Participants were shown a card with the names of racial and ethnic groups and asked to indicate the group to which they belonged. Options included American Indian; Asian; Pacific Islander; Black, not of Hispanic origin; Black, of Hispanic origin; White, not of Hispanic origin; White, of Hispanic origin; and other. In this article, we focus on three groups: non-Hispanic Blacks, non-Hispanic Whites, and Hispanics (Black or White).</p>

<title>Outcome Variables</title>
<sec id="section10-1077559512460728">
<title>IQ and reading ability</title>
<p>Cognitive functioning was assessed with two measures administered during the first interview (1989–1995). IQ was measured by the Quick Test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077559512460728">Ammons &amp; Ammons, 1962</xref>), an easily administered measure of verbal intelligence where the subject can point to a picture on a card. Quick Test scores correlate highly with Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) full scale (.79-.80) and verbal (.79-.86) IQs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1077559512460728">Dizzone &amp; Davis, 1973</xref>), and versions have been used with a variety of populations. Reading ability was measured by the Wide Range Achievement Test–Revised (WRAT-R; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1077559512460728">Jastak &amp; Wilkinson, 1984</xref>). WRAT-R internal consistency estimates range from .96 to .99 and concurrent validity with other achievement and ability tests ranges from the high .60s to .80s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1077559512460728">Jastak &amp; Wilkinson, 1984</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1077559512460728">
<title>Occupational status</title>
<p>Participants were asked about their occupation at the time of the first interview (1989–1995). This information was coded using the Hollingshead Occupational Coding Index (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1077559512460728">Hollingshead, 1975</xref>). The entire sample was skewed toward the lower end of the socioeconomic spectrum. Occupational levels of the participants ranged from 1 (<italic>laborer</italic>) to 9 (<italic>professional</italic>). The median occupational level of the sample was semiskilled, and less than 7% of the sample was in the highest levels.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1077559512460728">
<title>Psychiatric disorders</title>
<p>At the first interview (1989–1995), the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Diagnostic Interview Schedule-III–Revised (DIS-III-R; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1077559512460728">Robins, Helzer, Cottler, &amp; Goldring, 1989</xref>) was used to assess a number of psychiatric disorders, including major depressive disorder (MDD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1077559512460728">Widom et al., 2007</xref>), generalized anxiety disorder, dysthymia, PTSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1077559512460728">Widom, 1999</xref>), antisocial personality disorder (ASPD), alcohol abuse and/or dependence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1077559512460728">Widom, Ireland, &amp; Glynn, 1995</xref>), and drug abuse and/or dependence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1077559512460728">Widom, Weiler, &amp; Cottler, 1999</xref>). The DIS-III-R is a fully structured interview schedule designed for use by lay interviewers. The interviewers received an intensive week of training and were experienced in the administration of the DIS. Computer programs for scoring the DIS-III-R were used to compute DSM-III-R diagnoses. The DIS has been used in prior community-based studies of psychiatric disorders and demonstrates adequate reliability and validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1077559512460728">Leaf &amp; McEvoy, 1991</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1077559512460728">
<title>Homelessness</title>
<p>Homelessness was based on a person’s positive response to a question during the first interview (1989–1995) about whether they had ever “experienced a period of time when they had no regular place to live for at least a month.” Responses were coded “1” for <italic>yes</italic> and “0” for <italic>no</italic>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1077559512460728">
<title>Suicide attempts</title>
<p>As part of the depression module of the DIS-III-R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1077559512460728">Robins et al., 1989</xref>), participants were asked whether they had ever attempted suicide. Responses were coded “1” for <italic>yes</italic> and “0” for <italic>no</italic>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1077559512460728">
<title>Crime and violence</title>
<p>We use two indicators of criminal and violent behavior (official arrest data and self-reports) because each source of information has strengths and weaknesses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1077559512460728">Geerken, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1077559512460728">Maxfield &amp; Babbie, 2011</xref>). Records from three levels of law enforcement (local, state, and federal) agencies were searched for arrests during 1987–1988 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1077559512460728">Widom, 1989b</xref>) and again in 1994 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1077559512460728">Maxfield &amp; Widom, 1996</xref>). A dichotomous (yes/no) crime variable for history of arrest was used. Juvenile arrests refer to offenses committed by a person less than 18 years of age, adult arrests refer to arrests by a person 18 years of age or older, and any arrest refers to juvenile or adult. Violent criminal behavior included arrests for murder/attempted murder, manslaughter/involuntary manslaughter, reckless homicide, rape, sodomy, robbery/robbery with injury, assault, assault and battery, aggravated assault, and battery/battery with injury. Age at first arrest was based on information from the official records. In addition, during the first interview, participants were asked to self-report whether they had ever engaged in a variety of <italic>violent behaviors</italic> based on the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1077559512460728">Wolfgang and Weiner (1989</xref>). Seven items reflect “severe violence,” including (1) hurt someone badly enough they required medical attention, (2) threatened someone because they wouldn’t give you money or something else, (3) used a weapon to threaten someone, (4) attacked someone with the purpose of killing them, (5) used physical force to get money or drugs, (6) forced someone to have sex with you, and (7) shot someone.</p>

<sec id="section16-1077559512460728">
<title>Possible Confounding Variables</title>
<sec id="section17-1077559512460728">
<title>Child characteristics</title>
<p>Information from the first interview was used to indicate whether the person reported being in trouble for misbehavior in school, skipped school or played hooky, or was expelled from school.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1077559512460728">
<title>Family characteristics</title>
<p>Information about characteristics of the family was based on responses to questions during the first interview about whether the participant had grown up in a single-parent household or had lived with two parents until 18 years of age, whether the family had received welfare when the person was a child, the size of the family (large family = 5 or more children), and whether either parent had ever had an alcohol or drug problem or had been arrested.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1077559512460728">
<title>Neighborhood characteristics</title>
<p>Data from the 1970 U.S. Census were used based on the participant’s address during 1967–1971. Six variables were used: percentage of families in the tract living on public assistance, below the poverty line, in single-parent homes, in the same house for at least 5 years, and in owner-occupied homes, and percentage of people with at least a college degree.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-1077559512460728">
<title>Trauma and victimization history</title>
<p>The Lifetime Trauma and Victimization History (LTVH) instrument (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1077559512460728">Widom, Dutton, Czaja, &amp; Dumont, 2005</xref>) was administered during the second interview (2000–2002). The LTVH is a 30-item comprehensive, easy to understand, and structured interview that asked participants about “serious events that may have happened to you during your lifetime.” The range of events includes seven different categories: general traumas (e.g., Have you ever been involved in a natural disaster, such as a tornado, hurricane, flood, or earthquake?); physical assault/abuse (e.g., Have you ever been shot at, stabbed, struck, kicked, beaten, punched, slapped around, or otherwise physically harmed?); sexual assault/abuse (e.g., Has anyone—male or female—ever forced or coerced you to engage in unwanted sexual activity?); family/friend murdered or committed suicide (e.g., Have you ever had an immediate family member, romantic partner, or very close friend who was murdered?); witnessed trauma to someone else (e.g., Have you ever seen or been present when someone was murdered or seriously injured?); crime victimization; and kidnapped or stalked. If the participant endorsed any trauma or victimization incident, follow-up questions were asked about the number of times the incident occurred, the relationship to the perpetrator, and the age at which the event last occurred. The LTVH demonstrates good predictive, criterion-related, and convergent validity and a high level of agreement between earlier and current reports of certain types of traumas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1077559512460728">Widom et al., 2005</xref>). Here, we only include childhood traumas and victimization experiences that occurred up to age 11.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-1077559512460728">
<title>Analyses</title>
<p>Cross-tabulations and logistic regressions were conducted with SPSS 17.0 (Chicago, Illinois) to assess differences between the neglect and control groups for Blacks, Whites, and Hispanics, separately. Because our interest is in consequences of childhood neglect specific to each race or ethnic group, we present all results separately for Blacks, Whites, and Hispanics and compare individuals with histories of neglect to the controls without such histories within each race and ethnic group. We report age- and sex-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to provide the reader with an estimate of the effect size since important findings may be overlooked with a focus on <italic>p</italic> values alone. <italic>T</italic> tests were conducted to assess the effect of group (neglect vs. control) on continuous outcomes. The <italic>N</italic> varies slightly across analyses because of missing data on different variables. Most variables had five or fewer cases with missing data, so listwise deletion was used in the analyses. Missing data was higher for the census data (<italic>N</italic> = 982), Quick Test (<italic>N</italic> = 1,030), and WRAT (<italic>N</italic> = 1,023). Although the size of the Hispanic group is small (<italic>N</italic> = 35), because there are so few studies of the consequences of neglect, we report results for the Hispanics in this sample but urge caution in interpreting the results.</p>

<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1077559512460728">Table 3</xref> presents information on the extent to which neglected children of different race and ethnic backgrounds differed from their respective controls in terms of official arrests for crime and violence and self-reports of violent behavior. As can be seen, Black neglected children were at increased risk for being arrested (any), arrested for a violent crime (any), arrested as a juvenile, and arrested for a violent crime as a juvenile, compared to Black controls. White neglected children, compared to White controls, were at increased risk for any arrest and for an arrest as a juvenile but not for violent crimes. It is noteworthy that the odds ratio for any arrest for neglected Hispanics compared to nonneglected Hispanics was larger than that for neglected Whites compared to White controls, even though not statistically significant. In addition, the trend for Hispanic neglected children, compared to Hispanic controls, was for decreased risk for arrest for a violent crime (any violent arrest or as a juvenile). In terms of the age of first arrest, Black neglected children were arrested at an earlier age than Black controls, whereas there were no differences in the age of first arrest for White neglected children compared to White controls. Hispanic neglected children showed the opposite pattern, in that they tended to be older at first arrest than Hispanic control children, although this trend was not statistically significant. Finally, the bottom of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1077559512460728">Table 3</xref> shows self-reported violent and serious violent behaviors. In contrast to the official arrest data, these results show that White neglected children reported significantly more violence than the White controls, whereas there were no differences between neglected and control Blacks and Hispanics.</p>

<title>Potential Confounding Factors</title>
<p>Because our theoretical framework recognizes that characteristics of the child, family, or neighborhood might contribute independently to outcomes for these children, we consider the role of several possible confounding factors. Given the differences in mental health outcomes, we also consider the extent to which neglected Blacks, Whites, and Hispanics might have experienced differences in the extent of additional traumas and victimizations, compared to controls.</p>

<title>Child characteristics</title>
<p>
<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1077559512460728">Table 4</xref> shows the extent to which these individuals had problems as a child (based on self-report and official record information). As can be seen, the pattern of results is quite similar for Black and White neglected children compared to their respective controls. Both groups of neglected children reported getting into trouble and being expelled or suspended from school significantly more often than the controls. In data not shown, both Black and White neglected children reported being significantly more likely to be picked up (and arrested) as a runaway compared to controls (Black neglected children compared to controls, 10.1% vs. 3.4%, OR = 3.23, 95% CI = [1.25, 8.33], and White neglected children compared to White controls, 4.9% vs. 1.9%, OR = 2.67, 95% CI = [1.03, 6.90]). We did not find a statistically significant difference for the Hispanics, although 11.1% of Hispanic neglected children were arrested and picked up for being a runaway, whereas none of the Hispanic controls had this experience. It is worth noting that the percentage of neglected Blacks and Hispanics who were picked up by the police for being a runaway was twice that of neglected White children.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Results from this investigation reveal similarities and differences in the long-term consequences of neglect for Black, White, and Hispanic children compared to same race and ethnic group controls. We found similar negative consequences for White and Black neglected children compared to White and Black controls on IQ, reading ability, and occupational status, and a trend for Hispanic neglected children that did not reach significance. Our results showed differences in mental health consequences, where neglected White children showed the most extensive mental health consequences (increases in risk for dysthymia, MDD, PTSD, ASPD, and conduct disorder), neglected Black children showed increased risk for generalized anxiety and dysthymia, and neglected Hispanic children showed increased risk for alcohol problems, compared to their respective controls. In terms of criminal consequences, Black and White neglected children were at increased risk for being arrested compared to Black and White controls, respectively. However, there were differences in the extent to which neglected Black and White children were at increased risk for violence that depended on the type of indicator (arrest vs. self-report). Neglected Blacks were arrested for violence (more than two times as likely as Black control children), whereas neglected Whites were not. Neglected Whites reported engaging in significantly more violence than White controls, whereas neglected Black children did not.</p>
<p>How to interpret these findings in light of the three theories outlined at the beginning of this article? We found some support for each of the hypotheses. Our findings with regard to IQ, reading ability, and occupational status lend some support to the racial invariance hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1077559512460728">Sampson &amp; Bean, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1077559512460728">Sampson &amp; Wilson, 1995</xref>), which suggests that the negative impact of social risks should be similar across different race and ethnic groups. These results are consistent with research showing the adverse effects of neglect on brain development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1077559512460728">De Bellis, 2005</xref>) which, in turn, have been linked to poor cognitive and academic outcomes. In turn, these academic disadvantages would likely exert a negative influence on occupational attainment in adulthood (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1077559512460728">Currie &amp; Widom, 2010</xref>). We also found that Black and White neglected children were at increased risk for homelessness and suicide attempts compared to Black and White controls, suggesting similarities in consequences associated with childhood neglect.</p>
<p>Our results also provide some support for the double jeopardy hypothesis; that is, for some outcomes, the effects of neglect were significant for Black or Hispanic neglected children, compared to controls but not for neglected White children. Neglect was a significant predictor of arrests for violence in Blacks (3½ times more likely for an arrest for violence as a juvenile and 2½ times more likely for any arrest for violence), whereas neglect was not predictive of violent arrests in Whites or Hispanics. By contrast, when self-reported violent behavior was examined, neglect predicted increased risk of self-reported violence for Whites, but did not predict self-reported violence for Blacks and Hispanics, compared to race and ethnic group controls.</p>
<p>The current findings might also be interpreted to provide some support for the resiliency hypothesis for a few specific outcomes. We found that neglected Black children had an increased risk for only two psychiatric disorders assessed here (dysthymia and generalized anxiety disorder) compared to Black controls, whereas neglected White children were at increased risk for several psychiatric disorders (dysthymia, MDD, PTSD, ASPD, and conduct disorder) compared to White controls. Given that others have linked cumulative stressors associated with minority status to greater psychological vulnerability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1077559512460728">McCleod &amp; Owens, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1077559512460728">Pearlin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1077559512460728">Wyatt, 1991</xref>), these findings warrant further consideration. First, the higher rates of traumatic experiences reported by neglected Whites compared to control Whites are consistent with an increased risk for psychopathology. Second, the increased risk of dysthymia for neglected Blacks, reflecting a chronic depressive disorder present for a minimum of two years, may be related to a lack of mental health services among the Black neglected children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1077559512460728">Diala et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1077559512460728">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2001</xref>). Similarly, our findings indicate that, compared to Black controls, Blacks with histories of child neglect were more likely to report pervasive worries and anxieties (i.e., generalized anxiety disorder) rather than reporting more event-specific PTSD symptoms. Third, it is also possible that individuals from minority backgrounds may be less willing to disclose mental health symptoms, which are often stigmatized in Black and Hispanic communities.</p>
<p>Cumulatively, these findings across mental health and arrest outcomes suggest that other factors may be at play. Institutional racism and views of children of color as potential gang members rather than youth or students, as well as the fears produced by these beliefs, may lead to referrals to juvenile rehabilitation or correctional systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077559512460728">Edelman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1077559512460728">Wyatt, 1990</xref>). Blacks are disproportionately represented in the juvenile and criminal justice systems and are more likely to be arrested and incarcerated for delinquent behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1077559512460728">Rosich, 2007</xref>). It is also possible that Black neglected children are more likely to end up in the juvenile justice system, because they have not received earlier mental services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1077559512460728">Rawal, Romansky, Jenuwine, &amp; Lyons, 2004</xref>) or because of biases and stereotypes that result in harsher consequences for minority youths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1077559512460728">Rosich, 2007</xref>). Black caregivers may be reluctant or unable to seek support from the mental health system for a number of reasons, including limited availability of mental health services in minority communities, the relative paucity of Black mental health providers, financial barriers, or stigma regarding mental health symptoms and services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1077559512460728">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2001</xref>). Thus, problems of neglected White children may be more likely to be addressed in the mental health system, whereas problems of neglected Black children may not be addressed until they end up in the juvenile justice system.</p>
<p>Although this study has numerous strengths, like any single study, several caveats are necessary. (1) Definitions of race and ethnicity are complicated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1077559512460728">Okazaki &amp; Sue, 1995</xref>). While self-defined race and ethnicity may be an appropriate method for measuring disparities in delivery of services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1077559512460728">Winker, 2004</xref>), this method of assessing race and ethnicity may not fully capture more nuanced aspects of being “Black” or “White.” Future research should include other relevant measures of race and ethnicity such as level of identification with one’s race and ethnicity, racial discrimination, and acculturation. (2) The standardized assessments and measures used here may not have consistent and similar meanings across different race, ethnic, and cultural groups. (3) Although potential control group members with official records of childhood abuse and neglect were eliminated from the sample, an unknown number of controls might have suffered childhood victimization that did not come to the attention of officials (false negatives). It should be noted that the design of the original study was an attempt to be conservative in assessing the consequences of child abuse or neglect and, thus, the presence of false negatives makes finding significant differences less (not more) likely. (4) While some evidence from this investigation suggests that the way institutions or systems respond may lead to different outcomes across races and ethnic groups, we did not explicitly examine this issue. Future research is needed to understand the institutional actions, criteria, and decision making that affects neglected children from different backgrounds. (5) Finally, the analyses employed here do not capture the kinds of complex systems and sociocultural factors that likely influence outcomes associated with childhood neglect across different racial and ethnic groups. This work represents a first step in our examination of these issues and provides a good road map for the next steps in this attempt to understand these relationships and outcomes. Future work is needed to examine potential mediators and moderators of some of these relationships and to conduct multilevel modeling to understand the contribution of contextual factors.</p>
<p>Ecological models and multilevel analytical techniques should lead to a richer and more complete understanding of the issues examined here. For example, it has often been thought that the consequences of childhood neglect are primarily the result of growing up in poverty, not the neglect experience per se. In a recent article using multilevel modeling to examine the roles of neighborhood, family, and individual factors in predicting a person’s risk for mental health and psychosocial outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1077559512460728">Nikulina, Widom, &amp; Czaja, 2010</xref>), three childhood characteristics—neglect, family poverty, and neighborhood poverty—were shown to have different effects on long-term development and the findings showed that childhood neglect has consequences of its own, distinct from poverty. Childhood neglect and childhood family poverty were important contributors to risk for PTSD, crime, and academic achievement, whereas childhood neighborhood poverty was not. Future research needs to consider the role of these “extra-individual” factors in understanding the developmental trajectories of neglected children and how changes in family poverty or neighborhood poverty over the life course may alter trajectories for children of different races and ethnic backgrounds.</p>
<p>Our findings have clinical implications. First, across these three different racial and ethnic groups, negative consequences associated with child neglect highlight the need for greater attention to childhood neglect and early recognition of the effects so that these children receive appropriate support and intervention. Second, these results support the need for interventions to modify the cognitive and neurological effects of neglect, which appear to affect children across the different races and ethnic backgrounds. Educational and job training programs may also have benefits for young adults with histories of childhood neglect. Third, our findings reinforce the need to study and ameliorate disproportionate minority contact within the juvenile justice system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1077559512460728">Huizinga, Thornberry, Knight, &amp; Lovegroove, 2007</xref>). Efforts need to be directed toward sensitizing practitioners to possible practices and institutional biases that result in neglected Black youths receiving harsher legal consequences. Fourth, since neglected Blacks were more likely to develop chronic problems of generalized anxiety and dysthymia, community mental health screenings and follow-up with neglected children might help to identify these conditions, which otherwise might be missed. Although more tentative, screening for drug and alcohol problems among individuals with neglect histories may be particularly beneficial for clinics and agencies serving Hispanic communities. Finally, it is important for service system agencies and mental health providers to recognize that minority race and ethnic background is not always a vulnerability factor but may be associated with cultural strengths that help to buffer against the effects of neglect.</p>
