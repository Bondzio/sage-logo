<p>These essays come from a March, 2008 conference at the Center for the study of Christianity at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. The book is divided into two halves, the first dealing with the “paradises of Second Temple Judaism and Christian origins” and the second with “contemporized traditions of paradise: Jews and Christians in late antiquity” (p. 12).</p>
<p>In the “Introduction,” Strousma discusses paradise both as something lost and something to be gained only in the future. By attributing sin to Adam, Christians “implicitly transformed” the story of Adam “into a myth about human nature” (p. 7). In so doing, especially in the comparison of Adam to Jesus, Christians “trivialized the place of Israel in the history of salvation” (p. 8). Joachim Schaper, “The Messiah in the Garden: John 19:38–41, (Royal) Gardens, and Messianic Concepts,” argues that gardens were often associated with royalty in the Ancient Near East, and John's depiction of Jesus' burial in the garden is highly suggestive that John is alluding to the royal status of Jesus. Maren R. Niehoff's “Philo's Scholarly Inquiries into the Story of Paradise” shows that Philo's reading of the Eden stories “combined for the first time stringent scholarship in the style of Demetrius and Homeric scholars with systematic allegorical readings,” but Philo believes these readings “had already been intended by Moses himself” (pp. 41–42).</p>
<p>In “Paradise in the Biblical Antiquities of Pseudo-Philo,” Richard Bauckham shows that the Biblical Antiquities understand paradise to be a place no longer accessible to human beings due to their transgression, but it “will become the dwelling place of the righteous after their resurrection from the dead” (p. 56). Martin Goodman, “Paradise, Gardens, and the Afterlife in the First Century <sc>ce</sc>,” argues that Josephus' failure to describe paradise as the dwelling place of the righteous after death suggests that Luke's description of paradise “was not yet common among Jews” (p. 62). Grant Macaskill, “Paradise in the New Testament” argues that, following a tradition in 1 Enoch, Luke's paradise refers to an intermediate stage between death and the full coming of the kingdom of God, that 2 Corinthians draws upon a tradition of four rabbis who entered heaven in Merkabah tradition, and that Revelation presents paradise as “perfect fellowship with God as a life-giving reality” (p. 77). The final essay in the first half of the book, Simon Gathercole's “Quis et unde? Heavenly Obstalces in Gos. Thom. 50 and Related Literature,” shows that GThom 49–50 should best be understood as questions posed by guardians who block heavenly ascent.</p>
<p>The second half of the book treats post-biblical understandings of paradise. Sabrina Inowlocki, “Tertullian's Law of Paradise (<italic>Adversus Judaeos</italic> 2): Reflections on a Shared Motif in Jewish and Christian Literature,” argues that Tertullian's understanding of a law given before the law to Moses at Sinai accords with rabbinic understanding, but in the case of Tertullian, this law makes the Mosaic law secondary, whereas for the Rabbis, the earlier law is not complete. In “The language of Paradise: Hebrew or Syriac? Linguistic Speculations and Linguistic Realities in Late Antiquity,” Yonatan Moss shows that there was disagreement over what language was spoken in paradise. Most Christian commentators suggested Hebrew, though rabbinic sources of the tannaitic period suggested Aramaic. Two fifth-century Christian sources, Theodore of Mopsuestia and Theodoret of Cyrrhus both argued that Syriac was the language of paradise. Menahem Kister, “The Tree of Life and the Turning Sword: Jewish Biblical Interpretation, Symbols, and Theological Patterns and their Christian Counterparts,” shows that for Jewish biblical interpreters of late antiquity, the “turning sword” used to protect the way to paradise was imagined by Jews as the knife by which circumcision was performed, while for Christians, it was equated to the spear that pierced Christ's side.</p>
<p>Galit Hasan-Rokem's, “Erotic Eden: A Rabbinic Nostalgia for Paradise,” shows that, according to the Rabbis sex was one of three ways to experience paradise, but it had both positive and negative effects because it was a means “momentarily experiencing paradise on this side of the fiery sword,” but it also “reminds humans again and again of the imagined lost totality of the past” (p. 162). Gillian Clark, “Paradise for Pagans? Augustine on Virgil, Cicero, and Plato,” shows that Augustine, while drawing on these ancient authorities, understood their visions of the blessed life to fall short since they did not envision a union of both body and soul with God. Emile Perreau-Saussine, “Heaven as a Political Theme in Augustine's <italic>City of God,”</italic> demonstrates that Augustine, though he thought the city of God could be expressed on earth through acts of charity, did not share Eusebius' view that Rome, even after Constantine, was the expression of the city of God on earth. Markus Bockmuehl, “Locating Paradise,” shows that it was not until after the fifteenth century that Eden was no longer considered a place upon the earth to which explorers could travel.</p>
<p>Alessandro Scafi's “Epilogue: A Heaven on Earth,” summarizes the discussion of the contributors to the book. Despite the fact that this collection contains many interesting articles, the fact that some of the arguments are fairly technical and not all of the ancient languages are translated in the book, its usefulness will be primarily to advanced graduate students and scholars.</p>
