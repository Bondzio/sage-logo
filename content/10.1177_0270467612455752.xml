<p>Three theories accurately predict and describe the behavior of industry, its lobbyists, and consultants in terms of dealing with the serious health, social, and environmental effects of its activities and products. These are the theory of preventive engineering, the theory of the corporation as a psychopathic legal person, and the theory of law as organization. I will briefly describe these theories and report on how industry deals with those who blow the whistle on adverse effects of their products or activities.</p>
<p>The theory of preventive approaches is designed to reorganize the knowledge base that contemporary societies use for evolving their ways of life to open up a vast potential for making decisions with a higher ratio of desired to undesired effects in every sphere of human life. The nonpreventive orientation of our scientific approach to knowing and our technical approach to doing is rooted in their discipline-based organization. These approaches were premised on human life, society, and the biosphere all being separable and divisible into distinct categories of phenomena that could be examined one at a time. Physical phenomena thus became the business of physicists, chemical phenomena of chemists, biological phenomena of biologists, social phenomena of sociologists, political phenomena of political scientists, and so on. This discipline-based approach to scientific knowing has clear and obvious limitations. It works extremely well where the influence of one category of phenomena dwarfs the influences of all others so that these can be neglected. It does not work very well for those situations in which several categories of phenomena make important contributions, so that these cannot be understood as one category of phenomena at a time. The reason that physics became the model discipline and that many other disciplines failed to replicate its success is therefore apparent. Physics happens to study situations in which physical phenomena dwarf all others, as is the case for the big bang and the subatomic world. Generally speaking, the social and life sciences were not so fortunate because living entities are characterized by many different categories of phenomena evolving in relation to each other and thus making nonnegligible contributions.</p>
<p>The same kinds of issues arise in our discipline-based approach to technical doing. For example, the designing and building of a nuclear bomb is predominantly a matter of exploiting physical phenomena. However, the moment it is exploded the aftereffects soon mingle with every imaginable category of phenomena. Although the consequences of most devices are much less powerful, they nevertheless transform everything they touch.</p>
<p>The “world” of technology has a mechanistic order, which lends itself very well to discipline-based approaches to knowing and doing. For example, a chemical plant is organized in terms of reaction vessels into which different chemical compounds are introduced. The products thus created are piped to another reaction vessel, where the next chemical reaction takes place. This continues until the final product emerges. Similarly, electrical circuits exclude all but electrical phenomena. Technological products, processes, and systems are built up from separate but interacting domains in which one category of phenomena is endlessly repeated to contribute one subfunction to the larger entity. The inputs received for each domain are endlessly transformed into the desired suboutputs, which become the inputs into another domain, and this is continued until the desired result is achieved. In my book, <italic>Our War on Ourselves</italic>, I have shown that every single technological artifact, including cars, computers, buildings, and all infrastructures, share this mechanistic-information order, which is ideally suited to discipline-based approaches. However, insofar as these are embedded in and interact with living entities, serious antilife biases are created when discipline-based approaches are used. All this can be correlated with the spectacular successes and equally spectacular failures of our civilization: We excel in improving the efficiency and power of technical devices and systems, but we fail almost completely to ensure that these can harmoniously coexist and evolve with all living entities.</p>
<p>Our discipline-based approaches to scientific knowing and technical doing are destructive of life in four important ways.</p>
<p>First, discipline-based expertise is separated from human life and the world through a triple abstraction. As an example, consider what happens in our hospitals. Since many different phenomena are involved in their operations, there is no one discipline that corresponds to hospitals. To bring discipline-based knowing and doing to bear on their operations, hospitals must be abstracted from the world, which is replaced with the “inputs” of sick or injured people received and the “outputs” of discharged patients returned to it. Before anyone can participate in the healing process that transforms these inputs into outputs, they must further abstract from it those aspects commensurate with their disciplines or specialties. Doctors, nurses, physiotherapists, nutritionists, psychiatrists, social workers, information systems specialists, administrators, accountants, maintenance engineers, public relations specialists, and security consultants all know different aspects according to their disciplines. Since these disciplines exclude how the running of a hospital interacts with everything else, specialists cannot decide between alternative courses of action in response to an issue on the basis of what is best for human life, society, and the biosphere. They cannot use the values of their culture, from which they have abstracted all they could, leaving only the part of the healing process related to their discipline and whatever interventions they return to this process—and this can be measured only in terms of output-input ratios abstracted from human values. As a result, the discipline-based division of labor in hospitals carries on as if these hospitals were organized in terms of separate and distinct domains in which one category of phenomena, corresponding to a single discipline or specialty, contributes a subfunction first to the healing process and then, via it, to the functioning of hospitals. Everything these discipline-based specialists do is thus separated from human life and society via a triple abstraction, and their collective efforts build a technical order that evolves without making any reference to sense.</p>
<p>A second important consequence of discipline-based approaches results from the fact that specialists suspended in this triple abstraction cannot intellectually “see,” let alone deal with, most of the negative consequences of their decisions because these fall beyond their domains of expertise. They cannot symbolize their professional experiences in relation to everything else, with the result that they are unable to see out of their disciplines (justly referred to as <italic>silos</italic>) in order to adjust their decision making to achieve their goals and at the same time prevent or greatly minimize undesired and harmful effects. The daily-life equivalent would be to train people to drive their cars by having them concentrate on their performance as indicated by the gauges on the dashboard and only occasionally glance out of their windows when they hear a scream or a crash. As a result, the many undesired and harmful consequences of discipline-based decision making must be dealt with in an end-of-pipe fashion. Additional goods and services must be created to mitigate or compensate for these effects; and this has become so expensive that we have all but given up on effective regulation. It has also transformed wealth creation into wealth extraction.</p>
<p>The third consequence makes matters even worse, because all that the discipline-based approach to knowing and doing can do is to improve the performance of everything. When genuine solutions require prevention by better adaptation and evolution, this approach to knowing and doing is structurally incapable of providing them. For example, the gridlock in many cities will not be resolved by endlessly optimizing the carrying capacities of our transportation systems. In addition to “supply-side” approaches that increase carrying capacity, “demand-side” approaches are essential to reduce our need for mobility. These transcend the usual disciplines. In the meantime, most discipline-based solutions lead to further deterioration in the compatibility between people, their transportation needs, urban forms, and the biosphere.</p>
<p>Finally, individual specialists and their collective efforts through the current intellectual and professional division of labor behave as if human life and the world were organized in the image of conventional or information machines, meaning that they are built up from distinct and separate domains, each of which has one category of phenomena contributing a subfunction. If we ever needed evidence that human life and the world are not organized in this way, it is surely furnished by the mushrooming human, social, and environmental crises of our time.</p>
<p>In sum, discipline-based approaches to technical doing excel in obtaining the greatest possible desired outputs from the requisite inputs, but fail to ensure that this performance is not achieved at the expense of their compatibility with human life, society, and the biosphere. Any of the latter issues can thus be dealt with only by end-of-pipe approaches, which are very expensive, displace the incompatibility problem from one area to another, and fail to address the incompatibility issues at their roots. In other words, this theory (although summarized here in a very abbreviated form) can accurately predict the characteristics of industrial activities and products. In contrast, preventive approaches in engineering, management, and economics can substantially improve the ratios of desired to undesired effects of industrial activities and products.</p>
<p>The theory and practice of preventive approaches was recognized by the Canada Foundation for Innovation in 2002 as one of 25 most important recent Canadian innovations. In 1995, it was the basis for my appointment to cochair a round table for the former Premier’s Council of Ontario. Its purpose was to prepare a blueprint for deep reform of higher education in order to create an economy capable of producing goods and services with a far lower burden imposed on human life, society, and the biosphere. In 2003, it was one of the approaches to be incorporated into a similar attempt by two Canadian federal research councils. It also led to my induction as a fellow in the Canadian Academy of Engineering. Preventive engineering is a subset of preventive approaches, which had its roots in a study of North American undergraduate engineering education that showed that future engineers learn almost nothing about how technology influences human life, society, and the biosphere, and even less about how to use this understanding to adjust design and decision making in order to achieve the desired goals but at the same time prevent or greatly minimize harmful effects. The economic consequences of these effects are now so significant that, when net wealth production is calculated by subtracting the costs incurred from the gross domestic product (the value of all goods and services produced), net wealth production has not increased in 50 years. When it is calculated for people in the so-called middle class, it has fallen by almost one half.</p>
<p>Although the deficiencies in engineering education were widely reported to the profession and its accreditation boards, the results of the study were entirely ignored. Since this violates the profession’s responsibility to comprehensively protect the public interest, I have recently called for my profession to be placed under public control.</p>
<p>The only existing program in preventive engineering is in the Faculty of Applied Science &amp; Engineering at the University of Toronto, and it will be shut down when the current director retires. It is not a question of a lack of demand. The students have even signed petitions. However, some of the rank and file faculty members in engineering seem to be threatened by preventive approaches because they obviously call into question their courses and professional activities. Over the last 25 years, many attempts have been made to discredit the program, but because of the strong and enthusiastic support of students they have always failed. The faculty has now decided to create a number of “end-of-pipe” minors, which compensate for, as opposed to directly addressing the problems of undergraduate education at their roots. Those dealing with energy and the environment are obvious examples. Since this faculty had an alternative available, they are arguably disregarding their professional responsibility to protect the public interest in a comprehensive manner.</p>
<p>These kinds of developments put industry between a rock and a hard place. Currently, corporations have no choice but to employ engineers, managers, economists, and other specialists educated in nonpreventive discipline-based approaches. As in the economy, it has caused the costs associated with the production of wealth to skyrocket. There is no future of any kind in end-of-pipe approaches. I am not claiming that all issues can be dealt with preventively but a great many can and thus offer cost-effective alternatives. In the meantime, corporations have no option but to comply with regulations by adding end-of-pipe devices or services, thus externalizing these problems to be taken care of by society, and to lobby the regulators to weaken appropriate standards as much as possible. The World Trade Organization has now created a level playing field by which any and all of these standards can be deemed to be trade barriers, thus making a complete mockery of democracy. It is, of course, easy to dismiss this kind of diagnosis as left-wing propaganda. However, preventive approaches that could flourish in reorganized public universities hold the key to permitting the global community to set the appropriate protective standards that could give us a chance at a livable and sustainable future. Such standards could be met in a cost-effective manner by means of preventive approaches, and as these advance through research, the standards could progressively be raised. In the meantime, the World Trade Organization permits corporations to move to those areas on the planet where costs can be externalized to the greatest extent possible for lack of appropriate standards. It has institutionalized what Ralph Estes has called “the tyranny of the bottom line,” which sooner or later will undermine everything we have gained in the last 200 years. The current systemic human, social, economic, and environmental problems are symptoms of a technical order that is fundamentally incompatible with living orders. Until we get the message that there is no political solution but that there are possibilities of reforming our discipline-based approaches to scientific knowing and technical doing, the future looks extremely bleak, and we are all doing what is against our own long-term interests. It has unleashed what I have called “our war on ourselves.”</p>
<p>The theory of corporations as psychopathic legal entities was advanced by Professor Joel Bakan. As long as these corporations employ specialists in the nonpreventive discipline-based approaches to knowing and doing, they will continue to deal with their human, social, and environmental problems associated with their activities and products in the way briefly sketched above. Moreover, their behavior is sanctioned, if not condoned, by the World Trade Organization, which is not really accountable to anyone in a significant manner. There is no democratic country I know of that was given the opportunity to vote on free trade agreements. Generally speaking, politicians are unwilling or unable to suggest that the current practices are against all our long-term interests, including those of corporations.</p>
<p>Professor Bakan’s study shows that corporations tend to behave as psychopathic entities by refusing to take any responsibility for the harm they cause; and if caught in violation of regulations, they treat any fines as a cost of doing business. It is true that if human beings behaved in this manner, they would be prosecuted, fined, and probably jailed, but not if they are the executives responsible for these corporations. All this is exact but it fails to see that in other respects, corporations are not individuals but global organizational structures whose behavior is entirely predictable in terms of the characteristics of discipline-based approaches to knowing and doing.</p>
<p>The Union of Concerned Scientists has warned that this kind of behavior has substantially corrupted science, as companies with vested interests exercise a major influence on research findings affecting their businesses. Their report, titled “Heads They Win, Tails We Lose,” describes five basic methods used by corporations to influence science. These include suppressing research, intimidating scientists, manipulating research designs, producing and ghostwriting journal articles, and selectively reviewing the literature according to their own interests. For example, reporting that “there is no scientific evidence” is code for the fact that the appropriate studies have not yet been done or have been successfully blocked. On websites and in reports, this distorted scientific picture is used to influence public opinion by exaggerating uncertainty, downplaying contrary evidence, silencing the opposition by legal actions, and so on. Advisory panels to policy making bodies are stacked with enough people to ensure that vested interests will be well represented or overrepresented. Billions of dollars are spent on lobbying national and international bodies, and political donations ensure access to politicians. To improve the likelihood of a steady flow of funds, these politicians seek to weaken any scientific consensus that could stand in the way, use the doubt they cast on any consensus in order to justify not taking any decisive action, and thus ensure that distorted science shapes policy making. Think tanks, lobbyists, and consultants also have an undue influence on the courts. Who has the deep pockets needed to represent the public interest? Which faculty associations or universities will stand up to these pressures when so much of their funding depends on corporations? Why do federal funding agencies demand that a great deal of university research have industry partners, which in this way have an undue influence on the research agenda? What is still public about the public university in terms of serving the common good? We may have some awareness of how the pharmaceutical industry attempts to influence medical journals and how some mining companies have silenced their opponents in the courts by legally bankrupting them. However, few of us appreciate the scope and depth of the corruption of our entire knowledge system. The above report documents the alarming situation.</p>
<p>The behavior of corporations is deeply rooted in the way all contemporary societies evolved their ways of life: by means of more discipline-based approaches to knowing and doing. It corresponds to what my French mentor, Jacques Ellul, has called technique. Fortunately, it is only if we deal with the negative consequences of our technical creations in an end-of-pipe fashion that the setting of appropriate standards is impossible and will bankrupt us in the long term. Preventive approaches, however, steer technical projects much like the way we drive our cars. We look out of our windows to see who and what else is using the road around us as a basis for making steering and pedal corrections. Nevertheless, our civilization continues to do the equivalent of staring at the gauges on the dashboard to optimize the performance of the vehicle and looking out of the windows only when screams and crashes are heard or if the vehicle stops moving. It is possible to arrive at design exemplars (distinct from analytical exemplars derived from disciplines) that have vastly superior ratios of desired to undesired effects through preventive approaches. In <italic>Our War on Ourselves</italic>, I have shown how university reforms can unleash the potential of preventive approaches to open up an entirely different economic, social, and environmental future.</p>
<p>The third theory that predicts society’s response to the above situation, one advanced by Jacques Ellul, is that of the law acting as a technical means for organizing society to accept what the “system” does. He taught me to ask the question whether the law rules technology or whether technology rules the law. If the latter appears to be the case, as my colleague Jennifer Chandler has shown, technology as a subset of technique contributes to the latter’s autonomy. Much of the literature leaves entirely unexamined the obvious consequences of the fact that our relations with our surroundings are always reciprocal in character. We express ourselves and influence these surroundings, but they simultaneously influence us because we symbolize our experiences by means of synaptic and neural modifications to the organization of our brain-minds. Hence, as we change our surroundings, our surroundings simultaneously change us. If the former interaction is the stronger we remain free, while if the latter becomes the dominant one, alienation occurs.</p>
<p>Our current justice system is a perfect example of this situation. It has little or nothing to do with justice or defending the common good. It has become a technique for organizing a society in the grip of technique. In the case of industry, the law can be used to organize and manage any public protest. It is not simply a matter of the well-known S.L.A.A.P.P. (Strategic Legal Action Against Public Participation) suits. A much more effective way of legally intimidating any whistle-blowers or protesters are the so-called letters of demand. Even though these may have no legal merit whatsoever, they can have the powerful effect of intimidating anyone because of the possibility of bankruptcy as a consequence of having to defend oneself. We no longer live in a society in which one is innocent until proven guilty. These kinds of legal actions tend to have the same effect as being found guilty by penalizing us with crippling legal costs, while corporations have deep legal pockets and can simply write these expenses off as a cost of doing business without any remorse whatsoever. Lawyers who are employed in this way appear to have no idea what the consequences of their actions are.</p>
<p>In this drama, the public health community deserves special consideration. Its members are being educated in the previously mentioned discipline-based approaches, which have the same devastating effects. We do not have health care. What we have is end-of-pipe “disease care.” There is overwhelming evidence how the current “system” manufactures physical and mental illness at unprecedented rates, in a large measure because of the nonpreventive orientation of engineering, management, economics, and public policy. The agribusiness system is designed to optimize efficiency, productivity, and profitability, not nutrition. The effects were clearly shown in the movie “Supersize Me.” The usual objection that this movie shows an extreme case is rather silly because it is in this manner that we test drugs on animals and human beings: high-dosage short-duration testing, because long-term, low-dosage testing (including the testing for synergistic effects) is not feasible for practical and economic reasons.</p>
<p>To illustrate the point that workplaces generate disease, at one point Blue Cross was the largest supplier of the largest corporation in the world. Apparently, sick workers were its most valuable “product.” All this has been well documented by socio-epidemiology, showing how workplaces manufacture both physical and mental illness. In the same vein, the way we design cities unleashes a great many forces and stressors that make it much more difficult for us to live together and for this habitat to sustain our activities. These forces and stressors lead to strain, which translates over time into physical and mental illness. Many more such examples can be found. All this is simply the consequence of a nonpreventively oriented “system.” Since we manufacture disease at an unprecedented rate, we had better have the best possible disease care. However, there is no future in this business. Soon our health care budgets will overwhelm everything else, given the rate at which they are growing. The public health community as a whole has not yet awakened to this situation. Manufacturing disease is not the exception but the rule.</p>
<p>As the editor of this journal, I encounter from time to time an entirely new kind of academic article written by people with vested interests. The usual academic writing is transformed into a high level of “public relations speak”: Many statements are designed to create certain impressions, as opposed to accurately reporting scientific findings. Our referees must be notified to handle these articles from this perspective. Moreover, the same kind of trickery has been used for writing mandates for commissions of inquiry. These are usually charged with investigating the available evidence. Finding little or none, these commissions do not ask why this is the case. Was government lobbied not to fund the necessary studies? To what extent was the dependence on industry support for academic research a means of ensuring that the problems would not be studied? It is surprising that in jurisdiction after jurisdiction, these questions are not asked. In these cases, “no evidence” means that the appropriate investigations have not been done. Fortunately, the medical world is beginning to speak out. For example, the <italic>British Medical Journal</italic> recently published a peer-reviewed editorial speaking out on the health issues of wind turbines. The Canadian hearings on this technology are also slowly moving in the right direction.</p>
<p>As an editor, I have also learned that authors who act as scientific whistle-blowers and their referees may need additional protection. In some instances, referees were willing to do their work on condition that they be provided with additional protection of anonymity beyond the usual because their jobs could be at risk. In one instance, all parties were approached in an attempt to obtain the referee reports. One author immediately notified me, and additional measures were taken to ensure that the promised confidentiality would not be bridged. Following this, there was an attempt to discredit this journal, its authors, and referees on a blog. Fortunately, these claims were silly to the point that a careful reader should have been able to detect a clear conflict of interest. No action on my part was required.</p>
<p>However, the growing use of legal measures in attempts to silence scientific whistle-blowers is deeply disturbing to many of us who perform our academic roles as editors, editorial board members, authors, and referees. If governments are not prepared to stop these measures by enacting legislation to protect us when we carry out our duties with due diligence, the integrity of scientific publishing, academic freedom, and the independence of university research will be threatened in a manner that is not in anyone’s long-term interest. Whistle-blowing does everyone a huge favor: Early detection of serious issues can prevent a lot of harm as well as the enormous legal bills associated with hearings, commissions, and lawsuits. Whistle-blowing coupled with preventive approaches offer a much more cost-effective alternative by redesigning the technology or product in question.</p>
<p>As a civilization that entrusts all knowing to science and all doing to technique, we behave as if our actions in moving forward with these approaches to knowing and doing are not indissociably linked to the vast influences of science, technique, and economic growth on human life, society, and the biosphere. For at least a century these, our most powerful creations, appear to have had a much more decisive influence on us than we have had on them. If our influence had been more decisive than those of our own creations, many of our economic, social, and environmental problems would not have occurred, or might have been less serious. In other words, the lack of negative feedback discussed earlier for the professions has become characteristic of our entire civilization, and this does not bode well for our ability to create a more livable and sustainable future. Many science, technology, and society programs in our universities have never played the essential and decisive role of providing our societies with some negative feedback regarding the use of science and technique. Many have been discontinued, and the survivors appear to be mostly on life support. Some of the alternatives, including Science and Technology Studies, are in an even worse position to provide us with negative feedback. Apparently, our secular religious devotion to science, technique, and economic growth is without limits; and this will get us into a great deal more trouble. It is the equivalent of driving a car by concentrating on its performance as indicated by the gauges on the dashboard. We appear to be in an all-out war against ourselves.</p>
