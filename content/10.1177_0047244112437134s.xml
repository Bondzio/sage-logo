<p>In this study John D. Pizer sets himself the limited but exacting task of analysing the fictional presentation of the <italic>Goethezeit</italic>, long considered the ‘Golden Age’ of German literature, in the post-war period in East and West Germany. Following the creation of two separate German states, both the GDR and the FRG sought to co-opt the figure of Goethe for their respective ideological and artistic purposes: remarkably, both claimed success in this enterprise. Already in 1932, Thomas Mann had hailed Goethe as ‘a representative of the bourgeois age’, whereas Georg Lukács was to argue that Goethean classicism represented a stage in the intellectual development of Marxism. (The background here, as Pizer acknowledges, is the veneration for Goethe − his cultural <italic>Gleichschaltung</italic>, so to speak − in the Third Reich.)</p>
<p>The complexity of the image of Goethe that emerges from, say, Thomas Mann’s <italic>Lotte in Weimar</italic> (1939), is matched by the many different treatments of Germany’s most canonical writer from the late 1960s to the present, including (in the GDR) Peter Hack’s <italic>Ein Gespräch im Hause Stein über den abwesenden Herrn von Goethe</italic> (1974), Johanna Hoffmann’s <italic>Charlotte von Stein: Goethe und ich werden niemals Freunde</italic> (1988), and (in the FRG and post-unification Germany) Sigrid Damm’s <italic>Cornelia Goethe</italic> (1987), Otto Böhmer’s <italic>Der junge Herr Goethe</italic> (1999) and Martin Walser’s <italic>Ein liebender Mann</italic> (2008). (One could do worse than to regard Pizer’s study as a sort of annotated reading list, pointing us in the direction of the numerous texts available.)</p>
<p>As Pizer himself points out, the 1970s did not mark the beginning of German literary engagement with the <italic>Goethezeit</italic>, given that Goethe had cast the neoclassical author Christoph Martin Wieland as a character in <italic>Götter, Helden und Wieland</italic> (1774), while Goethe himself had become a character in J. M. R. Lenz’s <italic>Pandämonium Germanicum</italic> (1775). And he touches on the earlier obsession of Heidegger for Hölderlin (p. 73), arising in part from his resonance in the circles around Stefan George. In fact, as well as the eponymous author of the <italic>Goethezeit</italic>, other figures have received similarly intensive treatment, including Hölderlin — in Stephan Hermlin’s <italic>Scardanelli</italic> (1970) and Gerhard Wolf’s <italic>Der arme Hölderlin</italic> (1972) from the GDR and Peter Weiss’s drama <italic>Hölderlin</italic> (1971) and Peter Härtling’s novel <italic>Hölderlin</italic> (1976) from the GDR − and Kleist — in Christa Wolf’s <italic>Kein Ort. Nirgends</italic> (1979), Günter Kunert’s <italic>Ein anderer K.</italic> (1976; 1977), and Karin Reschke’s <italic>Verfolgte des Glücks: Findebuch der Henriette Vogel</italic> (1982). In the third chapter, the historical novels of Renate Feyl (who was born in Prague in 1944, grew up in Jena, and worked in the GDR as a journalist in Berlin, where she still lives) receive particular attention, in view of their treatment of Luise Gottsched (in <italic>Idylle mit Professor</italic> (1986)), Sophie La Roche (in <italic>Die profanen Stunden des Glücks</italic> (1996)), and Caroline von Wolzogen (in <italic>Das sanfte Joch der Vortrefflichkeit</italic> (1999)), as well as the relationship between Prussia’s Sophie Charlotte and G. W. Leibniz (in <italic>Aussicht auf bleibende Helle: Die Königin und der Philosoph</italic> (2006)).</p>
<p>For all that there were contrasting national affiliations between East and West in the impact and form of <italic>Goethezeit</italic> fiction, the attitudes and styles in the fictional engagements with this period in German culture are too disparate to allow general conclusions to be drawn. Perhaps the exception here is the figure of Goethe himself, for whom ‘the distinct lack of veneration, indeed antipathy’ with which he is treated as a historical figure is ‘a consistent feature’ in GDR, FRG and contemporary fiction (p. 191). We have come a long way from the view held by Mann or Hesse (in <italic>Der Steppenwolf</italic>) of Goethe as ‘a cosmpolitan humanist’ (p. 16), and Pizer argues that Hesse was unique in creating</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>a fictional Goethe, who … not only reflects contemporary critiques of the poet and anticipates the late-twentieth-century fictional persiflage of this author, but … deflect[s] such criticism and emerge[s] as an ideal archetype, the venerable, indeed immortal old man who teaches one to live joyfully in the present. (p. 17)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Do modern representations of Goethe, then, ultimately tell us more about ourselves than they do about him? After all, the recent success of Daniel Kehlmann’s novel about Alexander von Humboldt and Carl Friedrich Gauß, <italic>Die Vermessung der Welt</italic> (2005), bears out the claim made by Renate Feyl during an interview with Pizer in 2008 (p. 90): the more we are moving towards Europe, the greater the need is becoming to experience something from one’s own history, from one’s own traditions and roots.</p>
