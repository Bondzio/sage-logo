<abstract>
<p>Elementary students (<italic>N</italic> = 104) at risk for severe behavior problems or with special education eligibility participated in three validity studies of the daily progress report (DPR) used in a Tier 2 behavioral intervention known as <italic>Check, Connect, and Expect</italic> (CCE). In Study 1, the relationship between teachers’ ratings of students’ externalizing problem behavior and students’ DPR scores was established. In Study 2, behavior specialists’ use of the DPR to make student treatment decisions in the CCE program was partially validated. The utility of placing students with low DPR percentages into interventions based on functional behavior assessment (FBA) was validated. In Study 3, the treatment duration of 4 weeks above the 75th percentile on the DPR proved to be an efficacious treatment outcome predictor versus 8 weeks duration, which was originally recommended in the CCE protocol. Future implementation of the CCE program would suggest assigning students who meet the 4-week DPR criterion to the self-monitoring phase of the intervention, allowing behavior specialists more time to facilitate individualized FBA-based interventions for students who fail to respond to the basic intervention.</p>

<p>The school-wide positive behavior support model (SWPBS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1098300712438942">Sugai &amp; Horner, 2009</xref>) recommends three tiers of prevention and intervention to effectively provide behavioral services for all students. The second tier is for students who are at risk for developing severe behavior problems. Behavioral interventions, such as <italic>Check, Connect, and Expect</italic> (CCE; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1098300712438942">Cheney et al., 2009</xref>), the <italic>Behavior Education Program</italic> (BEP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1098300712438942">Crone, Horner, &amp; Hawken, 2004</xref>), and <italic>Check-in and Check-out</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1098300712438942">Campbell &amp; Anderson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1098300712438942">Filter, McKenna, Benedict, Horner, &amp; Todd, 2007</xref>) have shown treatment efficacy in the reduction of students’ problem behavior. In these interventions daily progress reports (DPRs) served as a progress-monitoring tool and were designed to provide students with specific daily behavioral feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1098300712438942">Campbell &amp; Anderson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1098300712438942">Cheney et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1098300712438942">Filter et al., 2007</xref>). In addition, studies have shown that DPRs can be used for treatment decisions to implement individualized behavior interventions based on functional behavior assessment (FBA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1098300712438942">Campbell &amp; Anderson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1098300712438942">Filter et al., 2007</xref>). However, there are no published studies regarding a <italic>unified concept of validity</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1098300712438942">Messick, 1995</xref>) in the use of DPRs within a response-to-intervention (RtI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1098300712438942">Gresham, 2007</xref>) model for students at risk for behavior disorders in SWPBS systems.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1098300712438942">Messick’s (1995)</xref> seminal article on the validity of inferences based on psychological assessment, he discussed the concept of a <italic>unified validity</italic> that integrates traditional indices of <italic>construct validity</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1098300712438942">Cronbach &amp; Meehl, 1955</xref>) with other forms of validity. Cronbach and Meehl included <italic>criterion-referenced</italic> validity as an aspect of construct validity. They also indicate that the criteria should be derived from factor-analyzed multiple measures of the proposed construct.</p>
<p>In addition to traditional validity indices, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1098300712438942">Messick (1995)</xref> described <italic>consequential aspects</italic> of validity as the decisions made regarding the construct validated scores. Within the RtI model, test scores are used to make treatment decisions requiring <italic>treatment validity</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1098300712438942">Gresham, 2007</xref>). Behavior analysts describe treatment validity as the use of FBA to derive functionally relevant interventions with the result being a reduction in the problem behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1098300712438942">Cone, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1098300712438942">Hayes, Nelson, &amp; Jarrett, 1987</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1098300712438942">Elliott, Gresham, Frank, and Beddow (2008)</xref> extend treatment validity to include social skills rating scales in what they term <italic>intervention validity</italic>. Both treatment and intervention validity are aspects of consequential validity that require the use of behavioral assessment or rating scale data to assess the need for intervention as well as to show that the intervention has been successful in reducing the problem behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1098300712438942">Elliott et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1098300712438942">Messick’s (1995)</xref> unified validity also includes <italic>social consequences</italic>, which are derived from the social implications of assessments. Although underrepresented as a validity consideration, <italic>treatment duration</italic> has been recognized by the National Institute of Mental Health, the MacArthur Foundation, and the Child and Adolescent Psychosocial Interventions Consortium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1098300712438942">Hibbs, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1098300712438942">1998</xref>) as an important consideration of treatment utility or intervention validity. Empirical review of evidenced-based interventions for students with disruptive behavior disorders has included treatment duration as a relevant social consequence to identify resources and expectations of clinical treatments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1098300712438942">Garland, Hawley, Brookman-Frazee, &amp; Hurlburt, 2008</xref>). This study addressed three different aspects of Messick’s unified validity, which pertain to the CCE program’s use of an RtI process for students at risk for severe behavior disorders.</p>
<p>Data used in this study come from a 2-year efficacy study of the CCE program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1098300712438942">Cheney et al., 2009</xref>) that found 60% of the randomly assigned CCE students met the DPR target criterion of 75% for at least an 8-week period and graduated from the program. Successful students showed significant reductions on the problem behavior scale of the <italic>Social Skills Rating Scale</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1098300712438942">Gresham &amp; Elliott, 1990</xref>) and the externalizing and internalizing problem behavior scales on the <italic>Teacher Report Form</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1098300712438942">Achenbach, 2001</xref>) compared to control participants with estimated effect sizes of .74, .57, and .54, respectively, using Cohen’s <italic>d</italic>. The program used an Internet-based DPR for behavior specialists to monitor student progress and make treatment decisions regarding five different interventions.</p>
<p>This article reports on three different studies that address the validity in the use of the DPR for treatment decisions within the CCE program. The studies address (a) the <italic>criterion-referenced validity</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1098300712438942">Cronbach &amp; Meehl, 1955</xref>) of the DPR in relationship to standardized student outcomes of interest (i.e., externalizing and internalizing problem behavior, social skills, and academic skills), (b) the <italic>treatment utility</italic> or intervention validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1098300712438942">Cone, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1098300712438942">Elliott et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1098300712438942">Hayes et al., 1987</xref>) based on change in DPRs in relation to treatment decisions and student outcomes in an RtI model (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1098300712438942">Gresham, 2007</xref>), and (c) the <italic>treatment duration</italic> to achieve reduction of problem behavior to normal levels in relationship to level of DPRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1098300712438942">Garland et al., 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>Sample and Participant Selection</title>
<sec id="section3-1098300712438942">
<title>Schools</title>
<p>Participants were recruited from 18 elementary schools that were randomly assigned to intervention and comparison conditions within 3 school districts (i.e., 6 schools per district: 3 intervention and 3 comparison) located in the northwestern United States. Principals were informed that schools would be randomly assigned to intervention or comparison conditions prior to implementation based on stratified sampling procedures.</p>
<p>Schools were matched on four demographic variables: school size, percentage of students with individualized education programs (IEPs), percentage of students receiving free or reduced-price lunch, and percentage of White students. Schools in the study had enrollments ranging from 275 to 600 students; 6.0% to 12.5% received special education services, 53% received free or reduced-price meals, and 52.3% of the students were identified as White. One school in each matched pair was randomly assigned as an intervention or a comparison school. No significant differences were found between intervention and control schools for school size, percentage of students in special education, percentage of students receiving free or reduced-price lunch, or percentage of White students.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1098300712438942">
<title>Student screening for at-risk status</title>
<p>Students were identified for participation by using the <italic>Systematic Screening for Behavior Disorders</italic> (SSBD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1098300712438942">Walker &amp; Severson, 1992</xref>), which was conducted by the second month of the school year (see a description of the SSBD in the Measures section). In addition, some students identified with disabilities were screened into the project but received CCE intervention only if their IEP team agreed that it would be an acceptable approach to meet IEP goals or objectives.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1098300712438942">
<title>CCE student participants</title>
<p>During Year 1 of the project, 280 first, second, and third graders were enrolled in the study. In all, 168 were enrolled in the CCE program, and 112 were enrolled as control students. Of the 168 enrolled in the CCE program, 104 had 22 weeks of DPR data, without any missing weekly data and participated in these three validity studies. On average, 11.6 students participated in each school (<italic>Mdn</italic> = 13 and range = 5 to 16). Of the students, 24 (23%) were female and 1% were American Indian or Alaska Native, 6% were Asian or Pacific Islander, 18% were African American, 6% were Hispanic, 50% were White, and 19% were of unknown ethnicity. In addition, 48 (46%) students received free lunch and 10% received reduced-price lunch.</p>
<p>The majority of the students (87%) received their education in general education classrooms, whereas the remainder received 1 to 2 hr of instruction in resource classrooms. Students with special education eligibility included two students with autism, five with developmental delays, two with emotional disturbance, two with other health impairment, three with other health impairment (attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder), nine with specific learning disabilities, three with speech or language impairment, and one with traumatic brain injury (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1098300712438942">Table 1</xref> for the percentage of students with special education eligibility by CCE intervention category postintervention).</p>

During each evaluation period, the teacher used a 4-point scale to evaluate the extent to which the participating students’ social behavior met each expectation. Anchors included 4 (<italic>perfect, met expectations with positive behavior</italic>), 3 (<italic>good, met expectation with only one correction or reminder</italic>), 2 (<italic>OK, needed two or three corrections or reminders</italic>), and 1 (<italic>tough time, needed four or more corrections or reminders</italic>). At the end of each evaluation period, the teacher gave the student feedback and rated the student’s behavior on the DPR social expectations. In a teacher reliability study of the DPR, the reliability coefficients between 24 teachers’ DPR ratings on three behavior expectations and research assistants ratings yielded coefficients of .40 for Be Respectful, .61 for Be Responsible, and .80 for Be Safe, with an overall coefficient of .63 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1098300712438942">Lynass, 2010</xref>). The implied reliability suggests unacceptable to respectable levels of reliability across the three expectations with a minimally acceptable level on average (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1098300712438942">DeVellis, 1991</xref>).</p>

<title>Social Skills Rating System (SSRS) Teacher Form</title>
<p>The SSRS rating scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1098300712438942">Gresham &amp; Elliot, 1990</xref>) assesses three domains of behavior: Social Skills, Problem Behavior, and Academic Competence. The Social Skills scale measures cooperation (e.g., finishes class assignments), assertion (e.g., makes friends easily), and self-control (e.g., controls temper). The Problem Behavior scale assesses externalizing, internalizing, and hyperactive behavior. The Academic Competence scale is a unidimensional scale that assesses the teacher’s perception of the child’s academic ability compared to peers. The SSRS includes 52 items that are rated on a 3-point scale (0–2) and yield standard scores for the three scales. Test–retest reliabilities for the Social Skills, Problem Behavior, and Academic Competence scales range from .84 to .93. In the current study, the Social Skills scale was used as a measure of social skills.</p>

<p>The SSBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1098300712438942">Walker &amp; Severson, 1992</xref>) is a multistaged screening instrument that identifies elementary school-age students who are at risk for severe behavior problems. First, teachers nominate three students in their class with externalizing and internalizing problem behaviors based on a description provided by the SSBD administration manual. Second, teachers rate the students on three scales: The Critical Events Index (e.g., fire setting) has 33 items that are rated as occurring or not, the Adaptive Behavior Scale (e.g., student does seat work assignments as directed) includes 12 items that assess behavior on a 5-point scale with descriptive anchors of <italic>never</italic> to <italic>sometimes</italic> to <italic>frequently</italic>, and the Maladaptive Behavior Scale (e.g., student uses coercive acts to force submission of others) has 11 items that assess problem behavior that teachers rate on a 5-point scale. Cut scores were developed for teachers’ assessment of students Critical Events, Adaptive, and Maladaptive scores. Results based on discriminant analysis showed that these scales differentiate between non-nominated and nominated students for emotional disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1098300712438942">Walker et al., 1994</xref>). The internal consistency for the Adaptive Behavior Scale is .94, and for the Maladaptive Behavior Scale it is .90. Because of the nature of the Critical Event Scale items, no measure of internal consistency was reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1098300712438942">Walker et al., 1994</xref>).

Using two gates has shown the appropriate level of sensitivity with other screening measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1098300712438942">Lane et al., 2009</xref>) and has been used in other multitiered behavior intervention studies reporting a comparable percentage of students screened as at risk (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1098300712438942">Nelson, Duppong Hurley, Stage, &amp; Buckley, 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Coach and teacher procedures</title>
<p>All teachers and coaches attended a 1-day training a month before the start of the school year. The purpose of the training was fourfold: (a) provide an overview of the CCE intervention, (b) develop school-wide behavior expectations that would function as the behavioral anchors on their DPR (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1098300712438942">Crone et al., 2004</xref>), (c) observe a video about how to provide student DPR feedback in a positive manner for improving student behavioral expectation and performance, and (d) provide training for coaches on how to enter students’ DPRC data on the Internet-based progress monitoring system.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1098300712438942">
<title>Behavior specialist procedures</title>
<p>Behavior specialists conducted a weekly 2-hr coaches’ meeting each week with the three coaches for that specific school district. The meetings covered three topics: (a) each CCE student’s DPR progress report was reviewed at least once every 2 weeks to make RtI treatment changes as described below, (b) treatment adherence for the teacher check-in and check-out process, and (c) training on the social skill instruction (see basic plus description below). In addition, the behavior specialists conducted FBA procedures (see below in the intensive intervention level description) and met monthly with the authors of this article at a university to review intervention implementation.</p>

<title>Assignment to Intervention Level Using DPR Data</title>

<title>Basic level</title>
<p>After passing two gates of the SSBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1098300712438942">Walker &amp; Severson, 1992</xref>) by the second month of the school year, all students started the CCE intervention at the basic level. In the basic level, coaches checked in students in the morning and checked out students at dismissal. There were three important behavioral elements to the check-in process, which was delivered to each student individually at a designated check-in and check-out location. The three important elements were (a) check to see if the parent signed yesterday’s DPR, (b) present the students with a new DPR, and (c) give reminders to the students about their DPR expectations.</p>
<p>The coach used four important steps at check-out with each student: (a) tally the DPR points with the student, (b) verbally praise student’s success on the DPR, (c) give verbal feedback for the student’s problem behavior, and (d) send a copy of the DPR home for parent or guardian signature. There were weekly procedural checks on the coaches’ check-in and check-out procedures. The behavioral specialist or research assistants completed a total of 194 adherence checks on both check-in and check-out procedures (accounting for approximately 33% of total procedures). Adherence checks revealed a mean of 92% (<italic>SD</italic> = 0.08) and ranged from 70% to 100%, indicating good coach adherence to the check-in and check-out procedures.</p>
<p>Coaches entered students’ DPR data into the CCE Internet-based data system at least weekly. Paper DPRs were checked for reliability every 2 months by the research assistants to ensure the accuracy of the electronic data used to produce the DPR progress reports. The error in data entry was less than one per hundred of DPRs entered. Using an Internet-based chart review, the behavior specialists and coaches collaboratively reviewed each student’s DPR data every 5 to 10 days and made notes about the individual student’s progress. The CCE manual defined success at the basic level as the student earning more than 75% of possible points on more than 80% of days across an 8-week period. This 8-week duration was derived from the BEP manual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1098300712438942">Crone et al., 2004</xref>, p. 81).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-1098300712438942">
<title>Self-monitoring</title>
<p>After Week 8, successful basic-level students entered a self-monitoring intervention. Students rated their own behavior on the DPR and compared it to teacher ratings. With partial agreement (i.e., within one point for each rated expectation) on 10 out of 15 days, the student moved to an independent self-monitoring phase where students independently rated themselves on the DPR for a 2-week period. The partial agreement method was based on a study of a self-evaluation procedure that showed generalization and maintenance of treatment gains for students with behavior disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1098300712438942">Rhode, Morgan, &amp; Young, 1983</xref>). After meeting this criterion for at least 4 weeks (i.e., at least 2 weeks of matched ratings with the teacher and 2 weeks with self-ratings only), the student graduated (i.e., 12 weeks in all). If students were not successful in self-monitoring, they returned to the basic level for another iteration of the basic level.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-1098300712438942">
<title>Basic plus</title>
<p>After Week 8, students received additional services if they did not succeed at the basic level. If students were below 75% criterion for any 2-week period, the daily criterion was reduced by 10%. Students then received additional incentives to meet the criteria for 5 consecutive days (e.g., the opportunity to spend 5 to 10 min with the coach or other students during a special activity). The coach provided tutoring to students when DPR data suggested academic task completion was inconsistent. In addition, social skill instruction was provided from the <italic>Stop &amp; Think Social Skills Program</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1098300712438942">Knoff, 2001</xref>) for students whose DPRs had low scores on social skill-related expectations (e.g., consistently earns 1 out of 4 for Be Responsible, so the Follow Directions social skill lesson would be taught). After 8 weeks in the basic plus level, students who successfully met their criterion on 80% of the days returned to the basic level.</p>

<sec id="section23-1098300712438942">
<title>Intensive</title>
<p>After Week 12, students were considered for a functionally based behavior intervention using a multimethod multisource procedure (i.e., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1098300712438942">Stage et al., 2006</xref>) if they did not meet the DPR criterion after 8 weeks of basic and then 4 weeks of basic plus. Prior to using a FBA, the behavior specialist determined whether the teacher would actively participate in the intervention. This included a conversation about the expectations of keeping individual student behavioral data regarding 15-min momentary time sampling data on the student’s on-task behavior and contingently rewarding the student with free time, peer social time, or additional teacher social attention depending on the maintaining consequence verified with condition probabilities of five classroom observations. Students were not eligible for the intensive intervention if they were already receiving a school-derived FBA intervention or if they were currently being assessed for special education services.</p>

First, four separate multivariate principal components analyses were conducted to verify four constructs (i.e., change scores in internalizing problem behavior, externalizing problem behavior, social skills and academic skills). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1098300712438942">Cronbach and Meehl (1955)</xref> noted the fallacy of using one variable to represent one construct because of idiographic scale specificity and error within measurement. Change scores were used because the essence of the DPR as a progress monitoring tool that was expected to coincide with change in the behavior constructs. In addition, Cronbach and Meehl stated that criterion validity requires both concurrent and predictive validity of the experimental measure with construct validated measures. Therefore, second, DPR scores were correlated with construct validated measures to determine their concurrent and predictive validity. Criterion validity would be achieved for each construct if it was correlated with the change (i.e., concurrent validity) and final outcome (i.e., predictive validity) of the student’s DPR. It was expected that change in both externalizing and internalizing problem behaviors would be associated with DPR change over time and level of problem behavior given that these outcome measures were evidenced in the distinction between CCE graduates and nongraduates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1098300712438942">Cheney et al., 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Construct validity</title>
<p>A principal components analysis was conducted with the variable change scores (i.e., spring–fall) for each variable measured with each construct. The component scores showed an adequate correlation for each variable with the component analyzed, and the Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin (KMO) measures demonstrated adequate sampling of the variables. Scores greater than .500 are adequate to interpret as factors. The explained variance indicated an adequate amount of shared variance by the variables with the latent factor.</p>
<p>Results for externalizing problem behavior principal components analysis were TRF Attention Problem Component Score = .783, TRF Rule Breaking = .862, and TRF Aggression = .905, KMO = .662, with 72% total explained variance by the components. For the internalizing problem behavior principal components analysis, the results were TRF Anxious/Depressed = .739, TRF Withdrawn/Depressed = .801, and TRF Somatic Complaints = .572, KMO = .561 with 50% of the total variance explained by the components. For the social skills component analysis, the results were BERS Affective Strengths = .593, BERS Interpersonal Strengths = .773, and SSRS Social Skills = .583, KMO = .619 with 65% of the total variance explained. For the academic skills component analysis results of Letter-Word Identification = .755, Calculation = .783, and Math Fluency = .754, KMO = .652 with 58% of the variance explained by the components. The Anderson–Rubin method was used to produce factor scores (<italic>M</italic> = 0, <italic>SD</italic> = 1) for each student for each principal component analyzed that was used in a HLM analysis to predict students change in slope and final status on their DPRC scores described below.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section28-1098300712438942">
<title>Criterion-referenced validity</title>
<p>A linear growth analysis of DPR slope and final outcome was predicted by students’ factor change scores for each behavioral domain (i.e., externalizing behavior problem, internalizing problem behavior, social skills, and academic skills). The results of this linear growth analysis indicated that externalizing problem behavior was the only factor associated with final outcome (i.e., <italic>T</italic> = −2.34, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .05) and change in DPR score (i.e., <italic>T</italic> = 3.4, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .0001). Externalizing problem behavior was negatively correlated with the final DPR score and positively correlated with the slope of DPR scores. Therefore, negative standardized change scores in externalizing behavior (i.e., decreasing externalizing problem behavior) were reliably associated with higher final DPR scores and increases in DPR performance over weeks of intervention.</p>
<p>These results indicated that the only criterion related to change in percentage of DPR scores over time and end of the year status was the change in externalizing problem behavior. The other factor-analyzed multivariate criteria, internalizing problem behavior, social skills, and academic achievement, were not related to change or level of DPR scores. Thus, the only criterion measure associated with the DPR is teacher-rated externalizing problem behavior.</p>

Three analyses were completed to assess treatment utility of the DPR. The first analysis was an HLM analysis of DPR change and level by CCE treatment level to determine behavior specialists’ accuracy in assigning the students to the five different treatment levels based on DPR scores. These results were graphed to assess behavior specialists’ accuracy in placement of treatment level. In addition to intervention assignment accuracy, treatment utility would suggest that assignment to more intensive levels of intervention based on the students’ limited RtI would later result in increased performance on the DPR and concomitant changes on their outcome measures. Therefore, a Wilcoxon signed rank test was conducted to determine the reduction in the number of students who scored at or above the at-risk range (i.e., <italic>T</italic>-score ≥ 65) on externalizing problem behavior scales from the fall to spring.

These results showed gradual stair steps in relationship to the level of DPR points earned by intervention level with higher and lower final DPR percentages for intervention groups in comparison to the basic intervention group as would be expected.</p>
<p>In addition to the analysis of the final week DPR percentage, the linear growth analysis also statistically tests for the change in DPR percentage across weeks of intervention by intervention group. The basic group showed a statistically significant change in weekly DPR percentage when compared to zero (i.e., an average 0.4% increase per week; <italic>T-</italic>ratio = 8.43, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .0001). The only other group that showed a significant change in slope on weekly DPR percentage compared to the basic group was the intensive group (i.e., an average 0.7% increase per week; <italic>T-</italic>ratio = 2.36, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .05), indicating that the intensive group DPR percentage increased more rapidly than the basic group.</p>

<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1098300712438942">Figure 1</xref>, the basic group averaged between the 75th and 80th percentiles for the first 8 weeks and then climbed to the 85th percentile by Week 22. The self-monitoring group began above the 85th percentile and climbed to the 93rd percentile by the final week. Students in the graduate level began CCE above the 90th percentile and moved to the 99th percentile by the final week. On average, these results suggest that behavior specialists were under responsive in moving students toward graduation when they were above the 75th percentile criterion.</p>
<p>The basic plus group was below the 75th percentile at Week 8, which is consistent with CCE procedural guidelines. The basic plus group was slightly below the 75th percentile at Week 12, which would suggest consideration for intensive intervention. However, this slight deviation below the 75th percentile by the basic plus group can be explained by the standard estimation error about the best fit line, which was 1.8%. The intensive group remained below the 75th percentile criterion across both intervention change decision points at Weeks 8 and 12; this is consistent with CCE procedural guidelines and suggests that students were appropriately referred for individualized intensive interventions. On average, behavior specialists reliably assigned students to the basic plus and the intensive groups interventions as described in the CCE procedural guidelines.</p>

<title>Treatment utility</title>
<p>A cross-tabs analysis using a χ<sup>2</sup> test of independence was conducted to determine if there was a statistically reliable association between the frequencies of students across the intervention levels and the SSBD categories and special education eligibility, χ<sup>2</sup>(8, <italic>N</italic> = 104) = 12.26, <italic>p</italic> = .14.

<p>In addition, Fisher’s exact test was used to evaluate the proportion of at-risk students above or below the 50th percentile at each assessment period by treatment level. The 50th percentile was chosen because that is the total baseline average percentage. As expected, the self-monitoring and graduate levels showed a low percentage of students in the at-risk range. These students had been in the CCE intervention 6 weeks before the fall standardized assessment, and, as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1098300712438942">Figure 1</xref>, they had established high weekly DPR percentages. They showed a lower percentage of students in the at-risk range (i.e., in the fall 14% for graduates and 35% for self-monitoring students and in the spring 0% and 23%, respectively). The basic level showed a close to average number of students in the at-risk range (i.e., 44% across both testing periods). As expected, the basic plus group demonstrated a higher than average proportion of students in the at-risk range (i.e., 68% at the fall and 62% at the spring assessment periods). Students in the intensive group were the only students to demonstrate a decline in the proportion of students in the at-risk range from 83% to 50%, although there were only 6 students in this intervention level. These results suggest that the only group to evidence treatment utility was the intensive intervention group. The behavior specialists’ placement of these students in the intensive group based on weekly DPR percentages and an FBA-based intervention relate to a significant increase in weekly DPR percentage compared to other groups, and a concomitant reduction in the percentage of students rated in the at-risk range for externalizing behavior problems.</p>

<title>Study 3: Treatment Duration</title>
<p>The <italic>treatment duration</italic> of students’ successful performance based on their DPR percentage over weeks of intervention was investigated in relationship to teachers’ ratings on the validated outcome measures because it is an important consideration in the assignment of resources to deliver effective interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1098300712438942">Garland et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1098300712438942">Hibbs, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1098300712438942">1998</xref>). Therefore, we tested two different treatment duration lengths for students who met the DPR criterion in relationship to clinically at-risk versus normal levels of functioning on the validated measures of the students’ behavior. To derive the short duration, we simply halved the standard duration.</p>
<sec id="section34-1098300712438942">
<title>Results and Discussion</title>
<p>Two variables were entered into a forward stepwise conditional binary logistic regression equation to predict students who scored in the normal range (i.e., <italic>T</italic>-score &lt; 65) on their fall externalizing problem behavior average score. The model tested the odds in predicting students’ normal level of externalizing problem behavior with the DPR criterion of above 75% across 4 weeks and across 8 weeks.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the stepwise regression, the odds were 1.06:1 or 52% in the normal level and 49% in the at-risk level. On the first step of the equation, the Omnibus test of model coefficients was statistically significant, χ<sup>2</sup>(1, <italic>N</italic> = 104) = 13.97, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001. The only variable that entered the equation was DPR scores greater than 75% for 4 weeks (Wald statistic = 12.87, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001), and the odds in predicting normal levels of externalizing problem behavior were 4.8:1. After this step, the analysis stopped as the limits of tolerance were reached and the predictor variable of DPR scores above 75% for 8 weeks was not entered into the equation. This suggests that by the 4th week of the CCE intervention students who consistently earned 75% of their DPR points could be moved to the self-monitoring phase with the odds being 4.8:1 that their teachers’ rating of their externalizing problem behavior (i.e., aggression, rule breaking, and attention problems) would be evaluated in the normal range. The overall accuracy in prediction was 68%.</p>

<title>General Discussion and Summary</title>
<p>The three studies conducted were framed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1098300712438942">Messick’s (1995)</xref> <italic>unified validity</italic> concept. This framework extends traditional validity measures such as <italic>criterion-referenced validity</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1098300712438942">Cronbach &amp; Meehl, 1955</xref>) with the assessment of the consequences of the treatment decisions made using the DPR. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1098300712438942">Elliott et al. (2008)</xref> stated, “The terms [<italic>treatment utility</italic> and <italic>intervention validity</italic>] do not appear in the widely accepted Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing. However, these dimensions of assessment are a natural extension of the concept of consequential validity” (pp. 15–16). In addition to criterion and treatment validity, <italic>treatment duration</italic> was assessed in regard to the social consequences of the treatment decisions made as recognized by the National Institute of Mental Health, the MacArthur Foundation, and the Child and Adolescent Psychosocial Interventions Consortium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1098300712438942">Hibbs, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1098300712438942">1998</xref>). These three validity studies make a significant contribution to the positive behavior support literature regarding Tier 2 interventions using an RtI model.</p>
<p>First, <italic>criterion-referenced validity</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1098300712438942">Cronbach &amp; Meehl, 1955</xref>) was confirmed with a factor-analyzed change score of externalizing problem behaviors with the DPR. As students’ DPRs increased, teachers’ ratings of their problem behavior decreased. This relationship also held for the prediction of their final week of treatment. Establishing criterion-referenced validity with the externalizing problem behavior construct aids school systems using large-scale positive behavior support systems that relay on constructing their own behavior expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1098300712438942">Crone et al., 2004</xref>). All the CCE schools uniquely derived their own DPR, and even with the variation about the nine different DPRCs used in this study, they reliably predicted students change in externalizing problem behavior. However, the internalizing problem behavior, social skills, and academic achievement domains did not show this relationship.</p>
<p>DPRs were not expected to demonstrate criterion validity with the social skills and academic achievement constructs as the CCE intervention did not evidence change in students scores on them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1098300712438942">Cheney et al., 2009</xref>). However, internalizing problem behaviors were expected to show criterion validity, as the CCE intervention did show a reduction in these student problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1098300712438942">Cheney et al., 2009</xref>). Pragmatically, this means that behavior expectations (e.g., Be Responsible, Be Respectful, and Be Safe) did not reliably correlate with internalizing problem behaviors, such as prefers to be alone, is sad, has stomachaches, and worries. For example, the behavior expectation, Be Respectful, is often associated with showing appropriate social interactions with teachers and classmates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1098300712438942">Crone et al., 2004</xref>) and the topography of preferring to be alone, being sad, or having stomachaches does not logically match. However, the therapeutic mechanism of the CCE program which was partially derived from the <italic>Check and Connect</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1098300712438942">Sinclair, Christenson, Evelo, &amp; Hurley, 1998</xref>) intervention used adult coaches to socially support students to reduce the students’ negative responses to school and increase their engagement, which might explain the reduction in internalizing program behaviors realized by the CCE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1098300712438942">Cheney et al., 2009</xref>) intervention.</p>
<p>Second, the school-based behavior specialists showed <italic>treatment utility</italic> in the use of the DPR to assess students’ lack of RtI and assignment to only the intensive intervention level (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1098300712438942">Figure 1</xref>). This individualized FBA-based intervention showed an incrementally steeper slope in their weekly DPR percentage compared to the other intervention groups (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1098300712438942">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1098300712438942">Figure 1</xref>). The reduction of the percentage of intensive students in the at-risk range from 83% in the fall to 50% in the spring indicates treatment utility in the behavior specialists’ use of the DPR to make therapeutically meaning treatment decisions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1098300712438942">Elliott et al. (2008)</xref> have discussed the importance of developing standardized assessment protocols that help make clinical decisions toward the interventions selected. There is now a growing body of evidence indicating at-risk students who show a lack of RtI to group-based positive behavior support interventions using DPRs are more likely to be responsive to individualized FBA interventions (i.e., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1098300712438942">Campbell &amp; Anderson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1098300712438942">Carter &amp; Horner, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1098300712438942">Fairbanks, Sugai, Guardino, &amp; Lathrop, 2007</xref>). However, it should be noted that the social skills instruction did not show treatment utility in the basic plus intervention. We are aware of only one other SWPBS study that directly applied social skills instruction to social expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1098300712438942">Lewis, Sugai, &amp; Colvin, 1998</xref>). Those researchers found that instruction in the absence of immediate external contingencies did not change students’ problem behavior.</p>
<p>The third important contribution of this study is in regard to <italic>treatment duration.</italic> Work groups sponsored by the National Institute of Mental Health, the MacArthur Foundation, and the Child and Adolescent Psychosocial Interventions Consortium suggest that studies regarding treatment duration need to be conducted to establish estimates of resource allocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1098300712438942">Hibbs, 1998</xref>). Given the odds of successful completion at 4 weeks above the criterion, this would suggest that students be moved to the self-monitoring intervention phase a month earlier than described in the CCE procedures. In addition, it would allow the behavior specialists to more rapidly apply FBA-based interventions to students struggling to meet the DPR criterion at 8 weeks instead of waiting until the 12th week.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section36-1098300712438942">
<title>Implications for Practice and Limitations</title>
<p>The implications for practice with this preliminary unified validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1098300712438942">Messick, 1995</xref>) assessment of the CCE suggest that within a large-scale SWPBS system DPRs are valid to make treatment decisions when standardized externalizing problem behavior measures are the criterion, although behavior specialists underutilized the placement of students to a self-monitoring and resultant graduation level. The finding regarding treatment duration suggests that within a 4-week time frame of intervention that relatively accurate decisions can be made about moving toward either less or more intensive intervention, which would ultimately increase the efficiency of the CCE program. FBA-based interventions within these models show preliminary treatment utility.</p>
<p>Although the TRF <italic>T</italic>-score of 65 is a cutoff score for at-risk behavior, not all teachers would say that students no longer need help with their externalizing problem behavior if they are rated below the 90th percentile. Although the claim of treatment utility was made for the use of DPR in conjunction with an intensive FBA-based intervention, it was based on a small sample of students who reduced their externalizing problem behavior (i.e., from five to three students).</p>
