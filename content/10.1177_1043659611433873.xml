<abstract>
<p>Cultural safety emerged in Aotearoa, New Zealand as a nursing response to bicultural interactions between indigenous Maori and other New Zealanders. The purpose of this research is to describe the meaning and experience of cultural safety as depicted by nurses in New Zealand and to illustrate the potential for this to inform U.S. nursing education and practice. This interpretive hermeneutic study explored cultural safety as described by 12 experienced nurses who were selected through snowball and purposive sampling. Audiotaped interviews were conducted after ethics approval. Interpretive analysis uncovered five themes that are described with data and paradigm cases. Cultural safety considers the perspective of the patient as the norm in contrast to the culture of health care. Understanding historical power differences and personal biases can help challenge victim-blaming responses by health care providers. Incorporating these understandings into reflective practice enhances the possibility of culturally safe learning for students and culturally safe care for patients.</p>

<p>Providing culturally appropriate and equitable care is a challenge for many nurses as social and cultural boundaries become complex and as nurses see more patients from backgrounds that differ from their own. This study developed through reflection on the practice of teaching and learning about culture in nursing in the United States. The article was collaboratively written by five authors, four from the United States and one from New Zealand. As nurse educators, the U.S. authors of this article experienced discomfort with the cognitive approach for cultural education focusing on the “values, beliefs, and traditions of a particular group” and tending to view culture as “static and unchanging” as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1043659611433873">Williamson and Harrison (2010</xref>, p. 761). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1043659611433873">Gray and Thomas (2005)</xref> provide a critical analysis of “culture” in the nursing literature that aptly describes the absence of scrutiny of relative power, how the essentialist view assumes group unity “based on presumed common or shared features . . .” (p. 254) and often uses interchangeable definitions of culture and ethnicity. Gray and Thomas argue this view does not take into account the fact that individuals often have multiple identities and levels of participation in different groups, and this view tends to leave out questions of power and privilege. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1043659611433873">Doutrich, Wros, Valdez, and Ruiz (2005)</xref> found that nursing courses on culture are often “well intentioned” reinforcements of cultural stereotypes and lack a sense of political/social/economic and historical understanding. Two of the U.S. authors of this article noticed that several students in one nursing course lacked awareness, for example, of a history of slavery in the United States, and they were unable to relate this history to the African American population now or to population health disparities. These concerns lead to searching for new conceptual models to guide our teaching practices.</p>
<p>Cultural safety is defined as “the effective nursing practice of a person or family from another culture, and is determined by that person or family” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1043659611433873">Nursing Council of New Zealand, 2005</xref>, p. 4). The concept and practice of cultural safety emerged in Aotearoa, New Zealand as a nursing response to the bicultural relationship between the Maori and other New Zealanders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1043659611433873">Ramsden, 2002</xref>). Maori—is the name of the indigenous people who make up 14.9 % of the population of Aotearoa, New Zealand, and the term “Maori” connotes both singular and plural (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1043659611433873">New Zealand Census, 2006</xref>). Cultural safety is informed philosophically by “emancipatory or neocolonisation theoretical perspectives” and by an emphasis on social justice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1043659611433873">Duke, Connor, &amp; McEldowney, 2009</xref>, p. 42; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1043659611433873">Ramsden, 2000</xref>). Grounded in critical theory, cultural safety invites the nurse to examine sources of repression, social domination, and structural variables such as class and power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1043659611433873">Ramsden, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The concept is based on the Treaty of Waitangi, in Maori, <italic>Te Tiriti o Waitangi</italic>, New Zealand’s founding document. The Treaty of Waitangi signed between the British Crown and Maori in 1840, provides a foundation for cultural safety. As with many treaties between colonists and indigenous peoples, the intent was not fully honored, arguably resulting in generational inequities in health, education, allocation of wealth and resources, land use, and cultural growth.</p>
<p>In 1988, the New Zealand Royal Commission on Social Policy stated that three principles inherent in the Treaty of Waitangi were partnership, protection, and participation; however, there is some controversy about whether these are consistent with self-determination. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1043659611433873">McKinney and Smith (2005)</xref> describe how from these generalized principles, nursing and midwifery developed a four-principle framework for practice that includes self-determination, which is foundational to the other principles. New Zealand nurses have been in the forefront of developing, articulating, and teaching cultural safety since the 1980s. The notion of cultural safety has been adopted and adapted by several countries including some regions of Australia, Canada, and to a lesser degree, the United States. The purpose of this study was to explore notions of cultural safety described by nurses with deep experience of it and to uncover how this could inform U.S. nursing education and practice. The focus of this article is on the explication of the notions of cultural safety.</p>
<sec id="section1-1043659611433873" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>This study, concerned with meaning and lived experience, used an interpretive hermeneutic approach to explore the consistent themes of cultural safety from nurses who are engaged in teaching and/or clinical practice. Two nurse researchers from New Zealand who had published on cultural safety were initially contacted via e-mail. Subsequently, in 2008 two U.S. nurse researchers traveled to New Zealand and were joined by a New Zealand nurse researcher in conducting the interviews, most of which were with New Zealand nurses. The nurses initially contacted introduced nurse colleagues who became participants, and who in turn identified “good people to talk with about cultural safety” through a snowball method. Other participants were selected through purposive sampling or were known to one of the U.S. researchers. Data collection was conducted after institutional review processes including ethics approval were obtained in the United States and New Zealand; written consent forms were signed by all participants. Participant interviews were audiotaped and transcribed verbatim and data collection occurred during 2008.</p>
<p>Data collection included ten 1- to 2-hour interviews conducted with individual nurse participants. In addition, 2 participants were interviewed together for a total of 11 interviews with 12 participants. In the interviews, the participants were asked to describe their experiences of cultural safety in practice and education. Interviews were semistructured and a primary question to start the interviews was “with as much detail and context as you can describe, please tell a story or talk about an episode that illustrates what cultural safety means to you.” This request for concrete detail is consistent with Heideggerian assumptions, which suggest that meaning lies in the concrete narrative of everyday life, that the person is a “being for whom things have significance and value,” and that understanding of behavior is best realized in context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1043659611433873">Leonard, 1994</xref>, p. 49).</p>
<p>Interpretive analysis was conducted by an analytic team composed of the U.S. and New Zealand nurse researchers and understandings continue to be refined as the interpretive writing continues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1043659611433873">Leonard, 1989</xref>). The U.S. team met regularly and used the Ethnograph Software™ to ensure a systematic analysis. The team then sent understandings to the New Zealand researcher who responded to the data via email. Dialogue continued until ideas were refined and findings established. Early in the process, after repeated readings of the interviews that had been audiotaped and transcribed verbatim, the analytic team developed a code list (see the <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1043659611433873">appendix</xref>). Hermeneutic analysis proceeded as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1043659611433873">Leonard (1989)</xref> from finding consistent and recurring themes, analyzing exemplars, uncovering paradigm cases, and finally to the nuanced description in the interpretive writing.</p>

<sec id="section2-1043659611433873" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Findings and Discussion</title>
<p>Twelve nurses (11 women, 1 man) participated in the interviews. Nine of the participants were born in New Zealand; the others had emigrated from Great Britain, Germany, Ireland, and a Pacific Island nation. None of the participants were Maori. Ten of the 12 are currently practicing in New Zealand, whereas 2 practice in Australia. Four were primarily working as staff nurses or supervisors in practice; eight were primarily nursing faculty, though, those teaching often also had practices, and those primarily practicing also provided clinical instruction and clinical coaching or precepting.</p>
<p>Five major themes emerged and are described below along with discussion of the themes. The themes uncovered are (a) “Reflection is key,” (b) “Know where you come from,” (c) “Learn to walk alongside,” (d) “Getting it right,” and (e) “Change over time” the evolving nature of cultural safety. While they are presented as distinct, there is a great deal of overlap and interplay between the themes. Liberal use of data excerpts illustrates the themes. Likewise, relevant literature is injected into the findings and discussion section. Two paradigm cases are provided that give context and illustrate the interrelationship of the themes.</p>
<sec id="section3-1043659611433873">
<title>A Paradigm Case</title>
<p>A paradigm case within the Heideggerian interpretive analytic method is an especially powerful example, often of several themes woven within a context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1043659611433873">Leonard, 1989</xref>). The participant below describes how her own reflection on teaching practices caused her to change assignments in order to practice safely with the students. She talks about the process of change and keeping students safe as they participated in self reflection, but also describes the power of knowing where you come from for students. Further, this excerpt contains information on reflection, the evolving nature of cultural safety, and explores the meaning of “walk alongside,” themes explicated more in the next sections.</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>We used to do an assignment and the students had to explore themselves and who they were and how they walked in the world and for the majority of the dominant students . . . they skipped over that quite easily and didn’t do it well at all. But what I realized was that for some of the [students from minority groups] they would come in and be incredibly distressed by the fact that it may have been the first time that they actually looked at who they were and how they stood in the world. And when they looked at the history of their people and they looked at the history of their family, and what the implications of that were for family and for themselves, it’s really painful. I had a student come and say she’d actually decided that she needed to go [back to her people and her land], she had to go back there to find out who she was and talk to her elders . . . to find out who she was and how she stood. And the other thing that concerned her was that if she was to write it on a piece of paper how could she know that what she held as really important—that her sacred words would be honored? And how can you put that on a piece of paper? And then you have somebody say that you failed you know? And in that conversation I realized that what we were doing in that assignment was bloody unsafe. So we changed it. We changed it to an aesthetic. We actually asked them to paint or to draw or to sing the essence of who they were and what they wanted; and how they saw cultural safety in their lives at that moment. Because to me cultural safety is a journey that takes three or four years and actually never finishes you know, it’s ongoing always, always going.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1043659611433873">
<title>Reflection Is Key</title>
<p>In New Zealand, reflection as an integral aspect of cultural safety is an expectation of all registered nurses practice and is embedded in all undergraduate nursing education. Reflection is defined by the regulatory nursing body as “The nurse delivering the service will have undertaken a process of reflection on his or her own cultural identity and will recognize the impact that his or her personal culture has on his or her professional practice” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1043659611433873">Nursing Council of New Zealand, 2005</xref>, p. 4). Reflection is a primary theme uncovered in this study and is not only fundamental to cultural safety and to nurses’ authenticity, but is foundational to other themes. For example, to understand power differentials or to know deeply one’s own story, a reflective process must be undertaken. Reflection is recognized as a key component of nursing clinical judgment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1043659611433873">Tanner, 2006</xref>) and without reflection on practice and in practice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1043659611433873">Benner (1984)</xref> suggests progression from novice to expert is frozen.</p>
<p>Reflection was discussed by participants from a professional perspective and as an imperative for students and faculty as part of the cultural safety education process. Thus, its importance in clinical practice and educational practice is embraced. The nurse educator participants talked of how faculty need to identify stereotypes and assumptions but do so in a safe way for students. They spoke of how faculty also have a responsibility to be continually reflective, both of their own identity and their teaching practices. Participants talked of how this process can sometimes be uncomfortable, describing this as learning that occurs on the “margins of discomfort.” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1043659611433873">Benner, Sutphen, Leonard, and Day (2010)</xref> recommend that educators have opportunities to develop skills in teaching students how to reflect on practice, including how to create a safe climate for students. One participant shared her perspective of the challenge of self-examination professionally and personally:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>Sometimes I’m not appropriate—actually, sometimes I’m very human. . . . I ask people to reach inside themselves and actually examine those same things for themselves. Because for me cultural safety is about the relationship that I create with one other person. That’s the basis of it. So when I’m teaching what I have people do is examine the self because that’s the whole point of it, to examine the self and look at their values, beliefs, and judgments.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Many participants described how awareness of one’s values and beliefs is what allows for authentic personhood and practice and subsequently, practice is constantly shaped by self scrutiny. Understanding and reflecting on political, economic, and historical context were identified as crucial to self reflection. These ideas may be introduced in clinical supervision, peer to peer, and in classes. At times, faculty described how reflection can precipitate changes at the core of one’s belief system and of the self. One participant describing students’ evaluations at the end of a course said,</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>We went around in the group and asked how they feel about the paper [in New Zealand what U.S. nurse educators call a “course” is termed a “paper”] . . . it was more like an evaluation, just talking amongst each other, and two or three students really stood out in terms of their identity. They said they find the paper [course] very difficult because it changed their identity and who they thought they were.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1043659611433873">
<title>Know Where You Come From</title>
<p>This theme is about knowing one’s self, one’s values, biases, assumptions, and knowing where these come from. It is about explicitly identifying family and culture. To tell their stories, our participants talked about how the teller has to “know where he or she comes from” which evolves and is dynamic. Participants talked again and again about “knowing your story,” “your people,” “where you come from.” They talked of “connection with the land” and of the “healing that can come from telling your story.” They also talked of having the story be heard and creating safe space for the story to be told. The participant below is describing early life experiences that shaped her and her “statehouse background.” The fact that her family was supported by the government and housing was subsidized influenced the development of her identity and her “self” as a nurse.</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>My nana was the village midwife and the village nurse . . . in the 1920s. I had no burning passion to be a nurse . . . was very much from a statehouse background and the girls that I encountered [during nursing education] . . . they were proper women. And I still think I suffer a little bit from being the—well not suffer—but I think I carry quite strongly the fact that I come from a statehouse background, and I come from [a not so wealthy village]. . . . But the community is very vibrant and fantastic and diverse.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Another participant spoke of the healing that can happen in knowing and telling one’s story:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>So the people that I was caring for at the time—they understood that I understood that if—if you have trouble in your story, in the being of you, your cosmology, in the relationship that you have with the world, then, you can’t be healthy. And you can’t stand and speak, let alone speak as a nurse and carry the capacity to heal. . . . But what we also understood early on, the sort belief which was absolutely articulated in New Zealand, that you have to tell your own story. Your story has to be heard. And, you have the responsibility to heal your own story, from within your own family. That’s not your colleague’s responsibility, that’s within your own family.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1043659611433873">Ironside, Dickelmann, and Hirschmann (2005)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1043659611433873">Diekelmann (2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1043659611433873">2005)</xref> have written about narrative pedagogy, the insights that come for the teller and the person(s) hearing the story. Likewise, the authors observed expert nurses being able to elicit and acknowledge the patient’s evolving story, often unfolding in a very short time. And while the ability to understand the salient aspects of the patient’s story is important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1043659611433873">Doutrich &amp; Marvin, 2004</xref>), the participants in this study also talked about how being able to know, and sometimes to tell, one’s story as a person and a nurse was crucial to being able to nurse from an authentic stance.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1043659611433873">
<title>Learn to Walk Alongside</title>
<p>This theme is deeply rooted in the principles in the Treaty of Waitangi and based on the notion that unless a people have the right of self determination, there is no partnership, no protection, nor real participation. For the purposes of teaching cultural safety, one participant explains,</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>The principles from the Treaty are partnership, participation, and protection. And we draw these in our nursing to teach the students to understand about these things. And when they are working with Maori, or anyone else for that matter, the principles are kind of taken up as part of cultural safety. Your patients participate in their care. You’re giving them care to try to protect them and preserve their health. And you’re working with them in partnership. In fact that partnership model starts right from the very day [the students] get here—and we talk about that partnership model. We bring it down, and we put in an extra step so we talk about partnership as teacher and student. We also try to work in partnership rather than being the teacher that “does to.” So we try to build some initiative and self-responsibility and that sort of thing. In the partnership you both have responsibilities—the goods and the bads—you’ve both got to shoulder some of them. We try to do that in terms of our teaching and learning. We’re here to teach them to be nurses, so we also then take it that final step. You work with your patient in a partnership model; you employ the understanding of their participation in this; and also that the partnership protects.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The late Dr. Irihapiti Ramsden, a nurse, nurse educator, and government administrator is acknowledged as the architect of cultural safety. In her doctoral thesis, Ramsden, reflected on her personal insights of carrying both Maori and Pakeha cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1043659611433873">Ramsden, 2002</xref>). “Pakeha” is the Maori term for New Zealanders of non-Maori descent. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1043659611433873">Ramsden (2002)</xref> initially described, two key points of cultural safety are, “to educate student nurses and midwives not to blame the victims of historical process for their current plight and to educate student nurses and midwives to examine their own realities and the attitudes they bring to each new person they encounter in practice” (pp. 85, 94)</p>
<p>Ramsden well understood political ramifications, historical trauma, and the influence of power (or lack thereof) on health. The following exemplar further illustrates how one participant considered issues of social justice, power, colonization, and eurocentrism within the context of nursing education in New Zealand.</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>If we go back to that original document [The Treaty] that’s what we come from. That original teaching is how do we both—these two cultures—live together . . . in this country. So that’s the part that we draw down, because it connects to nursing. What we found was the colonization process has done some dreadful things. . . . So that is of concern to us as nurses. Nurses are concerned with health. And we’re often concerned with those who are most disadvantaged. Because we’re busy trying to—I guess improve the health of everybody. But to do that we need to improve the health of the ones who have the least opportunity and have the most need.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The theme, <italic>learn to walk alongside</italic>, refers to <italic>looking at a way forward together</italic> (quote from another participant and title of this article), standing beside or walking with the patient, family, colleague, or student, rather than “standing over.” This is the notion of partnership and protection linked back to The Treaty of Waitangi. There is a critical concept embedded in this theme that concerns the importance of understanding and examining power differentials. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1043659611433873">Duke et al. (2009)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1043659611433873">Richardson and Carryer (2005)</xref>, and the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1043659611433873">Cultural Safety Research Group (2006)</xref> make clear the importance of examining political and historical inequity. This examination helps the nurse to understand power. Without this understanding there is no “walking beside.” The idea of power and being “alongside” or “walking beside” was one that came up in many of the interviews and often had to do with dealing with power differentials. This participant stated eloquently:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>I really believe that we’re just visitors to people’s journeys. . . . People are at their most vulnerable. . . . To assist them to uphold their dignity and walk with them. Like they always have that sense of walking with someone. And the other thing that I really believe is that we’re just visitors to people’s journeys, you know, we don’t hold such an important place. But we do have an important role in how we walk with people. And you know, that’s how I guess that whole thing about the person being professional—that’s how I live my life. So I walk journeys with people and once that journey’s finished or the person has learnt what they need to learn, or I’ve learned what I need to learn, we part and go our own way. And that’s how I think life is; and think it’s also how nursing is. So it’s more than—it’s more than just a job to me. It builds spirited people and it’s almost sacred. I see it as almost sacred.</p></disp-quote>

<title>Getting It Right</title>
<p>The researchers noted that this consistent theme recurred often in our participants’ stories as they described their desire, their motivation, and often their anxiety about their practices and their care. This desire contributes to motivation for cultural safety practice and education. “Getting it right” referred to both nursing care in general and culturally safe care more specifically. Cultural safety and really all other models of ethical nursing practice require that the health care professional go through a continual process of self-examination, exploring the values and assumptions that are shaped by life and practice experience. This process is integrally entwined with reflection and motivation. As she talked of cultural safety, one participant put it this way. <italic>What struck me about it</italic> [cultural safety] <italic>was the concept really spoke of ethical practice; to me it sort of sat in ethical decision making frameworks.</italic> Participants shared their own nursing stories and then described how they shared those stories with students.</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>I share a story with the students because it’s like you have to be able to demonstrate your own vulnerability. We don’t always get it right. And often the richest learning is when we don’t get it right.</p></disp-quote>

<p>For New Zealand nurse educators enacting biculturalism is based in part on redressing the health inequities resulting from colonization. They often spoke of “getting it right.” However, data from these interviews suggest a tension regarding situating multiculturalism for students in cultural safety teaching. New Zealand has an increasing number of immigrants now calling New Zealand home. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1043659611433873">Spence, (2001a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1043659611433873">b</xref>) recognizes that cross cultural nursing inevitably has its tensions due to its dynamic and complex nature. A participant recounts that</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>One of the first things some of these beginning students say to us [is] “Oh, we’re multi-cultural now . . .”And we say, “yes, that’s true, we are becoming multicultural, but we must be true to our roots, and the roots and beginnings of this country.” It was about two cultures . . . and the culture that was kind of like disadvantaged at the time, we need to take care of them first . . .and we’ve got to address our bicultural relationship first, and then we move on to embracing multicultural . . .just what we’re doing . . . it’s just that we mustn’t forget . . . as we become more and more multicultural. . . . We mustn’t forget our original connection with the other culture that we share this country with. . . . So we try to get them to see that and understand that we must address always that bicultural relationship and the multicultural relationship. It sort of . . . it all becomes one, but we must be aware of our roots . . .</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Cultural safety in New Zealand is based on Maori and Pakeha history. When participants talked of the bicultural nature of cultural safety, they also talked about how, with increasing diversity in New Zealand, the relationship remains bicultural (rather than multicultural) because new populations are in relation to the Maori. Culture is defined broadly and refers to “the beliefs and practices common to any particular group of people” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1043659611433873">Nursing Council of New Zealand, 2005</xref> p. 1). Thus, the bicultural relationship has dual meaning; it concerns the relationship between the New Zealander of non-Maori descent and the Maori and also the relationship between the health care provider and the client/patient. Encouraging students to link the bicultural relationship with health care has been conceptualized through understanding that health care is a culture unto itself. Each person who comes to the health care setting no matter what culture(s) encounters an alien culture, the culture of health care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1043659611433873">Kleinman, Eisenberg, &amp; Good, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1043659611433873">Spence, 2001a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1043659611433873">2001b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1043659611433873">2005</xref>).</p>

<title>Change Over Time: The Evolving Nature of Cultural Safety</title>
<p>This theme contains several aspects of cultural safety. It includes changes that have occurred in teaching cultural safety, the practice of cultural safety, and changes that happen ontologically for students and teachers as well as clinical practitioners as a result of cultural safety. Finally, it identifies the need for cultural safety to continue to evolve.</p>
<p>Cultural safety is evolving for individuals, populations, and organizations, specifically related to the bicultural nature of the nurse–patient or educator–student encounter. It recognizes the healthcare context as “foreign,” in contrast to the culture of the patient. With cultural safety, the norm is what the patient brings, while the “exotic other” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1043659611433873">Ramsden, 2002</xref>, pp. 76, 88, 110) is the health care world. Participants described the backlash that they experienced as part of this ongoing evolution. One participant, herself an early adopter and proponent of cultural safety, talked about how the concept was embedded in the early 1970s advocacy liberation politics and related to the sociopolitical context, feminism, and critical theory—pushing the political envelope. She said,</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>It [early cultural safety] was quite militant. Having done women’s studies and all that, [being militant] didn’t bother me. If you’ve got something to say, say it! But some people got a bit offended.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>How cultural safety is taught has also changed over time according to our participants. For example:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>When I was educated during my undergraduate program back in 1993, 1994—cultural safety at that time—we had Maori Studies. . . . So quite the whole focus of cultural safety from my perspective actually changed . . .</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The participant went on to say that now, rather than focusing on knowledge about the Maori culture (though it is still important), the focus shifted to an understanding of the self and values, biases, prejudices, and assumptions. There is also a focus on facilitating self understanding, and the understanding of the patient within an historical context. Another participant, discussing the change of cultural safety over time, said,</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>The change, briefly that I think happened that there is more an understanding of the patients of different cultures, different health practices, more of an understanding of all cultures . . . but it’s also about understanding that anyone you come in [contact with] is culturally different and that includes gender, race, sex . . . all those different things, young people, old people. So that’s my understanding of cultural safety.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Knowing cultural norms for the patient is an aspect of knowing the individual and is key to knowing the patient. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1043659611433873">Tanner, Benner, Chesla, and Gordon (1993)</xref> have described the phenomenology of knowing the patient as an aspect of nurses’ work. Knowing the patient is anti-stereotypic. For the nurse, there is the knowing of the patient’s typical pattern of responses and knowing the patient as a person. Rather than the golden rule, this has been characterized as the platinum rule—knowing what the patient wants/needs/expects rather than what the nurse might overlay onto the individual patient.</p>
<p>The last aspect of change over time has to do with the notion of cultural safety becoming rigid or the “new orthodoxy.” Because cultural safety is based in context, it needs to stay alive, changing as contexts change. Becoming inflexible within a hegemonic curricular framework is anathema to the dynamic nature of the foundations of cultural safety. Southwick has noted that cultural safety needs to stay at the point of tickling hegemony (Dr. Margaret Southwick, personal communication, Feburary 26, 2010).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1043659611433873">
<title>A Second Paradigm Case</title>
<p>One participant related cultural safety to practice for her students by describing a series of questions that her students might ask of their patients and themselves. She concluded with a caveat that it is important that the students adopt an open demeanor when questioning. She identified that knowing one’s patient is crucial while at the same time knowing oneself is also critical. These two concepts “sit side-by-side.”</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>I sort of locate it politically and [suggest] we get used to that openness and non-judgmental stance. Then we should <italic>get it right</italic> [italics added] for any person that’s different from myself. So I teach in [a nursing specialty]. It’s, “What’s your greatest need or worry? How can I help you most?” And then for cultural safety, “I’m different from this person. What do I need to know to be able to check out their greatest need and help? Who’s to do it? When? How do you want it done? Where?” Why? is not usually a useful question. “I might not be the right person but I can get the right person for you”—that kind of thing. So they sit side by side. However, the thing that would get in the way would be attitude.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The researchers recognized this as a paradigm case, integrating and modeling for the practice context, many of the emergent themes of this study. The concrete and pragmatic approach described by the participant above allows for the understandings and the openness required to connect without bias. There is a sense of understanding power differentials and political situatedness and a desire for “getting it right.”</p>

<title>Conclusions and Recommendations</title>
<p>The themes that have emerged from this collegial and collaborative research relationship have enriched the conversations and furthered the thinking about cultural safety for both U.S. and New Zealand educators. From the analysis of stories so willingly shared by colleagues in New Zealand, a series of themes of the meanings of cultural safety to nursing education and practice emerged. Of the 12 interviewed nurses, half were from one institution. Many have been instructors of cultural safety. Cultural safety is a required competency for nursing registration in New Zealand, and all nurses must consider and document their personal enactment of cultural safety in their practice. The nurses who agreed to be participants were proactive supporters of cultural safety concepts and practices. There were no Maori nurse participants in this study. With the increasing workforce diversity in nursing and understandings from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1043659611433873">Richardson and Carryer’s (2005)</xref> findings that Maori and Pakeha nurse educators experience discourses related to power and knowledge in the learning environment differently, this lack of inclusion should be understood as a study limitation. Additionally, in conducting continuing analysis, the distance from the United States to New Zealand was at times limiting so findings should be considered with these caveats.</p>
<p>Recommendations from this project suggest that the starting point for cultural safety is for the faculty person or the nurse in the practice setting to actively, and in an ongoing way, participate in a process of reflection. This process results in the educator or clinician knowing himself or herself—understanding at a deep level the values that motivate each of us. Moreover, there is a foundational value for social justice and for the decrease of disparity leading to improved health outcomes for all that guides the nursing profession (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1043659611433873">Bekemeier &amp; Butterfield, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1043659611433873">International Council of Nurses, 2006</xref>). Understanding and improving disparity is the core of cultural safety. In academic and clinical practice this necessitates a knowledge and understanding of historical trauma, power difference, and inequity that influence practice.</p>
<p>The four authors from the United States have changed our teaching practices. Each of us now includes opportunities for our students to know where they come from and tell their stories. This is done through a variety of assignments including a personal narrative, digital story (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1043659611433873">Gazarian, 2010</xref>), and through the reflective processes that articulating family and/or cultural values differentiation require. Students are encouraged to link reflective practice with ethical practice and improving care and are offered peer-to-peer supervision options and clinical coaching from faculty. The U.S. authors have institutionalized discussions of new teaching practices from the cultural safety study and have normalized the sometimes uncomfortable learnings that come from reflection, to become part of our faculty meetings. Additionally, critically examining historical treaties, inviting our indigenous faculty to discuss the power of healing community through awareness of historical trauma and understanding the impact of social determinants on health have all had influence on our teaching philosophies, classes, and the expected outcomes of our courses.</p>
<p>Ethical comportment in nursing requires what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1043659611433873">Ramsden (2002)</xref> initially called for, “not to blame the victims of historical process for their current plight and examine their own realities and the attitudes they bring to each new person they encounter in practice” (pp. 85, 94). Through reflection, self knowledge, learning to connect while understanding power differentials, having the motivation for “getting it right,” and appreciating the evolving nature of cultural safety, nurses and nurse educators are offered the possibility of helping to create a culturally safe learning environment for students and culturally safe health care environment for patients.</p>
