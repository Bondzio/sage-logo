<title>Background:</title>
<p>Parkinson’s disease (PD) is frequently complicated by co-occurring psychiatric problems such as depression and anxiety that negatively affect the course and management of the illness. Yet, in most cases, these psychiatric comorbidities are neither recognized nor treated to remission. The primary purpose of this study was to identify and describe barriers to mental health care utilization for people with PD. Secondary objectives included the assessment of attitudes and preferences regarding the need for mental health services in the PD community and the acceptability of telehealth interventions as a method for improving access and quality of care.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>A total of 769 people with PD completed an anonymous cross-sectional questionnaire assessing barriers to mental health care utilization in this medical population. Respondents were drawn from a national sample.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Commonly endorsed barriers to mental health care utilization in PD reflect the patients’ incomplete understanding of mental health problems, access issues, and illness-specific concerns, as well as the inadequate screening and detection of psychiatric complications by medical providers and the need for more effective treatments in this medical population. Several demographic, medical, and psychiatric variables also influenced the likelihood of accessing mental health care. Interest in telehealth approaches to mental health treatment was high and, in several instances, correlated with perceived barriers to mental health care utilization.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusions:</title>
<p>People with PD may encounter a multitude of barriers that impede their pursuit of mental health care. Clinical implications are discussed and further research is needed to replicate and extend these findings.</p>

<body>
<p>Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder in the elderly. In the majority of individuals, the illness is complicated by co-occurring psychiatric problems, such as depression and anxiety,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0891988713481269">1</xref></sup> that negatively affect the course and management of the illness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0891988713481269">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0891988713481269"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0891988713481269">4</xref></sup> Yet, in most cases, these psychiatric comorbidities are neither recognized nor treated to remission.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0891988713481269">5</xref></sup>
<sup>,</sup>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0891988713481269">6</xref></sup> For example, Shulman and colleagues found that neurologists failed to recognize depressive and anxious symptoms in people with PD during routine office visits, more than 50% of the time.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0891988713481269">5</xref></sup> Other research groups have also demonstrated that a substantial proportion of patients with PD (ie, 40%-66%) reporting significant depressive symptoms had neither been treated nor referred for further psychiatric evaluation by their personal physicians, while more than half of those who had been prescribed antidepressant medication remained depressed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0891988713481269">4</xref></sup>
<sup>,</sup>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0891988713481269">6</xref></sup> Most recently, a National Institutes of Health-funded trial (Methods of Optimal Depression Detection in Parkinson's Disease [MOOD-PD]) reported that while improving access to an initial psychiatric consult enhanced the rate at which depression treatment was initiated, it did little to reduce the rate of patients with PD with unremitted depressive episodes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0891988713481269">7</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Collectively, the above findings suggest that improved screening and detection of psychiatric complications may be only two of many factors related to the use of and benefit from mental health care in PD. Effective mental health treatment in this medical group may also be impeded by the fact that treatment outcome research regarding the psychiatric complications in PD is just beginning to burgeon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0891988713481269">8</xref></sup>
<sup>,</sup>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0891988713481269">9</xref></sup> and optimal treatment recommendations have yet to be developed. Nonetheless, several patient variables may also be implicated in the suboptimal management of psychiatric disorders in PD. Factors such as physical disability, transportation problems, geographic location, age, poor mental health literacy (ie, knowledge and beliefs about psychiatric symptoms, treatment options, and their potential effectiveness), and distrust of medical professionals, to name a few, may limit the ability of patients with PD to derive maximum benefit from the health care system both before and after a psychiatric complication has been detected. Several of these aforementioned variables have been identified as important barriers to health care utilization in other populations but none have been systematically evaluated in PD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0891988713481269">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0891988713481269"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0891988713481269"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0891988713481269"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0891988713481269"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0891988713481269">15</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>The primary purpose of this study is to identify and describe barriers to mental health care utilization for people with PD. Secondary objectives include the assessment of attitudes and preferences regarding the need for mental health services in the PD community and the acceptability of telehealth interventions (ie, treatment delivered via the phone or internet) as a method for improving access and quality of care. Telemedicine was purposely explored as a specific strategy for disseminating evidence-based mental health care in PD, given the success that this approach has demonstrated in other medical groups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0891988713481269">16</xref></sup>
<sup>,</sup>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0891988713481269">17</xref></sup> The information gleaned from this research may be used to inform clinical practice recommendations for the psychiatric complications frequently observed in PD. To our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically examine barriers to mental health care utilization in PD in a national sample.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>People with PD throughout the United States were recruited from several sources. Study flyers were distributed through the National Chapter of the American Parkinson’s disease Association (APDA) as well as local APDA chapters and PD support groups across the United States. The study was also posted on ClinicalTrials.gov, PDTrials.org, Craig’s list, the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s Research-Fox Trial Finder, and on Web sites for various PD-related organizations (ie, National Parkinson Foundation). All individuals with a diagnosis of PD, who were at least 18 years of age, were eligible to participate.</p>

The survey assessed several domains related to mental health care utilization in PD and was pilot tested (for clarity, readability, and ease of administration) at a local PD support group prior to distribution to the national sample.</p>
<p>Participants reported demographic information such as age, gender, education, income, health insurance, work, marital status, and region of residence in the country and key aspects of medical (ie, length of illness [PD], primary provider of PD care, comorbid medical conditions, number of medications, assessment of overall health, number of medical specialist visits in the past year, and PD-related physical impairment) and psychiatric history (ie, need and receipt of past mental health treatment, helpfulness of and satisfaction with previous interventions, provider and type of past mental health services, and treatment provider knowledge of PD). Past barriers to mental health care utilization (ie, physical disability, no transportation, and perceived benefit of treatment; 22 questions) were assessed. Participants were also given the opportunity to describe changes they desired about the mental health services they received. Attitudes and preferences regarding mental health care services in the PD community, perceived future barriers to mental health treatment (11 questions), and the acceptability of telehealth interventions as a method for improving access and quality of care were also assessed. The questions were presented in many forms, including multiple choice, open-ended, and Likert rating scales (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0891988713481269">Appendix A</xref>).</p>

<title>Procedure</title>
<p>This research study had the full approval of the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School IRB and consisted of the one-time administration of an anonymous cross-sectional survey that took 15 to 30 minutes to complete. In order to accommodate people with varying levels of disability, interested participants had the option to complete the survey either online (by accessing the study specific link on Survey Monkey), on paper (by requesting that a hard copy be mailed to their home), or over the phone (by calling the research team at designated periods of time). All potential participants read (or were read) a statement of informed consent before beginning the survey that was specific to the method of survey administration (paper, online, and phone). No identifying information was collected.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0891988713481269">
<title>Overview of Statistical Analyses</title>
<p>Data were analyzed with SPSS Version 18 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, 2009). All available data, from all participants, were used in conducting statistical tests. Descriptive statistics (ie, means, frequencies, and crosstabs) were generated for most survey items. Where appropriate, one-way analysis of variance or chi square tests were used to compare survey responses (ie, endorsement of barriers) based on demographic factors as well as key aspects of medical and psychiatric history as described above. Correlation analyses were conducted to explore the inter-relationships between variables. Logistic regressions were used to examine the predictors of each proposed past and future barrier to mental health care utilization in this medical population. Potential predictors for each logistic regression model (one regression model per barrier) were determined based on the results of significant chi square tests (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05) and were entered into the respective model simultaneously. All variables were dichotomized as appropriate based on the inspection of the data prior to their inclusion in statistical analyses. For example, a barrier to mental health care utilization was dichotomized as “present” by a rating of at least a 5 (moderate) on the 10-point Likert scale rating provided, or absent otherwise. Open-ended responses were coded via text analysis software provided by Survey Monkey. The capital letter “N” reported throughout the text and tables reflects the total number of participants that answered each individual question, that belong to a particular category (ie, received psychotherapy only) or that were included in a specific statistical analysis. The small letter “n” corresponds to the “percentages” reported in the text and tables.</p>

<title>Mental Health Care Utilization</title>
<p>See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0891988713481269">Table 2</xref> for specific information regarding patterns of mental health care utilization for study participants. Among those who expressed need for mental health treatment, 73.4% (n = 354) actually received treatment for their mental health concerns. For those who received psychotherapy alone (N = 38) or in combination with medication (N = 125), the therapist’s knowledge of PD was significantly related to the participants’ perceived satisfaction with (<italic>r</italic> = .293, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001; N = 153) and helpfulness of (<italic>r</italic> = .352, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001; N = 154) the intervention. Satisfaction with services also varied based on the type of treatment received (F [2,336] = 4.44, <italic>P</italic> = .01; N = 339), with those receiving combination treatment (antidepressant medication and psychotherapy) reporting higher levels of satisfaction than those who were on prescribed medication only (<italic>P</italic> = .01). Aspects of mental health care that the recipients of past treatment would like to see improved (based on 149 open-ended text responses) included improved access to care (13.4%, n = 20), increased knowledge of PD amongst community-based mental health treatment providers (13.4%, n = 20), improved dialogue (with their neurologist and other treatment providers) regarding the link between mental health and PD (20.1%, n = 30), better coordination of care between neurologists and mental health professionals (5.4%, n = 8), greater focus on psychotherapy versus medication management (20.8%, n = 31), decreased cost (14.1%, n = 21), and availability of more effective treatment choices (11.4%, n = 17).</p>

<title>Mental Health Needs Assessment and Telehealth Interventions</title>
<p>Approximately 93% (n = 640) of respondents believed that treatment for depression, anxiety, and the stress of living with a chronic medical condition would be beneficial to people with PD. Yet, 60% (n = 412) were unaware of any local services available for this purpose. Telephone-based interventions designed to meet this need were of interest to 68% of respondents (n = 468). Almost all the participants (97% [n = 661]) felt it important that mental health professionals working with people with PD have an advanced level of understanding of the medical condition. Interest in phone psychotherapy was also significantly correlated with several perceived barriers to mental health care utilization in PD, including lack of services in the local community (<italic>r </italic>= .167, <italic>P </italic>&lt; .0001; N = 654), insensitivity of doctors to PD-related issues (<italic>r </italic>= .148, <italic>P </italic>&lt; .0001; N = 652), and difficulty in controlling feelings and utilizing coping skills (<italic>r </italic>= .148, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001; N = 646).</p>
<p>Participants also reported that they traveled far distances in order to receive medical care for PD (mean number of miles = 52.00 [standard deviation, SD = 140.98]; N = 309). However, on average, the distance required to receive medical care (as described above) was further than the participants were able to drive themselves (mean number of miles able to drive self = 33.34 [SD = 65.89]; N = 261). Respondents reported having access to multiple methods of communication (telephone [71.9%, n = 641], cell phone [67.3%, n = 600], computer [70.1%, n = 625], Internet [69.2%, n = 617], email [70.4%, n = 627], and webcam [27.7%, n = 247]) and to feeling comfortable communicating with their physicians via these modalities (telephone [87.6%, n = 584], email [81.2%, n = 540], and webcam [58.9%, n = 379]). While 91.7% (n = 604) of respondents reported that they were motivated to receive all of the specialty care (ie, speech therapy, physical therapy, and psychological services) that was recommended to optimize the treatment of PD, in addition to routine visits with their treating neurologist, 84.8% (n = 559) of the sample indicated that they would be even more motivated to do so if they could receive this help in the comfort of their own home. On average, participants reported that they were able to speak on the phone for 51.95 minutes (SD = 49.84; N = 636) and use the computer for 86.31 minutes (SD = 89.56; N = 639) at a time.</p>

<sec id="section11-0891988713481269">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This was the first study to identify and describe barriers to mental health care utilization in PD in a national sample. The majority of respondents reported that they required mental health intervention for depression or anxiety in the past. Almost half of those needing help were not given a formal referral and a significant proportion (ie, approximately 30%) remained untreated. Participants who had received mental health treatment identified several aspects of their care that could benefit from improvement, including better access, improved knowledge of PD amongst treatment providers, and a greater focus on psychotherapy versus medication management. Related to this, reported satisfaction with and helpfulness of mental health services rendered were associated with the receipt of combination treatment (psychotherapy and medication) and the treatment provider’s knowledge of PD.</p>
<p>Importantly, results also suggested that people with PD encounter a multitude of barriers that impede their pursuit of mental health treatment. Commonly endorsed barriers reflected low mental health literacy (eg, Anyone in my situation would be struggling; I cannot control how I am feeling or coping; It was not necessary; It could not help me), access issues (eg, No transportation, Services not available in the local community, and No quality options were available to me), and illness-specific concerns (eg, PD-related physical impairment, Doctors are not sensitive enough to PD-related issues). Previously documented barriers to treatment optimization in PD, such as inadequate screening and detection of psychiatric complications by medical providers (eg, Referral not given, Doctor did not support or recommend treatment) and the need for more effective treatments in this medical population (eg, Treatment did not help in the past), were also observed in this sample. Several demographic, medical, and psychiatric variables also influenced the likelihood of accessing mental health care. Of note, participants treated by movement disorder specialists were just as likely to experience all assessed barriers to mental health care utilization, as those treated by other physicians.</p>
<p>Finally, on average, patients with PD needed to travel further distances to receive specialty care than they were able to drive themselves. They had access to and were comfortable with various modes of technology, particularly telephone-based approaches, and were able to use both the phone and computer for the typical time required to complete a treatment session for depression or anxiety (45-50 minutes). Interest in telehealth approaches to mental health treatment was high and, in several instances, correlated with perceived barriers of mental health care utilization. Overall, the present findings are both consistent with and extend the published literature regarding barriers to health care utilization in other populations,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0891988713481269">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0891988713481269"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0891988713481269"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0891988713481269"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0891988713481269"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0891988713481269">15</xref></sup> the suboptimal detection and management of depression in PD,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0891988713481269">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0891988713481269"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0891988713481269">6</xref></sup> and patient treatment preferences for comorbid psychiatric complications in PD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0891988713481269">20</xref></sup>

<title>Clinical Implications</title>
<p>Telehealth interventions (both pharmacological and nonpharmacological in nature) for the psychiatric complications of PD, based out of movement disorder specialty clinics and PD Centers of Excellence across the country (locations in which multidisciplinary providers have both exceptional knowledge of PD and the ability to coordinate care), may provide a mechanism for eliminating some of the more commonly perceived barriers to mental health care utilization in this medical population. Though randomized controlled trials are required to evaluate efficacy prior to widespread implementation, past pilot research suggests that telemedicine may be an effective strategy for managing both the motor and nonmotor complications of PD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0891988713481269">18</xref></sup>
<sup>,</sup>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0891988713481269">19</xref></sup> Increased efforts (ie, educational initiatives) to improve mental health literacy in the PD community may also be helpful, especially given the overlap between the physical symptoms of PD and many of the common correlates of depression and anxiety (ie, fatigue and insomnia). The prospect of training community-based mental health providers across the country (with interest in working with medical populations) in the motor and nonmotor aspects of PD also warrants consideration. The Movement Disorder Society, in conjunction with local and national psychological and psychiatric organizations, provides an excellent forum for this work and may ultimately result in a directory of interested providers, a web-based system to facilitate referrals, and a forum for ongoing training and consultation. Ideally, this process could be bridged with the preliminary initiatives that the Movement Disorder Society has already taken in this regard. Finally, as resources permit, efforts should be made to refer people with PD for combination treatment to address their comorbid psychiatric concerns and to provide extra follow-up to subgroups of patients (ie, those with poorer health and those who are not married) who may have particular difficulty accessing mental health care.</p>

<title>Limitations</title>
<p>This study has several limitations. First, participants expressed interest in this research study by responding to various advertisements and were not drawn from a random sample. Related to this, the study population was self-selected and the denominator of potential respondents is not known. Second, participant responses may have been biased by low mental health literacy, inaccurate recall, and/or the desire to respond in a favorable (or unfavorable) manner. For example, limited knowledge about the psychiatric complications in PD may have led to the under-reporting of depression and anxiety by some respondents as well as to the participants’ perception that they have not needed mental health services during the course of their medical illness (even if such treatment may have been of benefit). Third, given the anonymous nature of survey participation, a diagnosis of idiopathic PD could not be confirmed for study participants. Fourth, results may not generalize to all people with PD. The majority of the sample was treated by movement disorders specialists, internet savvy, connected with PD support groups around the country, and in earlier years of the illness (PD). It is likely that barriers to mental health care use may be even more pronounced in those who lack these resources or those who have more advanced stage disease. Finally, the majority of respondents, who <italic>acknowledged</italic> that they previously needed mental health treatment, reported receiving some type of psychiatric intervention (even if unsatisfactory) for their concerns. Thus, in this sample, the share of unidentified subjects with mental health problems may be small.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In summary, the suboptimal treatment of the psychiatric comorbidities in PD is of great clinical concern as these complications negatively affect the course and management of the illness. Yet, our results suggest that people with PD encounter a multitude of barriers that impede their pursuit of mental health care. Telehealth interventions may provide a mechanism for eliminating some of the more commonly perceived barriers to mental health care utilization in this medical population. Training community-based mental health providers in the psychiatric complications of PD, as well as increased efforts to improve mental health literacy in the PD community, may also prove beneficial. As this was the first study to identify and describe barriers to mental health care utilization in PD, results should be viewed as preliminary. Future research is needed to replicate and extend these findings.</p>
