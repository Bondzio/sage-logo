<p>At present, the utility of psychiatry is well-documented and presents a relatively uncontroversial solution to mental health issues ranging from minor neuroses to larger problems of family relations and inter-group interaction. As author Michael E. Staub demonstrates though, this assessment of the value of psychiatry in contemporary life has undergone radical change since the 1980s, from a time when the notion of psychiatry was seen as repressive, and mental illness was viewed an outgrowth of societal conditions rather than as an individual medical problem.</p>
<p>In Staub’s illuminating account of the postwar era of anti-psychiatry, the author traces the dramatic rise in social explanations for mental health issues brought about by the development of attuned psycho-dynamic theories in tandem with the rapid social change occurring from the 1940s until 1980. During this period we find the culturally- and politically-charged idea that madness was an appropriate response to extant social conditions. When placed alongside the emergence of the New Left, the Civil Rights movement, and feminism, as well as the rise of Fascism and the Cold War, Staub is able to chronicle the development of American psychiatry. In this process, Staub is able to uncover the dynamics between political and intellectual institutions, and the role of social diagnoses in shaping general notions of the self, the family, and even avenues for social change.</p>
<p>An interesting and accessible read, <italic>Madness is Civilization</italic> sheds new light on the subject of mental health in the United States, while cohesively drawing together disparate intellectual developments under the rise (and fall) of the anti-psychiatry movement. While it may be a (small) stretch to suggest that most social scientists should take a look at the book, the topic intersects a wide selection of sociological sub-fields, such as family, social psychology, political sociology, education, and others. As such, any scholar with an interest in the changing dynamics of American culture and politics should include this book on their reading lists, as it provides both a unique and insightful analysis of the emergence of social diagnostic thinking and its importance in social change.</p>
