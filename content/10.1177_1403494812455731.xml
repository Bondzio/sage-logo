<abstract>
<p><italic>Aims</italic>: Our aim was to compare the weapons used in lethal or potentially lethal violence against parents according to the age (adolescent vs. adult) of the offender and victim (mother vs. father) of the offence. <italic>Method</italic>: All forensic psychiatric examination statements of male offenders who had offended violently against one of their parents during 1973–2004 in Finland (<italic>n</italic>=192) were reviewed retrospectively. Data on the weapons used by adolescent and adult offenders in relation to the sex of the victim, mental disorder, criminal responsibility and intelligence were gathered. <italic>Results</italic>: In the whole sample, sharp-edged weapons were the most commonly used weapons. Firearms were more commonly used in offences against fathers (i.e. patricidal offences) than against mothers (i.e. matricidal offences). Adolescent offenders were more likely to use firearms than adult offenders in violent acts against a parent. Among personality-disordered subjects, patricidal offenders used firearms more commonly than did matricidal offenders. Homicidal matricidal offenders had higher full-scale and verbal IQ scores as compared to homicidal patricidal offenders. The matricidal offenders using firearms were shown to be more intelligent as measured by full-scale and verbal scale IQs than the patricidal offenders using firearms. <bold><italic>Conclusions</italic>: Consistent with the physical strength hypothesis, firearms are used more often in lethal or potentially lethal violence against parents by adolescents than by adults in Finland. As firearms legislation in Finland is currently under reform the study findings suggest that restriction of gun availability may have an influence on intrafamilial homicides, particularly those committed by adolescents.</bold></p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Parricide (i.e. killing one’s parent) is a rare offence accounting for approximately 2–6% of all homicides in Western countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494812455731">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1403494812455731"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1403494812455731"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1403494812455731"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1403494812455731">5</xref>]. For example, in Finland, during the period 2003 to 2006 there were altogether 18 parricides, comprising 4% of all homicides and including 10 patricides (i.e. killing one’s father) and eight matricides (i.e. killing one’s mother) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494812455731">6</xref>]. One of the cases was a double parricide (i.e. both parents were killed); thus, in total there were 17 offenders, who were all males [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494812455731">6</xref>]. The estimated prevalence for patricide was 1.0/million inhabitants/per year and for matricide 0.7/million inhabitants/per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494812455731">6</xref>]. Similarly, most of the recent studies have drawn the conclusion that the total number of patricides exceeds the number of matricides in Europe and North America [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1403494812455731">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1403494812455731">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1403494812455731">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494812455731">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1403494812455731"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1403494812455731"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1403494812455731"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1403494812455731">11</xref>]. The overwhelming majority of both matricides and patricides are committed by adult sons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494812455731">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1403494812455731">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1403494812455731">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1403494812455731">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1403494812455731">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1403494812455731">12</xref>], although the current data indicate that the involvement of adolescents in parricides is substantial as well, at least in the US [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1403494812455731">11</xref>]. Most studies indicate that offenders who kill their fathers tend to be younger than those killing their mothers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1403494812455731">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1403494812455731">5</xref>]. Heide and Petee analyzed the FBI national database of all homicide arrestees, including all parricide arrestees as well, over the period 1976 to 1999, and reported mean ages of 30 and 25 years for matricide and patricide offenders in the US, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1403494812455731">5</xref>]. Previous research has identified several factors contributing to parricide, among them severe mental disorders, other psychiatric morbidity and familial abuse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1403494812455731">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494812455731">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1403494812455731">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1403494812455731">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1403494812455731">12</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1403494812455731">13</xref>].</p>
<p>Previous studies conducted on samples mainly derived from psychiatric or forensic settings have suggested that knives are the most frequently used weapon by parricidal offenders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1403494812455731">4</xref>]. However, recent non-clinical US studies using national FBI data found that during the last decades, six out of 10 fathers and four out of 10 mothers were killed with firearms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1403494812455731">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1403494812455731">5</xref>]. Heide and Petee [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1403494812455731">5</xref>] used the Supplementary Homicide Report from the FBI data for homicides in the US to analyze parricide incidents, victims and offenders for the 24-year period 1976 to 1999. The data used were one of the most extensive and reliable datasets on US homicides. They found that fathers were more likely to be killed with firearms (64%) than mothers (44%). In addition, juveniles were significantly more likely than adults to use firearms rather than other weapons to kill victims in patricide (80% v. 57%) and matricide (62% v. 38%) incidents. Adults, relative to their juvenile counterparts, were significantly more likely to use knives, blunt objects, personal weapons and other means (poison, explosives, drugs, drowning) to kill fathers (43% v. 20%) and mothers (62% v. 38%). Thus, Heide and Petee [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1403494812455731">5</xref>] replicated Heide’s earlier findings of the weapon use of parricide offenders for the period 1977–1986 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1403494812455731">14</xref>], indicating that at least in the US the methods used in parricide cases have remained stable.</p>
<p>Other studies including information on weapons used by parricide offenders have utilized more limited samples. Weisman and Sharma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1403494812455731">8</xref>], analyzing 45 parricides and 19 attempted parricides, found that 22% of the hospitalized offenders used firearms, 47% stabbing, 23% beating, 6% strangulation and 2% suffocation. In Canada, among 39 mentally ill adult parricide and attempted parricide offenders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1403494812455731">9</xref>] a knife was the most prevalent weapon used (57%), followed by physical strength (20%), a blunt object (15%) and a firearm (8%). A Canadian study of hospitalized parricidal offenders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1403494812455731">15</xref>] compared 12 adolescent to 43 adult offenders and found that adolescent offenders used firearms more commonly than adult offenders (50% v. 9%). Bourget et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1403494812455731">10</xref>] used data collected from coroners’ files, comprising all parricide offenders (<italic>n</italic>=56) in the province of Quebec, Canada, and found that during the time period investigated among matricides the most common methods of killing were blunt instruments (33%), followed by knives (29%), and firearms (21%), while among patricides the most prevalent weapons used were knives (33%), followed by firearms (28%) and blunt instruments (22%). Specific information on the weapons used by male parricidal offenders in European countries is lacking.</p>
<p>Our aim was to compare the weapons used in lethal or potentially lethal violence against parents between adolescent versus adult offenders and between matricidal versus patricidal offenders. One reason for investigating the weapons used was the ongoing firearm legislation reform in Finland. During 2007 and 2008, Finland experienced two exceptional school mass murders, which launched procedures that aimed to tighten firearm laws as one means of preventing homicides by young males. We were therefore interested in examining the role of firearms in another specific group of young male parricidal offenders, because similarly to school murders, parricidal acts occur in a particular environment that is psychologically important to the offender.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>Data were gathered from a national forensic psychiatric register covering all of Finland and containing all mental state examinations conducted in Finland. The mental state examination is a comprehensive inpatient psychiatric investigation in specialized hospital settings lasting a maximum of two months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1403494812455731">16</xref>]. The conclusions of the mental state examination include diagnoses and the assessment of criminal responsibility. We extracted information on all males who underwent a mental state examination in Finland in 1973–2004 subsequent to committing a serious parricidal offence. The minimum age of criminal liability in Finland is 15 years. In Finland, the majority of homicide offenders and a great proportion of other seriously violent offenders undergo a mental state examination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1403494812455731">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1403494812455731">17</xref>]. Among parricide offenders a mental state examination is probably frequently ordered because parricides are exceptional offences, differing from other homicides in Finland in many respects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494812455731">6</xref>]. For example, over the period 1980 through 2004 there were 21 male homicide offenders under the age of 21 whose victim was their father, stepfather, mother or stepmother [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1403494812455731">18</xref>]. In our data there are 18 homicidal parricide offenders of that age during the same time period, indicating that the majority of these offenders were probably assessed with a mental state examination. Our data do not include, for example, those offenders who committed suicide after the parricidal offence.</p>
<p>The offences in this study were defined as comprising homicide, attempted homicide and aggravated assault. The offence caused the death of the parent or the possibility of the death of the parent (e.g. the parent survived only due to immediate treatment). The material consisted of 86 matricidal and 106 patricidal offenders. In addition to cases with biological parents as victims, our sample also includes cases where the offence was against step-parents and foster parents, but only when the step/foster parent had joined the family when the son was under the age of 8 years. There were three matricidal offenders (4%) and two patricidal offenders (2%) whose victim was a step-parent or foster parent. The distribution of different charges did not differ statistically between the matricidal and patricidal groups. In the matricidal group there were 14 murders (16%), five attempted murders (6%), 33 manslaughters (38%), 16 attempted manslaughters (19%) and 18 aggravated assaults (21%). The patricidal group included 15 murders (14%), seven attempted murders (7%), 51 manslaughters (48%), 20 attempted manslaughters (19%) and 13 aggravated assaults (12%).</p>
<p>Matricidal offenders (mean age 30.1 years, SD 9.5) were significantly older than patricidal offenders (mean age 27.1 years, SD 8.8) at the time of the offence (<italic>p</italic>=0.019). Demographic data on offenders are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1403494812455731">Table I</xref>. In order to enable comparisons between the adolescent and adult offenders we included offenders younger than 20 years of age in the adolescent group, as there were only 10 offenders under age of 18 at the time of the offence (the age of majority in Finland is 18). The extension may be justified by the fact that the ages 18 and 19 years are developmentally included in the later period of adolescence. There were 32 parricidal offenders (17%) under the age of 20 years and 160 offenders (83%) aged 20 years or over. The mean age of the adolescent group was 17.8 years (SD 1.3) and that of the adult group 30.7 years (SD 8.8).</p>

<p>In an earlier study regarding the current sample [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1403494812455731">19</xref>] we found that matricidal offenders suffered from a psychotic disorder significantly more commonly than patricidal offenders, while a greater proportion of patricidal offenders were diagnosed with a personality disorder. In terms of legal implications, matricidal offenders were significantly more commonly found to be legally insane than patricidal offenders. Motives for the offence differed statistically significantly; among matricidal offenders, the motive was most commonly a mental disorder, whereas among patricidal offenders the most frequent motive was conflict resolution. There was significantly more commonly a preceding threat posed by the victim in the cases of patricidal offences compared to matricidal offences.</p>
<p>In this study, all cases were retrospectively analyzed for several variables regarding the offence and offender characteristics. Information on the instrument used (no objects/firearms/sharp-edged objects/other objects including e.g. blunt objects and strangulation) and type of the offence (homicide/attempted homicide or aggravated assault) was collected. Data on the intellectual functioning of the offender measured by WAIS (Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale including full scale, verbal scale and performance scale IQ) were gathered as reported in the forensic psychiatric examinations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1403494812455731">20</xref>]. Furthermore, information on the main diagnosis given in the forensic psychiatric examination (psychotic disorder/alcohol or drug-related disorder/personality disorder/depressive disorder/other non-psychotic disorder/mental retardation/brain organic disorder) and on criminal responsibility (full responsibility/diminished responsibility/no responsibility) was collected. A person with full criminal responsibility is considered to be mentally healthy enough to be convicted and judged normally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1403494812455731">16</xref>]. Diminished responsibility in the Finnish forensic psychiatric practice means that a person suffers from a serious psychiatric disorder, but not an actual psychosis during the offence, or is mentally retarded with a WAIS score 55–70 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1403494812455731">16</xref>]. The offender with diminished criminal responsibility may be considered to be only partly responsible for the criminal act. Persons with diminished responsibility used to get a 25% shorter prison sentence compared to offenders with full responsibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1403494812455731">16</xref>]; today, they are often convicted without the reduction. An offender with no criminal responsibility is either psychotic or mentally retarded (WAIS score below 55) and is not judged in court, but is usually committed to a mental hospital for treatment on an involuntary basis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1403494812455731">16</xref>].</p>
<p>Statistical significance of group differences in categorical variables was assessed with Pearson Chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test and in continuous variables with Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test or Mann-Whitney tests. <italic>P-</italic>value 0.05 was defined as the limit of statistical significance. All data were entered in SPSS for statistical analysis.</p>
<p>The original study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Oulu University Hospital on 19 August 1996. The Ministry of Social Affairs and Health Affairs has approved the study.</p>

<p>The weapons used in the offence differed significantly between matricidal and patricidal offenders (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1403494812455731">Table II</xref>). Nearly 30% of the patricidal offences were committed using firearms, compared with only 8% of matricidal offences. Patricidal offenders with a personality disorder (27%) were far more likely to use firearms than matricidal offenders with such disorders (5%).

<p>A significant difference (Fisher’s exact test <italic>p</italic>&lt; 0.001) was also found between the parricidal offenders with diminished criminal responsibility (<italic>n</italic>=87): patricidal offenders with diminished responsibility used firearms more commonly than the corresponding matricidal offenders (38% v. 7%). Furthermore, other weapons in this group were used more commonly by matricidal than patricidal offenders (36% v. 11%). The proportions of weapons used by legally insane matricidal offenders did not differ from those used by legally insane patricidal offenders. There were no differences in weapon use between the offender groups among those with full criminal responsibility.</p>
<p>The percentage of those using firearms in the offence against a parent among adolescents (&lt; 20 years) was twice that seen among adults (≥ 20 years) using firearms (38% v. 16% respectively) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1403494812455731">Table III</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We used forensic psychiatric examination reports covering the whole of Finland over the years 1973–2004 to analyze the weapons used to kill a parent by male offenders. The main findings showed that adolescent offenders were more likely than adult offenders to use firearms in parricidal acts, and that firearms were more commonly used in patricidal than in matricidal offences. Among personality-disordered subjects, patricidal offenders used firearms more commonly than matricidal offenders. The matricidal offenders using firearms proved to be more intelligent as measured by full-scale and verbal scale IQs than the patricidal offenders using firearms. The homicidal matricide offenders had higher full-scale and verbal IQ scores as compared to the homicidal patricide offenders.</p>
<p>The finding of our study that adolescent parricidal offenders were more likely than adult parricidal offenders to use firearms is in accordance with previous study findings from the USA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1403494812455731">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1403494812455731">14</xref>] and is accounted for by the physical strength hypothesis presented by Heide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1403494812455731">14</xref>]. The hypothesis suggests that due to the fact that adults are usually stronger than adolescents, a rational means to effect the killing of a parent by an adolescent would be a firearm, not a method requiring physical contact. A Finnish study of adolescent homicide offenders (aged 15–18 years) subject to a forensic psychiatric examination in 1990–2001 found that 14% of the homicides were committed by shooting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1403494812455731">21</xref>]. During 1980–2004, firearms were used in 12% of the homicides committed by 15- to 20-year-old homicide offenders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1403494812455731">18</xref>]. In Finland, firearms are clearly a weapon utilized by older men in committing homicides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494812455731">6</xref>]. It seems that firearms are used more frequently in parricides than homicides in general by adolescents in Finland, as 38% of parricidal offenders under the age of 20 years in our study used a firearm. A similar pattern has been observed in the US among adolescent offenders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1403494812455731">5</xref>]: firearms were more frequently used in matricides than in homicides with female victims in general (62% v. 52%), and more commonly in patricides than in homicides with male victims in general (80% v. 73%), whereas adults used firearms more often in homicides with male victims than in patricides (67% v. 57%) and in homicides with female victims than in matricides (54% v. 38%). Heide and Petee [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1403494812455731">5</xref>] suggested that the more frequent use of firearms by adolescents in parricide offences than other homicides may be due to the fact that a firearm may be used from a distance, which may be psychologically easier compared to other methods.</p>
<p>The more frequent use of firearms in patricidal offences as compared to matricidal offences in our study is also explained by physical discrepancy, as males are usually physically stronger than females [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1403494812455731">14</xref>]. The difference in weapon use among personality-disordered parricidal offenders is a novel finding. As shown in our previous study with this sample, patricidal offenders more frequently had borderline personality disorder compared to matricidal offenders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1403494812455731">19</xref>]. The more frequent use of firearms by patricidal offenders with a personality disorder compared to the corresponding matricidal offenders may relate to masculine confrontational situations with a history of a long-term feud or characterized by revenge. This can also include a dispute or conflict arising from the immediate social interaction before the offence in which the behaviour of the father is perceived as humiliating or insulting by the offender. As the conflict escalates, if a firearm is available, its use may be considered as the only means to end the situation by the emotionally vulnerable patricidal offender.</p>
<p>The finding of higher full-scale IQs and verbal IQs among the homicidal matricidal offenders and those matricidal offenders that used firearms compared to the corresponding patricidal offenders is preliminary. One tentative hypothesis, grounded in the theory presented by psychoanalyst Alice Miller in her popular publications is that a child with a good cognitive capacity may be more perceptive to the psychological symptoms such as anxiety and depression of the parents from the early childhood, which may lead to psychological vulnerability of the child [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1403494812455731">22</xref>]. As the mother–child relationship is specific and profound, a discerning child may get too tightly entwined in this relationship, which may grow too oppressive and result in more severe means to detach himself from the relationship. Shon and Targonski [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1403494812455731">4</xref>] note that a variety of methods are applied in parricides, some of them (e.g. firearms) usually requiring more premeditation and decision making. Considering the infrequent use of firearms in matricides in general, the physical strength hypothesis and the high level of intelligence among the matricidal offenders using firearms in this study, it may be hypothesized that matricidal offences using a firearm may be an exceptional offence among parricidal offences involving more premeditation. However, in-depth analysis of parricidal cases could reveal more of the meaning of intelligence as combined with other factors related to parricidal offences.</p>
<p>The different results of the weapons used most commonly in our study compared to the large U.S. studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1403494812455731">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1403494812455731">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1403494812455731">14</xref>] may be at least partly explained by cultural and criminological factors that influence homicides in general. In Finland during 1998 and 2002, almost half (46%) of all homicides by males were committed by sharp instruments, while firearms were used in 24% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1403494812455731">23</xref>]. In 2002–2006, male offenders (<italic>n</italic>=503) used firearms in 17% of the homicides and sharp instruments in 39% of the homicides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1403494812455731">24</xref>].Thus, the most frequent use of sharp-edged weapons in parricides parallels common homicide characteristics in Finland. This lends support to the view of Shon and Targonski [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1403494812455731">4</xref>] that parricides have many aspects in common with homicides in general, and that criminological and sociological factors affecting homicides in general influence parricides as well.</p>
<p>Our sample also includes offenders charged with attempted parricide offences. Hillbrand and Cipriano [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1403494812455731">25</xref>] recently illustrated the difficulties related to parricide studies, e.g. the problem of collecting samples of adequate size. In our study, the strategy of including serious non-fatal violent offences against a parent in addition to parricides expands the population coverage. Each case involved a violent offence with the possibility of death of the victim. On the basis of the earlier literature on parricides and attempted parricides it seems justifiable to study these offences together [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494812455731">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1403494812455731">8</xref>]. However, some caution is advised, given that a few studies have noted differences between parricides and attempted parricides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1403494812455731">11</xref>].</p>
<p>Finnish doctors are facing a challenge as they are obligated to inform the police if they assess someone as unsuitable for possession of a firearm. Other factors affecting firearm violence besides health issues need to be investigated and recognized as well. For example, a homicidal adolescent offender may not present any emotional warning signs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1403494812455731">21</xref>]. In Australia, restriction of gun law in 1996 has been followed by accelerated declines in overall firearm deaths, particularly suicides, but a decreasing trend among firearm homicides has been observed as well, and no substitution effects by other methods of suicide or homicide have been observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1403494812455731">26</xref>]. On the other hand, another recent Australian study suggested that the gun law may not have had such a great impact on firearm suicides; instead, other sociocultural factors may have contributed to the reduction observed in the number of firearm suicides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1403494812455731">27</xref>]. In Europe, a study from Austria found convincing evidence that more restrictive firearm legislation effectively reduced the rates of firearm suicide and homicide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1403494812455731">28</xref>].</p>
<p>This study has some limitations. The sample remains inevitably small. For example, probably due to the small sample size, differences were not found between the matricidal and patricidal groups when weapon use was analyzed by personality disorder clusters a, b and c or specific personality disorders. Our sample data include only the parricidal cases that were evaluated in a mental state examination. The number of cases that are missing is unknown. In addition, the study focuses on a restricted number of variables and disregards several important factors contributing to the complexity of parricidal acts by adolescent and adult offenders. Conclusions should therefore be drawn with caution. Because our sample is selective the results may not be directly generalized to violent offenders. Nearly 28% of IQs were missing. Altogether there were 53 cases (23 in the matricidal group and 30 in the patricidal group) out of a total of 192 cases without explicit full-scale IQs. Furthermore, IQ is only a robust measure of intelligence and neuropsychological functioning. Scoring in the normal range on the WAIS does not preclude neuropsychological abnormality. In this study, we were constrained by the measures used in forensic psychiatric examination procedures at the time. In future studies the use of more comprehensive measures of neuropsychological functioning may lead to better understanding of the association between intelligence and parricide. Finally, we did not analyze handguns separately from other firearms.</p>
<p>The strength of our study is that it contains data on a large nationwide sample of serious child-on-parent violence. The overall quality and reliability of Finnish forensic psychiatric examinations has been considered high by both courts and scientists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1403494812455731">16</xref>]. In addition, because of the established practice that almost all homicide offenders have been examined in a forensic psychiatric examination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1403494812455731">16</xref>], this study provides relatively comprehensive data on the homicidal parricide offenders in Finland. In the previous study regarding patricidal offenders it was concluded that a forensic psychiatric examination of the offender was conducted with all of the homicidal patricidal offenders during 1980–1996 and the majority of cases in 1973–1979 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1403494812455731">29</xref>]. It would be useful to estimate the coverage of our data as compared to all parricidal offences (including attempted parricides and aggravated assaults against a parent in addition to completed homicides), but relevant explicit data for this purpose are not readily available.</p>
<p>Parricides are rare and exceptional incidents. In our study, adolescents were more liable than adults to resort to firearms when committing serious, potentially fatal violent acts towards a parent. We acknowledge that there are many other essential aspects in the prevention of intrafamilial homicides, such as alcohol policy, mental health issues and socioeconomic factors, that are likely to have an impact. However, restriction of firearm availability is a practical procedure which may have an effect on intrafamilial homicides, particularly those committed by adolescents, and should not be overlooked.</p>
