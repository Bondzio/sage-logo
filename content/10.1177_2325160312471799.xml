<p>When AADE was established in 1973 to support and advance the profession of diabetes education, no one could have anticipated the growth and diversity that is now a part of this field. From hospital-based programs and public health settings to pharmacies and telemedicine, the diabetes education landscape is continually evolving.</p>
<p>The latest evolution in the role of the diabetes educator has been providing education to individuals with prediabetes. Diabetes self-management education (DSME) programs have included people with prediabetes in self-management classes and programs for years. Many educators have created separate programs and classes to address the unique concerns of this group.</p>

<p>When the results of the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) study were released in 2001, we knew an evidenced-based program to reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes was on the horizon. As described by Knowler and colleagues in the <italic>New England Journal of Medicine</italic> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2325160312471799">2002</xref>, the DPP showed that a structured lifestyle change program promoting modest weight loss (5-7%) resulted in a 58% risk reduction for developing type 2 diabetes in people with prediabetes, compared to a 38% risk reduction in those who were given Metformin. Following these promising results, translational studies examined whether a lower cost, group-based model could achieve the same results.</p>
<sec id="section1-2325160312471799">
<title>National Diabetes Prevention Program</title>
<p>In 2009, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) launched the National Diabetes Prevention Program (National DPP), a lifestyle change program designed to replicate the success of the DPP. Emory University’s Diabetes Training and Technical Assistance Center (DTTAC) developed a standard curriculum and trained a nationwide team of facilitators to deliver the program.</p>
<p>The program is a 1-year, group-based adaptation of the DPP lifestyle intervention and is meant for people who have been diagnosed with prediabetes or have established risk factors for type 2 diabetes. The trained facilitators, called “Lifestyle Coaches,” facilitate weekly group sessions for 16 weeks followed by monthly post-core sessions for up to a year.</p>
<p>The lifestyle change program relies on group dynamics as a core strategy for behavior change. Lifestyle coaches work to develop and leverage the group dynamic throughout the year, allowing participants to learn from one another, problem solve together, and hold each other accountable.</p>
<graphic id="img2-2325160312471799" position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_2325160312471799-img2.tif"/>
<p>Program content is broken into these three general categories:</p>
<list id="list1-2325160312471799" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>tools and skills for healthy eating,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>controlling the external environment,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>psychological and emotional influences on behavior.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Lifestyle coaches weigh participants each week, review food and physical activity logs, and facilitate a group discussion on the topic of the week. Because this is a lifestyle and behavior change program and not a clinical intervention, lifestyle coaches can be health professionals of any type or laypeople, such as community health workers. This flexibility as it relates to the background of facilitators lends itself to the program’s SBf scale and reach in a cost-effective way.</p>
<p>A review recently published in <italic>Health Affairs</italic> describes studies comparing groups led by health professional coaches to groups led by lay coaches that demonstrated that the same weight loss outcomes were achieved regardless of the coach’s background.</p>
<p>Since the launch of the CDC’s Diabetes Prevention Recognition Program (DPRP) in January <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2325160312471799">2012</xref>, over 200 lifestyle coaches have been trained by DTTAC to deliver the lifestyle change program across the country. In addition, some coaches have been delivering an earlier iteration of the group-based curriculum, <italic>Plan Forward, Group Lifestyle Balance, or I-CAN Prevent Diabetes</italic>, or have been trained by other entities. So the workforce of lifestyle coaches is diverse and growing. More than 3 out of 4 of the DTTAC trained lifestyle coaches are health-related professionals, and a significant proportion of those are certified diabetes educators (CDEs). Sixty percent of them are associated with a hospital or clinic, some type of government entity, or a community-based organization.</p>

<title>CDEs as Trainers, Coaches, and Advocates</title>
<p>What is the emerging role of the diabetes educator with the launch of the National DPP? As indicated earlier, CDEs are serving as DTTAC master trainers and lifestyle coaches in programs around the country. With Motivational Interviewing skills and the Conversation Map tool being utilized in many DSME programs, in addition to or in place of traditional diabetes education teaching, taking on the role of a lifestyle coach, as opposed to a more traditional educator role, is not a big stretch for many CDEs. However, serving as a lifestyle coach is by no means the only way educators are currently engaged or can be engaged with the National DPP. Diabetes educators can also play a role in program coordination, program mobilization, mentoring, and sustainability work. The CDC Recognition standards require that a site seeking recognition status has a designated diabetes prevention program coordinator. In some organizations, the lifestyle coach and program coordinator are one and the same, and in others that is not the case.</p>

<p>Diabetes educators coordinating DSME programs certainly have the skills and experience required of a prevention program coordinator.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Diabetes educators can also play a role in program coordination, program mobilization, mentoring, and sustainability work.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Diabetes educators can encourage stakeholders in the community to offer the program by raising awareness about the National DPP, organizing collaborative efforts to address issues around program implementation, training and/or reimbursement, and planning lifestyle change programs. Educators can mobilize efforts to implement the program in their own work setting with employees or clients with prediabetes and can work on sustainability efforts including policy work around third-party reimbursement. They can also mentor non-health care provider lifestyle coaches.</p>

<title>Getting Involved</title>
<p>So as National DPP programs begin to launch around the country, where should you start? Check out the registry of programs, in References, to see if anyone in your state or local community is offering the program. You may be able to collaborate with them or share in their learning. Contact your state health department Diabetes Prevention and Control Program to find out if there are statewide efforts to launch programs. Additionally, consider presenting the case for diabetes prevention programs to decision makers. Share data on the number of people with prediabetes that your program has worked with. Presenting local diabetes data available through your state diabetes control program or the CDC can also support the need for the National DPP in your community.</p>

<p>As the role of the diabetes educator continues to evolve, there will be more opportunities to provide leadership in improving the health of people at risk for diabetes and the services available to these individuals. ■</p>
