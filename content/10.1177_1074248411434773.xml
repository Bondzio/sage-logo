<sec><title>Objectives:</title>
<p>We aimed to characterize different cellular effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin 1 (AT1) receptor blockers (ARBs) as mono- or combination therapy in cardiac pressure overload.</p>
</sec>
<sec><title>Methods and Results:</title>
<p>C57B1/6 mice received either the ACEI ramipril (2.5 mg/kg body weight), the ARB telmisartan (20 mg/kg body weight), or the combination. In all groups, pressure overload was induced by transverse aortic constriction (TAC). Cardiac hypertrophy (heart weight/tibia length) induced by TAC was reduced in all 3 treatment groups, with the most pronounced effect in the telmisartan group. The cardiomyocyte short-axis diameter and cardiac fibrosis were increased by TAC and similarly reduced by ACEI, ARB, and the combination therapy. The TAC-induced increase in the number of proliferating Ki67<sup>pos</sup> cardiomyocytes and noncardiomyocytes was reduced more potently by ACEI than by ARB. Four days of drug treatment induced a significant increase in Scal<sup>pos</sup>/VEGFR1<sup>pos</sup> endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) in all animals in the treated SHAM groups. After 1 day of aortic constriction, only ramipril increased EPC numbers; after 5 weeks, telmisartan monotherapy did not change the EPC levels compared to vehicle or the combination therapy but raised it compared to ramipril. Neither TAC nor one of the therapies changed the number of cardiac capillaries per cardiomyocytes.</p>
</sec>
<sec><title>Conclusions:</title>
<p>ACE inhibition and AT1 receptor blockade have beneficial effects in remodeling processes during cardiac pressure overload. There are small differences between the 2 therapeutical approaches, but the combination therapy has no additional benefit.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The activity of the renin–angiotensin system (RAS) is involved in the pathogenesis of blood pressure, atherosclerosis, and myocardial hypertrophy. Two of the major drug classes used to reduce RAS activity are angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs). The ACEI blocks the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II and inhibits the breakdown of bradykinin. A disadvantage of ACEI is the “ACE escape” phenomenon, which is related to the tissue production of angiotensin II by enzymes other than ACE.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1074248411434773">1</xref> </sup>The human α-chymase is able to convert angiotensin I into angiotensin II and is assumed to be responsible for more than 80% of tissue angiotensin II formation in the human heart.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1074248411434773">2</xref>
</sup> The ACE is also identical to kininase II, the enzyme that metabolizes bradykinin to inactive fragments.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1074248411434773">3</xref>
</sup> Therefore, ACE inhibition leads to attenuation of bradykinin metabolism and to an increase in the local concentration of this potent vasodilator. The ARBs block RAS activity at the AT1 receptor, thereby also targeting angiotensin II produced by chymases. Since both classes differ, one could speculate that a combination of ACEI and ARB would have complementary effects.</p>
<p>The well-documented antihypertensive and antihypertrophic properties of ACEI and ARBs are associated with beneficial cardiovascular effects.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1074248411434773">4</xref>
</sup> In the heart, increased afterload leads to cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis and to upregulation of EPCs from the bone marrow which may contribute to myocardial angiogenesis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1074248411434773">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1074248411434773">6</xref>
</sup> We showed earlier that ACE inhibition using ramipril in a dose of 5 mg/kg body weight was ameliorating these effects in cardiac overload in mice.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1074248411434773">7</xref>
</sup> In patients after acute coronary syndrome, treatment with an ARB led to similar numbers of EPC in the peripheral blood as treatment with an ACEI.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1074248411434773">8</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>We therefore hypothesized that ACE inhibition and AT1 receptor blockade may have similar effects in increased cardiac afterload and wanted to test whether the combination of both drugs would be beneficial. We used doses of ramipril 2.5 mg/kg body weight and telmisartan 20 mg/kg body weight to mimic the 1:8 ratio used in large studies such as ONTARGET and TRANSCEND.<sup>

<title>Animals, Drug Treatment, and Transverse Aortic Constriction</title>
<p>The study was approved by the animal ethics committee of the Universität des Saarlandes and conforms to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the US National Institutes of Health (National Institutes of Health Pub. No. 85-23, revised 1996). Ten-week-old male C57/ Bl6 (Charles River Laboratories, Sulzfeld, Germany) were housed under standard conditions. Animals received at 10 weeks of age either ramipril at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg body weight in the form of pulverized tablets per kg body weight (Aventis, Frankfurt, Germany) introduced into the diet or telmisartan at a dose of 20 mg/kg body weight in the drinking water (Boehringer-Ingelheim, Ingelheim, Germany) or both drugs or a matched placebo diet (sniff, Germany) and normal drinking water. Three days after starting drug treatment or placebo diet, the animals were anesthetized with ketamine (100 mg/kg body weight, intraperitoneally [IP]) and xylazine (10 mg/kg, IP) for transverse aortic constriction (TAC). After orotracheal intubation using a 20-gauge catheter, the tube was connected to a volume-cycled rodent ventilator (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, Massachusetts) on supplemental oxygen with a tidal volume of 0.2 mL and respiratory rate of 110 per min. The chest cavity was entered in the second intercostal space at the left upper sternal border through a small incision and aortic constriction was performed by tying a 7-0 nylon suture ligature against a 27-gauge needle to yield a narrowing 360 µm in diameter and a TAC of 65% to 70%. Control mice underwent a sham operation. After 5 weeks, animals were anesthetized with ketamine (100 mg/kg body weight, IP) and xylazine (10 mg/kg, IP) and a 1.4F pressure-transducing catheter (Mikro Tip Catheter, Millar Instruments, Houston, Texas) was used for left ventricular (LV) pressure measurements. After the LV pressure measurements, hearts were rapidly excised. Hearts were partly snap-frozen and stored at −80°C, partly fixed and embedded in paraffin. Peripheral blood was sampled for further preparation.</p>

<title>Peripheral Blood Pressure</title>
<p>Peripheral blood pressure was obtained on the tail artery of mice 4 weeks after sham surgery or aortic constriction on 5 consecutive days using at least 20 repeating measurements per day (BP 2000 Series II Blood Pressure Analysis System, Visitech Systems, North Carolina).</p>

<title>Immunofluorescence Analysis</title>
<p>For pretreatment slices with 3-µm-thick sections were placed in Coplin jars with 0.05% citraconic anhydride solution, pH 7.4 for 1 hour at +98°C and then incubated overnight at 4°C with the first antibody, followed by the appropriate secondary antibody at 37°C for 1 hour. Immunofluorescence studies were performed by applying monoclonal antibodies against α-sarcomeric actin (clone5c5; Sigma-Aldrich, Schnelldorf, Germany) to detect cardiomyocytes. Sections were co-stained for capillary detection (Podocalyxin; R&amp;D Systems, Wiesbaden, Germany). Co-immunostaining for the antigen Ki67 (Novocastra Laboratories LTD, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK) was used to detect cycling cells. A green fluorescent protein (GFP)-specific antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) was used to enhance GFP fluorescence of tie2-positive bone marrow-derived cells in bone marrow-transplanted animals. The fluorescein isothiocyanate-, tetramethyl rhodamine isothiocyanate-, biotin-, and peroxidase- (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) conjugated anti-mouse immunoglobulin (Ig)M, anti-mouse IgG, anti-rabbit IgG, and anti-goat IgG were used as secondary antibodies and for amplification if necessary. Sections were counterstained with DAPI (Calbiochem, Darmstadt, Germany) and washed and mounted with fluorescent mounting medium (Vectashield; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, California) for fluorescence microscopic analysis. All sections were evaluated using a Nikon E600 epifluorescence microscope (Nikon, Düsseldorf, Germany) with appropriate filters.</p>

<title>Ramipril, Telmisartan, and Combination Therapy Do Not Increase Cardiac Capillarization</title>
<p>Cardiac capillaries were detected by immunostaining for podocalyxin. The number of capillaries per squared millimeter did neither change after 5 weeks of pressure overload nor by telmisartan, ramipril, or combination therapy (S 4404 ± 120, TAC 4250 ± 187, R-SHAM 4881 ± 493, T-SHAM 4622 ± 336, RT-SHAM 4877 ± 222). After TAC, the capillary number was not changed in mice treated with the ACEI but was even decreased in mice receiving the AT1-receptor antagonist or the combination treatment compared with the corresponding SHAM groups (R-TAC 4076 ± 174, T-TAC 3824 ± 155, RT-TAC 4032 ± 185; T-TAC <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05 vs T-SHAM; RT-TAC <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05 vs RT-SHAM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1074248411434773">Figure 4C</xref>). Regarding the ratio of capillaries to cardiomyocytes, there was only a significant decrease between telmisartan- and combination therapy-treated TAC groups compared to the TAC group receiving vehicle (S 2.1 ± 0.1, TAC 2.3 ± 0.1, R-SHAM 2.2 ± 0.2, T-SHAM 1.9 ± 0.1, RT-SHAM 2.0 ± 0.1, R-TAC 2.2 ± 0.1, T-TAC 2 ± 0.1, RT-TAC 2 ± 0.1; R-TAC &amp; T-TAC <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05 vs TAC; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1074248411434773">Figure 4D</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Mechanical pressure overload leads to cardiomyocyte hypertrophy as an adaptive response to the increase in wall stress induced by the increased external load. We aimed to know whether ACE inhibition and AT1 receptor blockade have similar effects in increased cardiac afterload and wanted to test whether the combination of both drugs would be beneficial.</p>
<p>We showed before that ACE inhibition reduces cardiac hypertrophy in transverse aortic constriction.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1074248411434773">7</xref>
</sup> In this study, telmisartan and the combination therapy showed a similar effect. Telmisartan in renovascular hypertensive rats also led to a reduced cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area which was dose dependent.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1074248411434773">12</xref>
</sup> This was believed to be caused by the reduction in the blood pressure which was dose dependent. In our study, telmisartan and the combination therapy reduced blood pressure significantly after TAC, which was not the case in the group receiving ramipril monotherapy as seen before using an even higher dose of ramipril.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1074248411434773">7</xref>
</sup> Therefore, the reduction in cardiomyocyte hypertrophy by treatment with ramipril seems to be independent of blood pressure. On the other side, telmisartan monotherapy and the combination therapy reduced cardiac hypertrophy, measured as heart weight per tibia length, stronger than the ramipril treatment which could be related to the differences in the blood pressure. So there may be additional effects of ACEI causing reduction in cardiac and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy apart form peripheral blood pressure.</p>
<p>Telmisartan as well as ramipril and the combination treatment abolished the extent of fibrosis induced by pressure overload to a similar extent. Therefore, this effect could be independent of blood pressure as described recently in hypertensive rats given excess of salt.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1074248411434773">13</xref>
</sup> On the other side, after TAC, LV systolic pressure was only reduced by the combination therapy. Since this reduction was followed neither by further reduction in cardiomyocyte size nor by a decrease in  cardiac fibrosis, neither the greater inhibition of angiotensin II by the combination therapy nor the decrease in LV systolic pressure could be beneficial or both mechanisms abrogate each other.</p>
<p>The ACEI treatment was shown to decrease the induction of collagens I and III, laminin, and fibronectin as well as the ratio of the gelatinolytic matrix metalloproteinase 2 to the tissue inhibitor<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1074248411434773">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1074248411434773">15</xref>
</sup> of matrixmetalloproteinases 4. In transforming growth factor-β1 transgenic mice receiving telmisartan, we also observed a reduction in interstitial fibrosis due to a normalized ratio of matrixmetalloproteinases and their inhibitors.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1074248411434773">16</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>We observed a greater extent of early EPC upregulation by ramipril than by telmisartan. We have not examined possible underlying mechanisms in this study but one could speculate that this could be due to a mobilization at different time points since after 5 weeks, no effect of ramipril or any other drugs on animals with pressure overload was observed, but telmisartan at this time point led to significant higher numbers of EPC than ramipril in TAC mice. Differences in a study performed in patients after acute coronary syndrome showing similar increases in EPC by ARB and ACEI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1074248411434773">8</xref></sup> might be explained by the different setting of acute ischemia versus the pressure overload model used in our study. Heart size and cardiac function are angiogenesis dependent and disruption of coordinated tissue growth and angiogenesis in the heart contributes to the progression from adaptive cardiac hypertrophy to heart failure in myocardial hypertrophy.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1074248411434773">17</xref> </sup>In animals with pressure overload induced by TAC receiving 5 mg ramipril per kg body weight, we observed an amelioration of the capillary–cardiomyocyte ratio.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1074248411434773">7</xref>
</sup> But in this study, neither ramipril at the lower dose of 2.5 mg nor telmisartan or the combination therapy were significantly influencing the cardiac capillary density in pressure overload compared to vehicle treatment. The difference in capillary density in contrast to our previous study using the higher dose of ramipril might be dose related. On the other side, the 2 drugs and their combination decreased cardiomyocte size significantly in aortic-ligated mice leading to a reduced diffusion distance which is important for an adequate supply of oxygen and nutrient substrates.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1074248411434773">18</xref>
</sup> Therefore, the capillary–cardiomyocyte mismatch was ameliorated in the mice receiving treatment compared to the vehicle-fed TAC group even if the number of capillaries did not decrease. The difference in capillary density in contrast to our previous study using the higher dose of ramipril properties might be dose related. In the literature, both proangiogenic<sup>

</sup> properties of ACEIs and AT1-receptor blockers have been described. The possible mechanisms for this phenomenon remain unresolved since ACE inhibition and AT1-receptor blockade also hamper neovascularization in other tissues.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1074248411434773">20</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>There was no additional effect of the combination therapy on top of the most efficient of the 2 drug classes. This was true for all the parameters tested in this study apart from the LV pressure. A magnetic resonance tomography study in a subgroup of high-risk patients with cardiovascular disease in the ONTARGET study revealed similar effects of telmisartan and ramipril on LV mass and volume, and the combination therapy was not more effective in high-risk patients with cardiovascular disease.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1074248411434773">25</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In conclusion, ACE inhibition and AT1-receptor blockade in remodeling processes during cardiac pressure overload showed similar beneficial effects concerning cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, cell cycling, and capillarization. Differences between the 2 therapeutic approaches were small, but the combination therapy had no additional benefit.</p>
