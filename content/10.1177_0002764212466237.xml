<abstract>
<p>This article outlines two realities about the Philippine labor market: the continuing expansion of the large informal economy and the continuing “flexibilization” of work in the narrow organized sector of the economy. The first is a consequence of the uneven development of the economy and its weak capacity to create stable jobs for a growing population. This expansion is reflected in the chain of urban and rural poor colonies mushrooming all over the archipelago. On the other hand, the flexibilization phenomenon in the formal labor market is manifested in various forms of flexible hiring arrangements, primarily through the service contracting modality. Flexibilization has generated fierce legal debates, especially regarding the so-called management prerogative of firms to outsource jobs held by regular workers. The article contends that social protection for the “precariat” in both the formal and informal sectors requires not only the passage of protective labor laws but also, and more importantly, an overhaul of the neoliberal and crisis-ridden economic policy regime that has been in place for nearly four decades.</p>

<body>
<p>Workers in the Philippines are experiencing an expansion in precarious work. Many of these precarious jobs are in the large and expanding informal economy, while workers in the narrow formal labor market hold jobs that are increasingly being subjected to varying forms of “informalization” or “casualization.” This article seeks to explain how these twin labor market phenomena have developed and how weaknesses in the agro-industrial policy regime have contributed to them. The article also outlines the various policies, existing and proposed, in support of social protection for precarious workers in both sectors of the economy. It is argued that a “rights-based” approach to social protection, via the passage of protective labor laws for the vulnerable, is insufficient to secure such protection, given the weaknesses of the economy.</p>
<p>The article has two major parts. The first discusses the growth of the informal economy, and the second is an inquiry of the informalization processes in the formal sector.</p>
<sec id="section1-0002764212466237">
<title>Informal Economy and Underdevelopment</title>
<sec id="section2-0002764212466237">
<title>Definitions and Nuance</title>
<p>The large informal sector is a catchment for workers who cannot find jobs in the limited and underdeveloped organized sector of the economy. Informal-sector work involves coping with the requirements of daily living, no matter how minimal the income is from an informal economic undertaking, which include hawking, home-based production, unregistered repair services, and so on.</p>
<p>The term <italic>informal sector</italic> was embraced by the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) in employment planning in the 1980s, courtesy of the Manila office of the International Labor Organization (ILO).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0002764212466237">1</xref></sup> The informal sector was then generally understood as including any economic activity not registered formally with the government and, therefore, not liable for taxes (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0002764212466237">Ofreneo, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>However, in 2002, the National Statistical Coordination Board (NSCB) adopted a more nuanced definition of the informal sector:
<disp-quote>
<p>The IS [informal sector] consists of “units” engaged in the production of goods and services with the primary objective of generating employment and incomes to the persons concerned in order to earn a living. These units typically operate at a low level of organization with little or no division between labor and capital as factors of production. It consists of household unincorporated enterprises that are market and non-market producers of goods as well as market producer of services. This means these are owned or operated by households engaged in the production of goods and/or services that are not constituted as legal entities independent of the households or household members that own them.</p>
<p>Labor relations, where they exist, are based on casual employment, kinship or personal and social relations rather than formal or contractual arrangements. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0002764212466237">NSCB, 2008</xref>, pp. 1-2)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The NSCB classified “household unincorporated enterprises” into two categories: “informal own-account enterprises” and “enterprises of informal employers.” For the Bureau of Labor and Employment Statistics (BLES) of DOLE, this means the informal sector includes self-employed or own-account workers without any paid employees as well as unpaid family workers. In a way, the informal sector is similar to another ILO concept of “vulnerable employment,” which includes unpaid family workers and nonemployer own-account workers.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the ILO published a report titled <italic>Decent Work and the Informal Economy</italic>, which adopted the broader term <italic>informal economy</italic> to cover all economic activities by workers and economic units that are—in law or in practice—not covered or insufficiently covered by formal arrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0002764212466237">ILO, 2002</xref>, p. 3). Today, the terms <italic>informal sector</italic> and <italic>informal economy</italic> are used interchangeably by advocates of social protection for the informal workers. In the proposed House Bill (HB) 768, providing for a “Magna Carta of Workers in Informal Employment,”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0002764212466237">2</xref></sup> the bill’s proponents cited both the ILO and NSCB definitions of informal sector and the informal economy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0002764212466237">Angara, Fernandez, &amp; Tanada, 2011</xref>). HB 768 included a remarkably long list of workers considered to be in informal employment:</p>
<list id="list1-0002764212466237" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Small farmers owning not more than 3 hectares, and rural and agricultural workers serving as tenants, sharecroppers, or laborers;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Small fisherfolk or operators owning boats of 3 tons or less, and fisherfolk who have no fishing equipment;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Home-based workers who are independent producers of goods or services, industrial home workers doing subcontracting work, and the self-employed engaged by other contractors to do subcontracting work;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Vendors, ambulant or not, with not more than a million peso capitalization [roughly US$23,000];</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Transport drivers, including “barkers,” fare collectors, dispatchers, and other workers, who share income with self-employed or unincorporated operators and transport operators [of jeepneys, pedicabs, tricycles, taxis, etc.] whose capitalization is not more than a million pesos;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Household domestic workers;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Noncorporate construction workers, referring to those hired informally or through subcontractors;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Small-scale miners doing their own processing, including those with capitalization of not more than a million pesos,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Workers of Barangay Micro Business Enterprises;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0002764212466237">3</xref></sup></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Noncorporate cargo handlers and allied workers;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Waste pickers and recyclers;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Workers engaged in producing seasonal products;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Own-account workers doing repair and maintenance of equipment, appliances, and so on, including beauticians, barbers, and masseuses;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>“On-call” workers in the entertainment, movie, and media industries, such as bit players, stuntpeople, makeup artists, and so on;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Volunteer workers in government receiving only allowances or honoraria, such as the <italic>barangay</italic> health workers and volunteers in nongovernment or people’s organizations; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Unpaid family members, workers receiving allowances, and seasonal workers in microenterprises and unincorporated household enterprises.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Interestingly, even this long list was appended with a statement that also included “Other similar economic activities that are ‘not illegal, criminal or life threatening in nature.’”</p>

<title>Population Growth, Urbanization, and Economic Change</title>
<p>Whatever the definition that is used, the informal sector has grown exponentially. One source for this is high population growth (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0002764212466237">Table 1</xref>), with the population more than tripling in 50 years, from 27 million in 1960 to 92 million in 2010. With the exhaustion of extensive agriculture in the 1960s (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0002764212466237">Hicks &amp; McNicoll, 1968</xref>), more and more of the growing population has since been absorbed by cities and urbanized towns.</p>

<p>A good indicator of rapid urbanization is the expansion of Manila into a giant metropolis called Metro Manila, now home to 11.5 million residents. There also has been a proliferation of cities, more than 120, in the 17 administrative regions of the country. In 2005, the urban population was estimated at 53 million, or more than 60% of the country’s total population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0002764212466237">Housing and Urban Development Coordinating Council &amp; Philippine Institute for Development Studies, 2009</xref>, p. 13).</p>
<p>Another contributor to the rapid expansion of the informal sector is the failure of agro-industrial development, which is reflected in the declining share of agriculture and industry in overall employment. The share of agriculture in overall employment shrank from more than half of the total in 1970 to only a third in 2010, whereas that of services rose from 28% to more than half in the same period (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0002764212466237">Table 2</xref>). The share of industry in employment declined slightly, from 16.5% to 15% from 1970 to 2010; however, the share of the manufacturing subsector dropped dramatically from 11.9% to 8.4%. Given an economy with a stagnant industrial sector and a declining agricultural sector, it does not take much imagination to conclude that many of the jobs generated in the country are in the informal sector, and mainly in the services.</p>

<title>Assessing the Informal Sector</title>
<p>Estimates on the size of the informal sector vary because there is no informal subsector category in the country’s labor statistical system. Although the National Statistics Office (NSO) carries out quarterly samplings of the labor force based on the usual classification of the labor force—by employment (employed, unemployed, and underemployed), by class (paid, unpaid, and own account), by hours of work, and by sector and subsector—there is no surveying of informal employment. In fact, informal economic activities can be found in all sectors, with the highest concentration in services and agriculture. The lack of survey data has been filled by estimates. For example, BLES-DOLE gives an informal sector estimate of about 41% of the total employed population of 36 million for <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0002764212466237">2010</xref> (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0002764212466237">Table 3</xref>). Interestingly, this is also the BLES-DOLE figure for the ILO’s vulnerable-employment category.</p>

<p>Another estimate is from the Employers’ Confederation of the Philippines (ECOP). The ECOP’s estimate is much higher—a whopping 77% of the employed, or 25 million out of the 36 million employed in 2006 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0002764212466237">Table 4</xref>). The higher ECOP estimate is attributable to the inclusion of the “underemployed” in the informal sector total. Underemployed workers are assumed to be in the huge galaxy of micro, small, and medium enterprises. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0002764212466237">Table 5</xref>, microenterprises with 1 to 10 employees account for 91.3% of establishments, according to an NSO survey in 2005, and employ roughly 2 million workers. It is also important to note that the data shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0002764212466237">Table 5</xref> are limited to registered enterprises; there are also hundreds of thousands of unregistered microenterprises in the country.</p>

<p>Overall, the BLES-DOLE estimate is an underestimate, whereas the ECOP’s figure is an overestimate. However, the ECOP estimate, meant to dissuade government from raising the minimum wage standard frequently because the informal-sector workers are left behind, is closer to the reality, given the large number of unregistered microenterprises in the country.</p>

<p>Under its commitment to the UN Millennium Development Goals, the Philippines government seeks to reduce the poverty rate recorded in 1990 by half by the year 2015. This has proved unachievable as poverty incidence has increased from 20% in 2003 to 20.9% in 2009 despite the continuous positive GDP growth from 2001 to 2009.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0002764212466237">4</xref></sup> It is clear that this growth was jobless and had only limited impact on equity. The 20.9% poverty rate corresponds to 3.86 million poor families or 23.1 million poor individuals (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0002764212466237">Table 6</xref>).</p>
<p>Social and economic inequality is also disturbing. The Gini coefficient has fluctuated within a narrow band between 0.44 to 0.48 in the past three decades (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0002764212466237">Figure 1</xref>). The foregoing coefficients indicate a highly unequal society. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0002764212466237">Tomas Africa (2011)</xref>, former NSO director, the income of the top 1% of families in 2009 and 1985 was equivalent to the aggregate income of the bottom 30%. He noted that there is “no visible middle class” in the Philippines.</p>

<title>Poverty count underestimation</title>
<p>Remarkably, the foregoing official poverty data, worrisome as they are, are understated. This is especially true in Metro Manila, which has an unbelievably low 2009 official poverty incidence rate of just 2.6%. This meant only 54,949 National Capital Region families (or fewer than 300,000 people) were considered poor in 2009. And yet any visitor to Manila cannot fail to notice the large colonies of slums all over the metropolis. A memo from the Presidential Management Staff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0002764212466237">Abad, 2011</xref>) revealed that a 2010 census of informal settlers by the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority showed a total of 556,526 informal settler families in the metropolis. At a conservative estimate of five members to a household, this easily translates to close to 3 million people or 26% of Metro Manila’s population. Most of these informal settlers are poor and belong to the large informal sector. The informal settler houses have uncertain legal status because they squat on either private or government lands.</p>
<p>A deeper scrutiny of the NSO 2009 data on poverty shows why the estimate is low. The poverty threshold was set at 46 pesos a day (at the time, a little less than US$1 a day). In Metro Manila, this amount will not meet the cost of even two simple meals, let alone three meals plus a portion for transport, utilities, and also on. A more realistic poverty threshold would be the World Bank’s US$2, which is a day global standard. At this level, fully half of the capital’s populations are poor. This figure happens to be similar to the self-rated poverty survey results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0002764212466237">“Poverty Numbers Worsen,” 2011</xref>) conducted by the Social Weather Station, a private social climate surveying institution, which also indicates rising rates of hunger.</p>

<title>Unemployment, Underemployment, and the Informal Economy</title>
<p>The magnitude of poverty and the informal economy are also reflected in the NSO data on the labor force, particularly in the unemployment and underemployment rates. In 2010, the labor force participation rate was registered at 64.3%, meaning 39.9 million out of the 62 million working-age population are in the active labor force. About 37.1 million (or 92.9%) of the labor force are employed, meaning the remaining 2.8 million are unemployed or have no jobs (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0002764212466237">Table 7</xref>). The statistics also show that there are 7.1 million underemployed, who have jobs but are actively looking for additional jobs. There are 3.97 million “unpaid” family workers. And there are 12.65 million who are working fewer than 40 hr a week. In sum, more than half of the employed do not actually have adequate and decent work.</p>

<p>The significant point is that there have been no visible signs of improvement in the past 30 years. For example, unemployment has gotten worse. It was recorded at a low rate of 4.9% in 1980 but increased to 7.3% in 2010; in between, it soared to 11.2% in 2000 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-0002764212466237">Table 8</xref>). It was reduced to a single digit in 2005, when the NSO survey question was modified, making it terribly taxing for an unemployed respondent to answer whether he or she was unemployed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0002764212466237">5</xref></sup> Underemployment rates remain virtually unchanged in the past three decades.

<title>Informal Households and Earning Modalities</title>
<p>Informal-sector workers and families are people living on the margin. They usually build makeshift houses (approximately 2 m × 2 m) made of light materials on vacant private and government lands and in potentially dangerous spaces, such as river embankments, sea walls, and canals. Some communities have even developed in public cemeteries. The Climate Change Congress of the Philippines, or <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0002764212466237">CCCP (2011)</xref>, identified the following among the poorest households: people living on push carts (which double for informal economic activities, such as scavenging), seawall households, those living under bridges, dumpsite households, hillside and mountaintop households, street households who move from one alley to another, and those living in cemeteries and the Luneta national park in Metro Manila.</p>
<p>In terms of income generation, the CCCP identified the poorest households. These included <italic>hagdaw</italic> households, who are families who come in after a harvest to glean or clean up leftovers, such as fallen rice stalks; alms-seeking households; slash-and-burn farming households (usually in hillsides of public lands); charcoal-making households based in remote hills and mountains; and small-scale mining households.</p>
<p>The CCCP also observed that many informal workers are mobile, meaning they move from place to place in search of odd jobs on a seasonal and even day-to-day basis. For example, the landless rural poor, who have no land rights and no fixed or regular jobs, may be seasonal agricultural workers one day (during planting and harvesting), coastal or river fisherfolk another day, and construction aides in the cities still another day. Similarly, the urban poor with no regular jobs also keep moving from one job to another or from one place to another in search of jobs. They could be ambulant peddlers one day, construction workers another day, and cargo handlers still another day.</p>
<p>A big group of informal workers are the home-based workers, such as those who produce handicrafts, toys, processed food, household accessories, and numerous other products right at home. During the heyday of the export-oriented garments industry in the 1980s and 1990s, more than half a million workers were estimated to be home based, doing subcontracted embroidery work or assembly of garment parts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0002764212466237">Ofreneo, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Most informal workers are engaged in varied forms of service provision or delivery, including domestic work, backyard repair services, cargo handling, hawking, sidewalk retailing, and informal construction services. Strikingly, the informal sector and informal economy are not only barely monitored but also generally unprotected. The Labor Code does not apply to them. Because they are not officially registered and taxed, the informal economic activities are not given formal legal protection. Also, because their work is generally casual, issues of overtime payment, health and safety, collective bargaining, and even unionism are largely missing in this sector.</p>

<title>On Social Protection for Informal Workers</title>
<p>What has been the government’s response to the basic economic requirements—jobs, food, housing, medical needs, and so on—of informal workers and their families?</p>
<p>In the past, the government exhibited a combination of benign neglect and occasional programs of assistance that were generally limited in scope and budget. Most often these programs involved relocation and low-cost housing for those living in vulnerable areas and relief goods distribution for those affected by disasters, such as floods. Relocation has always been problematic because there are usually no readily available jobs in the relocation areas. Hence, urban poor groups have demanded on-site or near-site urban housing-cum-development for the poor. In many cases, however, the urban poor are simply driven away by force by private and government land developers from the private and public lands that they were occupying.</p>
<p>During the presidency of Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (2001-2010), there were four major antipoverty programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0002764212466237">Manasan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0002764212466237">National Economic Development Authority, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0002764212466237">Asuncion &amp; Sale, 2009</xref>). The first was credit support for microfinance lending, with the government’s People’s Credit and Finance Corporation providing funds to nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) that on-lend to the “entrepreneurial poor,” such as those fattening pigs at home or maintaining a small neighborhood <italic>sari-sari</italic> store. Second, there was credit support for small enterprise development dubbed “<italic>Sulong</italic>” (advance). Third, there was assistance to the poorest communities and municipalities in building roads, water systems, clinics, and schools. Finally, the inclusion of indigents in the coverage of the Philippine Health Insurance (Philhealth) provided members with affordable health insurance premiums.</p>
<p>Another antipoverty program, the World Bank–supported conditional cash transfer (CCT), was introduced in 2008. The CCT program provides a poor family of five with a monthly cash allowance of P1,400 (US$32), which is contingent on the commitment of the mother to visit a maternal health clinic regularly and for school-age children to attend school regularly. The CCT program, funded by the national budget and loans from the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, has been criticized as an obvious political bonanza for the administration. Hence, Arroyo’s successor, Benigno Aquino, readily embraced and expanded the program, doubling the budget and target beneficiaries to 2 million in 2011 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0002764212466237">Department of Social Work and Community Development, 2011</xref>), with promises of further doubling in the coming years.</p>
<p>As this shows, governments past and present have been working toward increased protection for the poor and the informal workers. These programs are supplemented by other assistance programs, such as socialized pricing for electricity, rice subsidies, food-for-school programs, and socialized housing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0002764212466237">Manasan, 2010</xref>). And yet, the coverage and funding for these programs is generally limited. For instance, Philhealth coverage remains below 80% and the benefits are limited to certain medical procedures and medicines. A government-run contributory social security system has fewer than 10 million active members (out of 36 million employed). And the percentage of the national budget that goes to government-supported social protection programs is less than 2% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0002764212466237">Manasan, 2010</xref>, p. 125), far below the 6% suggested by the ILO as the minimum budget percentage for countries to be able to provide universal social protection to their populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0002764212466237">Pineda-Ofreneo, 2010</xref>, p. 6).</p>
<p>It is against this backdrop that several home-based and informal-sector organizations and NGO advocacy groups have banded together to form an alliance called Magna Carta for the Informal Sector Alliance, or MAGCAISA.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0002764212466237">6</xref></sup> The idea is to push for the passage in Congress of a so-called Magna Carta for the Informals (HB 768) that guarantees the following universal rights for informal workers: the right to a job, the right to form an association, and the right to get social protection in crisis periods, including the right to protection against harassment by agents of the state in relation to their micro and informal economic activities. The general policy demands of the alliance are self-explanatory: jobs for all, social security for all, health care for all, education and skills for all, basic services for all, social assistance to all in need, justice for all, and a voice for all (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0002764212466237">Pineda-Ofreneo, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The alliance argues that all these demands are basic rights all citizens are entitled to under the 1987 Philippine Constitution and the various UN Conventions on human, economic, and social rights. For example, Section 9, Article II of the Constitution states,
<disp-quote>
<p>The State shall promote a just and dynamic social order that will ensure the prosperity and independence of the nation and free the people from poverty through policies that provide adequate social services, promote full employment, a rising standard of living, and an improved quality of life for all.

<p>Every administration has officially declared its commitment to provide social and economic protection to the poor. The problem is that this commitment collides with the hard reality of a weak and underdeveloped economy unable to create jobs and provide social security for all. The Philippines has an eroding economic base. In particular, manufacturing, a major generator of formal-sector jobs, has declined sharply, especially when contrasted with the performance of its Asian neighbors (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table9-0002764212466237">Table 9</xref>).</p>

<title>Limited job creation</title>
<p>Why has the Philippine economy fared so poorly in the past four decades or so? Why has the Philippines, declared by the World Bank in the early 1960s as the second-fastest industrializing economy in Asia, failed to take off?</p>
<p>Although there have been a host of political, economic, and even cultural explanations, the most plausible explanation is related to the narrow export-oriented industrial (EOI) program favored by the neoliberal technocrats who have remained in the economic policy-making saddle for more than four decades despite dramatic changes in the nation’s political leadership and the failure of neoliberal policies. The EOI program was deepened in the 1980s and 1990s through a World Bank–supported structural adjustment program (SAP) in the 1980s and 1990s. Briefly, the EOI-SAP called for the opening up and liberalization of the economy through reduced tariffs, the elimination of other trade restrictions, greater openness to foreign investment, the deregulation of major economic sectors (finance, industry, services, and agriculture), and the privatization of government-owned and government-controlled corporations (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0002764212466237">Ofreneo, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0002764212466237">Fair Trade Alliance, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>EOI has produced some limited successes. There has been a proliferation of public and private “ecozones” hosting more than 1,000 enterprises and employing around half a million workers in the urbanized regions of the country. Another example is the phenomenal, although unplanned, growth of the call center–business process outsourcing (CC-BPO) sector, which employs more than half a million workers. The relative openness of the economy facilitated the establishment of CC-BPO firms being offshored by American, European, and Australian companies. The jobs generated tend to be for educated youth, who work mostly at night to service customers on the other side of the globe.</p>
<p>There have also been downsides. First, the EOI industries that have developed are few and are limited to garments, electronics, and auto parts. Second, these EOI industries can and do falter; for example, the labor-intensive garments industry has fewer than 100,000 workers today, down from a million in the 1990s because many garment investors relocated to China, Bangladesh, and other, cheaper global sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0002764212466237">Ofreneo, 2011</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0002764212466237">7</xref></sup> Third, many industries nurtured by import-substituting industrialization (ISI) have wilted under the EOI-SAP program. There has been a hollowing out or a deindustrialization of the national economy because of the unilateral liberalization of the Philippine trade regime ahead of other countries without any clear industrial development blueprint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0002764212466237">Bello, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0002764212466237">Fair Trade Alliance, 2006</xref>). For example, domestic producers have bewailed the lowering of tariffs below those of the country’s competitors, such as China and Thailand, and the inability of the government to stop the widespread smuggling of products competing with locally produced goods, such as shoes, vegetables, textiles, paper, steel, cement, petrochemicals, plastics, and ceramic tiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0002764212466237">Francia &amp; Ramos, 2011</xref>). And since smugglers and ecozone exporters do not pay taxes, the full burden of taxation in the Philippines falls hardest on the unprotected domestic industrial and commercial sectors and the consuming public. The crisis of the domestic-oriented producers is further compounded by the higher costs of doing business, such as the high price of power, now the highest in Asia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0002764212466237">“The Philippines Has the Most Expensive Electricity in Asia,” 2011</xref>), and a lack of infrastructure. Thus, even the multinationals that set up Philippine subsidiaries during the ISI period, such as drug, home appliance, and pharmaceutical firms, have closed their production facilities in favor of production consolidation in nearby Thailand and Indonesia since the 1990s. Philippine operations were transformed into import-and-distribute business undertakings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0002764212466237">Fair Trade Alliance, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Other reasons for the Philippine industrial debacle include the following: lack of technological upgrading (stuck at the assembly level in the export sector and no modernization in the domestic sector), the high cost of servicing huge domestic and foreign borrowings (consuming almost one third of the annual national budget), and failures in governance (corruption, red tape, and poor infrastructure) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0002764212466237">Lim, 2010</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section12-0002764212466237">
<title>Stagnating agricultural sector</title>
<p>In agriculture, a similar pattern of economic torpor has developed. Although there has been growth in production and job creation in the “nontraditional” export-oriented fruit subsector producing mainly bananas and pineapples, there is production and job stagnation elsewhere. For example, the much larger food subsector (rice, corn, and vegetables) and the equally large traditional export subsector (sugar, coconuts, and tobacco) have exhibited stagnation. The poor performance of agriculture was fully revealed in 2008 when the Philippines became the world’s biggest rice importer. This fact caused considerable national embarrassment as the country has a large rural population and has long produced rice. In 1995, ironically the first year of the Philippine’s membership in the World Trade Organization, the country became a net agricultural importing country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0002764212466237">Fair Trade Alliance, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>This poor performance in agriculture can be traced to the combined effects of several factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0002764212466237">Fair Trade Alliance, 2006</xref>). The government’s failure to support domestic agricultural development in capacity building and in implementing the Agricultural and Fisheries Modernization program ranks high. The government has failed to invest in rural infrastructure, human resources, or support services for the small farmers and agrarian reform beneficiaries. Likewise, it has been unable to reduce the high cost of farming (e.g., the high cost of inputs and irrigation). There is also the incapacity to stop the smuggling of competing agricultural products (particularly, onion, garlic, and vegetables) and to level the domestic playing field through fair trade measures. In addition, the sector is hobbled by the weak and delayed implementation of the state’s comprehensive agrarian reform program, now in its 24th year.</p>

<sec id="section13-0002764212466237">
<title>Growth of the services, informal economy</title>
<p>As indicated above, it is the services sector that has grown most rapidly. The Philippines has become a services-led economy without having experienced an industrial revolution.</p>
<p>The sector has two major subsectors, one that is formal and another that is informal. The most prominent formal industry is CC-BPOs, which employ young, English-speaking, and tech-savvy workers who enjoy entry wages at least twice the mandated minimum wage in Metro Manila. But the bulk of employment in the formal service subsector is actually in the traditional service industries, such as food, education, real estate, distribution, and entertainment, where many of the workers are often low-paid casual workers. These industries are also remittance-driven industries, largely buoyed by the spending of families of overseas Filipino workers (OFWs).</p>
<p>The informal side of the service sector is huge. It is composed of numerous micro and informal income-generating activities undertaken by the poor, such as hawking, vending, unregistered repair and personal services, home-based outwork, and similar activities.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0002764212466237">
<title>Rise of a remittance-driven economy</title>
<p>It is against this backdrop that one can appreciate the tremendous expansion of the overseas labor market. Because of the failure of the local economy to produce good jobs, workers have flooded out of the country seeking better jobs and pay. The Philippine “manpower export” program was originally launched in the mid-1970s as a “stop-gap” employment program but has become huge and permanent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0002764212466237">Ofreneo, 2010</xref>). This is because the EOI-SAP program, which was meant to solve the problem of lagging growth, never took off. The estimate of the total number of OFWs and other “overseas Filipinos” was more than 8 million in 2006 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0002764212466237">Commission on Overseas Filipinos, 2008</xref>), or nearly 10% of the total population. OFW remittances, which exceeded US$20 billion or some 10% of GDP in 2011 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0002764212466237">Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, 2012</xref>), are the reason growth in the country has been described as increasingly consumption led. The OFWs and their families have disposable incomes that they spend on consumption goods, such as home appliances, and services, such as education. Some one fifth of the country’s population are directly dependent on the OFWs for its daily needs.</p>
<p>The remittance economy has little impact for informal-sector workers and families. Informal workers have limited opportunities to work overseas. Two major requirements for success in the search for overseas jobs are education and formal labor market experience. Informal-sector workers lack formal labor market experience as well as education qualifications. An analysis of informal workers by DOLE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0002764212466237">BLES, 2008b</xref>) for 2001 to 2006 shows that 43% to 46% had only elementary education, with just half graduating. Secondary education was attained by 35% to 37%, with just more than half graduating, meaning only 15% to 16% percent reached college and just 9.5% to 10.5% graduated from college.</p>

<title>“Informalization” of the Formal Labor Market</title>
<p>To this point, the article has concentrated on the informal sector and informal employment. At the same time, the narrow formal side of the labor market has also seen considerable change. The expansion of the informal sector has been complemented by a process of “informalization” in the formal labor market, which is making work more precarious. This trend is aided by jobless growth in the organized sector previously mentioned and the availability of a large reserve army of flexible labor from the agricultural and informal sector. This process of informalization is dubbed as “contractualization” or “casualization,” which generally refers to short-term and unprotected temporary hiring arrangements. A popular slang term used for a short-term worker is <italic>Endo</italic>, meaning one whose employment contract has ended or is bound to end in a short time.</p>
<p>The Philippine trade union movement, which is divided on many issues, such as the minimum wage, is consistently united in its denunciation of the flexibilization phenomenon. Flexibilization consists of various forms of flexible job hiring arrangements, such as the outsourcing or subcontracting of work, deployment of agency-hired and third-party-managed workers within the company’s work premises, and/or direct hiring of workers under short-term employment contracts. This is why the union at the Philippine Long Distance Telecom Company—formerly a large union with approximately 10,000 members but that now has just 2,000, attributable in part to the impact of informalization—has succeeded in building a broad-based labor coalition called Kilusan Laban sa Kontraktualisasyon, or “Movement Against Contractualization” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0002764212466237">De Vera, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Another big union, the Philippine Airlines (PAL) Employees Association (PALEA), also has managed to get the support of various competing labor groups, as well as the attention of the Philippine Congress, in its bitter fight with the PAL management regarding the outsourcing of 2,600 jobs occupied by unionized regular workers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0002764212466237">8</xref></sup> Congress has been conducting public hearings on the PAL-PALEA dispute and asking both sides to explain what the appropriate policy on job outsourcing should be. PAL management argues that outsourcing is a global trend and that the airline company cannot survive if it does not adopt the same global work practice. On the other hand, the PALEA union argues that the workers’ basic union, job, and collective bargaining rights are being violated by the outsourcing measure, in violation of the Labor Code provision on security of tenure of regular workers. Both sides raise legal arguments in support of their respective positions: PALEA cites the Labor Code provisions protecting regular jobs, whereas PAL management cites Supreme Court rulings and Civil Code provisions on “management prerogative” to outsource jobs as needed or as required by “business exigency” (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0002764212466237">Azucena, 2010</xref>). The PAL-PALEA dispute on outsourcing, which led to a near-paralysis of PAL operations in late 2011 because of the labor protests, is the most explicit illustration of the fierce debates between unions and employers on the issue of labor flexibility.</p>
<sec id="section16-0002764212466237">
<title>Forms of Flexibilization</title>
<p>Unfortunately for the unions and many workers, the realities in the labor market are not favorable for them. Informalization related to demands for flexibilization is widespread on the formal side of the services, industry, and agriculture sectors.</p>
<p>Although flexibilization takes varied forms, the common thrust is to put workers under short-term employment arrangements, with the job contract ranging anywhere from 1 week to less than 3 years. The latter 3-year term is the usual length or duration of a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) in the Philippines, which explains why trade unionists complain that they have fewer and fewer workers to organize for collective bargaining purposes. Moreover, under existing jurisprudence, nonregular workers are usually excluded from the scope of the CBA coverage. The following are the different forms of labor flexibilization according to two major studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0002764212466237">Abrera-Mangahas, Hernandez, Ofreneo, Sancho, &amp; Soliman, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0002764212466237">Sibal, Amante, &amp; Tolentino, 2007</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section17-0002764212466237">
<title>Hiring workers as temporaries or on probation with no intention of regularizing them</title>
<p>Under the Labor Code of the Philippines, a company is allowed to subject workers to 6 months of probation, beyond which he or she is entitled to regularization if the job is “regular and necessary” to the business. A company is also allowed to hire a casual worker; however, a year of accumulated service, even if intermittent, means he or she is also entitled to regularization. The outcome of these provisions is that some companies and placement and manpower agencies use short-term workers on a so-called 5-5 arrangement, meaning they are hired for only 5 months without any intention of regularizing these workers (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0002764212466237">Abrera-Mangahas et al., 1999</xref>). For manpower agencies with a network of partner companies, these workers are simply redeployed to another company for another 5 months, meaning that the company is able to avoid the legal requirement for regularization following at least 6 months of continuous probationary service.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0002764212466237">
<title>Hiring workers as “project employees.”</title>
<p>Under the law, the tenure of project employees is coterminus with the project they are assigned to, for example, developing a cellular transmission tower for a telecom company whose completion is bound to happen on “a certain day.” This is the usual and well-established system of hiring workers in the construction industry, where work moves from one project to another. The concept of project hiring, which can be for longer durations depending on the project (e.g., 3 years), has been adopted by nonconstruction companies or industries, which simply package different aspects of work, such as the assembly of one set of goods, treated as a project separate from the succeeding assembly of another set of goods. In the booming CC-BPO sector, most jobs are under project hiring arrangements.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0002764212466237">
<title>Hiring of trainees</title>
<p>Under the law, companies can hire trainees, anywhere between 6 months and 2 years, at compensation rates that are 25% below the minimum wage. Some companies in the electronics assembly and auto parts industries are heavy users of this scheme. In one big electronics company with around 20,000 workers, there are 19 apprentices-trainees for every one regular employee (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0002764212466237">Ofreneo &amp; Hernandez, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The foregoing are in addition to the old but continuing flexible work and compensation arrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0002764212466237">Kapunan &amp; Kapunan, 2006</xref>). They include the following: work on a commission basis, meaning workers are paid on the basis of a percentage of the sales they make; a “boundary” system, which is common in the transport sector (drivers are supposed to turn over a fixed daily amount or “boundary” to the transport owner, e.g., taxi, and appropriate to himself or herself whatever is the surplus; and a piece-rate system, meaning workers are paid on the basis of results (quite common in the heyday of the garments industry). There are also seasonal workers, or those hired during peak demands for business, for example, production of Christmas decorations for the Christmas season.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-0002764212466237">
<title>Job contracting within company premises</title>
<p>The most common way of promoting labor flexibilization is the company use of services provided by third-party manpower agencies that deploy project and other short-term workers within company premises. This job or service contracting is also the subject of heated debates among Philippine industrial relations actors. Service or labor contracting agencies are “manpower agencies,” which maintain “manpower pools” and place workers on a temporary basis in different companies to do all kinds of functions, supposedly all under their control and on their payroll. The question arises: Who is the real employer of these workers? The principal company, which contracted the services of the agency, or the agency, which places the workers in the principal’s business? The unions contend that it is the principal, who evades compliance with mandated labor standards, such as regularization of tenure and payment of benefits due a regular employee, through the use of these agencies. The unions complain that agency workers often outnumber the direct hires, especially in service industries, such as the distribution, hotel, and restaurant industries as well as labor-intensive manufacturing industries.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0002764212466237">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>In recent years, there also has been a proliferation of “manpower cooperatives,” which operate like the regular service agencies and yet claim that the workers they are deploying are not workers but “service cooperators.” They argue that as service cooperators, these workers are not covered by labor laws because they are “co-owners” of the cooperative. Hence, these workers get only “daily allowances.” However, in 2009, the Supreme Court ruled that Asia-Pro, a big manpower cooperative, had employer-employee relations with the workers deployed in a banana plantation in Mindanao and should, therefore, remit to the Social Security System the social security contributions for their workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0002764212466237">Azucena, 2010</xref>, pp. 153-154).</p>
<p>The debate on the legitimacy of job contracting revolves around the “labor contracting” provisions of the 38-year-old Labor Code (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0002764212466237">Azucena, 2010</xref>). The Labor Code’s Articles 106 through 109 prohibit “labor-only contracting” (LOC) but recognize the legitimacy of “independent job contracting.” The former is defined as a situation where the contracting agency has no substantial capital to back up its capacity to do the outsourced work, no equipment or tools to undertake the work, and no control over the manner and conduct of the work as performed by the recruited workers. The latter, independent job contracting, is simply the opposite of the former, LOC.</p>
<p>The problem is that in real life, the distinction between LOC and independent job contracting usually gets blurred. The proposals of the trade unions and sympathetic legislators in Congress are for the tightening of rules against job contracting (e.g., nonregulars should constitute not more than 20% of the total workforce) to outright “criminalization” of job outsourcing. On the other hand, the business community, represented by ECOP, is adamantly opposed to all these demands and has been calling instead for full liberalization of the labor market (including ease in the hiring and firing of workers) and all forms of outsourcing, arguing that this is the way of doing business and creating jobs in a globalized economy.</p>

<title>The number of nonregulars</title>
<p>BLES has conducted surveys showing a rising trend in nonregular hiring (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table10-0002764212466237">Table 10</xref>). Nearly one fourth or 24.3% of the total 731,546 workers hired by companies with 20 or more workers are nonregulars, a jump of 16.4% from the 2004 figure (628,000). Moreover, it is evident that the flexible hiring practices favored by many employers are the 5-5 arrangement and project hiring.</p>

<p>Note: CBAs = collective bargaining agreements. The listing of unions includes the active and inactive, including those being claimed by different labor federations and centers. However, the Bureau of Labor Relations has tightened the registry of active CBAs and the list of active union members.</p>

<p>Overall, unionism is on the retreat. There has been a steady decline of unionization in both the entire employed sector and among the wage and salary earners from 1990 to the present. As can be deduced from the foregoing discussion, one ineluctable explanation is the increasing flexibility in hiring arrangements, which makes it doubly difficult for unions to organize workers.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The Philippine labor market, formal and informal, has been veering more and more toward flexibility. Jobs in the large informal sector are precarious, generally unprotected, and increasingly precarious. This is why the MAGCAISA is seeking the enactment of a law prescribing universal health insurance and social protection for all informal workers.</p>
<p>At the same time, jobs in the small formal labor market are increasingly being “informalized,” subjected to various forms of labor flexibility measures employed by companies that also make work more precarious. As a result, unionism is on the retreat, bargaining rights are on the decline, and nonregular employment is widespread. This is why unions and their friends in Congress have been pushing for restrictions on job outsourcing and more protection for workers, regular and nonregular.</p>
<p>However, the demand for more protection for workers in both the informal and formal labor markets will not be effective if there is no overhaul of the existing development framework, which the Philippines has pursued in the past four decades. Curbing labor abuses in the formal and informal labor markets requires an overhaul of economic programs that have failed the nation in creating and delivering stable, decent, and sustainable jobs for all Filipino workers.</p>

<p>The methodology used by the National Statistics Office (NSO) in measuring poverty has undergone at least four major changes (or “refinements,” in the words of NSO director Romulo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0002764212466237">Virola, 2011</xref>) in the past three decades.

<p>To be unemployed, one must be of working age, have no work, be seriously looking for work, and, should a job be available today, be prepared to take it. If the answer is uncertain, some unemployed respondents are likely to be placed under the category “not in the labor force.” In other countries, however, surveys probe into the phenomenon of idle workers who are not in the labor force by clarifying whether the active search for jobs was because of discouragement from failed efforts in the past or expectation that no jobs are really available in the labor market. Labor economists call such workers “discouraged workers.”</p>

<p>Ironically, the garments industry, engaged primarily in re-export manufacturing based on imported materials, contributed to the early demise of the country’s import-substituting industrialization textile industry, which employed around 300,000 workers in the 1970s; the failure was attributed to the limited linkages between the two sectors. There were widespread accusations that export-oriented industrial garments producers overimported duty-free textile materials, which eventually found their way into the domestic market.</p>

<p>In 1998, Philippine Airlines (PAL) Employees Association (PALEA) succumbed to the pressure of president Joseph Estrada to accept a 10-year moratorium in its collective bargaining with PAL management. In 2009, the commencement of bargaining was disrupted with the PAL decision to outsource 2,600 jobs (ground crew, reservations, and catering). PALEA filed an unfair-labor-practice case against the outsourcing decision. The Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) sustained the position of PAL management in 2010; on appeal, DOLE and Malacanang reaffirmed this decision.</p>
