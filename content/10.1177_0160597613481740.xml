<italic>We Shall Not Be Moved</italic> is a timely and useful look at the process of urban rebuilding in post-Katrina New Orleans. Though the book has its shortcomings, it does provide a window into some of the tragedies, failures, and successes of post-Katrina New Orleans. A passionately written book, <italic>We Shall Not Be Moved</italic> provides a rich descriptive account of five New Orleans’ neighborhoods, Broadmoor, Ninth Ward, Lakeview, Hollygrove, and Village de l’Est, that the author feels are representative of the population of pre-Katrina New Orleans and that were deeply affected by Katrina and the floods. Wooten looks at each neighborhood over three critical time periods: when Katrina hit, the first year after Katrina, and the period beginning in the second year after the flooding through the present.</p>
<p>The richness of the book lies in its emphasis on storytelling, particularly the stories of the neighborhood residents and volunteers. The reader gets to know many courageous and persistent residents who, against all odds, rebuilt their neighborhoods from the ground up. While there have been many excellent examinations of the immediate disaster, such as <italic>One Dead in Attic</italic>, this kind of multiyear follow-up of the rebuilding process is extremely valuable.</p>
<p>While the rebuilding of homes was critically important, these folks also built and nurtured a deep sense of community. It is this level of the narrative that is most striking. Community often appears most vivid in the aftermath of disaster, as well documented in Rebecca Solnit’s <italic>A Paradise Built in Hell</italic>. Authorities responding to “elite panic” during disasters generally call out the troops to quell looting and disturbances, but people on the ground consistently tell a different story, where it was organized community effort, not chaos, that characterized responses to the disaster.</p>
<p>What is particularly useful is his description of the tremendous community organizing efforts that have taken place in the five neighborhoods. He emphasizes the role that local community groups played in connecting with former neighbors, encouraging them to return, and providing assistance to those who did return. The heroic efforts of people like Pam Dashiell in the Ninth Ward deserve attention and applause, not just because of their work in the aftermath of the disaster, but because they represent countless other neighborhood activists across the city and the country that face similarly disinterested local governments and unrestrained corporate power. In New Orleans, you need only to look at the city’s treatment of public housing activists during the closure of 4,500 housing units, many undamaged by Katrina, to see the ruthlessness of government responses to concerned neighborhood activists. While the level of disorganization and destruction caused by Katrina was unquestionably massive, the lack of respect shown to these neighborhood leaders by local government and corporate leaders is, unfortunately, the norm throughout the country. The work of Diane Wilson comes to mind, particularly her book <italic>An Unreasonable Woman</italic> (and in her 2007 keynote speech to the Association for Humanist Sociology). In it she documents government and corporate indifference to the massive amount of industrial pollution killing off the shrimping industry and, ultimately, the culture in the Gulf and the unrelenting harassment of community activists like herself.</p>
<p>In most American cities, community associations and churches are the major forms of local social organization. And while that is true in New Orleans, the city also has the advantage of an independent layer of neighborhood organizing that revolves around Mardi Gras. The Mardi Gras Indian tradition, local Mardi Gras krewes, and the Social Aid and Pleasure Clubs represent a tremendous network of interconnected social groups, some very much neighborhood based. The author’s focus strictly on traditional neighborhood associations and churches leaves out a major dimension to the recovery about which he is writing. New Orleans has a unique culture among American cities. A greater appreciation of these cultural and artistic dimensions in the rebuilding of New Orleans would have given the reader a more complete understanding of how and why some neighborhoods came back and others are still struggling.</p>
<p>It is difficult to talk about the rebuilding of New Orleans without dealing with the truly catastrophic loss of public housing. Indeed, the fight over public housing communities in the aftermath of Katrina was one of the biggest stories in the rebuilding process. Unfortunately, that important story, of a poorer population than Wooten chose to examine, remains untold here. The lack of social and historical context is a shortcoming to this book and is particularly obvious in this regard. With the obvious importance of geography and location in the analysis of the rebuilding effort, more detailed maps would have been extremely useful, especially for readers not intimately familiar with the city.</p>
<p>This book is a fine attempt to tell a complex and multilevel story. It whets ones appetite for a more sociological account that colors in the social, political, geographical, and historical background and gives even greater meaning to the challenges and successes of these residents that Wooten so sensitively portrays.</p>
