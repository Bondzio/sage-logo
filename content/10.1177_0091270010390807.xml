<abstract>
<p>A0001 (α-tocopherylquinone) is a potent antioxidant currently in development for the treatment of symptoms associated with inherited mitochondrial disorders. A0001 pharmacokinetics were studied in a single-blind, adaptive design study following a single daily oral dose of placebo (n = 2) or ascending doses of A0001 (n = 8) at 0.25 and 0.5 g under a fasted state or a 0.5- to 6-g dose with a high-fat meal. Dose escalation was based on safety assessment, and proceeding dose levels were selected based on interim pharmacokinetic analyses. A0001 plasma concentration-time profiles were similar across doses, reaching peak concentration within 4 to 6 hours, with concentrations returning to baseline within 24 hours. Exposure was highly dependent on food and dosing frequency. Exposure was nearly 60-fold higher with food but increased subproportionally above 1-g dose; however, the nonproportionality was offset by administering A0001 in divided doses (0.735 g, 3 times per day). The potential for an A0001:vitamin E interaction was also explored, as vitamin E use is prevalent in this patient population, and suggested that a clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction is not likely. A0001 was well tolerated with no serious adverse events or dose-limiting toxicities. These findings suggest that A0001 has a favorable pharmacokinetic profile when administered orally with food.</p>

<p>A0001 (α-tocopherylquinone, 2-[(3<italic>R</italic>,7<italic>R</italic>,11<italic>R</italic>)-3-hydroxy-3,7,11,15-tetramethyl-hexadecyl]-3,5,6 trimethylcyclohexa-2,5-diene-1,4-dione) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0091270010390807">Figure 1</xref>) is a semisynthetic compound currently in phase 2 development for the treatment of Friedreich’s ataxia (FA) and mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS). Friedreich’s ataxia is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive gait and limb ataxia, dysarthria. and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0091270010390807">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0091270010390807">3</xref></sup> Patients have large expansions of GAA triplet repeats in the first intron of the frataxin gene, resulting in reduced expression of this mitochondrial protein. Similarly, MELAS is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder with progressive loss of brain and motor function, as indicated by the mnemonic.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0091270010390807">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0091270010390807">6</xref></sup> In MELAS, mutations in transfer RNA alter the synthesis of specific proteins in the mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes. As a result, both diseases are characterized by deficiencies in mitochondrial complexes I, II, and III and aconitase enzyme activities with apparent reduced capacity for ATP generation and increased production of free radical oxygen species.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0091270010390807">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0091270010390807">8</xref></sup></p>

<p>The involvement of mitochondrial respiratory chain dysfunction and oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of FA and MELAS suggests the course of the disease may be modified—at least in part—by treatment with coenzyme Q<sub>10</sub> (CoQ<sub>10</sub>) and other antioxidants; CoQ<sub>10</sub>, a lipid-soluble component of cell membranes, functions as both a cofactor in the mitochondrial electron transport chain and in its reduced form (ubiquinone) as an antioxidant.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0091270010390807">9</xref></sup> Clinical efficacy studies using high doses of CoQ<sub>10</sub>, with and without other antioxidants such as vitamin E, have been conducted in patients with these diseases with limited success.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0091270010390807">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0091270010390807">13</xref></sup> Investigators have pointed to vitamin E and CoQ<sub>10</sub> bioavailability, which are known to be regulated or limited by transfer proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0091270010390807">14</xref></sup> and oral absorption,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0091270010390807">15</xref></sup> respectively, as potential underlying causes for marginal clinical performance,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0091270010390807">16</xref></sup> leading to the search for more effective and more bioavailable antioxidants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0091270010390807">17</xref></sup> Recently, idebenone was approved in Canada (Catena, Santhera Pharmaceuticals, Liestal, Switzerland) for the symptomatic management of patients with FA. Structurally, idebenone contains the same quinone moiety as does CoQ<sub>10</sub> but differs significantly in its lipid properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0091270010390807">18</xref></sup> However, very low idebenone plasma concentrations (C<sub>max</sub> ~ 31 ng/mL at the 0.75-g dose) have been reported due to its rapid metabolism to inactive metabolites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0091270010390807">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>A0001 has been granted orphan drug status by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of inherited mitochondrial respiratory chain diseases. The rationale for developing A0001 for the treatment of these diseases is based on cellular pharmacology studies as well as its structural similarity to CoQ<sub>10</sub>. A0001 differs from CoQ<sub>10</sub> primarily in its pattern of chemical substituents and electronics of the <italic>p</italic>-benzoquinone ring system. Based on its structure, A0001 has a more favorable redox potential than does CoQ<sub>10</sub>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0091270010390807">20</xref></sup> Thus, A0001 is expected to mitigate mitochondrial oxidative stress,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0091270010390807">21</xref></sup> protect against lipid peroxidation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0091270010390807">22</xref></sup> and potentially facilitate electron transfer in a dysfunctional respiratory complex.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0091270010390807">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>Measurable levels of α-tocopherylquinone have been reported previously in the plasma of animals and humans in the absence of exogenous A0001 administration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0091270010390807">24</xref></sup>; however, the source of endogenous α-tocopherylquinone remains unclear. Although some have proposed that α-tocopherylquinone is a minor metabolite of vitamin E (less than 1%) in humans,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0091270010390807">25</xref></sup> others question the validity of these findings because vitamin E is known to oxidize to α-tocopherylquinone during sample preparation and analysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0091270010390807">26</xref></sup> Adding to the uncertainty of the origin of α-tocopherylquinone, labeled metabolic tracer studies in rats indicated that α-tocopherylquinone originates from de novo synthesis involving tyrosine and mevalonic acid.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0091270010390807">27</xref></sup> Conversely, vitamin E is a known essential nutrient in humans. Deficiencies in natural vitamin E (α-tocopherol or α-VitE), which comprises more than 90% of the total vitamin E in plasma, are associated with neurologic and neuromuscular disorders.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0091270010390807">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0091270010390807">29</xref></sup> α-VitE plasma concentrations are tightly mediated, predominantly through selective binding to the α–tocopherol transfer protein.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0091270010390807">14</xref></sup> In vitro binding affinity of α-tocopherylquinone for α–tocopherol transfer protein was reported to be less than 2% that of α-VitE itself.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0091270010390807">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>As part of A0001 development, a phase 1 single ascending-dose study was undertaken to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics of A0001 over a 36-fold dose range. A0001 is a highly lipophilic compound (clog P &gt; 10) with poor water solubility (less than 1 µg/mL). Thus, its absorption is expected to be affected by food, whereas exposure may be dose limited due to its lack of aqueous solubility. Hence, the pharmacokinetics of A0001 were evaluated in both the fed and fasted states. To facilitate dose escalation decisions and overall conduct of the trial, an adaptive trial design (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0091270010390807">Figure 2</xref>) with key decision points based on rapid drug plasma analysis was employed. The pharmacokinetics following single oral doses of A0001, effect of food, and benefits of the adaptive design are presented herein. In the same study, the potential for an A0001/α-VitE pharmacokinetic drug interaction was explored in healthy subjects as patients with mitochondrial disorders are likely to be taking vitamin E supplements. In addition, the effect of A0001 on endogenous α-VitE plasma concentrations was also investigated.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>The study was conducted at a single center in the United States between July 10, 2008, and October 5, 2008. Informed consent for all subjects was obtained prior to the conduct of any study-related procedures. The clinical study protocol, amendments, informed consent document(s), and any other appropriate study-related documents were reviewed and approved by an independent ethics committee/institutional review board. This study was conducted in full accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki; <italic>Good Clinical Practice: Consolidated Guideline</italic>, approved by the International Conference on Harmonization; good clinical practices as required by and described in 21 Code of Federal Regulations parts 50, 54, 56, 312 subpart D, and 314; and standard operating procedures for clinical investigation.</p>

<title>Study Drug</title>
<p>The drug product “A0001 for solution” was provided by Penwest Pharmaceuticals (Patterson, New York) and was formulated as a solution in olive oil (NF, 1:1, wt/vol) in a multidose container. The placebo solution consisted of olive oil alone. The appropriate dosing volume, corresponding to the targeted dose, was dispensed using an oral syringe.</p>
<p>Commercially available capsules of natural vitamin E (Puritan’s Pride) contained 400 IU of natural vitamin E acetate that is equivalent to approximately 300 mg of natural vitamin E (<italic>RRR-D-(+)-</italic>α-tocopherol or α-VitE). Although most vitamin E supplements are sold mainly as the synthetic form (all-racemic, a mixture of 8 stereoisomers), the α-VitE analogue was selected for the study as it is the stereochemical form where the interaction would be the most expected.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0091270010390807">31</xref></sup></p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Ten healthy, nonsmoker male subjects per dose level, between 18 and 55 years of age with a body mass index between 18 and 32 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, were eligible for enrollment in the study. Exclusion criteria included known hypersensitivity or allergy to A0001 or vehicle components; history of significant cardiovascular or pulmonary dysfunction within 6 months before screening; abnormal laboratory values that were considered clinically significant by the investigator; prior or concurrent use of prohibited prescription medications, over-the-counter medications, multivitamins, or natural medicine (herbal) products including CoQ<sub>10</sub> and vitamin E supplements within 14 days before check-in and for the duration of the study; positive urine drug screen; and consumption of alcoholic beverages, poppy seeds, grapefruit, and/or grapefruit juice within 48 hours before admission to the clinic for each treatment period and during each dosing period.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0091270010390807">
<title>Study Design</title>
<p>The study was conducted as a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending-dose study with the treatment groups described below. Sixty healthy adult male subjects were enrolled into 1 of 6 cohorts of 10 subjects each. Within each cohort, subjects who satisfied all inclusion/exclusion criteria were randomly assigned to receive either A0001 (8 subjects) or placebo (2 subjects). There was a 2-week interval between dosing of each cohort during which a medical safety review and pharmacokinetic analysis were conducted. During each study period, blood and urine were collected at specified times for pharmacokinetic or other analyses. Vital sign assessments, electrocardiogram measurements, and clinical laboratory tests were also conducted periodically throughout the study. All subjects remained in the clinic from the day prior to administration of the study drug (day −1) until discharged by the investigator on day 5 (96 hours after administration of the study drug). Subjects returned 3 days after discharge for safety follow-up evaluations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0091270010390807">
<title>Adaptive Dose Selection and Administration</title>
<p>The initial design was to evaluate A0001 pharmacokinetics, over the range of 0.25 to 9 g, as a single daily dose under both fasted and fed conditions. The starting dose (0.25 g), determined based on preclinical toxicology studies, and the second dose (0.5 g) were set at the onset of the study and tested under fasted conditions. Subsequent doses were escalated based on safety data. Dose levels were selected based on interim pharmacokinetic analyses and visual assessment of dose proportionality based on the mean A0001 AUC<sub>(0-96)</sub>. Rapid analysis of the plasma samples for A0001 concentrations was conducted after the second dose to support the choice of subsequent dosing levels and food regimen selection and was performed following each cohort thereafter. Dose selection for each cohort after the second dosing level (0.5 g fasting) used the following decision tree: If exposure was dose proportional, then escalate the dose to 2-fold the preceding dose; if subproportional, escalate to 3-fold; or if supraproportional, escalate to no more than 1.5-fold the preceding dose. Interim pharmacokinetic analyses were conducted using data from cohorts 1 and 2 (fasted), cohort 2 and 3 (fed), cohorts 2 through 4 (fed), and cohorts 2 through 5 (fed). The dosing scheme is presented graphically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0091270010390807">Figure 2</xref>. In addition, subjects in cohort 4 participated in an A0001:α-VitE drug interaction substudy.</p>
<p>Subjects in cohort 1 and cohort 2, who received study drug under fasted conditions, were required to fast for at least 10 hours before dosing. Subjects were administered the drug immediately followed by 240 mL of water. No food was allowed until 4 hours after administration of study drug. Water was allowed as desired except for 1 hour before and after drug administration.</p>
<p>Subjects in cohorts 2 through 6, who received study drug under fed conditions, were required to fast for at least 10 hours before eating their breakfast. After the overnight fast, subjects were fed a standardized high-calorie (800-1000 calories), high-fat breakfast with approximately 150, 250, and 500 to 600 calories derived from protein, carbohydrate, and fat, respectively. Subjects were allowed to eat over a 25-minute period. The study drug was administered with 240 mL of water within 5 minutes of meal completion. No food was allowed for at least 4 hours postdose. Water was allowed as desired except for 1 hour before and after drug administration. For cohort 6 (thrice daily dosing), the 2.2-g dose was split into 3 equally divided doses of 0.735 g, administered 7 hours apart. Each dose was administered with a high-fat meal. Lunch and dinner contained the same caloric and fat content and followed the same administration procedures as that of breakfast on day 1.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0091270010390807">
<title>Effect of Supplemental Vitamin E on A0001</title>
<p>As stated above, subjects in cohort 4 participated in an A0001:α-VitE drug interaction substudy. These subjects had received either a single 2-g oral dose of A0001 (4 mL of a 0.5 g/mL solution in olive oil) or a single oral dose of placebo (4 mL of olive oil) with food (period 1). On completion of this evaluation period, subjects were given a bottle of vitamin E capsules containing 400 IU α-VitE acetate (equivalent to 300 mg α-VitE) before discharge. The subjects were instructed to take 1 α-VitE capsule daily with food for 7 days starting the day after discharge and continuing until they returned to the clinic for period 2, day 1. The last dose of α-VitE was administered at the clinic on the morning of study drug administration. Subjects were administered either a 2.0-g A0001 dose or placebo after consuming a high-fat breakfast (as assigned in period 1) coadministered with the seventh dose of α-VitE.</p>
<p>Although A0001 exposure is dose limited, particularly at doses above 1 g, the 2-g dose maximizes the potential for a presystemic interaction, although systemic exposure is nearly identical to the 1-g dose. The selected α-VitE acetate daily dose of 400 IU is higher than the recommended daily dose of 20 to 30 IU per day but reflects best the use in the intended patient population. Daily administration for 7 days ensured that near steady-state α-VitE plasma levels are reached (t<sub>1/2</sub> of α-VitE ranges between 24-72 hours<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0091270010390807">32</xref></sup>) before exposure to a single dose of A0001 or placebo.</p>

<sec id="section7-0091270010390807">
<title>Effect of A0001 on Endogenous α-VitE</title>
<p>To gain further insights into possible interactions with endogenous α-VitE, plasma samples were collected before (predose) and over 24 hours postadministration of A0001 doses of 2 g once daily, 6 g once daily, and 0.735 g thrice daily to measure endogenous α-VitE and calculate pharmacokinetic parameters for subjects who received A0001 and placebo.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0091270010390807">
<title>Pharmacokinetic Sampling</title>
<p>For cohorts 1 through 5, blood samples (3 mL) were collected predose and then at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 36, 48, 72, and 96 hours after the morning dose. For cohort 6, blood samples (3 mL) were collected predose and then at 1.5, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 13, 14, 16, 18, 20, 23, 26, 30, 36, 48, 72, 96, and 168 hours after the morning dose. Blood was collected into sodium heparin (2-8°C) tubes and protected from light. Samples were centrifuged under refrigeration (2-8°C) at 900 g for 15 minutes, and the resulting plasma was divided into 3 aliquots (2 for A0001 and 1 for α-VitE analysis as applicable) and stored in polypropylene cryotubes at −70°C, until analyzed. α-VitE data were obtained up to 24 hours only.</p>
<p>Urine was collected over the following intervals: −2 to 0, time 0 (predose) to 6, 6 to 12, 12 to 24, 24 to 48, and 48 to 72 hours after the morning dose administration. Urine samples were divided into aliquots and stored under identical conditions to those of the plasma samples.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0091270010390807">
<title>A0001 Bioanalysis</title>
<p>Plasma and urine samples were analyzed for A0001 concentrations following a validated LC/MS/MS method with an assay range of 0.02 to 20.0 µg/mL and a lower limit of quantification of 0.02 µg/mL. Deuterated (d9)-A0001 was used as an internal standard. A0001 and the internal standard were extracted from plasma and urine by protein precipitation with acetonitrile followed by centrifugation. The supernatant was analyzed by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometric detection. Selective detection of A0001 used the parent to product ion mass transition of m/z 429.4 to 165.4. Concentrations were calculated from an 8-point calibration curve, and acceptance criteria were based on quality control sample and incurred sample reproducibility. Accuracy and precision of the assay ranged between −5.4% to −1.3% and 2.0% to 5.6%, respectively.</p>

<sec id="section10-0091270010390807">
<title>Vitamin E Analysis</title>
<p>Plasma samples were analyzed for concentration of α-VitE following a well-established high-performance liquid chromatography assay with programmable fluorescent detection at 296 nm excitation/340 nm emission, applicable to serum and heparin-treated plasma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0091270010390807">33</xref></sup> The calibration range was over 0.1 to 50 µg/mL range with less than 5% coefficient of variation and a lower limit of detection of 0.02 µg/mL.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0091270010390807">
<title>Pharmacokinetic Analysis</title>
<p>Pharmacokinetic parameters for A0001 and α-VitE were derived from the plasma concentration versus time data using noncompartmental analysis with WinNonlin Professional software (version 5.2, Pharsight Corporation, Mountain View, California). Actual postdose sampling times were used to derive all pharmacokinetic parameters. All concentration values below the lower limit of quantitation were set to zero. Low but measurable endogenous α-tocopherylquinone plasma concentrations at predose were expected. For subjects whose measurable predose concentrations of α-tocopherylquinone were present, the day 1 predose α-tocopherylquinone concentration for each individual subject was subtracted from the corresponding postdose A0001 plasma concentration, as a function of time, to calculate the baseline-adjusted pharmacokinetic parameter calculations. Concentrations of A0001 below zero after the subtraction were set to zero. Pharmacokinetic analysis was performed on these baseline-adjusted A0001 concentrations only.</p>
<p>Calculated plasma pharmacokinetic parameters of A0001 and α-VitE included observed maximum concentration (C<sub>max</sub>), time to reach C<sub>max</sub> (T<sub>max</sub>), area under the drug concentration versus time curve from zero to the last sampling point with a quantifiable drug concentration (AUC<sub>(0-last)</sub>), area under the drug concentration versus time curve from 0 to infinity with extrapolation of the terminal portion of the curve (extrapolation from the last measured sampling point, AUC<sub>(0-inf)</sub>), area under the concentration versus time curve extrapolated from t<sub>last</sub> to t<sub>inf</sub> calculated as a percentage of the total AUC (AUC<sub>%extrap</sub>), terminal elimination rate constant (Lambda_z (k<sub>el</sub>)), terminal half-life (t<sub>½</sub>), apparent total clearance of drug after oral administration (CL/F),and apparent volume of distribution during the terminal phase (V<sub>d</sub>/F). AUC<sub>(0-inf)</sub>, Lambda_z, t <sub>1/2</sub>, CL/F, and Vd/F were only calculated when AUC<sub>(%extrap</sub>) ≤ 30%.</p>
<p>Urinary pharmacokinetic parameters for A0001 calculations were limited to amount of unchanged drug excreted in the urine within the time span from time 0 (predose) to the last sampling collection time (A<sub>e(0-t)</sub>), fraction of orally administered drug excreted unchanged in urine (F<sub>e</sub>[%]), and renal clearance (CL<sub>R</sub>).</p>

<p>Safety was evaluated by adverse-event monitoring, clinical laboratory testing (hematology, serum chemistry, coagulation, and urinalysis), vital sign measurements (temperature, sitting blood pressure, heart rate, and respiration rate), electrocardiograms, and physical examinations at various times during the study and at follow-up.</p>

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>All statistical analyses were performed using SAS (version 8.2). Baseline-adjusted plasma concentrations of A0001 and all A0001 pharmacokinetic parameters of the evaluable population were summarized using appropriate descriptive statistics, including n, mean, SD, minimum and maximum values, and percentage coefficient of variance. Geometric mean and geometric percentage coefficient of variance values were derived for A0001 C<sub>max</sub>, AUC<sub>(0-last)</sub>, and AUC<sub>(0-inf)</sub> parameters. Descriptive statistics for T<sub>max</sub> were summarized using median, minimum, and maximum values only, along with n. In addition, C<sub>max</sub>, AUC<sub>(0-last)</sub>, and AUC<sub>(0-inf)</sub> parameters for all cohorts were dose normalized by dividing by the respective dosing regimens and summarized using appropriate descriptive statistics. In the substudy for the assessment of a food effect on the pharmacokinetics of a 0.5-g A0001 dose, a linear mixed-effects model was used with the natural log-transformed AUC<sub>(0-last)</sub>, AUC<sub>(0-inf)</sub>, and C<sub>max</sub> of the A0001-treated subjects in cohort 2 (ie, with and without food). The model included treatment (with and without food) as a fixed effect and subject as a random effect. If the 90% confidence intervals (CIs) for the ratios (fed:fasted) of the geometric least-squares means for AUC<sub>(0-last)</sub>, AUC<sub>(0-inf)</sub>, and C<sub>max</sub> fell within 0.80 to 1.25, then an effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of A0001 was excluded. If the 90% CIs for these geometric mean ratios (GMRs) fell outside the above limits, then a food effect was assumed. A similar assessment of the effect of coadministration of α-VitE on the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of A0001 under fed conditions was conducted for drug-treated subjects in period 1 and period 2 (with and without α-VitE, respectively).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The endogenous compound α-Tocopherylquinone is found in human plasma at low concentrations. In this study, most subjects had quantifiable endogenous α-tocopherylquinone predose (baseline) concentrations that were generally well below 0.1 µg/mL with a mean ± SD value of 0.056 ± 0.041 µg/mL (n = 56), ranging between &lt;0.02 and 0.178 µg/mL for all drug-treated subjects in cohorts 1 through 6. These values are within the 0.007 to 0.438 µg/mL range of values reported in the literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0091270010390807">24</xref></sup> Considering the relatively larger magnitude of the postdose A0001 concentrations in these subjects (up to 1-2 orders of magnitude greater in fed state), these predose concentrations did not affect the interpretation of the baseline-adjusted study data and underline the need for exogenous A0001 administration to achieve clinically significant A0001 plasma concentrations.</p>

<title>A0001 Dose Proportionality and Food Effect</title>
<p>Single oral A0001 doses (0.25 and 0.5 g) were poorly absorbed under fasted conditions with maximum plasma concentrations ranging close to the background concentrations of endogenous α-tocopherylquinone (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0091270010390807">Table I</xref>).

<p>Because of the substantially increased exposure in the fed state, A0001 was administered with a high-fat meal in the subsequent dose-escalation studies. Mean plasma concentration-time profiles for A0001 at each of the dosing levels under fed conditions are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0091270010390807">Figure 4</xref>, and mean plasma pharmacokinetic parameters for A0001 are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0091270010390807">Table I</xref>. Following single undivided doses of 0.5 to 6.0 g administered with a high-fat breakfast, A0001 was slowly absorbed with a median T<sub>max</sub> of 4 to 6 hours that was independent of the dose. The mean C<sub>max</sub> concentrations were between 4.6 and 18.6 µg/mL, whereas AUC<sub>(0-last)</sub> ranged between 23 and 107 µg•h/mL over the 0.5- to 6-g dose range. Plasma concentrations returned to baseline concentrations within 24 hours. Mean apparent t<sub>1/2</sub> values ranged from 28 to 36 hours and were also independent of dose. The long apparent terminal t<sub>1/2</sub> values calculated in this study reflect the concentrations returning to the baseline endogenous levels and do not significantly contribute to A0001 exposure. Indeed, baseline-adjusted A0001 concentrations at 24 hours tended to account for less than 1% of C<sub>max</sub>, and AUC<sub>(0-24)</sub> accounted for most of the time-averaged exposure. Thus, the “effective” half-life of A0001 is likely much shorter than the estimated apparent t<sub>1/2</sub> of 26 to 36 hours.</p>

However, following the 2-g dose, A0001 exposure increased subproportionally with less than 10% increase in AUC despite a 2-fold increase in A0001 dose.</p>

<p>As per protocol, a 6-g A0001 dose was chosen for the next dosing level (3-fold greater than preceding dose). Again, a 6-fold increase in dose (relative to the 1-g dose) resulted in only a 1.5-fold increase in AUC (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0091270010390807">Table I</xref>). Thus, over the 0.5- to 6-g dose range, A0001 exhibited dose-limited absorption kinetics with an observed increase in C<sub>max</sub> and AUC of approximately 4-fold and 4.5-fold, respectively, over the 12-fold dose range (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0091270010390807">Table I</xref>).</p>
<p>Although the maximum tolerated dose had not been reached, it was decided to discontinue dose escalation beyond 6 g due to the lack of significant change in exposure with increasing dose. Instead, a revised dosing regimen was tested to assess whether dividing the daily dose would improve exposure and restore proportionality relative to the 1-g dose, the highest single daily dose demonstrating proportionality. Indeed, administration of A0001 as 3 equally divided doses of 0.735 g, administered 7 hours apart (2.2-g total daily dose), significantly increased A0001 bioavailability relative to a 2-g single-unit dose. The dose-normalized exposure for the 2.2-g divided dose was 1.4-fold higher than following the 2-g unit dose and comparable to the 0.5-g dose but still slightly lower than the 1-g A0001 dose (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0091270010390807">Table III</xref>). The highest dose-normalized exposure (both C<sub>max</sub> and AUC) and lowest CL/F were obtained following the 1-g A0001 dose, suggesting that nonlinearity in absorption occurs at A0001 unit doses greater than 1 g. A0001 was not detected in any of the urine samples analyzed; thus, urine pharmacokinetic parameters could not be determined in this study.</p>

<title>Effect of α-VitE Co-administration on A0001 Pharmacokinetics</title>
<p>The mean concentration-time profiles of A0001 following a single 2-g dose administered with food, either alone or coadministered with α-VitE acetate (400 IU) at steady state, were superimposable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0091270010390807">Figure 5</xref>).

The apparent shorter A0001 terminal half-life values with α-VitE are unlikely to be of clinical relevance as concentrations at 24 hours were less than 1% of C<sub>max</sub>. Summary statistics for the A0001 pharmacokinetic parameters GMRs and 90% CIs are provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0091270010390807">Table IV</xref>. The GMR and 90% CI for AUC<sub>(0-last)</sub> and C<sub>max</sub> in the presence/absence of α-VitE were 105.11 (84.01-131.53) and 95.91 (84.49-108.89), respectively. Despite the small number of subjects, the 90% CI for A0001 AUC<sub>(0-last)</sub> was fully contained within the 80% to 125% confidence limits. The upper 90% CI for C<sub>max</sub> was slightly outside the limit. Regardless, the observed difference in mean AUC<sub>(0-last)</sub> and C<sub>max</sub> was around 5%, and this small difference is not considered clinically relevant.</p>

<p>With respect to safety and tolerability, A0001 was well tolerated by the subjects in all dose groups when it was administered as both single oral doses and as thrice daily doses. There were no dose-limiting toxicities, and no serious treatment emergent adverse events were reported. No clinically relevant findings in clinical laboratory values, vital signs, electrocardiograms, or physical examinations were noted during the study.</p>

<sec id="section18-0091270010390807" sec-type="discussion|conclusions">
<title>Discussion and Conclusions</title>
<p>A single ascending-dose study was conducted in healthy male subjects to define A0001 pharmacokinetics and safety profile following a single daily dose. An innovative, adaptive design was employed to facilitate decision making and optimize the dose-escalation process.</p>
<p>Coadministration of A0001 with food was necessary for satisfactory drug exposure. Exposure was linear up to 1-g single daily dose then increased subproportionally at higher single daily doses. This lack of proportionality was mitigated by administering A0001 in thrice daily divided doses. Other pharmacokinetic parameters, including T<sub>max</sub> and t<sub>1/2</sub>, were independent of dose. No serious adverse events were noted. A0001 was well tolerated with satisfactory exposure upon dosing subjects in a fed state.</p>
<p>A0001 is a highly lipophilic compound with no appreciable aqueous solubility. As a result, its absorption is predicted to be solubility and dose limited. In addition, its absorption is expected to be affected by the presence of fat and foods. This hypothesis was confirmed in the present study in that absorption was highly dependent on the presence of food. It is notable that A0001 was virtually indistinguishable from endogenous α-tocopherylquinone plasma concentrations when given to subjects in the fasting state, but concentrations increased significantly when administered with food. Although a positive food effect was expected,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0091270010390807">36</xref></sup> a 60-fold magnitude was not foreseen. This substantial increase in exposure with food suggests that it is imperative that A0001 be given with food to achieve demonstrable plasma concentrations.</p>
<p>The effect of solubility limitations was also evident in the assessment of dose proportionality, as A0001 exposure (AUC and C<sub>max</sub>) approached a plateau at doses higher than 1 g. Interestingly, this nonlinearity in exposure could be overcome by administering A0001 in thrice daily divided doses, such that the exposure following 0.735 g three times a day (ie, 2.2-g total daily dose) was nearly twice that of a 1-g single daily dose, as would be expected in cases of dose proportionality. The effect of divided doses on the resulting increase in total exposure, combined with the improved exposure following coadministration with food, suggests that solubility limitations are likely the primary mitigating factor in A0001 dose nonproportionality. Although AUC and C<sub>max</sub> were not dose proportional across the range of doses studied, t<sub>1/2</sub> and T<sub>max</sub> values were independent of dose. The dose independence with respect to half-life suggests that clearance does not become saturated across the dosing range. The median T<sub>max</sub> (~6 hours) was longer than expected and may be a consequence of the limited solubility of A0001. The possibility of a preferential site of absorption cannot be excluded at this time considering that A0001 is highly lipophilic and may be similar in that regard to fats that are predominantly absorbed lower in the gastrointestinal tract and tend to induce alterations in gastrointestinal motility.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0091270010390807">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>The calculated half-life of A0001 was relatively long (~30 hours), but this finding should be counterbalanced by the observation that A0001 concentrations had returned to background levels by 24 hours (less than 1% C<sub>max</sub>), suggesting that A0001 exhibits a shorter effective half-life than suggested by the calculated terminal elimination profile. It should also be noted that bioavailability (F) is changing across dose levels (as evidenced by the dose nonproportionality); thus, an accurate estimate of CL/F and Vd/F across dose levels is not possible at this time.</p>
<p>The use of an adaptive design was particularly useful in the present work and allowed for rapid decisions on dose escalation and dosing regimen selection. Although it was predicted that solubility issues might arise and affect A0001 absorption, one could not have gauged a priori the dose at which the nonproportionality might occur. By evaluating A0001 pharmacokinetics in real-time fashion following each cohort dosing, adjustments in the next dosing level were made based on observed data in a systematic fashion. In the current study, plasma concentrations and interim pharmacokinetics were available within 96 hours of dosing level completion, facilitating rapid initiation of the next study phase. In addition to reducing acquisition of suboptimal data due to improper dose selection, cumulative efficiencies were realized in terms of study duration because drug plasma concentrations were obtained synchronously.</p>
<p>The potential for a drug interaction between A0001 and α-VitE was also explored in a small group of healthy subjects as the similarities between their lipophilicity (clog P &gt; 10) and stereochemistry of the phytyl chain could play an important role in their protein interactions. Coadministration of high doses of supplemental α-VitE had no apparent effect on A0001 plasma concentration. Likewise, A0001 treatment did not affect the endogenous α-VitE plasma disposition (in the absence of vitamin E supplementation). Collectively, these exploratory data show that a pharmacokinetic drug interaction is not likely on concomitant administration of A0001 and α-VitE in the clinic.</p>
<p>Adaptive designs are being advocated in the conduct of efficacy clinical trials in particular and in earlier development studies in general.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0091270010390807">37</xref></sup> Their merits are illustrated in this phase 1 study whereby multiple aspects of dosing, dosing regimen, and food effect were guided based on interim pharmacokinetic analyses. In addition, a perceived potential for a pharmacokinetic interaction with vitamin E was proactively explored in the same study to assess the magnitude (if any) of the effect.</p>
<p>In summary, the pharmacokinetics of A0001 were assessed in a single ascending-dose fashion using an adaptive trial design. Appreciable A0001 plasma concentrations, well above baseline α-tocopherylquinone, were noted when A0001 was given to subjects in a fed state, suggesting the necessity for coadministration with food. Over a 24-fold range of doses, the exposure to A0001 was linear up to a 1-g unit dose, with subproportional increases in exposure noted up to the highest dose studied (6 g). The dose nonproportionality could be overcome by dividing the total daily dose into 3 separate doses and coadministering with food. Overall, A0001 was well tolerated and exhibited a pharmacokinetic profile that would provide good drug exposure.</p>
