<abstract>
<p>In this article, two teachers from a public school in the United States describe their beliefs about the importance of using student voice as a foundation for increasing student efficacy, recognizing student individuality, and addressing curriculum standards. Sharing examples from their classrooms, the authors illustrate how student voice can help teachers meet the needs of individual learners and prepare students for their role in the United States system of participatory democracy from an early age.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Young children enter the US public school system as individuals, already capable of thinking and processing information in unique ways (Shonkoff and Phillips, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0892020612445693">2000</xref>). However, from Kindergarten (age 5) through Grade 12 (age 18), public schools often employ large-group learning structures, with the expectation that all students will meet common, minimum curricular requirements, or standards, prior to graduation (Costello et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0892020612445693">2000</xref>; Mitra, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0892020612445693">2004</xref>). Although this system is designed to ensure that citizens share basic knowledge and skills for participation in the US economy and democracy, standardization can have the unintended effect of stifling individuality and creativity, rather than fostering the abilities and perspective of the individual learner (Beghetto, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0892020612445693">2005</xref>; Eisner, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0892020612445693">1995</xref>). As teachers of young children (ages 5−11), we believe that students should not only acquire knowledge of core content and commonly accepted methods of thinking, but should also develop individual talents and thought processes through which to apply their knowledge. We believe that honoring and developing student voice throughout the school years is a critical task for teachers in preparing students for successful citizenship. In this article, we provide simple examples from our classrooms to illustrate how honoring student voice can contribute to the development of both individual learners and the community as a whole.</p>

<title>Context</title>
<p>As two teachers in a US public elementary school, we have witnessed increased movement toward curriculum standardization, whereby specialization based on student interest and talent is often delayed until secondary or post-secondary school. While we agree that students should acquire certain shared knowledge and basic skills at a minimum, our experience working with young children convinces us that teachers can help individuals excel beyond minimum standards in their areas of interest by honoring student voice. We believe that empowering children as individuals should begin as early as possible so that students embrace and develop their own voices long before graduating from secondary school. As teachers, we believe that we have the obligation to teach children before content and that we can address curricular standards only when we first honor children as individuals.</p>

<title>Lorraine McGarry, Grades 1 and 2 (ages 6−8)</title>
<p>In the primary grades, my students are concerned with achieving fairness among their peers and receiving approval from adults. These early grades are a tenuous and critical time for me to honor student voice, as children show willingness to express their views but often worry whether their thoughts and opinions will be valued by their teacher and classmates. As a teacher, I listen closely for moments where students are prepared to test their own voices and then actively encourage individual thinking and sharing. These moments frequently arise during daily lessons and routines, where issues of fairness and problem solving develop authentically. </p>
<p>An example occurred this winter when my first- and second-grade students created a fictional neighborhood to study communities, but disagreed on a name for the neighborhood. After having used majority-rules voting to narrow the number of choices from seventeen to two − “Maple Woods” and “Golden Eagle Valley” − they discovered that the class vote was split between the two choices, 11 to 10. The children’s discomfort with having failed to reach consensus was apparent to me, and I recognized the moment as a developmentally appropriate opportunity to invite student voice into community problem solving. I facilitated a “town hall meeting” in which students took turns voicing opinions, supporting arguments, and suggesting alternative solutions. After a long stalemate, one student proposed a new, creative solution: taking one word from each choice, he suggested the name “Maple Valley.” The class agreed to the new name quickly and unanimously, and students left the meeting feeling efficacious by having achieved a fair outcome. In my opinion, providing students with time and support to use their own voices resulted in a more meaningful learning experience than any teacher-imposed solution. I believe that when children are given frequent, developmentally appropriate opportunities to use their voices, they develop into empowered students who are engaged in their own learning.</p>

<title>Jennifer Cody, Grade 5 (ages 10−11)</title>
<p>In my classroom, as fifth-grade students transition from age ten to age eleven, they also demonstrate movement away from egocentrism toward a more selfless view of the world. With sixth grade and middle school looming on the horizon, my students often begin to recognize that they must show initiative and take responsibility for their own learning. In my opinion, this is the student voice “sweet spot” − the perfect time to empower students to make a difference in their own learning. </p>
<p>A typical outcome of empowering fifth-grade students to use their voices is the emergence of student leaders in our school. One example occurred during the 2009−10 school year, when a group of girls approached me with a lunch dilemma. The girls took issue with the pre-made salads in the cafeteria, which conflicted with their dietary needs for religious, cultural, and health reasons. They recognized themselves as individuals affected by a common problem who were coming together to make a difference. After asking for my guidance in addressing the problem, the girls polled students in our school, analyzed the data, developed a presentation, and contacted decision makers to share the results of their research. They succeeded in convincing the district food services manager to change the lunch menu to meet the dietary needs of students in our school. I believe this illustrates the ability of students to make a difference when they feel that their voices are both valuable and powerful (Serriere et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0892020612445693">2010</xref>).</p>

<title>Consequences for institutional leadership and management</title>
<p>These two examples are outgrowths of underlying personal and institutional characteristics that we consider vital to successfully honoring student voice. These include:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>A commitment to learning about children as individuals − their strengths, needs, learning styles, and personalities − to help them find success in our classrooms.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>A commitment to building community, creating learning environments where students can develop comfort with themselves, their peers, and their teachers in order to ask questions and express ideas.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>A commitment to treating children with respect, showing them that we value their thoughts and opinions.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>A commitment to helping students discover their individual talents and abilities, strengthening them in areas where they excel and supporting them in areas where they struggle.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>As we continue to examine teaching practices and institutional characteristics that impact student voice in our school, we find ourselves asking a number of questions, including:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>What role do curriculum standards play in our work to teach students as individuals?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>What role do individual students play in our work to address curriculum standards?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>In what ways might honoring student voice help us prepare young citizens who not only develop unique talents but also feel empowered to use them?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>How can we create learning opportunities at all grade levels that are developmentally appropriate for strengthening student voice?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>What is the relationship between teachers’ feelings about their own empowerment and their efficacy in preparing students for active citizenship?</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>We invite teachers and administrators to join our conversation on honoring children as individuals by considering these questions and continuing to support student voice in their midst.</p>
