<p>Natural fine fibers were extracted from Borassus fruits belonging to the <italic>Arecaceae</italic> family. To improve the surface, these fibers were treated with aq NaOH solution. Composites were prepared by the hand lay up process using both the untreated and alkali-treated Borassus fine fibers as reinforcement and unsaturated polyester resin as matrix. The effect of a coupling agent and alkali treatment of fibers on tensile, flexural and impact properties of the composites was studied. The mechanical properties and interfacial bonding were found to improve when surface modified fibers were employed in the composites. This is due to the improvement of chemical bonding between the treated fibres and polyester matrix as also supported by Fourier transform infrared results. Water absorption by the different composite types was also found to be negligible.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0021998312454032" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>During recent years, composite materials reinforced with natural fibers have received greater attention, since they are considered to be environment friendly materials. Extensive research confirms that natural fibers may replace glass fibers as reinforcement in semi-structural laminates, using both thermoplastic and thermosetting matrices.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998312454032">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998312454032">2</xref></sup> The advantages of using natural fibers as reinforcements in polymers are numerous. Such fibers normally exhibit low density, non-abrasiveness, high specific properties, ease of recyclability, renewability, good insulation (sound, electrical and thermal), biodegradability and economic viability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998312454032">1</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021998312454032">3</xref></sup> Different researchers have made green composites using natural fibers like jute, sisal, coir, pineapple leaf, hemp, hildegardia etc and studied their mechanical properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021998312454032">4</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021998312454032">9</xref></sup> Natural fiber-reinforced polymer composites find applications in the automotive industry as door panels, seat backs, headliners, package trays and dashboards.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021998312454032">10</xref></sup> They also find applications as building materials and consumer products. However, natural fiber-reinforced resin matrix composites have to overcome many challenges in order to be commonly used as engineering materials. A common drawback of these composites is the large variability and low mean values of their mechanical properties. These characteristics are due to the intrinsic variability of the properties of the fibers, the susceptibility of natural fibers against moisture and poor wetting of the fibers by the resin matrix. Considerable work has been done in order to improve the strength of fiber/matrix interface, but much work is yet to be carried out in order to guarantee performance reliability of natural fiber composites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021998312454032">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021998312454032">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021998312454032">11</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021998312454032">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the present work, we extracted fine fibers from Borassus fruits and reinforced them in styrenated unsaturated polyester (UPE) matrix. UPE resins form approximately 75% of the total resins used in the composites industries. They provide excellent mechanical properties, good chemical resistance and are low in cost. Further advantages of UPE resins over other thermosetting resins are that they are easy to handle and can easily flow in a liquid form around the fiber reinforcement. The properties of polyester composites with cellulosic fibers have been widely reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021998312454032">16</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021998312454032">19</xref></sup> In an earlier work, the authors reported the structural and physical properties of Borassus fruit fibers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021998312454032">20</xref></sup> Borassus fruit fiber from ripened fruits is an important agricultural waste in tropical regions. These fibers are biodegradable, environment friendly and renewable. The unique elastic nature of these fibers with high modulus has been the prime reason for the choice of these fibers being used as reinforcement in this work.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021998312454032">20</xref></sup> The Borassus fruit fibers with and without alkali treatment, and in presence and absence of a coupling agent (3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane) were used for making the composite laminates. Silane coupling agent (R′Si(OR)<sub>3</sub>) are widely used to enhance the adhesion between polymeric matrices and natural fibers. Further, fiber treatment with coupling agent (e.g. silane) is beneficial in reducing water uptake in natural fibers, which helps in improving fiber adhesion with matrix. We also studied the effect of fiber loading, alkali treatment and coupling agent on the mechanical properties of the composites and interfacial bonding.</p>

<sec id="sec5-0021998312454032"><title>Treatment with NaOH and coupling agent</title>
<p>A portion of Borassus fine fruit fibers was treated with 5% aq NaOH solution at room temperature, maintaining a liquor ratio of 20:1. Fibers were immersed in the alkali solution for 30 min to remove the hemicellulose and other greasy materials. Then the fibers were washed with distilled water repeatedly to neutralize them. Finally, the fibers were dried. Some of the dried Borassus fibers (both untreated and alkali treated) were dipped in silane coupling solution (diluted to 1% using acetone) for 6 h and dried in a hot air oven at 60°C for 1 h.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0021998312454032"><title>Preparation of composites</title>
<p>For making the composite laminates by the hand lay up process, a glass mould covered with Teflon® sheet and having dimensions of 160 × 160 × 3 mm was used. Laminates were made from UPE resin, catalyst and accelerator taken in the ratio of 100, 1.5 and 1.5 parts by weight, respectively. The mould was filled with a mixture of matrix and Borassus fibers (chopped length and diameter in the range of 2 to 3 cm and 0.10 to 0.15 mm, respectively) in random orientation with varying fiber content (4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24% by weight) and allowed to cure at room temperature for 24 h. The cured laminates were demoulded and post cured in a hot air oven at 70°C for 3 h.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-0021998312454032"><title>Mechanical testing</title>
<p>Tensile tests were carried out according to ASTM D3039-78 standard using a Universal testing machine (INSTRON 3369) with a load cell of 10 kN, maintaining a crosshead speed of 5 mm/min. Flexural tests were performed as per ASTM D5943-96 standard utilizing the three-point bending mode on the above machine with a crosshead speed of 2 mm/min and a support span length of 50 mm. Izod impact tests were performed on the composites according to ASTM D256-88 standard using an impact testing machine (M/s PSI Instruments, India). The test specimen was supported as a vertical cantilever beam and broken by a single swing of pendulum. Five specimens were used for each test and the average values recorded.</p>

<sec id="sec8-0021998312454032"><title>Scanning electron microscopy analysis</title>
<p>The morphology of the fractured samples was examined using the JEOL JSM 820 scanning electron microscope (SEM) operating with secondary electron imaging at 15 kV. The composite samples were cryogenically cooled and brittle fractured. The fractured surfaces were coated with gold by electrodeposition to impart electrical conduction before recording the micrographs.</p>

<sec id="sec9-0021998312454032"><title>FTIR analysis</title>
<p>The FTIR spectra of neat cured matrix and different types of Borassus composites were recorded on an attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) instrument (Perkin-Elmer 2000) in the range of 4000–500 cm<sup>−1</sup> with a resolution of 4 cm<sup>−1</sup> for 32 scans. This test was carried out with a view to analyze the bonding characteristics between the fiber and the matrix.</p>

<sec id="sec10-0021998312454032"><title>Water absorption</title>
<p>To study the water absorption of the composites, tests were carried out as per the ASTM D 543-87 standard. The pre-weighed specimens were dipped in the distilled water for 24 h, removed, dried by pressing them between filter paper and reweighed.

<p>In the present study, the Borassus fruit fibers were chemically modified in order to achieve better mechanical properties of the composites under study and compared the results with those of the untreated ones. The presence of hydroxyl groups of the cellulose in fibers is responsible for their inherent hydrophilic nature. As a result, it becomes difficult to compound them with a hydrophobic polymer matrix, resulting in poor mechanical properties as well as dimensional changes of the finished products due to moisture absorption. To overcome these problems, first the fibers were chemically treated with aq NaOH and then with silane coupling agent.</p>
<p>The tensile properties (modulus, strength and elongation) of neat UPE, untreated and alkali-treated Borassus fiber reinforced UPE composites in the absence and presence of coupling agent, as a function of fiber loading are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021998312454032">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998312454032">Figures 1</xref><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998312454032"/>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998312454032">3</xref>. The stress–strain behavior for untreated and different grades of chemically treated Borassus fiber polyester composites for different fiber weight fraction is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021998312454032">Figures 4</xref><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998312454032"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021998312454032"/>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998312454032">7</xref>. The plots show a linearly increasing stress–strain curve for all the composites followed before fracture. From <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021998312454032">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998312454032">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998312454032">2</xref>, it can be observed that the tensile (modulus and strength) increased with increase in fiber loading upto 16%. This behavior is attributed to the reinforcing effect of the fibers, leading to a uniform stress distribution from a continuous polymer matrix to a dispersed fiber phase. However, these properties were found to decrease for fiber loading beyond 16%. Generally, for higher fiber loading, non-uniform stress transfer results due to fiber agglomeration in the matrix. However, in all the cases, the tensile strength and modulus of the composites were found to be higher than that for the matrix. The increase in tensile strength and modulus of composites, respectively (presented in parentheses), over the matrix were as follows: untreated (14.8 and 22.7%), alkali-treated (17.7 and 54.4%), untreated and with coupling agent (19.6 and 59.0%) and alkali-treated and with coupling agent (23.2 and 86.3%). The tensile strength and modulus were found to be maximum when alkali-treated fibers were used in the presence of the coupling agent. The tensile strength of untreated fiber composites at higher fiber content (24% wt) was found to be lower than the neat polyester matrix. This can be attributed to poor interfacial bonding due to a smooth fiber surface (owing to the presence of hemicellulose and other surface impurities). Further, sufficient amount of matrix is not available across every section of the laminate for good bonding with the fibers, leading to poor interfacial bonding. Various other authors including Farahani et al. observed similar results in kenaf-polyester composites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021998312454032">21</xref></sup> However, the % elongation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998312454032">Figure 3</xref>) of the composites varied only marginally from the values of matrix. The shorter length and random orientation of the fibers can be responsible for this behavior.

<p>The ability of a material to withstand impact loads can be assessed by its impact strength. In order to test the performance of Borassus/UPE composites for sudden loading, their impact strength was determined using the Izod impact tester.

<p>Generally, a uniform trend is observed for mechanical properties of composites when the reinforcement is oriented along the load direction. But, in the present case, the fibers were randomly oriented and hence some irregularity in trends was observed. In the present work, the optimum limit of fiber loading was found to be 16% beyond which deterioration in properties was observed.</p>
<p>From the above studies, it is evident that the chemical modification of the fibers by alkali and coupling agent treatment improved the mechanical properties of the composites. When the Borassus fibers are treated with an alkali, the fiber surface becomes rough.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021998312454032">20</xref></sup> The roughening of the surface leads to an increase in the contact area and lowering of the contact angle of the resin on the fiber leading to an improvement in the interfacial bonding. When a coupling agent is used, additional chemical sites are created on the fiber surface,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021998312454032">22</xref></sup> which lead to better bonding between the fibers and the matrix. Roughening of fiber surface and creation of additional bonding sites by the coupling agent, lead to an improvement in the mechanical properties of the chemically modified fiber composites.</p>
<p>For fiber-reinforced composites, the interface property is very important, as improved interface adhesion is necessary to obtain superior mechanical properties of a composite. To assess this, the brittle fractured surface of the composites was investigated using an SEM. The fractured surface micrographs of the composites with untreated, alkali-treated, untreated with coupling agent and alkali-treated with coupling agent are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0021998312454032">Figures 11</xref><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0021998312454032"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0021998312454032"/>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-0021998312454032">14</xref>, respectively. In the case of composites with untreated fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0021998312454032">Figure 11</xref>), fiber pullout was observed, indicating a poor bonding between the fibers and the UPE matrix. This is mainly due to weak interfacial interaction between the fibers and the matrix due to the smooth surface of the fibers. To counter this problem, surface modification (alkali treatment and coupling treatment) of the fibers was carried out. The fiber surfaces significantly changed on alkali-treatment, leading to removal of hemicellulose and surface impurities (wax), and the effective surface area available for contact with matrix increased. The dissolution of hemicellulose and waxy materials increased the inter-fibrillar region and yielded a surface with rough texture.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021998312454032">20</xref></sup> From the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0021998312454032">Figure 12</xref>, it is evident that, though the bonding is slightly improved (as indicated by the narrowing of gap between the fiber and matrix), fiber pullout is still present. Thus, the alkali treatment moderately improved the bonding. On the contrary, with coupling agent treatment, the scanning electron micrographs manifested in improved adhesion. It is evident that although the fiber pullout is reduced, fiber surface appears to be coated with a polymer layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0021998312454032">Figures 13</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-0021998312454032">14</xref>), because the bonded coupling agent reacts with the polymer matrix. Likewise, no discontinuity between the two phases was observed and the fibers seem to be totally covered by the matrix. This observation gives direct evidence about the improved adhesion at the interface in the presence of reactive silane coupling agent. These arguments are also seconded by an increase in all the mechanical properties.

Broad and weak absorption bands are observed at 3600–3400 cm<sup>−1</sup> due to the stretching vibrations of hydroxyl (OH) groups.

<p>The spectra of untreated and treated fiber UPE composites are both shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-0021998312454032">Figure 15</xref> and are observed to be near similar to the spectra of UPE. The stretching vibration bands (3600–3440 cm<sup>−1</sup>) for OH group in the Borassus fiber/UPE composites were much broader than that of the UPE. This possibly suggests the occurrence of hydrogen bonding between fibers and UPE. For composites, the peak intensity of the C=O group at 1717 cm<sup>−1</sup> was relatively higher than that of UPE. This indicates that covalent bonding has taken place through an esterification reaction between the fiber OH groups and polyester COOH groups. However, in the chemically modified fiber composites, the peak for C=O groups at 1717 cm<sup>−1</sup> was more intense than the untreated fiber composites. It appears that due to the removal of wax and hemicellulose materials from the surface of the fibers, the number of available OH groups and reactive sites increased on the fiber surface for greater esterification with UPE. Other researchers have also reported similar observations for hemp-polyester composites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0021998312454032">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>The water absorption (%) of the composites with untreated and alkali-treated fibers in the absence and presence of coupling agent was found to be 1.73, 1.22, 1.18, and 1.03%, respectively. These observations clearly indicate that water absorption by the composites under study was negligible in all the cases. Further, the surface modification of the fibers had little effect on the water absorption except a marginal decrease. Based on this study, these composites can be considered for agricultural, automotive and marine applications and for making water storage tanks.</p>

<p>In this paper, the feasibility of utilizing a forestry residue for alternative use was studied. The morphology of composites was studied using the SEM technique. Alkali and coupling agent-based chemical modification of Borassus fibers was successfully accomplished to demonstrate the effect of modification on the mechanical properties of Borassus-polyester composites. The interfacial bonding between matrix and reinforcement was found to be improved by surface modification of fibers. FTIR spectra of Borassus composites revealed increased bonding between fibers and matrix. The 16% wt content fiber composites exhibited superior mechanical properties. The alkali and coupling agent-treated Borassus composites demonstrated an increment of 23.2 and 86.3%, 36.3 and 35.4% and 64.2% in tensile (modulus and strength), flexural (modulus and strength) and impact strength, respectively. These composites also possessed better water resistance. Borassus fibers showed promising results as reinforcements for production of biocomposites.</p>
