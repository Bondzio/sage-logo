<p>In <italic>Pricing Beauty</italic>, Ashley Mears has written the book that I wish I could have written when I was interested in beauty work and bodily capital as a graduate student in the 1990s. She has also written the book that I would have wanted to read during my own brief stint in the modeling business in the late 1980s. <italic>Pricing Beauty</italic> is an enjoyable read that is rich with theoretical connections to a variety of sociological subfields. It takes fashion, a subject that one might view as trivial, seriously as a site of cultural production and work.</p>
<p>Starting with work and occupations, Mears uses an insider’s position to analyze modeling as work. She draws on both classic and contemporary theories to highlight how modeling is a precarious, winner-take-all labor market. While many are aware of the few models making millions of dollars, for each of them there are hundreds making nearly nothing and hoping to achieve a big break. Her discussion of the stratification of the modeling business into editorial work, which is high prestige but pays little or nothing, and catalogue work that pays well but is low prestige, conjured up memories of models saying disdainfully, “She’s <italic>so</italic> catalog!” But my reminiscing about fashion’s snarky repartee aside, Mears skillfully reveals how the fashion business is invested in a prestige hierarchy that appears, on the surface, to make no economic sense. By understanding the importance of a presence in the prestigious editorial markets for attracting bread-and-butter catalogue and showroom work, one can understand how modeling agencies maintain economic viability. At the same time, by playing the prestige game, modeling agencies create an army of low-paid workers: young women (and, to a lesser extent, men) working tirelessly in hopes of securing a top position in the editorial market. Like other winner-take-all markets such as athletics or music, modeling elevates a very few who differ relatively little, or perhaps not all, from the aspiring masses.</p>
<p>By highlighting the fact that value in modeling is unconnected to any objective or measurable quality, Mears also contributes to the sociology of culture and to economic sociology. <italic>Pricing Beauty</italic> analyzes fashion as an art world, examining how particular models’ “looks” come to have value. In this industry, bookers and clients produce a model’s value by using their networks within the industry to generate a “buzz” about a particular “girl.” While models tend to look very similar in terms of body type, height, race, and even facial features, some models rise to the top of the modeling market. Mears argues that the selection of these successful editorial models is based on the cultural work that bookers and clients do (as well as luck and timing). She devotes one chapter to the creation of a look, in which both models’ and bookers’ body work and emotion work socially produce a model’s bodily capital. She devotes another chapter to the unique power of bookers and clients to define which looks are hot—they are the tastemakers who define the trends, but they also follow one another in valuing a particular model over very similar others. It is a collective convergence of tastes that produces a hot look, and thus a hot model.</p>
<p>In addition to its important contributions to analyses of culture and economic sociology, <italic>Pricing Beauty</italic> also offers an in-depth and theoretically-informed analysis of race, class, and gender dynamics in fashion. While bookers and clients have the power to define tastes, they tend to define them in homogeneous ways: the vast majority of models are white, mainstream female models are extremely thin, very young and tall, and male models also conform to specific heights and measurements. But bookers and clients accept no responsibility for the homogeneity of the modeling workforce—they adhere to a liberal, color-blind discourse about race, and point to each other as the source of homogeneity in modeling (clients blame bookers and bookers blame clients). Mears’ respondents disavowed racism, but also bemoaned the lack of “really good” models of color—namely those whose features were more white and who projected a “high-class image.” Similar internal dynamics in the industry explain the unresponsiveness of fashion to critiques of the lack of body diversity among models. The end result is that industry insiders reproduce trends that exclude or marginalize models of color and maintain rigid standards of thinness. Mears offers a nuanced understanding of how color-blind racism and classism combine with the social production processes of fashion to produce a homogeneous field of models.</p>
<p>Mears also offers a theoretically-informed analysis of gender. While many industry insiders believed that women’s higher wages in modeling was a feminist triumph, Mears highlights the underlying gender logic that produces this upside-down gender pay gap in modeling. She draws on theories of economic sociology, culture, and gender to highlight the ways that bookers and clients construct different values of male and female models—values that fit with cultural stereotypes about fashion as a feminine pursuit and women as valid sex objects. Male models reinforce these views, even while they use their bodies and their sexuality to earn money in the modeling business. Unexamined views of women as “the sex” and women’s bodies as valid objects of the gaze lead to a reversed pay gap in modeling—like in striptease or pornography. Rather than subverting the gender order, pay-setting practices for modeling strengthen assumptions that modeling is appropriate, glamorous, and high-prestige work for women and not for men.</p>
<p>Overall, <italic>Pricing Beauty</italic> offers a theoretically rich, complex, and nuanced account of the modeling industry that balances recognition of the social production of culture and economic values with understandings of stratification by race, class, and gender. <italic>Pricing Beauty</italic> accomplishes this while acknowledging modeling’s gendered appeal and young women’s cultural attraction to it. Mears has produced a rich ethnography of models, bookers, and clients in the fashion industry that will be valuable for many undergraduate and graduate courses. Its only drawback is that it might be a difficult read for 16-year-old aspiring models.</p>
