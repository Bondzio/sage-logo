<abstract>
<p>The process of conceptualization and creation of a film score heavily depends on the collaboration between the film director and composer. The harmony of the director’s and film composer’s ideas should provide an impetus for the synchronization of literature (the script and film narrative) and music (film score). This was mainly used as a guide in crafting the film score for the independent film <italic>Ang Panggagahasa kay Fe</italic> (<italic>The Rapture of Fe</italic>, 2009) directed by Alvin Yapan. This article explores how the music is deployed to resonate with the mythic and folkloric sensibility of the film narrative. We chose to use the tambuleleng, a native lute instrument/chordophone from Bukidnon, Southern Philippines, that is a modern adaptation of three traditional instruments. In its invention, its crafting, and in the sounds it produces, the tambuleleng is an artful blending of tradition and modernity. The tambuleleng’s composition, its symbolism and function in native life and rituals, aside from the sound it creates, all became material in conveying the folkloric narrative, and articulating the issues presented in the film. Some concerns on Philippine film musical scoring are also tackled, mainly focusing on the constraints, as well as the liberties involved when operating within a limited budget for an independent movie production.</p>

<p>It is crucial that the film director and musical scorer collaborate effectively in order to assure a synergy of the film’s script and the film music. For the independent film <italic>Ang Panggagahasa kay Fe</italic> (international title: <italic>The Rapture of Fe</italic>), a full length independent film and an entry to the Cinemalaya Independent Film Festival in 2009, the instrument used in the film is called the tambuleleng, a native instrument which is a combination of drum, lute and violin. The tambuleleng’s composition, its symbolism and function in native life and rituals, aside from the sound it creates, all became material in conveying the folkloric narrative of the film.</p>
<p>Film director Alvin Yapan suggested that for the film music we should use a musical instrument that will articulate the type of narrative dominant in the film, that of folktales and Philippine mythology. He recommended that I use a native instrument, something that has a distinct local sound different from the temperament of such Western musical instruments as the Spanish guitar and piano. Yapan also stated that, though native, he doesn’t want the sound to be like that of conventional native and ethnic sounds, for example, the sounds created by a gong (a brass percussion instrument), or a high-pitched lute such as the hegalong of the T’boli group in Mindanao, not even the crude nature sounds like that of bamboo percussion. While we were contemplating the instrument to be used in the film, I showed him the tambuleleng, a two-stringed lute, drum and violin all in one instrument, from Bukidnon, Southern Philippines.</p>
<p>I let the director listen to the sound created by the tambuleleng and he liked it; he described it as being a very folk sound and appropriate for the mythical and mystical sensibility of the film. In this context, a Spanish guitar would not suffice for our purposes because of its associations with unmodified Spanish colonization. The tambuleleng appeals because of its associations with indigenous traditions that predate colonization. The distinctive difference of the tambuleleng to that of other instruments such as the guitar that appealed to our interests was musicological: its drone string which creates a low, reverberating tone that we used to serve as a base sound for the film’s ambience and as a recurring motif of the film’s narrative and mythic structure.</p>
<sec id="section1-0725513612450499">
<title>Choosing the instrument for the film: the tambuleleng</title>
<p>The tambuleleng, a chordophone from Bukidnon, Southern Philippines, is a modern musical instrument created in 2005 by Waway Saway, a Talaandig artist from Bukidnon.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0725513612450499">1</xref>
</sup> It is an addition to the ethnic instruments played by the Bukidnon natives. It was based on three Bukidnon ethnic instruments: dayuday/dioray/dayoray, kutyapi/katyapi/kuglong, and the tambol. The dayuday is a fiddle or a bowed lute-type instrument with one string and consists of a resonating body which is usually made of coconut shell covered with banana bark, and a long, slender, bamboo neck to which a peg is attached for tightening the hemp string (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0725513612450499">Tiongson 1994</xref>: 151). The kutyapi/kuglong is a two-stringed boat lute instrument that consists of a resonating chamber, and with a carved headpiece and tailpiece. A detailed description of the kutyapi can be found in E. Arsenio Manuel’s <italic>Toward an Inventory of Philippine Musical Instruments</italic>:<disp-quote>
<p>The most elaborate of Bukidnon instruments are the ‘long’ guitars, or boat lutes. These are usually carved to represent a mythical two-headed animal, a crocodile or a bird. Such instruments are made of thin strips of wood. The tightening rods are of wood, and the frets are of beeswax with small guides set in each. The lute has two strings, one of which is free, the other rests on the frets. When the strings are properly tuned, the player plucks them with fingers of the right hand while those of the left put pressure on the strings high on the neck. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0725513612450499">Manuel 1978</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The tambol/tambor, or drum, on the other hand, is made from a hollowed out tree with animal skin drumhead, and is used to create beats and rhythms.</p>
<p>These three separate instruments inspired the artist Waway Saway to create the tambuleleng, which can be played by plucking and/or strumming the strings with the fingers or with an aid of a plectrum, like kutyapi-playing, or bowing the strings, like dayuday-playing, while tapping the resonating body which serves as the tambol or drum for rhythm-making. The shape of the resonating chamber is rounded, which was taken from the dayuday, and there are frets, like the kutyapi, that guide the performer’s fingers (the tambuleleng has seven frets). The resonating chamber is made from wood.</p>
<p>To play the instrument, the player moves his/her fingers up and down the neck, shortening the strings and producing various pitches. The lute is held upright, the neck slightly slanted to the right of the player. The bottom of the lute sits on the player’s lap, sometimes wedged between the thighs. The left string acts as a drone and is plucked by the thumb. The melody string is played by the other fingers. Both strings are tuned in unison, the drone string usually an octave lower than the melody string.</p>
<p>The difference of the dayuday and kutyapi to the tambuleleng lies, however, in the materials used in crafting the instruments. The dayuday and kutyapi strings are made out of tree roots. Waway Saway employed more recent and modern materials in making the tambuleleng; he used a classical string (string number 6 for classical guitar) for the drone string, and a folk guitar string (string number 2 for folk guitar) for the melody string. The drone string vibrates freely, while the melody string can be stopped at any of the seven frets glued to the body of the instrument. The dayuday bow is usually made of horsehair, but the tambuleleng bow is made of nylon strings.<sup>

</sup>
</p>
<p>Using the tambuleleng for the film soundtrack served as a medium to impart the dominant mythic and folkloric sensibility used in the film narrative. The principle behind the use of the instrument comes from the tradition of employing native instruments as accompaniments in chants, in the narration of myths and folktales that are usually part of the daily existence and rituals of Philippine native groups, such as those living in Bukidnon. Although the tambuleleng was only created this century, the traditional and native sounds created by the kutyapi and dayuday are still represented by the sound created through the tambuleleng, as well as the technique and process of playing it. And this matches the film narrative; the folkloric element is fused with a contemporary perspective on current social issues such as the exploitation of women in a globalized context. The combination of the traditional and contemporary are embodied by the tambuleleng – the way it is crafted, and the music it produces, which is a blending of traditional and modern sounds.</p>
<p>There are around ten tracks created for the film; seven of these are designed using the tambuleleng. The concept of leitmotif, a term referring to a recurring theme, was used. This was employed in creating the music for the male characters, the men in Fe’s life – the <italic>kapre</italic>, Arturo (her young suitor), and Dante (her husband), and used also for the soothsayer, the film’s storyteller. A recurring melody is also present in the ‘rapture theme’, a scene that explains Fe’s decision to choose the kapre. The idea of using a leitmotif is to create a coherence to the whole soundtrack, binding the various scenes and sounds together and enabling the music to ‘voice’ the film narrative, even without the use of words.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0725513612450499">
<title>Melodies of courtship: The theme of the kapre (tree ogre)</title>
<p>In the film the kapre is seen as the persistent suitor of Fe, although he only becomes visible at the end of the film. In the earlier scenes, the representation of the kapre was only through some symbols used, such as the basket of black fruits, his gifts for courting Fe. Known in Philippine folklore as a supernatural creature, the kapre is a tree-dwelling creature, around 7 to 9 feet tall, and described as smoking a large tobacco pipe. He can establish contact with people to offer friendship, or if he is attracted to a woman (as in the film), he will consistently woo his object of affection and will lure her to live with him in his abode.</p>
<p>In order to emphasize the kapre’s character as Fe’s suitor, the tambuleleng is used for the track theme. The principle behind the use of lute instruments for courtship is employed in the film, particularly in creating the theme of the kapre. Kutyapi music often has subtle metaphorical meanings concerning love. It is not generally played during festive occasions, because its music is easily drowned out by the noise and general merrymaking; it is more appropriate for courting and other more intimate occasions. The kutyapi of Bukidnon expresses different sentiments: a man seeking a tryst with his loved one, a woman’s response to a man’s offer of love, a man bidding farewell on the eve of his departure for a faraway place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0725513612450499">Tiongson 1994</xref>: 159–60).</p>
<p>The film director specified that the music for the kapre should not evoke horror, because the kapre in the film is not described as a monstrous creature. The kapre is Fe’s suitor, therefore the music should generate a certain texture that is tender and affectionate, but not overly romantic and emotional. However, although the sound should not enunciate horror, there should still be an air of slight eeriness and mystery since the character depicted by the music is a supernatural being.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0725513612450499">
<title>A speaking instrument: The theme of the <italic>albularyo</italic> (soothsayer)</title>
<p>It was the director’s vision, and mine as well, to use a sound that represents the act of narrating myth and folklore in a contemporary context, using a contemporary instrument which has native roots. For example, the character of the albularyo (soothsayer) in the film is one that narrates and explains the violent incident related to the mysterious tree which the mythical creature, the kapre, inhabits. The tambuleleng’s music aids in this type of storytelling; since it is also a type of lute instrument, a speaking instrument, it accompanies the story of the soothsayer with calmness, attention to detail, subtlety and restraint that reinforce the mystery of the narrative. The tambuleleng strings are plucked (not strummed) to complement the eloquent tone needed in storytelling.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0725513612450499">
<title>A speaking instrument: Articulating women’s issues</title>
<p>The Women’s Crisis Center (WCC), a non-profit organization that deals with women’s issues, is one of the film’s endorsers and sponsors, and according to them, the film is an apt representation and commentary on the current situation of women who experience various forms of abuse and exploitation. Fe’s silences, fears, the desire to be hopeful and to free herself, all manifested by her submission and quietude, were attempted to be given representation by the music – subtle, suppressed tunes that articulate the delicate situation of the character, who is a victim of different levels and forms of rape. In line with the tradition of using the kutyapi in courtship and intimate occasions, the music used for the ‘rapture theme’ in the film can be treated as Fe’s response to the kapre’s offer of love.</p>
<p>To sum up, the tambuleleng, though not a popular instrument at present in the creation of film scores, figures as an important medium that captures and tells the narratives of our society, in a contemporary milieu, through the use of film as a medium of storytelling. It also speaks for the film’s characters and carries with it the precision and yet ambiguities in storytelling, the restrained quivers of an abused woman, an otherworldly proposal of love, the silences and the unsaid, and the alienating mysteries that envelope our society in the present, globalized context.</p>

<title>Film music composition and production: Some issues</title>
<p>It was imperative to create an all-original soundtrack for the film <italic>Ang Panggagahasa kay Fe</italic>, ideally, to cooperate with and support the director’s vision in contributing something fresh to the Philippine film industry, and also to reinforce a commentary made by Filipino film critic Pio de Castro on film music during the 1970s:<disp-quote>
<p>Since the start of the Philippine movie industry, music has always been an important part of moviemaking and has contributed to the enhancement of the screen story. But when the independent producers came into power, the use of original music was an expense that they thought they could do without. This started the abominable practice of using canned music, and the embarrassing practice of using movie themes from European and American films to score Pilipino pictures. With the entrance of new directors like Lino Brocka and Mike de Leon into the full-length movies, a new kind of sound was needed to express the fresh style of these directors. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0725513612450499">De Castro 1986</xref>: 197–8)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>At present, de Castro’s commentary on the use of canned music from the West still holds true, but this is sometimes done not by the independent but by the major production studios in the Philippines. Perhaps using these types of movie themes is dictated by the commercial film industry, some examples of which are the Filipino movies <italic>Till there was you</italic> (Joyce Bernal, Star Cinema, 2003) and <italic>Let the Love Begin</italic> (Mac Alejandre, GMA Films, 2005). ‘Till there was you’, a song written by Meredith Willson in 1957 for the musical play <italic>The Music Man</italic>, was also the title of a 1997 Hollywood romantic comedy film of the same title, produced by Lakeshore Entertainment and directed by Scott Winant. The latter film, <italic>Let the Love Begin</italic>, is a famous love song written by Gloria Sklerov and Lenny Macaluso and was also used as a theme for the American movie <italic>Thrashin</italic> (David Winters, Winters Hollywood Entertainment Holdings, 1986).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0725513612450499">3</xref>
</sup> Both films are produced by major production companies in the Philippines (Star Cinema and GMA films), and both also employed local, popular artists who sang the theme music for the films.</p>
<p>Filipino film critic Dr Bienvenido Lumbera explained that during the 1960s there was a film genre, the jukebox musical, that catered mainly to the young audience and, according to him, ‘a flimsy narrative was employed for the sole purpose of stringing together musical numbers performed by teenage pop singers glamorized by television and the recording industry’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0725513612450499">Lumbera 1986</xref>: 43). The practice of using popular songs in films became a means of pushing the popularity of matinee idols by giving them a venue to showcase their singing and dancing talents. In the case of the Filipino films <italic>Till there was you</italic> and <italic>Let the Love Begin</italic>, the popular songs were used not only to boost the careers of the pop artists who did a rendition of the movie themes, but also as a marketing strategy in order for audiences to easily recall and perhaps relate to these mainstream films.</p>
<p>My experience working with the director and production/artistic crew also taught me how much the film score primarily figures in after the shooting and editing of the film. Noel Burch explained in his essay entitled ‘On the Structural Use of Sound’ a perspective on sound and image used by filmmaker Robert Bresson:<disp-quote>
<p>Robert Bresson, commenting on his own film practice, has made some rather revealing and pertinent remarks on the dichotomy of sound and image. According to this filmmaker, sound, because of its greater realism, is infinitely more evocative than an image, which is only essentially a stylization of visual reality. ‘A sound always evokes an image, an image never evokes a sound.’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0725513612450499">1985</xref>: 200)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The latter statement, in my personal experience as film scorer, does not necessarily hold true. It is precisely the moving images (aside from the script which the director encourages the scorer to read in order to understand the mood and temperament of the narrative) that become the bases of the sound and music created for the film. This, I think, reiterates film scoring, in this context, as most critical during a film’s post-production stage. I can only create the music for the film after having watched a roughly edited version of it, and after some consultation and brainstorming with the director. In the studio, the music is simultaneously played and recorded with the scene, as it is flashed on a screen.</p>
<p>Working closely with the film director provided much guidance in conceptualizing the type of music to be used in the film. The challenge also was to operate within a limited budget, as this was an independent production. The director and I decided to use mainly one musical instrument (the tambuleleng) to accompany and accentuate the scenes in the film. It took only half a day to do the recording for the film’s tracks, since the music and the instrumentation were simple, meaning there were no elaborate orchestra sounds and music in the film, and no additional instrumentalists were hired. There were just the scorer/instrumentalist, the director, and the sound technician/engineer, and this set-up provided a very controlled environment and speeded up the process of film music production – which are both needed, given the financial constraints – and yet, on the other hand, offered a kind of artistic freedom.</p>
