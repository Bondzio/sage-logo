<p>The 12th international conference on electrorheological (ER) fluids and magnetorheological (MR) suspensions (ERMR 2010) took place in Philadelphia, USA, on 16–20 August 2010. The purpose of this conference was to provide a venue for scientists and engineers to present their findings, identify the thrust areas, and interact in a variety of subjects in the ER and MR materials area. ERMR 2010 comprised a wide range of research topics, including chemical compositions, physical mechanisms, material processing and characterization, device development, theoretical modeling, system integration, and applications. Invited and contributed papers described the cutting edge of research in the area of ER and MR fluids. Highly productive and scientifically stimulating discussions followed the presentations, and the state-of-art technology was disseminated.</p>
<p>ERMR 2010 included invited speakers, technical presentations, poster presentations, and a student paper competition. A unique feature of the ERMR 2010 is that the comprehensive coverage of research—issues ranging from physics to chemistry to engineering applications of ER and MR materials—is held in a single-session format where all attendees at the conference can attend each and every presentation, whether it be physics or applications. This is done to ensure and enhance interaction between scientists and engineers. The sessions in ERMR 2010 were organized based on two symposia: (a) <italic>Materials</italic> and (b) <italic>Applications</italic>. Topics covered in the <italic>Materials Symposium</italic> included mechanisms, preparation, and characterization of ER and MR materials. Topics covered in the <italic>Applications Symposium</italic> included ER and MR devices, control systems, system integration, and other applications, such as application for energy production and conservation. This structure was implemented in order to enable interaction between attending scientists and engineers in both the Materials Symposium and the Applications Symposium and to enhance the free flow of ideas and potential collaborative research opportunities. One of the highlights of the conference was the 15 plenary lectures by distinguished scientists and engineers in the fields of ER and MR fluids and devices.</p>
<p>This is the second of the two special issues dedicated to papers presented at the ERMR 2010. The first special issue appeared in vol. 22, no. 5. The review process was rigorous, and experts in the field accepted the papers for this second of two special issue. A group of 12 papers from the Materials Symposium also appeared in the <italic>International Journal of Modern Physics B</italic> (vol. 25, no. 7).</p>
<p>The editors would like to thank the many reviewers and especially the International Organizing Committee for their generous commitments in time and energy to the conference organization and execution and to reviews for this special issue.</p>
<p>ERMR 2010 was cosponsored by Temple University, Lord Corporation, BASF Chemical Company, Anton Paar GmbH, and Stream Chemical Inc. Their support in partially sponsoring this event is gratefully acknowledged and appreciated. We also wish to acknowledge the great effort put forth by the local organizing committee and, particularly, Dr Hong Tang, Dr Xiaojun Xu, Mr Enpeng Du, and Mrs Karen Woods-Wilson.</p>
