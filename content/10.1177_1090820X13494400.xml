<p>Ms Robertson and her colleagues are to be congratulated for their effort to contribute to evidence-based medicine. To avoid wasted effort on a broad scale, it is essential to concentrate on reforms that are proven effective, and scientific research—conducted in studies like the one their group has undertaken—is essential to establishing the nature of those reforms. Robertson et al were also “on the mark” when they mentioned the success of “Lean”-based process improvements. In our own process improvement work, we have found that implementing crew resource management (CRM; human factors training) and “Lean” process improvement simultaneously has a powerful impact on sustainable performance improvement in surgical areas. We had an epiphany when we realized that the teamwork culture of a given organization—or, specifically, the lack thereof—could “eat the Lean process improvements for lunch.” We began to ask, “What good does a new, standardized process do if the staff don’t (or won’t) use it as part of their daily work flow?” By simultaneously implementing CRM training and creating new standardized work models, we were able to create a culture of accountability, thus ensuring cross-check and mutual support by the staff on the new Lean process. The result? Better teams and sustainable process improvement. The combination of these 2 improvement disciplines is the wave of the future for reforms that are truly effective.</p>
