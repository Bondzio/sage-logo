<abstract>
<p>Many African American youth may develop high levels of allostatic load, a measure of physiological wear and tear on the body, by developing psychosocial competence under conditions of high risk related to socioeconomic status (SES). The current study was designed to test this hypothesis, which is based on John Henryism theory. In a representative sample of 489 African American youth living in the rural South, cumulative SES-related risks and teacher-reported competence were assessed at ages 11 to 13; depressive symptoms, externalizing behavior, and allostatic load were assessed at age 19. The data revealed that rural African American preadolescents who evinced high psychosocial competence under conditions of high cumulative SES-related risk displayed low levels of adjustment problems along with high allostatic load at age 19. These results suggest that, for many rural African Americans, resilience may indeed be only “skin deep.”</p>

<body>
<p>In the Black Belt that stretches across rural South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana, poverty rates are nearly 20% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0956797612471954">Proctor &amp; Dalaker, 2003</xref>). The socioeconomic risk factors that characterize this region have considerable consequences for the development of rural African American children, adolescents, and young adults. These risk factors include chronic, endemic poverty and limitations in occupational and educational opportunities, frequent housing adjustments in response to economic pressures, changes in employment status, interpersonal and institutional racism, difficulty in accessing pediatric and adolescent medical care, and marginalization by health-care professionals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0956797612471954">Dressler, Oths, &amp; Gravlee, 2005</xref>). Nevertheless, a remarkable number of African American children and adolescents in the rural South evince high levels of planful self-regulation, academic achievement, and psychological adjustment despite a lifetime of exposure to such challenges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0956797612471954">Brody, Kogan, &amp; Grange, 2012</xref>). These children have been called <italic>resilient</italic> because their competence develops in the face of contextual adversity, enabling them to “beat the odds” with which their environments present them.</p>
<p>The resilience literature is characterized by a widespread assumption that if children and youth who face major adversities are doing well as indexed by external behaviors—for example, if they excel academically and evince high levels of self-esteem—they have successfully negotiated those adversities. An intriguing hypothesis, however, is that these types of external successes take an internal, physiological toll, particularly on rural African Americans. Thus, there may be a cost in maintaining high levels of self-regulation and psychosocial competence in the presence of the myriad risks associated with low socioeconomic status (SES). Low-SES youth whose external behaviors appear to reflect resilience may be incurring outwardly undetectable wear and tear on their bodies that renders them vulnerable to negative physiological health outcomes over the long term. For rural African American youth, conceptions of resilience may have to go beyond overt behavioral indicators to include manifestations of physiological well-being. The purpose of the study reported here, then, was to test the hypothesis that African American preadolescents whose teachers rate them as self-controlled, academically competent, and socially competent and who live with high levels of SES-related risk will, at age 19, (a) report low levels of depressive symptoms and externalizing behaviors, but (b) manifest high levels of biological indicators of physiological stress. In the following paragraphs, we use constructs from allostasis theory and John Henryism (JH) theory to explain this hypothesis.</p>
<p>The myriad stressors that African American youth of low SES encounter elicit changes in multiple bodily systems. As the concept of allostasis emphasizes, the body achieves stability during stress through changes in multiple, interconnected systems. When these systems are repeatedly perturbed by stress, a biological toll, with potential implications for long-term health status, may be exacted. Some researchers refer to this presumptive toll as allostatic load (AL). Often, AL is operationalized as a composite reflecting various mediators and outcomes of the stress response, including the sympathetic adrenomedullary system, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, lipid metabolism, fat deposition, indices of inflammation, and immune functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0956797612471954">McEwen, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0956797612471954">Seeman, McEwen, Rowe, &amp; Singer, 2001</xref>). Only recently has a connection between exposure to SES-related stress and the development of AL been established among African American youth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0956797612471954">Brody, Yu, et al., 2013</xref>), despite the pivotal role that AL is conjectured to play in the development of chronic diseases and health disparities (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0956797612471954">Shonkoff, Boyce, &amp; McEwen, 2009</xref>). We hypothesized that growing up with SES-related risk during preadolescence would forecast higher AL levels at age 19 years among participants who exhibited higher competence.</p>
<p>This hypothesis was also informed by JH theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0956797612471954">James, 1994</xref>). JH is a high-effort coping style characterized by a determination to succeed by working hard even in the face of overwhelming stressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0956797612471954">James, 1994</xref>). The JH construct takes its name from the legend of John Henry, the “steel-driving man.” According to the story (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0956797612471954">Williams, 1983</xref>), John Henry was an African American railroad worker in the late 1800s who participated in a steel-driving contest in which he defeated a steam-powered drill. John Henry was forced to harness his great strength to overpower the mechanical drill but afterward died of exhaustion. For James, the fabled actions of John Henry illuminated associations among high-effort coping, chronic nervous system arousal, and health problems such as hypertension. The JH construct comprises three main characteristics: efficacious mental and physical vigor, a strong commitment to hard work, and a single-minded determination to succeed. Although no studies involving adolescents have been conducted, low-SES adults who have high levels of JH show higher blood pressure, greater total peripheral resistance, and increased risk of hypertension compared with low-SES adults who have low levels of JH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0956797612471954">James, Keenan, Strogatz, Browning, &amp; Garrett, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0956797612471954">James, Strogatz, Wing, &amp; Ramsey, 1987</xref>). Thus, JH theory can be used to predict that African American youth who show high levels of effort and determination in the form of planful self-control, academic competence, and social competence while growing up with high levels of SES-related risk will manifest high levels of AL.</p>
<p>With respect to mental-health outcomes, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0956797612471954">James (1994)</xref> speculated that the mental-vigor component of JH protects against depression. Stress-coping research also suggests that persons who deal with challenges through problem-focused coping and who believe they will succeed through persistent effort are less likely to become depressed and more likely to refrain from antisocial behaviors and substance use, compared with their peers who resort to avoidant or emotion-focused coping styles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0956797612471954">Bandura, 2002</xref>). Applying these ideas to the current study, we hypothesized that African American preadolescents who have high levels of the hard-work, problem-focused coping, and success elements of JH, such as planful self-regulation and academic competence, and who grow up with high SES-related risk would at age 19 exhibit good mental health, as evinced by low levels of depression and behavioral problems.</p>
<p>We investigated the hypothesized SES-Related Risk × Competence interactions in a representative sample of 489 rural African American youth. Data on SES-related risk and teachers’ ratings of planful self-regulation, academic competence, and social competence were gathered during preadolescence, when the youth were 11 to 13 years of age. Depressive symptoms, externalizing behaviors, and AL were assessed at the beginning of young adulthood, at age 19.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>The sample for this study was taken from a larger sample of African American target youth and their primary caregivers, who participated in annual data collections; the mean age of the target youth was 11.2 years at the first assessment and 19.2 years at the last assessment. The families resided in nine rural counties in Georgia, in small towns and communities where poverty rates are among the highest in the nation and unemployment rates are above the national average (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0956797612471954">Proctor &amp; Dalaker, 2003</xref>). Of the youth in the sample, 53% were female and 47% were male. Although the primary caregivers in the sample worked an average of 39.4 hr per week at the first assessment, 46.3% lived below federal poverty standards; at the last assessment, 49.1% did. At the age-11 data collection, 78% of the caregivers had completed high school or earned a general equivalency diploma. The median family income per month was $1,655 at the age-11 data collection and $1,169 at the age-19 data collection. The decrease in family income and increase in the percentage of families living in poverty over time were due to the economic recession that was occurring in 2010, when the last wave of data was collected. Overall, the families can be characterized as working poor.</p>
<p>At the first assessment, 667 families were selected randomly from lists of fifth-grade students that schools provided (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0956797612471954">Brody et al., 2004</xref>, for a full description). From a sample of 561 at the age-18 data collection (a retention rate of 84%), 500 youth were selected randomly to participate in assessments of AL and other variables at age 19. Of this subsample, 489 agreed to participate; they constituted the sample in the present study. Analyses indicated that the sample providing data at age 19 was comparable to the larger sample who provided data at ages 11 through 13 on indicators of SES-related risk and self-control/competence.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0956797612471954">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>All data were collected in participants’ homes using a standardized protocol. One home visit that lasted approximately 2 hr took place at each wave of data collection. Two African American field researchers worked separately with the primary caregiver and target youth in each family. Interviews were conducted privately, with no other family members present or able to overhear the conversation. Written informed consent was obtained at each wave. Primary caregivers consented to their own and minor youths’ participation in the study, and minor youth assented to their own participation. Upon reaching 18 years of age, youth consented to their own participation.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section5-0956797612471954">
<title>Preadolescent SES-related risk and self-control/competence</title>
<p>Preadolescent data were collected at three waves, when the target youth were 11, 12, and 13 years of age. Numerous studies of both physical morbidity and psychological dysfunction support the basic tenet of SES-related risk. Six standard risk indicators were assessed, with each risk factor scored dichotomously (0 if absent, 1 if present; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0956797612471954">Evans, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0956797612471954">Kim &amp; Brody, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0956797612471954">Rutter, 1993</xref>). The indicators were current family poverty according to U.S. government criteria, primary caregiver’s noncompletion of high school or an equivalent, current unemployment of the primary caregiver, single-parent family structure, current family receipt of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, and income rated by the primary caregiver as currently inadequate to meet all needs. SES-related risk was defined as the average of the summed risk factors across the three preadolescent assessments. The resulting index ranged from 0 to 6 (<italic>M</italic> = 2.29, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.34).</p>
<p>One of each target youth’s teachers assessed the youth’s self-control and competence at each of the three waves of preadolescent data collection. Self-control was assessed using the 12-item Self-Control Inventory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0956797612471954">Humphrey, 1982</xref>). Each item was rated on a Likert scale ranging from 0 (<italic>never</italic>) to 4 (<italic>almost always</italic>). Example items include, “sticks to what he/she is doing even during long, unpleasant tasks until finished,” “works toward a goal,” and “pays attention to what he/she is doing.” Alphas across waves ranged from .94 to .95. Self-control was operationalized as the average of the teachers’ ratings across the three preadolescent assessments. The teachers also completed a revised version of the Perceived Competence Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0956797612471954">Harter, 1982</xref>), which measures scholastic and social competence. The scale consists of 14 items rated on a Likert scale ranging from 1 (<italic>not at all</italic>) to 4 (<italic>always</italic>). Example items include, “very good at his/her school work,” “just as smart as other kids his/her age,” and “has a lot of friends.” Alphas across the three waves ranged from .86 to .88. Competence was operationalized as the average of the teachers’ ratings across the three preadolescent assessments. The self-control and competence measures were highly correlated (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001); they were standardized and then summed to form the self-control/competence score.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0956797612471954">
<title>Depressive symptoms and externalizing behavior in young adulthood</title>
<p>At age 19, the youth reported their own depressive symptoms, externalizing behavior, and substance use. Self-reports of depressive symptoms were obtained using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies–Depression scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0956797612471954">Radloff, 1977</xref>), which is widely used with community samples. The youth rated each of 20 symptoms on the following scale: 0 (<italic>rarely or none of the time</italic>), 1 (<italic>some or little of the time</italic>), 2 (<italic>occasionally or a moderate amount of time</italic>), or 3 (<italic>most or all of the time</italic>). Responses to these items were summed. Alpha was .86. Externalizing symptoms were measured using the Adult Self-Report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0956797612471954">Achenbach &amp; Rescorla, 2003</xref>). The Aggressive, Intrusive, and Rule Breaking subscales were used to index externalizing symptoms; alpha for the 36 items on these subscales was .92. The youth also reported their past-month cigarette, alcohol, and marijuana use and their excessive drinking on a widely used instrument from the Monitoring the Future Study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0956797612471954">Johnston, O’Malley, Bachman, &amp; Schulenberg, 2007</xref>). Responses to these four items were summed to form a substance-use composite, a procedure that is consistent with prior research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0956797612471954">Brody &amp; Ge, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0956797612471954">Newcomb &amp; Bentler, 1988</xref>). The measures of externalizing symptoms and substance use were highly correlated (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001); they were standardized and then summed to form the externalizing-problems score.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0956797612471954">
<title>AL in young adulthood</title>
<p>The protocol for measuring AL when the youth were 19 years of age was based on procedures that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0956797612471954">Evans (2003)</xref> developed for field studies involving children and adolescents. Resting blood pressure was monitored with a Critikon (Tampa, FL) Dinamap Pro 100 while the youth sat reading quietly. Three readings were taken every 2 min, and the average of the last two readings was used as the resting index. This procedure yields highly reliable indices of chronic resting blood pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0956797612471954">Kamarck et al., 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>Overnight urinary catecholamines and cortisol were assayed. Beginning on the evening of data collection, all urine that the young adult voided from 8:00 p.m. to 8:00 a.m. was stored on ice in a container with metabisulfite as a preservative. Urine was delivered to the Emory University Hospital medical laboratory in Atlanta, Georgia, for assaying. Total unbound cortisol was assayed with a radioimmunoassay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0956797612471954">Contreras, Hane, &amp; Tyrrell, 1986</xref>). Epinephrine and norepinephrine were assayed with high-pressureliquid chromatography with electrochemical detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0956797612471954">Riggin &amp; Kissinger, 1977</xref>). Creatinine was assayed to control for differences in body size and incomplete urine voiding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0956797612471954">Tietz, 1976</xref>). Technicians blind to the participants’ SES-related risk status assayed the samples.</p>
<p>AL was calculated by summing the number of physiological indicators on which each young adult scored in the top quartile of risk; possible scores ranged from 0 to 6. The AL indicators were overnight cortisol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine; resting diastolic and systolic blood pressure; and body mass index (weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0956797612471954">
<title>Health problems in young adulthood</title>
<p>The youth reported their health problems at age 19 using the General Health Perceptions subscale from the RAND 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0956797612471954">Hays, Sherbourne, &amp; Mazel, 1993</xref>). This five-item subscale includes a single-item rating of overall health (from 1, <italic>excellent</italic>, to 5, <italic>poor</italic>) and four items assessing current health status on a scale from 1 (<italic>definitely false</italic>) to 5 (<italic>definitely true</italic>). Examples of these latter items are “I am as healthy as anybody I know” and “I seem to get sick a little easier than other people.” Some of the items were reverse-scored, so that higher scores indicated more health problems and poorer general health. According to the instructions that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0956797612471954">Hays et al. (1993)</xref> provided for the scoring of this instrument, the responses are to be coded so that the lowest possible score is 0 and the highest possible score is 100. Therefore, after reverse-scoring, a response of 1 was assigned a value of 0, 2 was assigned a value of 25, 3 was assigned a value of 50, 4 was assigned a value of 75, and 5 was assigned a value of 100. After these values were assigned, responses to all items were averaged to yield a health-problems score, which could range from 0 to 100 (α = .72).</p>

At age 19, young men reported lower levels of depressive symptoms and higher levels of externalizing behavior than did young women. SES-related risk assessed across preadolescence was associated positively with AL at age 19, and higher teacher ratings of preadolescent self-control/competence forecast lower levels of self-reported depressive symptoms and externalizing behavior at age 19.</p>

<title>Hypothesis testing</title>
<p>To test our hypothesis, we constructed regression equations in which depressive symptoms, externalizing problems, and AL in young adulthood were predicted from successive blocks of variables: gender and health problems as controls, SES-related risk and self-control/competence, and a product term representing the latter two variables.</p>
<p>The results of the analyses for depressive symptoms and externalizing problems are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0956797612471954">Table 2</xref>.

<p>To interpret these results, we plotted estimated levels of depressive symptoms and externalizing problems at low (1 <italic>SD</italic> below the mean) and high (1 <italic>SD</italic> above the mean) levels of preadolescent SES-related risk and self-control/competence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0956797612471954">Aiken &amp; West, 1991</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0956797612471954">Figures 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0956797612471954">1b</xref> show that the interactions were consistent with the hypothesis. When youth lived with low levels of SES-related risk, teacher-rated preadolescent self-control/competence was not associated with depressive symptoms (simple slope = −0.194, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.136, n.s.) or externalizing problems (simple slope = −0.034, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.025, n.s.) during early adulthood. These associations became progressively stronger as the level of SES-related risk to which youth were exposed increased and ultimately reached significance (at 1 <italic>SD</italic> above the mean SES-related risk, simple slope = −0.580, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.138, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, for depression and simple slope = −0.109, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.025, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, for externalizing problems). Self-reports of depressive symptoms and externalizing problems were highest among young adults who, during preadolescence, had received low ratings on self-control/competence from their teachers and had also experienced high levels of SES-related risk. Self-reports of these two outcomes were lowest among young adults who, as preadolescents, had experienced high levels of SES-related risk but had received high ratings on self-control/competence from their teachers. Thus, young adults who, during preadolescence, had manifested age-appropriate indicators of hard work and success while experiencing high levels of SES-related risk reported the lowest levels of internalizing and externalizing behaviors. JH theory suggests that a single-minded focus on success protected these youth from psychological adjustment problems.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we found that rural African American preadolescents who evinced high levels of self-control/competence under conditions of high SES-related risk displayed low levels of adjustment problems but high levels of physiological risk (high AL) during young adulthood, at age 19. These findings are consistent with a counterintuitive pattern of mental- and physical-health outcomes that JH theory suggests. According to this theory, many rural African Americans should resemble the legendary folk hero John Henry: While growing up in a high-risk context, they are expected to be highly goal oriented and hardworking, to focus persistently on success, and to avoid unconventional behavior, but eventually to manifest indicators of physiological stress. Our findings are consistent with propositions that poor health and health disparities during adulthood are tied to earlier experiences; they also reinforce the importance of obtaining data on both overt behavioral adjustment and covert physiological distress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0956797612471954">Shonkoff et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>This study also has heuristic value for furthering the understanding of a remarkably similar, counterintuitive set of findings in the health-disparities literature. This literature indicates that African American adults experience greater physical morbidity and mortality than do adults of other ethnicities. For example, African American adults are twice as likely as are European Americans to die from heart disease, cancer, and diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0956797612471954">Lantz et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0956797612471954">Mensah, Mokdad, Ford, Greenlund, &amp; Croft, 2005</xref>). Conversely, in epidemiological surveys, African Americans consistently report lifetime rates of mental disorders that are no higher than the rates reported by European Americans, even with exposure to SES-related risk controlled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0956797612471954">Breslau, Kendler, Su, Aguilar-Gaxiola, &amp; Kessler, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0956797612471954">Kendler, Kuhn, Vittum, Prescott, &amp; Riley, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0956797612471954">Riolo, Nguyen, Greden, &amp; King, 2005</xref>). In the present study, we found a parallel discrepancy between participants’ psychological adjustment and health, as indexed by AL. This suggests that resilience is multidimensional; hidden indicators of compromised physiological health, such as high AL, may accompany observable competence and positive adjustment. In such cases, resilience may indeed be only “skin deep.”</p>
<p>We applied JH theory to derive a hypothesis about rural African American youth. An obvious question is whether the same pattern would be found for a broader cross section of disadvantaged youth, including urban African Americans or Latinos. We suggest that JH theory and the hypotheses it generates would be applicable to youth from other racial and ethnic groups who have the determination to succeed academically while grappling with chronic economic stressors, limitations in occupational and educational opportunities, and interpersonal and institutional racism.</p>
<p>A premise of this study was that when low-SES, rural African Americans make active efforts to beat the odds, a toll may be exacted on their bodily systems. For example, low-SES adults who use active coping to deal with stressors that are largely uncontrollable have higher blood pressure, greater total peripheral resistance, and greater risk of hypertension than do low-SES adults who are rated low on active coping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0956797612471954">James et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0956797612471954">Wright, Treiber, Davis, &amp; Strong, 1996</xref>). The present results are consistent with these findings and suggest the need for further research that elucidates the mediating mechanisms responsible for the physiological costs associated with active coping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0956797612471954">Chen &amp; Miller, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0956797612471954">Cohen, Evans, Stokols, &amp; Krantz, 1986</xref>). Clearly, refined analyses of the coping mechanisms that underlie the results presented here are needed.</p>
<p>Strengths of the present study include its prospective, longitudinal design and analysis of a large sample. The measures of the constructs minimized common method variance. SES-related risk across preadolescence was indexed from mothers’ reports; preadolescent self-control and competence were assessed from teachers’ reports; indicators of AL at age 19 were measured with a standard protocol that included overnight urine voids, blood pressure readings, and body mass index; and psychological adjustment was evaluated through young adults’ self-reports. Limitations of the study also should be noted. It is not known whether the results would generalize to low-SES European American or Latino families living in either urban or rural communities. The JH construct was not assessed directly because no valid measure of it is available for children and adolescents. Instead, age-appropriate indicators that exemplify this construct, self-control and competence, were assessed, and our hypothesis was tested using those indicators. Nevertheless, the results suggest that rural African American youth who live in low-SES circumstances and manifest psychological resilience may be at risk for developing high AL.</p>
