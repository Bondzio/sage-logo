<p>In an era of hyper-accelerated economic integration, the impact and cost of sport mega-events have grown in concert with their political and symbolic capital. The massive public expenditures on these short-lived events are occurring in the face of growing conflicts resulting from the decades-long implementation of neo-liberalizing regimes. Riots in Athens and London may not be specifically related to the Olympic Games of 2004 and 2012, but they also cannot be separated from the macro-economic policies that promote public risk and private profit, or the micro-spatial tactics of neo-liberal governance that fragment cities while separating, isolating, and surveilling “threats”.</p>
<p>The periodicity of mega-events makes them particularly apt vehicles for studying the localized implementation of larger trends and patterns, tactics and practices. These events are always critical conjunctures of the local and the global, the public and the private. These conjunctures accelerate existing trajectories, transforming cities into laboratories and populations into hosts (p. 41). Until relatively recently, the impacts of sports mega-events were felt more in the social and cultural realms than in the governmental and spatial. For instance, the soccer World Cup competitions – France ‘98, USA ‘94, and Italia ‘90 – had relatively minor impacts (with the exception of Paris’s Stade de France) upon the cities in which the matches were played. Every subsequent World Cup has, as this volume demonstrates, profoundly changed the spatial and social dynamics of host cities. The Olympics have followed a similar path, with each subsequent Games increasing in scale, scope and impact. The Olympic motto “stronger, higher, faster” takes form on Olympic landscapes. This excellent volume makes clear that some of the most profound and lasting impacts are in the realms of security, surveillance, and control.</p>
<p>Readers of <italic>Security Games</italic> will already be familiar with most of the academic concepts contained within. For students, teachers, and researchers new to the mega-event world this book will be excellent for vocabulary-building and theory testing. I found the volume to be tightly organized and surprisingly fresh, chapter after chapter. The case studies were well chosen, though more ethnographic analysis of the <italic>experience</italic> of security before, during, and after events would allow the mind to move laterally. The weakest chapters would be excellent on their own and did not detract from a tightly-packed book. I was particularly taken by the theoretical depth of the concept of “security”, particularly in Pete Fussey and Jon Coaffee’s chapter “Rethinking security at the Olympics”. The editors have taken great pains to provide a template for thinking about mega-event security that touches upon most of the salient themes. In addition to serving as an excellent reference for researchers and journalists (my notes ran to nearly twenty pages, full of zinging quotes), the book should be included in every course regarding mega-events and sports management.</p>
<p>Connecting the case studies of <italic>Security Games</italic> to research being conducted in Rio de Janeiro was all too easy. The militarization and privatization of urban space, the experiments in crowd control, the criminalizing of poverty, ridding the city of “undesirables”, a preternatural obsession with securing corporate rights, the discarding of human rights, processes of “social cleaning”, signing international arms contracts, importation and implementation of the accoutrements of war, the establishment of states and cities of exception – all this is well under way wherever mega-events occur. It is all very depressing.</p>
<p>I share the perspective of the authors that society should privilege human rights over market opportunities, citizen rights over corporate, and democracy over autocracy. The story narrated in <italic>Security Games</italic> is of an inevitable increase and acceleration of the implementation of authoritarian and militarized systems of surveillance and control in order to guarantee the transfer of public money to private coffers. Mega-events hasten security processes and regimes that might take decades to develop on their own, leaving new, invasive and deadly technologies strewn unevenly across the urban fabric. As Molnar and Snider note regarding Vancouver 2010, mega-events are “strategies that normalize accumulation, displace insecurity onto marginalized populations and the environment, and reproduce the social conditions necessary for capital accumulation” (p. 157). Once the event has passed, these systems, strategies, technologies, and knowledges remain, often in new and “innovative” forms. The detail and depth at which <italic>Security Games</italic> tracks these developments in mega-event cities and countries since 2002 is as impressive as it is important and scary.</p>
<p>The <italic>Security Games</italic> narrative is consistent with a prevailing academic discourse that suggests we are variably surfing a neo-liberalizing, globalizing, securitizing, ever-more-unequal wave into a future that forebodes environmental disasters pockmarked with a creeping loss of individual privacy and collective rights that are assumed by corporations that have revolving-door relationships with government and other private sector actors. However, mega-event security is produced in a discursive world that is the opposite of this. People who work for FIFA, the IOC, Local Organizing Committees, etc. really believe that these events bring benefits, that more security does not have generally harmful impacts, that taking the financial and social risk of hosting the event to expand a city’s brand is really worth the opportunity costs. Is there some kind of middle ground to be trod here or are these opposing discursive frameworks doomed to a disarticulated polarity?</p>
<p>In the Introduction Bennett and Haggerty intone, “in the face of such a powerful confluence of actors and motivations, meaningful local opposition to spectacular security measures is difficult, if not futile” (p. 7). This should be taken as a warning for cities and citizens that are preparing to host these events, and begs the question: in the face of such overwhelming odds, what is a disarticulated, fragmented, and surveilled social movement to do? What are the remaining options for civil society organizations to act and move in urban spaces (including the media) that are increasingly territorialized, securitized, “dedicated”, and privatized, in which public and private security forces have the right to evict, displace, harass, assess, and incarcerate?</p>
<p>An interesting point of departure for an answer would be to research what is being, has been, and can be done to reverse the gaze. The notion of transparency with mega-events tends to be unidirectional, with the state combining with the private sector in a sinister and complicit way to render populations both visible and profitable. The general lack of transparency mechanisms throughout the long process (if considered from bid to “legacy”) of a mega-event contributes, as much as the security apparatus itself, to the maintenance of “an architecture of power” that “engages not just Olympic protesters but all (including environmental activists) who resist the accelerated development strategies associated with the Games” (Molnar and Snider, p. 157). What would the reverse of this look like? Perhaps something like:
<disp-quote>
<p>‘Civil society organizations and social movements have consistently and effectively mobilized for the increased monitoring of the processes and costs associated with mega-events, establishing interlocked yet independent mechanisms that demand accountability from the public sector and have been successful in negotiating consensus with civil engineering and real-estate firms to ensure a more equitable form of income distribution.’</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It’s nice to dream.</p>
<p>The reality is that in order to host mega-events, cities make elaborate and expensive promises regarding event security. These promises and their subsequent contractual obligations develop into “opportunities for experiments in monitoring people and places”. The scale and cost of these experiments can be considered “‘total security’ concepts akin to planning and deployment in times of war” (Bennett and Haggerty, p. 1). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1741659011435405">Graeme Hayes and John Horne (2011)</xref> as well as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741659011435405">Gaffney (2010)</xref> note the similarities between Naomi Klein’s <italic>Disaster Capitalism</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1741659011435405">2008</xref>) and the installation of mega-event regimes.</p>
<p>The increasing demand for “transformation” within the discursive structures of the International Olympic Committee can be understood as a mechanism for opening new markets, forcing cities to open pathways and spaces that accelerate flows of capital, goods, people, and information. These transformations are not “natural”. To the contrary, they require significant legal and social restructuring to be carried off to the satisfaction of sport NGOs and their corporate “partners”. This volume’s contribution to the understanding of the short-, medium-, and long-term impacts of these events will prove invaluable to researchers working on mega-events as well as those interested in the tactical toolbox used in the structuring of new forms of urban governance and social control, frequently placed under the banner of “neo-liberalism”.</p>
