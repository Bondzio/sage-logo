The acute oral LD<sub>50</sub> for rats was 2.5 mL/kg<sup>3</sup> (2500 mg/kg). Diets containing PEA at concentrations of 0.06 to 2 g/kg provided to rats for 14 days produced no adverse effects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1091581812461811">4</xref></sup> However, open topical applications of 0.25 to 2 mL PEA/kg administered to rats for 90 days produced significant decreases in body weight at 1 and 2 mL/kg and significant decreases in hemoglobin in male rats at 2 mL/kg.

Nine-week-old healthy, time-mated, Crl:COBSCD(SD)BR female rats were obtained from Charles River UK Ltd. (Margate, Kent). After acclimation, 112 pregnant rats were assigned to 4 groups of 28 rats each, using a computerized stratified randomization for body weight. Ad libitum access to feed and water was provided, and the rats were housed individually in suspended galvanized wire mesh cages in an animal room maintained at 20°C ± 2°C with 53% ± 11% humidity and a 12-hour light/dark cycle. Ground laboratory diet (Labsure Laboratory Diet No.2) containing 0, 1000, 3000, or 10 000 ppm of PEA (calculated intake: 0, 83, 266, or 799 mg/kg/d) was provided on days 6 through 15 of gestation (GDs 6 through 15; sperm/sperm plug = GD 0). The PEA was microencapsulated in spray-dried gum arabic and then incorporated into the diet. The concentrations provided remained unchanged during the course of the study and were selected on the basis of results from a previous pilot study in which dietary inclusion of up to 9000 ppm PEA was well tolerated by pregnant rats and appeared to maintain diet palatability. High-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) analyses were used to validate the concentration, homogeneity, and stability of the PEA used throughout the study.</p><p>All animals were monitored daily for signs of toxicity. Feed consumption was measured daily, and body weights of the dams were taken on GDs 1, 3, 6, and then on alternate days until necropsy. The rats were sacrificed on GD 20, and in utero development of the conceptuses was assessed by determination of litter values and examination of the fetuses for external, soft tissue, and skeletal alterations (malformations and variations). Half of each litter was sectioned according to the method of Wilson,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1091581812461811">18</xref></sup> and evaluated for visceral changes, while the other half was evaluated for skeletal changes after clearing and staining with alizarin red.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1091581812461811">19</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="section4-1091581812461811"><title>Dermal Developmental Toxicity Study of PEA in Rats</title><p>The dermal study consisted of 4 groups of 25 to 35 per group time-mated female rats. The rats were of the same strain, age, and source as described for the oral study, and animal handling and housing conditions were also the same. Phenylethyl alcohol (neat) was applied to a 7 × 5 cm shaved (by electric clipper), interscapular area of the skin on GDs 6 through 15 at dosages of 140, 430, or 1400 mg/kg/d. A control group was administered applications of water at the same mL/kg volume as the high-dosage group (1.40 mL/kg).

The highest dosage, 1400 mg/kg/d, was used to extend the range of dosages tested, in case there was differential absorption by the dermal route. To minimize possible oral ingestion of the control or test material, the dermal applications were occluded with an aluminum foil patch that was held in place by a porous medical adhesive bandage. The applied daily dosages were kept on the animals for 24 hours.

Even at the highest dosage of 10 000 ppm (799 mg/kg/d), adverse effects were minimal: transient decrease in maternal feed consumption and body weight gains on GDs 6 and 7 and a slightly higher incidence of delayed ossification in some fetal skeletal elements, such as the sacro-caudal vertebral arches. Based on these results, the maternal and developmental no-observed-adverse-effect levels (NOAELs) for dietary administration were 266 mg/kg/d, resulting in a theoretical margin of safety of greater than 850 times the near-maximal (0.3 mg/kg/d) fragrance use level in humans.</p><p>These results differ remarkably from those of Mankes et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1091581812461811">8</xref></sup> These investigators reported that oral gavaged dosages of 4.3, 43, and 432 mg/kg/d produced fetal death, malformations, and growth retardation. The difference can probably be attributed to the single daily bolus dosages that likely produced spikes of high blood serum levels that could not be detoxified in a timely manner. Adverse developmental effects to the fetus are often considered to be due to excessively high peak exposures of noxious agents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1091581812461811">37</xref></sup> Furthermore, although gavaged dosages can be accurately defined and have fewer confounding factors than topical application, they do not mimic the human use of fragrances, which tend to be applied (and absorbed) several times a day. Such applications produce lower but more prolonged serum levels that resemble those seen after dietary intake, rather than bolus administration. Finally, there was a difference in the strain of rat studied (Long-Evans rats were used by Mankes et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1091581812461811">8</xref></sup>).</p><p>However, neither of the oral studies addressed possible differences caused by the route of administration of the PEA. Therefore, 2 developmental toxicity studies were performed to characterize and define the effects of PEA when applied topically to the skin of pregnant rats on GDs 6 through 15. The corroborative, second study was conducted with fewer animals and was designed to define more accurately the dose-response curves achieved in the first study. The combined results of these two studies demonstrated that dosages of ≥ 70 mg/kg/d produced dose-dependent local irritation at the application site, a common confounding factor in these types of studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1091581812461811">38</xref></sup> Decreases in fetal body weights and consequent reversible delays in ossification at 140 mg/kg/d and higher were probably associated with maternal stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1091581812461811">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1091581812461811">40</xref></sup> produced by the localized dermal irritation at the application site. Delays in ossification are considered fetal variations (reversible delays in development) in rodents that are usually related to reduced fetal body weight and, in the absence of fetal malformations, are not considered a significant hazard to humans.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1091581812461811">39</xref></sup> Maternal and developmental (NOAELs) for dermal application were considered to be 70 mg/kg/d, based on minimal dermal irritation in the dams and small (not statistically significant) reductions in fetal body weights at this dosage level. Such NOAELs suggest the presence of a theoretical margin of safety greater than 230 times the near-maximal human fragrance use level of 0.3 mg/kg/d.</p><p>However, species differences in absorption, metabolism, and excretion are major factors in calculating a realistic margin of safety for PEA. Therefore, the data from one dermal absorption and disposition study in rats, rabbits, and humans, as well as determination of plasma and urine concentrations and pharmacokinetics in rats reported by Politano et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1091581812461811">14</xref></sup> are highly relevant. Results from those studies indicated that biotransformation and excretion of PEA were similar in rats and humans. The major metabolite is phenylacetic acid and the maximum concentration in blood occurred 1.5 hours after dermal application in humans. Systemic absorption from topical application was much greater in rats than in humans. Based on urinary excretion of radioactivity, rats absorbed 77% of a single topical dosage of <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1091581812461811">14</xref></sup>C-PEA, while only 7.6% was absorbed by humans. The results of the present study provide a similar extent of dermal absorption in rats. About 65% of the applied dose was recovered in the urine by 24 hours. Thus, systemic exposure to PEA (and the metabolite phenylacetic acid) is markedly less in humans than in rats. This exposure to PEA from fragrances, 0.3 mg/kg/d can then be adjusted based on human skin absorption of 7.6% of the applied dose, resulting in a realistic human exposure level of 0.02 mg/kg/d. Utilizing the observed absorption differences resulting in human exposure of 0.02 mg/kg/d from multiple PEA-containing cosmetic products, Politano et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1091581812461811">14</xref></sup> calculated a human margin of safety greater than 2600.
