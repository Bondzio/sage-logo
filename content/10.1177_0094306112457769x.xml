<p>As its introduction tells us, <italic>Crime and Terrorism Risk</italic> includes works meant “to show how researchers and policy experts are beginning to think about crime and terrorism issues in terms of a new risk paradigm that emphasizes establishing a balance between threat and resources in developing prevention and response strategies” (p. xix). In other words, these chapters are oriented to the idea that policies regarding crime and terrorism can take account of when these acts are likely to occur, who is likely to engage in them, and what resources are available to stop them. But such informed and rational decision-making, while it may be less common than one would prefer, hardly constitutes a new or distinctive paradigm. And herein lies one potential source of confusion for readers of this volume, who might struggle to understand the nature of the “risk perspective” that provides an integrating theme for chapters addressing such loosely related topics as initiatives to reduce gang-related homicides, the profile of radical political groups, the organization of the Turkish police force, and an overview of crimes related to global trade. Despite its supposed importance in unifying these studies, the risk perspective does not appear to be a general strategy of observing and explaining along the lines of such sociological paradigms as rational choice, conflict, functionalist, or opportunity theories. Each of the latter approaches is a distinctive way of explaining human behavior, asking its own unique questions and specifying different independent variables. The risk perspective, on the other hand, seems to consist mostly of using the word “risk”—asking, for instance, who is at risk for committing a crime. Criminologists using various theoretical strategies will be forgiven for finding this question familiar. Studying the risk that something will or will not occur under a given set of conditions is neither a distinctive approach nor an empirical specialty, but an activity common across all branches of theoretical science, whether they address the risk of crime, biological extinction, earthquakes, or the decay of radioactive particles.</p>
<p>Once one understands that this new paradigm is neither new nor a paradigm, one can perhaps judge the articles in this volume on their own terms as exercises in criminology and public policy. The volume is organized into three sections. Part I provides an overview of risk assessment and contains more general discussions of theory and applied criminology. For example, Chapter Two describes an intervention by law enforcement agencies that succeeded in reducing homicide rates by focusing deterrence efforts on those most likely to offend, while Chapter Seven discusses factors that make a product more or less likely to be counterfeited. Part II focuses on risk management policies. For example, Chapter Eight discusses how police can use proactive, problem-solving approaches to prevent terrorism, while Chapter Ten recommends that police agencies develop centralized systems to record and share reports of suspicious activities. Many of the recommendations found in this section—that police should have better intelligence, better communication, and so forth—seem remarkably intuitive, though they may be extremely difficult to implement in any large organization. Finally, Part III contains a series of “case studies”: empirically-oriented chapters dealing with particular types of crime, including fairly interesting overviews of shipping crime (Chapter Thirteen), counterfeit pharmaceuticals and food (Chapters Fourteen and Sixteen), and cybercrime (Chapter Seventeen).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many chapters are disappointing, lacking general theoretical insights, major research findings, or a clear sense of what they meant to accomplish. The first chapter, for instance, tell us that crime may threaten either individuals or societies, that some threats are more specific than others (e.g., the threat of crime in general versus the threat of an individual offender), and that each crime has precursors as well as an aftermath. While these observations may have some utility, their ultimate contribution to a larger theoretical program or a concrete course of action remains unclear. Also unclear are the contributions of the concluding chapter—a discussion of the risk of zebra mussels (an invasive mollusk that is a nuisance in U.S. waters) becoming a terrorist weapon. The brief chapter does report one case in which an aggrieved individual threatened to release the creatures, but mostly consists of a list of seemingly obvious questions and prescriptions for legal officials investigating the threat of mussel-terrorism, such as “What do zebra mussels look like?” and “Identify the individuals and the reasons for their possession of the zebra mussels” (pp. 270–71). Such guidance may be less than enlightening.</p>
<p>The most important work in this volume is Joel Caplan, William Moreto, and Leslie Kennedy’s discussion of how to predict the location of maritime piracy, in Chapter Six. These authors present a simple opportunity theory that takes account of the volume of potential targets, their presence in geographically constricted “choke points,” and their proximity to weak states unable to provide protection. They then use this theory to predict the probability that maritime pirates will strike. Next, they empirically demonstrate that their model is more successful in predicting the location of pirate attacks than the alternate method of prediction based only on the location of attacks during the previous year. Their analysis shows the superiority that theoretical prediction can have over simple forecasts based on previous empirical trends, and thus makes a strong case for the practical utility of social scientific theory.</p>
