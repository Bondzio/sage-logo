<abstract>
<p>Recent economic growth in India has raised its potential to be an economic giant, along with the United States and China. One unique aspect of the Indian economy is that tremendous economic growth has been achieved despite weak infrastructure, resource shortages, and other travails that restrict growth in emerging economies. Recent economic explanations suggest that institutions supporting the economy and economic development are vital to sustained economic growth and may even be more important than infrastructure development. Examining the historic context of the Indian economy, we contend that vital market institutions were always present in India and that economic reforms have unleashed the full potential of these institutions. Using some industry examples, the authors argue that economic policies that strengthen market institutions may be more important compared to conventional policies geared toward infrastructure development.</p>

<body>
<p>Academics and practitioners alike are excited by the prospects of high growth in various emerging markets. The motley crowd of what is considered “emerging” includes historic civilization states, such as India and China, as well as relatively New World states, such as Brazil and Chile. The relative progress and achievement of these economies is a subject of much speculation but what is certain is that future market development in these economies will depend, to a large extent, on their historic pasts and current policies.</p>
<p>According to estimates prepared by the late Angus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0276146712441003">Maddison (2001)</xref>, India and China each accounted for about one-third of the world GDP circa 1000 AD. With the beginning of the industrial revolution in the West, India’s share of the global output declined to about 20 percent, with further declines from around 1850 to 1947, the year India became independent. Thus, by the time the word “Third World” was coined in 1952, India found it itself squarely in the middle of it. Later, with increasing development, gradual reforms and more wholesale liberalization, Indian economy started expanding, giving it now the status of an emerging economy. However, considering the historic background of economic clout, we prefer to view India as a resurging economy rather than merely an emerging economy.</p>
<p>Even a cursory examination of academic, business, and popular writings on the Indian economy reveal that there are several contradictions unique to India. First, while the infrastructure remains patchy and weak, business optimism and business growth in various sectors appear to have either surmounted these weaknesses or have circumvented it. Second, as the world’s largest democracy, with plurality of administration and political parties, it appears that policy consensus is very difficult to achieve, as evident by the recent delays on the question of allowing foreign ownership in the retail sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0276146712441003">Yardley 2011b</xref>). Despite the enormous diversity of ethnicities and political philosophies, Indians remain united in their commitment to economic growth and policy reforms, with the major debates only on specific policy instruments. Third, infrastructure necessary for the development of markets remains weak; yet, both business and consumer markets function quite effectively. Fourth, a vast majority of the population has not completed even primary schooling and therefore, labor is largely unskilled; yet, the country boasts of vast cadres of skilled personnel in various fields such as science, technology, medicine, pharmaceuticals, and information technology. Fifth, large family-controlled businesses appear to dominate in every industry where private investments are allowed; yet, there is a multitude of small businesses contributing to vibrant market competition and millions of entrepreneurs breaking into various markets. Finally, per capita income and purchasing power remains drastically low as compared to other emerging economies; yet, the size of the middle class is estimated to be as large as the entire population of the United States and expected to double by the year 2030.</p>
<p>In this article, the authors focus on these contradictions of infrastructure, governance, institutions, labor and technology skills, market competition, and purchasing power to demonstrate that the Indian experience has been one that has been shaped by resilience to historic forces and resourcefulness in the face of adverse circumstances. The authors advance the argument that economic development and market evolution in India have been shaped by improvisations of various institutions necessary for economic growth and market evolution. In short, economic growth is achieved due to strong institutions and despite poor infrastructure and unpredictable policy.</p>
<p>In the next section, the authors focus on the current realities in India through a framework offered by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0276146712441003">Sheth (2011)</xref>. In the sections following, the authors offer an analysis of market-supporting institutions in India and the changes brought about by recent policy reforms. The authors also offer a brief analysis of two industries—information technology (IT) services and diamond cutting—to demonstrate how issues of inadequate infrastructure were circumvented. We conclude with a brief prognosis of necessary institutional conditions for the resurgence of India as a global economic giant.</p>

<title>India in the Framework of Emerging Markets</title>
<p>Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0276146712441003">Sheth (2011)</xref> identified five characteristics of emerging markets as chronic shortage of resources, inadequate infrastructure, larger influence of sociopolitical governance in the economy, higher market heterogeneity, and higher competition among unbranded products. These are particularly true for India as well. In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0276146712441003">Table 1</xref>

<title>Shortage of Critical Resources</title>
<p>India has long suffered from a chronic shortage of critical resources, such as capital, raw materials, skilled labor and power needed for production and industrial growth. Due to the lack or maldevelopment of distribution systems, scarcity was more the norm and exchanges were characterized by high transaction costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0276146712441003">Sharma and Dominguez 1992</xref>). Scarcity of resources affected consumption as well, not merely due to a lack of purchasing power, but also due to government taxes and prohibitions on luxury and/or imported products, so that scarce resources could be channeled to the best social and productive uses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0276146712441003">Kaushik 1997</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0276146712441003">
<title>Inadequate Infrastructure</title>
<p>Historically, India’s infrastructure was either developed around traditional, rural market towns that served as places for trading cattle and agricultural produce or were developed by the colonial British to serve their own administration and economic purposes. Also, given that India prior to its independence was comprised of about 560 or more princely states, with many owing only taxes to the British, a central or federal authority to develop a national infrastructure was created only after independence. However, lacking both capital and technology to extract and utilize an otherwise abundance of natural resources, infrastructure necessary for commerce developed only at a snail’s pace. Even today, India’s road and rail networks, power generation and distribution systems, and many airports and seaports are in dire need of modernization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0276146712441003">Li, Mengistae and Xu 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0276146712441003">Seddon 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0276146712441003">Yardley and Bajaj 2011</xref>). As a result, transportation, logistics, warehousing, communications, and transaction facilitation all remain somewhat patchy and underdeveloped, thwarting not only domestic business growth but also warding off foreign business. Only recently, there has been some more concerted focus on infrastructure, with more modern airports and better highway systems, but much of the transportation system still remains “congested and crumbling” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0276146712441003">Seddon 2011</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0276146712441003">
<title>Influence of Sociopolitical Systems in Governance</title>
<p>Historically, in India, trade and business were largely confined to specific castes and communities across the country and some even became large business conglomerates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0276146712441003">Tripathi 1997</xref>). These groups circumvented the high costs of transactions among strangers by confining much of their business dealings along caste, religious community, and kinship identities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0276146712441003">Iyer 1999</xref>). The positive impacts of these have been the avoidance of market failure and the achievement of economic efficiencies through expansion in sources of finance, credit, resources, knowledge skills, and distribution access. These business groups also developed the unique skills needed to circumvent or respond to the maze of bureaucratic red tape restricting business practices. However, in achieving economic dominance, the support of the ruling elite was always needed; in pre-Independence India, the larger traders and business groups sought these from the British through providing them with finance to cover administrative costs. However, in a post-Independence India that appeared overtly socialist with adversarial relations between the government and business, their influence waned somewhat for a few decades until the 1980s. A pro-business governmental attitude from the early 1980s once again enabled the large trading and industrial groups to assert their influence on government plans and policies and thus obtain preferential treatment for further growth and diversification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0276146712441003">Rodrik and Subramanian 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0276146712441003">Root 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0276146712441003">Sheth 2011</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0276146712441003">
<title>Greater Market Heterogeneity</title>
<p>Historic dependence on agriculture and uneven industrialization, among other factors, has also created greater market heterogeneity in India. While a few major cities are relatively well developed, a vast proportion of the population still lives in hundreds of smaller towns and thousands of villages scattered across the country. Even today, many rural areas, and even some urban areas, lack infrastructure and amenities, including those as basic as running water and electricity. The uneven development and the wide urban–rural disparity have also contributed to markets that are not only local, fragmented, and small scale but also owned and operated by petty traders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0276146712441003">Sheth 2011</xref>). Scale economies, already low in production, are largely unavailable in distribution. Small market sizes along with bureaucratic limits to growth and expansion have, however, contributed to thousands of small enterprises in almost every sector of the economy where private enterprise formation is permitted. For example, small enterprises employing 10 or less workers account for as much as 89 percent of all enterprises, as compared to only 4 percent of such enterprises in China and 11 percent in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0276146712441003">Bajaj 2011</xref>). Local small enterprises offer a vast variety of products and services to their own small markets across the country.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0276146712441003">
<title>Unbranded Competition</title>
<p>While large business groups account for most of the industrial, manufactured, and branded products, a substantial variety of products, such as staples, as well as services such as household services, remain unbranded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0276146712441003">Sheth 2011</xref>). The lack of a modernized infrastructure renders distribution to dispersed multitudes of rural markets inefficient and costly; therefore, most large business groups cater mainly to urban consumers. However, most agricultural products are still largely unbranded and large markets exist for reused, repaired, and retrofitted products.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0276146712441003">
<title>Summary</title>
<p>Despite all these characteristics of emerging markets, India’s average annual gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate has averaged around 6 percent since the 1980s, with the annual growth rate projected to be at least 5 percent until the year 2050 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0276146712441003">Kohli 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0276146712441003">Wilson and Purushothaman 2003</xref>). The fascinating aspect of India’s economic growth is that it being achieved despite weak infrastructure, shortage of critical resources, fragmented markets, and with much of the economy still in the informal sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0276146712441003">Kumar 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0276146712441003">Sheth 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0276146712441003">Yardley 2011c</xref>). Instead of developing the infrastructure as China had done, or enabling large business groups to compete globally, as in the case of South Korea and Japan, India has reveled in contradictions so wide as to lead the <italic>New York Times</italic> to dub India as a country where “dynamism wrestles with dysfunction” and where “growth usually occurs despite the government rather than because of it” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0276146712441003">Yardley 2011a</xref>, p. A1). Such economic dynamism defies conventional explanations, especially given the fact that despite decades of economic planning and government involvement in industry, much of the growth has occurred in areas that were less subject to government policies and participation.</p>
<p>In the next section, in line with recent explanations focusing on India’s institutions, we evaluate the constraints on market evolution in India and the impacts of economic reforms in India on institutional change. We argue that an institutional base for market evolution was already present in India and that policy reforms enhanced the quality of relevant institutions and unleashed the full potential of these institutions to contribute to economic growth.</p>

<title>Policy Reforms and Institutional Change in India</title>
<p>Given wide disparities in income, wealth, and access, India’s development aims were slanted toward social justice more than economic growth for several decades after freedom from Great Britain in 1947. Fresh from a colonial past and given the abundance of natural resources and labor but gross inequalities in incomes and wealth distributions, free India declared its objectives as one of self-reliance or, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0276146712441003">Nehru (1946)</xref> stated it, “national self-sufficiency.” However, India borrowed ideas freely from around the world. The constitution that was formally adopted in 1950 was based on ideas of freedom and equality from the US, German, and French constitutions, while the administrative and legal frameworks used by the British during their rule were kept largely intact. The idea of economic planning followed the Soviet approach to planned economic development with socialistic objectives, and the emphasis on a dual-sector approach to economic growth was a blend of Nehru’s vision of industrialization and Gandhi’s philosophy of emphasizing small and cottage industries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0276146712441003">Kaushik 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Self-reliance was sought through a two-pronged strategy—setting up the base for large-scale industrialization in diverse sectors and the continuing emphasis on agriculture for basic needs fulfillment. While GDP grew by almost 4 percent to 5 percent in the first two decades after freedom, it had declined to around 2 percent to 3 percent by the late 1960s. After several years of declines in agricultural output and a failed liberalization experiment in the 1960s, India retreated to an inward orientation at a time when other Asian countries were seeking an export-led growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0276146712441003">Mukherji 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0276146712441003">Panagriya 2008</xref>). A variety of socialistic initiatives were pursued by the government, including the nationalization of large banks and the insurance sector, increasing government participation and investment in heavy industry, punitive registration and license requirements as well as monopoly laws and other regulations, including restrictions on foreign direct investments (FDI), that effectively led to a “strangulation of industry” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0276146712441003">Panagriya 2008</xref>). What emerged was a climate of distrust toward big business and profits. Essentially, business profits were considered anathema to a social justice view of economic development and, therefore, business activities were curtailed through extensive regulations and corporate profits, and personal incomes were subject to punitive taxation.</p>
<p>Despite a weak infrastructure, recent economic growth in India is attributed not only to the policy reforms undertaken from the early 1980s but also to a few strong and vibrant institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0276146712441003">Bhattacharya 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0276146712441003">Patibandla 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0276146712441003">Rodrik and Subramanian 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0276146712441003">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0276146712441003">Rodrik, Subramanian and Trebbi 2004</xref>). Institutions can be defined as “the rules of the game in a society,” or as “the humanly devised constraints that shape human interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0276146712441003">North 1990</xref>, p. 3). Perspectives from economic history have informed us that the institutional environment is important for the emergence and growth of economic organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0276146712441003">Davis and North 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0276146712441003">Williamson 1996</xref>). Such an institutional environment is broadly defined as the “set of fundamental political, social and legal ground rules that establishes the basis for production, exchange and distribution” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0276146712441003">Davis and North 1971</xref>, p. 6).</p>
<p>Markets as institutions rely on other institutions for their effective functioning, including institutions that enable entrepreneurship, regulations that protect private property and proprietary assets, education and information that guide sellers and buyers, institutions that allow for price- and brand-based competition, institutions that enhance credibility and/or safeguard reputations, institutions that enable transactions, and institutions that provide the structure and processes necessary for fair, efficient, and effective conduct of exchanges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0276146712441003">Davis and North 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0276146712441003">Iyer 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0276146712441003">Iyer and Masters 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0276146712441003">Khanna and Palepu 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0276146712441003">Virmani 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0276146712441003">Rodrik and Subramanian (2004)</xref>, India already had several good economic and political institutions, including a “stable democratic polity, reasonable rule of law and protection of property rights,” but it started taking advantage of these institutions only in the 1980s (p. 1593). Support for this assertion can also be found in its corollary. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0276146712441003">Bhattacharya (2011)</xref> argues that despite India’s integration in global trade by the sixteenth century, economic growth was dampened by weak economic, social, and political institutions that emerged, such as rent seeking by feudal landlords and local rulers, weak political power of the merchants and masses, deindustrialization due to relative increase in farm prices and the importation of British manufactured goods, and free India’s import substitution and other regulatory policies.</p>

highlights aspects of the marketing system that existed circa 1970. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0276146712441003">Boddewyn (1969)</xref>, a marketing system can be conceptualized as composed of interrelated constituents of actors, processes, structures, and functions that contribute to marketing exchanges. A skewed income distribution and a high incidence of poverty and illiteracy allowed only a small segment of educated middle-class consumers. All large banks were nationalized and industries were dominated by state-owned (public sector) enterprises with restrictions on private investments in most industries. Moreover, due to lack of financing and government controls on licensing and business formation (also known as the license raj), there were only a few small- and medium-sized businesses. Some large family business houses operated and diversified, but under tight regulations and government restrictions. However, distribution activities remained traditionally linked by informal networks and ethnic ties among smaller petty traders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0276146712441003">Iyer 1999</xref>).</p>

<p>However, market exchanges were still facilitated by well-defined private property rights, legal frameworks, contractual obligations and reputation within informal networks. A parallel economy developed, with most small-sized businesses becoming part of an informal economy that escaped government scrutiny and therefore, the various restrictions and regulations on products, prices, and business operations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0276146712441003">Kumar 1999</xref>). Even today, it is estimated that about 90 percent of India’s labor force is employed in the informal sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0276146712441003">Yardley 2011c</xref>).</p>
<p>In the early 1980s, the government attitude apparently had shifted to one that was more pro-business, and several reforms were undertaken to aid large business (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0276146712441003">Kohli 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0276146712441003">Rodrik and Subramanian 2005</xref>). It has been argued that these pro-business reforms in the 1980s provided much of the groundwork for the success of the extensive liberalization of the Indian economy that was set in motion more than a decade later in 1991 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0276146712441003">DeLong 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0276146712441003">Kohli 2006a</xref>).</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0276146712441003">Rodrik and Subramanian (2005)</xref>, the pro-business orientation of the Indian government favored large incumbent firms and manufacturers who profited from easing of various restrictions, including price controls, capacity expansion, and import controls as well as the reduction of corporate taxes. These changes were welcomed by existing businesses and also had the largely unintended consequence of creating new competitors in various sectors, including the IT industry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0276146712441003">Rodrik and Subramanian 2005</xref>). Nonfarm productivity surged throughout the 1990s, and the GPD growth averaged 5.7 percent for years 1981 to 1991 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0276146712441003">Ahluwalia 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0276146712441003">Panagriya (2004)</xref> argues that the reforms that were undertaken in the 1980s took the form of “liberalization by stealth.” By contrast, the much publicized market liberalization in 1991 was more broad based, systematic, and systemic, and led to a more stable and sustainable growth soon after (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0276146712441003">Panagriya 2004</xref>). Triggered by a balance of payments crisis, the historic 1991 liberalization reduced import tariffs, eliminated import quotas for most goods, eased foreign ownership restrictions, ensured greater currency convertibility, and overhauled the industrial policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0276146712441003">Ahluwalia 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0276146712441003">Kaushik 1997</xref>). Private sector was now allowed to compete in industries earlier reserved only for the public sector, such as heavy machinery and large-scale plants, telecommunication and telecom equipment, mining, air transport services, and electricity generation and distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0276146712441003">Ahluwalia 2002</xref>). GDP growth from 1992 onward was more stable and was over 7 percent for several years and was estimated to be 9.7 percent in 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0276146712441003">World Bank 2011</xref>). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0276146712441003">Table 3</xref>

<p>Liberalization was gradual, but had its intended effects: foreign investments started flowing into India and foreign firms started setting up shop; entrepreneurial activity surged and new businesses were now created in every sector in which private investments were allowed; market competition increased as did innovations; and economic growth led to increased poverty alleviation and a growing middle class. India’s economic engine had received its jump-start. Much like the development paths of other similarly situated developing countries and the typical insights and recommendations of economists, India’s GDP shifted away from agriculture. However, the Indian case is quite unique, since instead of secondary sectors, such as industry, in general, and manufacturing, in particular, accounting for much of the growth, it was the services sector that led the economic revitalization. The services sector contributed as much as 37.2 percent even in 1980 and this sector’s share of the GDP rose to 55.2 percent in 2009–10, or as high as 63.4 percent, if construction was also included (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0276146712441003">Government of India, 2011</xref>). Thus, much of the rapid growth in GDP in the post-liberalization period could be accounted by growth in the services sector.</p>
<p>The policy changes that occurred in the 1980s not only strengthened democratic polity but also improved the quality of various economic and political institutions, including property rights, contracts, and regulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0276146712441003">Bhattacharya 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0276146712441003">Patibandla 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0276146712441003">Rodrik and Subramanian 2004</xref>). Despite scarcity of resources, low consumer purchasing powers, high inequalities in incomes and wealth, and the close nexus between the economic elite and the political elite, India remains a vibrant democracy with no signs of revolts or social revolutions. Moreover, the past 15 years have moved India firmly on the path of capitalist market liberalization with even the last two Indian states (Kerala and West Bengal), where the communist parties were in power and socialist ideologies rampant, now pursuing market-led capitalistic growth. Also, with increasing transparency as well as the dismantling of the bureaucratic license and permit regimes which fostered corruption by public officials, political and public institutions are now under increased scrutiny. Political meddling in public institutions and corruption are often exposed to the public by an increasingly vigilant media and also dealt with through legal actions and punitive measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0276146712441003">Goldsmith 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0276146712441003">Rodrik and Subramanian 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Education and the development of skilled labor, a new entrepreneurial class and technical and managerial knowledge also benefited from reforms. Historically, the emphasis on self-reliance had led to the development of technical skills indigenously, though some technical help was obtained from bilateral arrangements as well as collaborations with prestigious universities in the West, such as Harvard and MIT, and educational foundations (e.g., Ford). World-class educational institutions, such as the Indian Institutes of Technology, Indian Institutes of Management, and the Indian Institute of Science, continued to produce a cadre of highly skilled scientific and management elite even in the dismal economic climate of the 1960s and 1970s. Continuing investments in public education led to the creation of numerous publicly funded colleges and universities across India, ensuring merit-based access for all as well as preferential quotas for oppressed castes. Overall, the public educational system was not at par with those in developed countries during that time, but they provided the institutional base for the success of later social, political, and economic reforms. Also, with the easing of restrictions and control on the establishment of educational institutions, India now has over 400 universities and more than 20,000 colleges, with a cumulative enrollment of about 12 million (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0276146712441003">MHRD 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0276146712441003">Thorat 2006</xref>). Caste-based quotas allow for up to 49 percent of seats in government-funded educational institutions and with the lifting of restrictions on private colleges and universities, the Indian education system now provides not only access but also inclusiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0276146712441003">Tilak 2004</xref>). However, the gross enrollment ratio, measured as the ratio of students aged 16 to 23 to the total population remains quite low at about 10 percent—far lower than the 20 percent to 90 percent range for developed countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0276146712441003">Mishra, Abidi and Sharma 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0276146712441003">Tilak 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>What was most interesting in India was that relatively slight changes in policy have led to tremendous incremental benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0276146712441003">Bhattacharya 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0276146712441003">Kohli 2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0276146712441003">Nayar 2001</xref>). The basic structure for a market economy was already present in India, though many of the actors and activities remained somewhat hidden from view in a large informal sector, partly due to restrictive government policies toward business establishment and operations as well as high rates of taxes through the latter half of the 1960s to the 1970s, and partly due to informal networks of trading and business that had existed for several centuries among specific communities. The size of this “black economy” was estimated variously from 20 percent of the GDP at market prices to as much as 51 percent of the GDP by various economists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0276146712441003">Kumar 1999</xref>). The consequent impact was that informal institutions for production, distribution, and exchange co-existed with formal and legal institutions. The net impacts of these were increased transaction costs, indirect taxes, and interest costs for industry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0276146712441003">Kumar 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>The fact that the government was not shy in participating in the economic sphere had ensured the establishment of at least a working industrial base. Despite observations of India as a socialist economy, government investments in the economy did not exceed 50 percent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0276146712441003">Kaushik 1997</xref>). A vast economic area was left for private development, and it was in sectors such as textiles, light machinery, light transportation vehicles, industrial components and parts, and wholesaling and retailing where private enterprises initially blossomed. Thus, entrepreneurship started emerging from the historic confines of caste (one caste, the <italic>vaishya</italic>, had been the predominant group engaging in trade and business) and large business families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0276146712441003">Iyer 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0276146712441003">2004</xref>). However, given cumbersome regulations and high rates of taxation until the 1980s, entrepreneurial activities remained small in scale and local in impact. With the pro-business and pro-economic growth changes in government policies, entrepreneurship is seen now in a variety of industrial and services sectors.</p>
<p>We contend that institutions necessary for the emergence of formal markets were already present in India by the time various policy reforms were undertaken in the 1980s and beyond. Large diversified business families co-existed with state-owned, or public, enterprises and small, often unregistered firms, engaging in trading or the manufacture of traditional products, such as handlooms, crafts, and potteries. Private property rights were strong and legal frameworks afforded protection of business dealings in the formal market sector. At the same time, strong reciprocal obligations undergirded business exchanges in all sectors of the economy, conducted as they were along kinship, identity and community lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0276146712441003">Iyer 1999</xref>). Thus, weaknesses in legal institutions, such as inordinate delays in clearing cases before courts, were overcome largely by the private ordering of transactions and enforcement of reputational sanctions (Iyer 1999; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0276146712441003">Landa 1981</xref>). Moreover, informal networks were often the primary sources of credit, business knowledge, and other necessary resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0276146712441003">Iyer 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Large business groups thrived and diversified over time, given access to formal sources of resources and acumen in dealing with India’s complex regulatory processes as well as changing political ideologies. Firms in manufacturing and distribution are often connected through community ties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0276146712441003">Iyer 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0276146712441003">2004</xref>), and distribution has historically been conducted by both large wholesalers and small retailers. Numerous small and often, unregistered, firms also engaged in manufacturing and trade. Their survival in the “hidden” economy depended on clever circumvention of bureaucratic rules and resource scarcity issues, as well as exploitation of market opportunities in the gray areas not explicitly covered by existing laws and regulations.</p>
<p>Much of the operations of the market were more readily seen after the gradual reforms of the 1980s and 1990s. Relaxation in licensing and other bureaucratic regulations brought forth an entrepreneurial dynamism that was historic in nature and far-reaching in scope. Existing businesses diversified into various areas, while new businesses emerged to take advantage of relaxation in the restrictions on policies covering private investments, licensing, and taxation. Moreover, international trade was facilitated with easing of restrictions on import controls, tariffs, and duties as well as state encouragement of exports through incentives and financing.</p>
<p>India’s small, localized, and fragmented markets, while not affording appropriate economies of scale for large business, were a boon to a plethora of entrepreneurs who sprung up to take advantage of the voids in production, distribution, and transaction facilitation. Small entrepreneurs who recognize such market opportunities today provide numerous products and services for local markets. Also, while competition among branded goods are more common for modern products, the reputation of the provider or the merchant served the same functions as would a brand for various traditional products and services, including small-scale retailing, jewelry, tailoring, and agricultural and farm products.</p>
<p>Thus, it could be argued that a vast majority of reforms undertaken in India, though not appearing to be part of a broad strategic plan, had beneficial impacts on the formalization of markets and business practices, creating entrepreneurs and enabling innovations, and intensifying the positive effects of free market competition among large and small firms.</p>

<sec id="section9-0276146712441003">
<title>Some Industry Examples</title>
<p>In the preceding sections, it was argued that while infrastructure in India is largely undeveloped, market institutions were relatively well developed, with unique and creative responses to assuring low-scale production, distribution and facilitating transactions. For example, despite intermittent power supply and bottlenecks in transportation and related infrastructure, the diamond cutting and polishing industry in Surat, Gujarat, is now considered the world’s largest. Labor-intensive, it uses smaller power tools run by generators and relies on <italic>angadias</italic>, indigenous couriers who can be trusted even with high-value gems. Similarly, the Indian business process outsourcing and information technology industry developed despite inadequate infrastructure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0276146712441003">Ahluwalia 2002</xref>). The lack of an appropriate consumer base (IT industry) or resources (diamonds) led these industries to rely initially on export markets for their products and services before serving the domestic market.</p>
<p>The IT industry’s export growth can be explained by the fact that demand for IT services personnel in advanced countries outstripped the supply of IT services personnel in these countries. Around 1980, firms such as Tata Consultancy Services started engaging in labor arbitrage by hiring surplus but highly skilled Indian IT services personnel and placing them in US firms for temporary assignments. Independent firms that helped US firms recruit IT engineers from India also complemented this business. Around the mid-1990s, both US firms and their Indian contractors realized that rather than hiring temporary IT personnel, they would be able to get work done in India at lower costs. Existing institutions as well as the lack of onerous restrictions in India facilitated such outsourcing growth. One major advantage for the Indian IT industry was the ready availability and surplus of highly skilled and talented graduates from Indian science and engineering colleges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0276146712441003">Kapur 2002</xref>). Another advantage was that the IT services industry did not require the high levels of infrastructure typically needed for manufacturing. Whatever infrastructure was required, such as constant power supply and transport for workers, were provided through private investments in generators and private bus services, respectively. But one of the main blessings for the IT industry since it was primarily a services industry, the historical and restrictive factory and labor laws did not largely apply. Moreover, the bureaucratic infrastructure could be bypassed as there were no licensing requirements for this industry and India had not developed sophisticated regulations and tax laws for the software industry. All that remained to be addressed was sparse telecommunications infrastructure, but the IT industry bypassed traditional landlines and relied on satellites. Thus, the IT industry capitalized on the basic institutions while relying on nontraditional and private investments in infrastructure. Only after the potential of this industry was realized and some of the firms grew into large businesses did the central and state governments start to provide better policy and infrastructure assistance and offer numerous incentives through the creation of special economic zones.</p>
<p>Similar growth took place in the diamond cutting and polishing industry, one of India’s largest exports. Initially, large conglomerates such as Tata Exports and large jewelers entered the diamond cutting industry by buying raw diamonds from firms such as De Beers and selling cut diamonds to Western markets. However, they were operating under onerous regulations that required multiple inspections and sign-off from a large number of government agencies that delayed the process and increased costs. The opportunity to sidestep cumbersome regulations and lower the costs of processing enabled several small-scale entrepreneurs, especially in the city of Surat, to enter and fill in the various institutional voids in small-scale production, processing, and transportation. An informal network of firms soon developed, resembling somewhat the industrial clusters in the West. Knowledge, credit, financing, and other business assistance were readily exchanged within this informal network and enabled India to grow and dominate the world trade in diamond cutting and polishing. Several cost-saving processes were employed, such as outsourcing to smaller facilities, some even confined to the jeweler’s house, making the industry price competitive. This strategy may also have helped circumvent manufacturing regulations and tax authority oversight. Also, <italic>angadia</italic> courier services offered personalized transportation to bypass the weak infrastructure. Thus, despite restrictive business regulations and weak infrastructure, diamond cutting became one of the largest export industries in India.</p>

<title>A Brief Prognosis for Market Evolution in India</title>
<p>While the recent pace of economic growth in India has surprised many observers, with some dubbing it a “miracle,” a historic analysis reveals that many of the institutions necessary for market evolution were already present in India. The trajectory of economic growth in India was stunted briefly in the late 1960s through the 1980s through policies of self-reliance and nationalization that, in retrospect, caused considerable damage to the overall economy. One consequence was that many of the economic institutions went underground into an abyss of market stagnation, inefficiency, and high transaction costs. However, current economic reforms have cut many of the shackles that had bound entrepreneurial zest, free market operations, and market-based competition. The beneficial impacts have been on the creation of a new entrepreneurial class, a growing middle class of consumers and development of human capabilities and social capital.</p>
<p>India stands as evidence to the fact that strong and vibrant institutions may be sufficient for establishing a reasonably effective market structure and achieving economic growth. However, despite the rosy scenario of Indian economic miracle, many of the vestiges of the past remain, including poverty, illiteracy, corruption, inefficient state-owned enterprises, migration and urban travails, a large mass of unorganized labor, and the lack of a good social security net. These political, social, and economic issues could potentially reduce the pace of India’s resurgence in the near future unless the underlying institutions are strengthened.</p>
<p>Poverty and illiteracy affect consumer welfare directly through reduced purchasing powers, uninformed decisions in the market and poor health, and indirectly through restricting capabilities for realizing human potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0276146712441003">Banerjee and Duflo 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0276146712441003">Sen 1999</xref>). Corruption may have been unavoidable to circumvent the government inefficiencies and the possibility of market failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0276146712441003">DeSoto 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0276146712441003">Leff 1964</xref>), but it detracts from free market operations, increases transaction costs, leads to various economic distortions, stunts economic development, and deters critically needed foreign direct investments (<italic>Economist</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0276146712441003"> 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0276146712441003">Shleifer and Vishny 1993</xref>). Much work needs to be done in making public state-owned enterprises more productive and efficient either through privatization or through direct market competition with private enterprises (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0276146712441003">Gupta 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0276146712441003">Panagriya 2008</xref>). Also, despite economic reforms, international trade and FDI flows are still not at par with the economic optimism that prevails within India.</p>
<p>The Indian economic resurgence has been through improvisation of its existing strong institutional base, despite weak infrastructure and insufficient capital for investments. For formal market structures to evolve, many of these institutions need to be further strengthened. A focus must be on political institutions that are more transparent, economic institutions that favor free-market competition, legal institutions that are more expeditious, educational institutions that enhance capabilities, skills and consumer education, and social institutions that equalize opportunities. India’s recent economic resurgence has largely been as much through the pragmatic, though gradual economic reforms as through the resilience of its people and the improvisation of its entrepreneurs. It appears that a slight economic push goes a long way, judging by the fact that even gradual economic reforms have paid handsome growth dividends.</p>
