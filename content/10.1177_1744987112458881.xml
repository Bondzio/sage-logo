<p>Developments in smart technology and e-health intersect with increasingly aggressive treatment regimens for cancer. Approaches to treatments for some cancers are improving survival. For many people, cancer is a long-term condition which results in them living with the consequences of treatments provided at the onset and recurrence of cancer. Treatments for cancer are complex and may include surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and biological agents. In addition to treating the primary disease, these treatments also aim to reduce the risk of the cancer recurring in the future. For many patients the intensity of treatments, which reduce the risk of recurrence, can lead to long-term side effects.</p>
<p>Placing the patient experience at the centre of health services and helping patients to assume responsibility for self-care in order to keep control of their life is essential. Marrying the aesthetic attributes of care alongside the use of technology is a challenge facing healthcare providers. Furthermore, establishing whether the use of such technology is acceptable and helpful to the key stakeholders is important. A recent and extensive systematic review of smart technologies for older people identifies that while there are thousands of papers describing technology, these have not been validated to any extent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1744987112458881">Morris et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore the pace of development of smart technology is far in advance of knowledge about acceptability, utility and issues around implementation in ‘real time’. This paper by Milne et al., which seeks to validate the use of an online cancer support platform is therefore timely.</p>
<p>Promoting self-management and enhancing communication between the patient, family/carers and healthcare staff is a central tenet of the CanCare support system and these aspirations reflect the aims of good care. This paper presents a real-time account of the experiences of patients, family, friends and healthcare professionals. The key message from this paper is the need to integrate any such systems in the mainstream and ensure they do not lie outwith these. Engagement at individual, structural and organisation level is essential as is the recognition that establishing such technology is likely to increase the use of resources at least initially. In the current climate of fiscal constraint this may be challenging to support and justify across many countries even those traditionally ‘well resourced’.</p>
<p>This paper provides a frank account of the issues which arose and demonstrates how the initial enthusiasm of the staff dissipated amidst heavy and demanding workloads. Of particular note is the fact that patients valued the support of the researchers to use the system – emphasising the transactional nature of healthcare interactions. In this respect we have a long way to go. Technology will undoubtedly continue to develop and has significant potential. However, the development of technology needs vigorous testing to ensure it does enhance care in the real world with real people. Despite an increasingly IT-literate population the challenges faced by individuals and families who are dealing with illness demand we involve those who will use smart technologies from the outset. This is essential so we do not recreate the often-cited ‘theory - practice gap’ with a ‘smart technology - practice gap’.</p>
