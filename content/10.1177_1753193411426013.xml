<abstract>
<p>The purpose of this study was to determine whether a radial shaft fracture would decrease the protection provided to the posterior interosseous nerve by the pronation maneuver during posterolateral exploration. The position of the nerve in 14 cadaveric elbows, before and after a radial osteotomy, was determined using CT scans in full supination and full pronation after injection of the nerve with radio-opaque dye. The angle formed by the olecranon, radial head and posterior interosseous nerve, and the distance between the nerve and the most lateral aspect of the radial head were measured.Pronation increased the distance between the lateral radial head and the nerve by a mean of 6.5 mm (range 3.6–10.7). After radial osteotomy, the mean increase was 4.2 mm (range 1.0–8.3), difference 2.3 mm (<italic>p</italic> = 0.044, 95% CI 0.10 to 3.33). The posterolateral approach requires additional care in the presence of a radial shaft fracture, but pronation is still beneficial.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Fractures, complications of trauma and some other elbow conditions require an extensile exposure of the proximal radius. The posterolateral or Kocher approach, which uses the internervous plane between the anconeus and extensor carpi ulnaris (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753193411426013">Kocher, 1911</xref>), and the Thompson approach, between the extensor carpi radialis brevis and the extensor digitorum communis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1753193411426013">Thompson, 1918</xref>), are the two approaches favored by most surgeons, but are well known to place the posterior interosseous nerve (PIN) at risk of injury. The relation of the PIN to the classic approaches has already been defined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193411426013">Diliberti et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1753193411426013">Roidis et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1753193411426013">Witt and Kamineni, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1753193411426013">Witt et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>It has long been taught that pronation of the forearm during the approach reduces the risk of injury to the PIN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193411426013">Hoppenfeld and de Boer, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1753193411426013">Strachan and Ellis, 1971</xref>). We hypothesized that this effect would be decreased in the presence of a radial shaft fracture.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1753193411426013" sec-type="materials|methods">
<title>Materials and methods</title>
<p>Eighteen fresh-frozen cadaveric elbows that had no evidence of forearm or elbow surgery or trauma were thawed in a bath of normal saline at 30°C for testing. The PIN was opacified by exposing the radial nerve through an anterolateral approach above the elbow from proximal to distal to its bifurcation into the PIN and superficial radial nerve. The PIN was then gently injected with radiographic contrast medium with care taken to avoid extravasation. After injection the muscles, fascia and the skin were restored to their normal relationships and held in position with silk sutures for each layer.</p>
<p>Spiral CT scans of the elbows were obtained using a Philips Mx 8000 CT scanner. A jig was used to hold the elbow in one of three positions of forearm rotation (maximally supinated, neutral and maximally pronated) during each scan. Following an initial set of post-injection scans of each elbow in three positions, a radial osteotomy was created in the proximal third of the radial shaft after dissection of the area via a Thompson approach. The dissection was kept distal to the area of the radial head and neck. The skin and fascia overlying the approach for the osteotomy were also sutured in position with silk sutures for each layer. Repeat scans of each elbow in supination, neutral and pronation were obtained using the same protocol.</p>
<p>Data were collected from axial cuts of the elbow formatted with a slice thickness of 1 mm and interval of 2 mm. Measurements were taken manually from the images using the mouse-driven MPR (Multi-Purpose Reader) program provided with Marconi Mview software.</p>
<p>Three measurements were obtained at a standardized axial cut 4 mm distal to where the radial head could first be fully visualized. The measurements were performed in random order to avoid bias and the observer was not aware of whether the scan was before or after the osteotomy. Measurements taken were the distance between the lateral edge of the radial head and the PIN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753193411426013">Figure 1</xref>); the distance from the centre of the radial head to the PIN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753193411426013">Figure 2</xref>); and the angle formed by the PIN, the centre of the radial head, and the most posterior aspect of the olecranon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1753193411426013">Figure 3</xref>). Volume-rendered images were also obtained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1753193411426013">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1753193411426013">5</xref>). Because the shape of the radial head is rather elliptical, by using the software of the CT we adjusted the best match of a concentric circle on the periphery of the radial head. The point of tangency represents the point that the tangential line from the PIN meets the circle on the lateral side. That point was considered as the lateral edge of the radial head.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Injury to the PIN, whether transient or permanent, is a major potential complication of surgery involving the proximal radius. Based largely on a classic study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1753193411426013">Strachan and Ellis, 1971</xref>), surgeons have long been taught to pronate the forearm while performing a posterolateral approach to the radius to decrease the chance of injury to the PIN.</p>
<p>Acute fracture remains the most frequent indication for surgery on the proximal radius. Fracture produces a discontinuity between the proximal radius or radial head and the rest of the radius including the wrist, which is held in pronation to achieve the protective effect.The control group reproduced the phenomenon of the PIN moving anteromedially with pronation of the forearm. This effect was decreased by 34% after a proximal radial shaft osteotomy, which is consistent with there being less movement of the radial head, neck and attached supinator muscle, through which the PIN passes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1753193411426013">Thomas et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>In the classic study on this phenomenon by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1753193411426013">Strachan and Ellis (1971)</xref> the method of injecting specimens and X-raying 1-cm sections closely approximated the technique of CT scanning, but because this method destroys the specimen, a different elbow had to be used for each elbow position.We were able to use each elbow as its own control. It is difficult to determine the exact value for nerve excursion from the Strachan and Ellis study as the results are presented in a graphical format and it is unclear exactly which landmarks were used for measurement. They appear to report a nerve excursion from supination to pronation of 7.5 mm with a range of 2.5 to 14 mm, which is similar to our control group.</p>
<p>Other studies seeking to determine the safety of surgical approaches to the proximal radius have performed anatomical dissections. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1753193411426013">Tornetta et al. (1997)</xref>examined the distance from the elbow joint where the nerve crossed into the field of a standard Kocher (posterolateral) approach. The goal was to determine the safe proximal limit of plate application to the proximal radius. The approach was made with blind subperiosteal dissection with the forearm pronated. A 4-cm plate was placed on the proximal radius. Measurements were taken with the forearm in neutral. The average distance from the PIN to the plate was 5 mm. There were no nerve injuries detected in the 50 cadaveric elbows studied, and the authors concluded that the approach was safe with blind subperiosteal dissection provided that the forearm was pronated.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193411426013">Diliberti et al. (2000)</xref> sought to determine the dimensions of an area that could be safely exposed via a posterolateral approach to the proximal radius. Using a dissection model, they focused on how far distally the dissection could be safely extended. They found that the PIN crossed the radial shaft 33 mm from the elbow joint in supination, which increased to 52 mm with pronation. Pronating the forearm was seen to cause the nerve to become more parallel to the joint. The authors concluded that the approach was safer in pronation and only in that position would it be safe to place a typical AO plate on the proximal radius.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753193411426013">Kim et al. (1998)</xref> performed MRI scans of the nerves of the elbow with the forearm in pronation and supination as well as flexion and extension. However, they sought primarily to determine the optimal position for placing patients in an MRI scanner to give the clearest images of the nerves. The authors did not comment on any motion of the PIN as the cadaveric arms were repositioned, but noted that the median and radial nerve (including the PIN) were best imaged with the elbow extended and pronated.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1753193411426013">Mekhail et al. (1995)</xref> experimented with plate placement in the proximal radius with a cadaveric model. Plates were applied from Henry’s anterior approach, Thompson’s posterior approach, or a Gordon-Boyd approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193411426013">Boyd, 1940</xref>). The authors felt that the anterior approach was relatively safe and decreased the chance of a nerve injury compared with a Thompson’s approach.</p>
<p>Our study has some inherent limitations. It is generally difficult to simulate a fracture with an osteotomy. The variability in nerve movement in the osteotomy group, with a few specimens having nearly the same motion as before the osteotomy, may be a result of frictional contact between the bone ends that consequently moved as a unit. We feel it is unlikely that the surgical exposure used to create the osteotomy contributed to the change in PIN position on pronation, but CT imaging after making the approach and before creation of the osteotomy would be required to resolve this question. Our study used fresh-frozen cadaveric elbows which, although not as stiff as formalin-fixed specimens, may have been less pliable than the living tissues.</p>
<p>We chose to standardize measurement from the lateral edge of the radial head as referenced from the olecranon. This may not correspond to the exact plane of dissection of a Thompson or Kocher approach, however moving the nerve anteromedially should be protective whether the joint is approached posteriorly or posterolaterally.</p>
