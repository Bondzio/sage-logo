<p>This article seeks to extend and refine Alastair MacIntyre’s moral theory of virtue ethics, by probing behind the Benedictine Rule—so fulsomely invoked at the end of <italic>After Virtue</italic>—to the ascetical theology of the noted, Eastern, ‘Cappadocian’ theologian of the fourth century: Gregory of Nyssa. I shall argue that Gregory’s vision of ascetical bodily practice complicates MacIntyre’s contemporary appropriation of virtue ethics. It does so by underscoring the diachronic, developmental character of personal ethical maturation—a theme which finds no expression in MacIntyre’s otherwise sophisticated account of ‘narrative’.</p>

<body>
<p>In the final chapter of <italic>After Virtue</italic>, Alasdair MacIntyre draws a comparison between the contemporary political and ethical <italic>aporiai</italic> in Europe and North America, with their impoverished commitments to liberal individualism, and ‘the epoch in which the Roman empire declined into the Dark ages’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0953946813484406">1</xref></sup> In the case of the former, liberal society—on MacIntyre’s reading—is rent by moral controversies that cannot be resolved because no rational justification can be proffered for claiming that an action is objectively good or bad. All that remains, as the emotivists saw, are subjective assertions of preference. Dismissing ‘Marxist socialism’ as an unviable solution to the contemporary predicament,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0953946813484406">2</xref></sup> MacIntyre calls at the end of his study for ‘the construction of new forms of community within which civility and the intellectual and moral life can be sustained through the new dark ages which are already upon us’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0953946813484406">3</xref></sup> He ends with the oft-quoted remark that we await ‘another—doubtless very different—St Benedict’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0953946813484406">4</xref></sup> who will re-install ‘the tradition of the virtues’ in our age.</p>
<p>MacIntyre’s portrayal of ‘virtue’ in <italic>After Virtue</italic> relies on a variety of related concepts. It is, first and foremost, underpinned by the category of ‘practice’. MacIntyre situates ‘practice’ (and indeed, by the end of his study, the Benedictine Rule) within an Aristotelian concept of morality in which a person has an objective <italic>telos</italic> towards moral excellence in the pursuit of virtue—a view which, on MacIntyre’s genealogical account of moral decline in Western ethical discourse, was rejected by post-Enlightenment philosophers who regarded human beings not as creatures with definite functions or ends, but as agents who possess no purpose apart from that created by their own will. Having thus arrived at the concept of <italic>telos</italic>, MacIntyre proceeds to define ‘virtues’ as ‘dispositions’ that ‘sustain practices and enable us to achieve the goods internal to practices’ and that ‘sustain us in the relevant kind of quest for the good’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0953946813484406">5</xref></sup> Crucially—for our present purposes—MacIntyre frames ‘practice’ within an account of ‘narrative’, in which the medieval concept of ‘quest’, mentioned above, is subsumed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0953946813484406">6</xref></sup> MacIntyre’s appeal to ‘narrative’ underscores the Aristotelian functional teleology to which he subscribes and also serves to highlight the communal dimension to individual practices.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the sophistication and insight with which MacIntyre contours his theory of virtue ethics, it is the burden of this essay to argue that his account of ‘narrative’ is deficient in at least one respect, by failing to develop a theory of individual ethical maturation. There is, in other words, no consideration in MacIntyre’s thought of the progressive acquisition and fruition of virtues within an individual moral agent over the course of time. It is no coincidence that Benedict, whom MacIntyre invokes so fulsomely at the end of his study, developed, according to R. W. Southern, ‘no <italic>theory</italic> of the spiritual growth of the <italic>individual</italic>’, but rather a blueprint of almost completely untheorised day-to-day practices for a community under an Abbot, designed to help it perfect its goal of Christian love and imitation of Christ.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0953946813484406">7</xref></sup> For in neither Benedict nor MacIntyre does the theme of individual ethical maturation make an appearance.</p>
<p>In what follows, I shall probe behind Benedict to Gregory of Nyssa (c. 330–395)—the noted, Eastern, ‘Cappadocian’ theologian of the late fourth century—whose teaching on spiritual and ethical maturation influenced Western thinking via Evagrius of Pontus<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0953946813484406">8</xref></sup> and John Cassian, but whose theory of individual ethical diachronicity had no apparent influence upon the Benedictine Rule to which MacIntyre appeals. My aim is to reprise the theme of diachronicity from Gregory’s ascetical theology, in order to support the hypothesis that there can be no virtue ethics without an accompanying theory of individual ethical maturation. In doing so, I shall show that Gregory refines notions of corporeality and <italic>askesis</italic> for ethics in a way that has been overlooked by MacIntyre’s almost mantric and (some have said) ‘implicitly Pelagian’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0953946813484406">9</xref></sup> appeal to ‘practice’, and presents a more diachronically theorised account of transformation in his ‘theological anthropology’.</p>
<p>A brief overview of MacIntyre’s construal of ‘narrative’ is in order first. Only then will it be possible to show how an account of individual ethical maturation, resourced from Gregory of Nyssa’s ascetical vision, adds a layer of complexity and richness to MacIntyre’s theory of virtue ethics.</p>
<sec id="section1-0953946813484406">
<title>MacIntyre’s Construal of ‘Narrative’</title>
<p>In <italic>After Virtue</italic>, the concept of ‘narrative’ is employed in two significant ways: it refers to the history of an individual human life as well as the historically inflected moral tradition to which she belongs.</p>
<p>Firstly, ‘narrative’ is used by MacIntyre to highlight the personal identity of the moral subject as ‘a story-telling animal’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0953946813484406">10</xref></sup> He insists that the personal narrative of one’s life, though composed of individual acts, comprises an intelligible sequence in which personal identity is preserved. Ideas such as ‘narrative’, ‘intelligibility’ and ‘accountability’, he remarks, necessarily presuppose ‘the applicability of the concept of personal identity, just as it presupposes their applicability and just as indeed each of these three presupposes the applicability of the two others’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0953946813484406">11</xref></sup> In this way, MacIntyre’s invocation of narrative, as understood from the perspective of the individual ‘story-telling animal’, is intended to counter the thought of Jean-Paul Sartre and Erwin Goffman whose efforts to disarticulate particular actions from their narrative context produce—in MacInyre’s judgement—‘a self…[that] can have no history’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0953946813484406">12</xref></sup> For MacIntyre, however: ‘the story of my life is always embedded in the story of those communities from which I derive my identity… [t]he possession of an historical identity and the possession of a social identity coincide’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0953946813484406">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>MacInyre’s insistence on the embeddedness of the self in a ‘social identity’ also inexorably leads him to viewing one’s life according to Aristotelian categories, as indeed I have already intimated in the introduction: it is a life oriented, by virtue of the coherence and intelligibility of its narrative, towards a particular <italic>telos</italic>. To define narrative as an intelligible sequence of actions in which the present is always ‘informed by some image of some future’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0953946813484406">14</xref></sup> is to suggest that human life is inexorably teleological.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0953946813484406">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the second of MacIntyre’s two applications of ‘narrative’, the term refers to the history of a community in which the individual moral agent participates. Practices, he writes, are ‘embedded in and made intelligible in terms of the larger and longer history of the tradition through which the practice in its present form was conveyed to us’ just as, and indeed precisely because, the history of each individual life is ‘embedded in and made intelligible in terms of the larger and longer histories of a number of traditions’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0953946813484406">16</xref></sup> Furthermore, the community, <italic>qua</italic> a moral ‘tradition’, imbues virtuous practices with intelligibility. As such, the moral agent’s intentions are placed ‘in causal and temporal order with reference to their role in his or her history’ and ‘with reference to their role in the history of the setting or settings to which they belong’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0953946813484406">17</xref></sup> Tradition, for MacIntyre, also provides the moral agent with a site of moral anchorage, by supplying the context within which virtuous practices are acquired and fortified. In this respect, the acquisition of virtues sustains ‘those traditions which provide both practices and individual lives with their necessary historical context’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0953946813484406">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>By emphasising the communal dimension to practice, MacIntyre is reacting against the spectre of Nietzsche’s <italic>Übermensch—</italic>‘the great man’—who ‘cannot enter into relationships mediated by appeal to shared standards or virtues or goods’. He is ‘his own only authority’ so that ‘his relationships to others have to be exercises of that authority’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0953946813484406">19</xref></sup> MacIntyre seeks instead to disentangle ethics from the ‘isolation’ and ‘self-absorption’ of the <italic>Übermensch</italic> who constructs himself as a ‘self-sufficient moral authority’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0953946813484406">20</xref></sup> and to re-situate practices within a community, a moral tradition.</p>
<p>Despite MacIntyre’s consideration of the narrative of one’s individual life as well as its communal location, there is surprisingly little consideration of the <italic>diachronic</italic> character of <italic>individual</italic> ethical transformation. MacIntyre’s riposte against liberal individualism in which he concertedly underscores the ‘socially established’ aspects of ‘cooperative human activity’ is so overriding that his definition of ‘practice’ is completely bereft of even the slightest allusion to individual moral growth.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0953946813484406">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is to this theme of diachronicity in individual moral maturation that I shall turn in this essay by exploring the ascetical theology of Gregory of Nyssa. But first, I shall offer a cursory outline of Gregory’s (unsystematically presented) ‘moral theory’ before elucidating his description of the transformative potency of the body. With these insights firmly in place, I shall then explicate Gregory’s theory of diachronic ethical maturation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0953946813484406">
<title>Gregory’s Moral Theory</title>
<p>Although Gregory does not develop a consciously systematic ‘ethic’ as such, his moral exhortations presuppose a sophisticated theory of virtue. Several ideas, enumerated below, are key to understanding that theory of virtue.</p>
<p>In the first instance, for Gregory, all the virtues are inexorably connected so that ‘where one … is present, the others will necessarily follow’ (<italic>De virginitate</italic> XV:2:17-18)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0953946813484406">22</xref></sup> and conversely where one virtue is removed, the others are also eliminated. This is a common theme in ancient philosophy,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0953946813484406">23</xref></sup> termed ‘the reciprocity of the virtues’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0953946813484406">24</xref></sup> in which virtues are thought to be reciprocal but not identical.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0953946813484406">25</xref></sup> The corollary of this doctrine is that one’s life, in its pursuit of virtue, must at all times be a unified endeavour; <italic>all</italic> vice, no matter its species or its gravity, must be rejected and all virtue, strived for (<italic>De virginitate</italic> VI-VII).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0953946813484406">26</xref></sup> To compromise on one virtue, in other words, is to compromise the entire pursuit of the life of virtue.</p>
<p>In the second instance, there is—in Gregory’s mind—no end to ‘the perfection of human nature’ (<italic>De vita Moysis</italic> I:10),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0953946813484406">27</xref></sup> ‘no stopping place’ (<italic>De vita Moysis</italic> I:7)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0953946813484406">28</xref></sup> in the pursuit of virtue, because ‘divine nature’ is ‘unlimited and infinite’ and ‘whoever pursues true virtues participates in nothing other than God, because he is himself absolute virtue’ (<italic>De vita Moysis</italic> I:7).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0953946813484406">29</xref></sup> The theme of eternal progress in spiritual ascent, within which the endless accruement of the virtues is a constitutive part, was famously termed <italic>epektasis</italic> (l’épectase) by Jean Daniélou.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0953946813484406">30</xref></sup> The substantive ἐπέκτασιϚ derives from the verb ἐπεκτείνειν (‘to strain forth’) which appears in participle form in Phil. 3:13 (<italic>De vita Moysis</italic> 1:5).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0953946813484406">31</xref></sup> While the term enjoys unchallenged popularity in twentieth-century scholarship and has been reified as a ‘doctrine’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0953946813484406">32</xref></sup> it is important to note that the substantive ἐπέκτασιϚ is not used with any precision by Gregory or, indeed, with any notable regularity.</p>
<p>In the third instance, Gregory’s moral theory rests upon the Aristotelian construal of virtue as the middle path, the mean, between two extremes (<italic>Ethica Nicomachea</italic> 1107a:7-8 [Book II:6-7]).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0953946813484406">33</xref></sup> To this, Gregory adds the medical notion of the ‘equilibrium’ (soκράteiα) ἰof the elements of which human beings are composed—an idea he borrows from the physician, Alcmaeon of Crotona.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0953946813484406">34</xref></sup> In the specific case of sexual self-restraint Gregory condemns those who despise virginity as well as those who condemn marriage, and instead exhorts his readers to find the middle ground between excess and deficiency in the practice of temperance (<italic>De virginitate</italic> VII:2:1-29 cf. <italic>De vita Moysis</italic> II:288).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0953946813484406">35</xref></sup> Extreme asceticism which ‘incline[s] towards toil and the wearing out of the flesh’ (XXII:1:8-9)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0953946813484406">36</xref></sup> is condemned by Gregory, for whom one’s concentrations should be directed towards ‘the efficient working of the instruments of the soul’ rather than ‘the suffering of the body’ (XXII:2:25-28).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0953946813484406">37</xref></sup> The essential distinction upon which Gregory’s moral theory rests is between morally legitimate ‘need’ (χρεία) and ‘satiety’ (κόρoς); greed reigns supreme when the latter is (delusively) regarded as a kind of ‘necessity’ (ἀνάγκη) (<italic>De virginitate</italic> X:2:8-10; cf. <italic>De beatitudinibus Patrologiae Cursus Completus, Series Graeca</italic> [hereafter <italic>PG</italic>] 44 1237:24-28).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0953946813484406">38</xref></sup> The virtuous person, the true ascetic, therefore opposes the conflation of ‘necessity’ and ‘satiety’, partaking instead of ‘the requirements of life only as far as necessary’ and thereby refusing to be ‘softened by the luxuries of the body’ (<italic>De oratione dominica</italic> III:254:10-3).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0953946813484406">39</xref></sup> At the same time, however, as we have seen, such a person also supplies the needs of the body so that she may not cause detriment to her own bodily health.</p>
<p>Thus far, I have spoken of ‘ascetical practices’ without offering a definition of the expression. By it, I intend to encompass a variety of practices extolled by Gregory (though not in a systematic, delineated fashion) for their capacity to stave off sin and inculcate virtue. They include: fasting, chastity—which includes virginity as a lifelong or temporary undertaking,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0953946813484406">40</xref></sup> as well as ‘moderate’ and ‘measured’ sexual activity in marriage (<italic>De virginitate</italic> VII:3:5-7;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0953946813484406">41</xref></sup> cf. VIII:1:17-19)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0953946813484406">42</xref></sup>—and the renunciation of wealth, fame and worldly honour. It is worth underscoring the centrality of the care of the poor to which these practices are often ultimately directed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0953946813484406">43</xref></sup> Fasting, the ‘foundation of virtue’ (<italic>De beneficentia Gregorii Nysseni Opera</italic> [hereafter <italic>GNO</italic>] IX 95:17-18)—as well as the practice of dietary ‘moderation’ (σύµµετρος) in matters of food (<italic>GNO</italic> IX 104:9) and wine (<italic>GNO</italic> IX 95:6-7) which seems in the case of the former to have included abstention from ‘meat’ (κρέας) (<italic>GNO</italic> IX 93:20)—is pre-eminently intended to feed the poor out of the plenty one has (<italic>GNO</italic> IX 97:9-16). And the renunciation of wealth carries with it an attitude of detachment from material pleasures and inculcates generosity of heart, whereas the accruement of personal wealth deprives others of their <italic>genuine</italic> χρeία (<italic>De oratione</italic> dominica 284:4-9, cf. <italic>De beatitudinibus PG</italic> 44 1196:42-48; <italic>De beneficentia GNO</italic> IX 102:14-103:4; 106:1-18).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0953946813484406">44</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is also important to highlight the centrality of the reciprocity of the virtues in Gregory’s ascetical vision, for it necessarily entails that no single ascetical practice is sufficient by itself. In the case of fasting, for instance, abstinence from food is meaningless unless accompanied by acts of charity (<italic>De beneficentia GNO</italic> IX 94:6-12).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0953946813484406">45</xref></sup> In the case of virginity, sexual continence is regarded by Gregory as ‘the foundation for the life of virtue’ so that ‘<italic>all</italic> the products of virtue’ may be built upon it (<italic>De virginitate</italic> XVIII:1:27-29).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0953946813484406">46</xref></sup> In other words, in order to align ‘one’s <italic>whole</italic> life’ (XVIII:1:32)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0953946813484406">47</xref></sup> to virtue, the entire cohort of ascetical practices must work together in concert.</p>
<p>Having briefly outlined the salient features of Gregory’s moral vision, we now turn to the theme of bodily transformation, seeking to understand the moral efficacy of ascetical practices in Gregory’s thought.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0953946813484406">
<title>Ascetical Bodily Transformation</title>
<p>Two related ideas are key to understanding why Gregory regards ascetical practice as the pre-eminent means of moral transformation. On the one hand, ‘the body of <italic>sin</italic>’ (Rom. 6:6; emphasis mine) or ‘the flesh’ (Rom. 8:6, 16; Gal. 5:17)—in the Pauline sense—is the locus of human rebellion against God. On the other hand, indeed precisely for this reason, the body is able to overcome passion through <italic>bodily</italic>, ascetical practices. The battle against disordered desire, in other words, must be fought and won in the body itself—only here and nowhere else.</p>
<p>The body’s ability to overcome moral disorder is vividly portrayed in the <italic>De beatitudinibus</italic>, in which Gregory recounts the raging spiritual battle heroically fought by Paul against the Devil:
<disp-quote>
<p>You know very well the adversary who fights through the flesh, and whom he [Paul] chastises by his boxing skill. He scratches him with the nails of continence, he mortifies his limbs by hunger and thirst, by cold and nakedness, he inflicts on him the marks of the Lord (<italic>PG</italic> 44 1212:55-1213:2).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0953946813484406">48</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Elsewhere, and later, in the De vita Moysis, Gregory claims that the life of virginity ‘chastises the flesh [σάρξ]’ (II:187)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0953946813484406">49</xref></sup>—echoing Paul in 1 Cor. 9:27—because as a ‘rough’ exercise in self-control, it is able to consume ‘the habitual passions’ (II:187).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0953946813484406">50</xref></sup> Sexual continence, an arduous—indeed, at times, testing—bodily undertaking, is presented here as a potent exercise in ascetical self-restraint capable of defeating the sinful rebellion of the flesh.</p>
<p>Gregory’s description of the corporeal battle ground upon which the Devil is fought and defeated is intrinsically related, as I have already indicated, to the body’s entanglement in sin. In the <italic>In Sanctum Pascha</italic>, Gregory remarks that the body, though ‘little’, is ‘found to be responsible for most sins’. What is more—and in the same breath—he avers that ‘[i]t bears also the pains of virtue, and is embroiled in the struggles for good, being cut with iron and burned with fire and flayed with whips and loaded with vexatious shackles and suffering every outrage in order not to betray the sacred philosophy, as if it were a city of fine towers encircled by the hostile power of evil’ (<italic>GNO</italic> IX/1 267:24–268:5).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0953946813484406">51</xref></sup> In the <italic>De sancto Theodoro</italic>, corporeality is described as the ‘deserving and immaculate vehicle’ of ‘incorruptibility’, ‘an inestimable treasure’ that prefigures its own restoration in ‘the time of regeneration’, precisely because, at the <italic>eschaton</italic>, it will be disentangled from ‘its <italic>own</italic> passions’ (<italic>De sancto Theodoro PG</italic> 46 737:27-33; emphasis mine).</p>
<p>So, to sum up: Gregory regards the transformative potentiality of the body as the reverse aspect of its collaboration with passion. Only <italic>because of</italic> its intimacy with sin, in other words, can the body be regarded as the pre-eminent <italic>locus</italic> of ethical transformation. But the process of bodily transformation is incomplete in a pre-eschatological context in which sin continues to be a factor to contend with (<italic>De vita Moysis</italic> II:277).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0953946813484406">52</xref></sup> Bodily transformation reaches competition, as Gregory intimates above, at the resurrection, the point at which true integration between body and soul is finally and definitively achieved, a view enunciated explicitly in the <italic>In Canticum canticorum</italic> (<italic>GNO</italic> VI 30:10-12; 14-20).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0953946813484406">53</xref></sup></p>
<p>As this juncture, we may wonder <italic>why</italic> the body bears moral culpability for sin in the way Gregory suggests. The underlying presumption is that bodily <italic>sensation</italic>, if left untransformed, gives disordered passions entry into the soul (<italic>De oratione dominica</italic> V 304:3-19, 24-25; cf. <italic>De beatitudinibus PG</italic> 44 1297:3-7).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0953946813484406">54</xref></sup> But this fact alone should not lead us to presume that Gregory is intent on disarticulating the body from the soul so that the former is regarded as singularly culpable for sin.

<p>There is no division of the soul from the body when it practises theft or commits burglary, nor again does it by itself give bread to the hungry or drink to the thirsty or hasten unhesitatingly to the prison to care for the one afflicted by imprisonment, but for every action the two assist each other and cooperate in the things that are done (<italic>GNO</italic> IX/1 267:1-7).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0953946813484406">55</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The view expressed here—that both body and soul are equally complicit in evil—appears in various texts in Gregory’s oeuvre in which he insists that the contemplation of God requires purity in both soul and body (<italic>De vita Moysis</italic> II:153; cf. <italic>De instituto Christiano GNO</italic> VIII/1 43:8-9; 54:20-55:18).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0953946813484406">56</xref></sup> This is supported in Gregory’s thought by a variety of scriptural passages: Moses’ exhortation in Exod. 10:15 to the Israelites to keep themselves from all ‘defilements’ (I:42),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0953946813484406">57</xref></sup> Paul’s summons to virginal purity in 1 Cor. 7:34 (<italic>De instituto Christiano GNO</italic> VIII/1 49:13-5)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0953946813484406">58</xref></sup> and 1 Thess. 5:23 in which mention is made of ‘body and soul and spirit’ (<italic>De perfectione GNO</italic> VIII/1 212:22–213:1).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-0953946813484406">59</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although much here echoes the thought of Plato,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-0953946813484406">60</xref></sup> for whom irrational impulses are attributed to both body (<italic>Phaedo</italic> 66C)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-0953946813484406">61</xref></sup> and soul (<italic>Respublica</italic> 430E–431A),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-0953946813484406">62</xref></sup> it is also ultimately sustained by Gregory’s <italic>Christian</italic> conviction that the body and soul are created <italic>in simul</italic>. Having established that both body and soul are ‘simultaneously brought into life’, Gregory argues that both are fed with the same form of nourishment, that is, ‘purity, a good scent, and whatever else the virtues bring forth abundantly’ (<italic>In Canticum canticorum GNO</italic> VI 241:4-8).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-0953946813484406">63</xref></sup> Because body and soul are created <italic>in simul</italic>, they are, in other words, equally and indivisibly implicated in the contamination of evil; they are also, concomitantly, implicated in the process of sanctification, so that by disciplining the flesh through ascetical practices, virtue is inculcated into the soul.</p>
<p>The high regard in which ascetical practices are held by Gregory is also related to his deep reflections on Paul’s subtle understanding of the ambiguity of ‘bodily’ life, poised between negative ‘fleshly’/’bodily’ sins and communal, ‘bodily’ transformation into Christ.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-0953946813484406">64</xref></sup> Gregory follows Paul’s distinction between living ‘in the flesh’ (ἐν σαρκὶ) and living ‘<italic>according to</italic> the flesh’ (κατὰ σάρκα) (Rom. 8:12) so that corporeality <italic>as such</italic> is not ‘mistrusted’ (as Peter Brown has argued)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-0953946813484406">65</xref></sup> but affirmed in its created malleability and lability to divine transformation.</p>
<p>The distinction outlined in Rom. 8:12 is particularly borne out in the <italic>De perfectione</italic>. In one passage, Gregory explains that the Christian life must be conformed to ‘the image of the invisible God’, a reference to Col. 1:15. He defines the ‘example’ (ὑπόδειγµα) of Christ as living ἐν σαρκὶ (the unavoidable corollary of the incarnation) but µὴ κατὰ σάρκα (GNO VIII/1 195:5-9).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-0953946813484406">66</xref></sup> Gregory goes on to say that although Christ was tempted by sin because of the similarity of his nature to ours, he did not commit sin. For Christians, then, the life of Christ, a life fraught with temptation but not sin, represents the life that all Christians are called to follow, even if theirs, ultimately, cannot be impeccable from start to finish.</p>
<p>In the fourth <italic>Homily</italic> of the <italic>In canticum Canticorum</italic>, Gregory also distinguishes between ἐn σαρκὶ and κατὰ σάρκα (<italic>GNO</italic> VI 134:14-5).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-0953946813484406">67</xref></sup> In this context, he is talking not of present embodied existence, but the resurrection, which he regards as ἐν σαρκὶ.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-0953946813484406">68</xref></sup> The word σάρξ does not here denote moral disorder but redeemed, incorruptible corporeality,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69-0953946813484406">69</xref></sup> no longer governed by the rebellion of σάρξ against God.</p>
<p>The sentiments of Rom. 8:12 are reiterated in a variety of other contexts in Gregory’s oeuvre. Here, we find that other Pauline texts are appealed to.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn70-0953946813484406">70</xref></sup> In the <italic>De perfectione</italic>, for instance, Gregory refers to the ‘elements at variance within us’, the war that rages between ‘flesh’ (σάρξ) and ‘spirit’ (πυεῦµα). Citing Gal. 5:17,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn71-0953946813484406">71</xref></sup> he explains that a life of peace can only be sought once ‘the spirit of the flesh’ (τÒ… πνεῦµα κατὰ τῆς σαρκός) is subjected to ‘divine law’ (<italic>GNO</italic> VIII/1 184:14-5).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn72-0953946813484406">72</xref></sup> In this passage, Gregory alludes to Gal. 5:17 but substitutes σάρξ with τÒ πνεῦµα κατὰ τῆς σαρκός, echoing Rom. 8:6: ‘The mind [φρόνηµα] of the flesh [σάρξ] is death’. It is also significant that Gregory elsewhere in the same work—and under the influence of Rom. 8:7—insists that σάρξ should be ‘sacrificed according to the law of the spirit’ so that ‘the will of God to be displayed in it’ (GNO VIII/1 187:1-3).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn73-0953946813484406">73</xref></sup> In neither passage is there any indication that Gregory thinks that σάρξ will be eliminated. On the contrary, its continued preservation is clearly presupposed when Gregory claims that the will of God will be manifest ‘in it’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn74-0953946813484406">74</xref></sup> The expression of the divine will in humanity requires corporeality so that σάρξ can become the vehicle of divine transformation.</p>
<p>In the tenth Homily of the In Canticum canticorum, one finds a particularly vivid rendition of these same sentiments. Gregory claims—as in the De perfection—that σάρξ must be ‘subservient and docile in obedience to the Spirit’s rule’ in order to function as the indispensible instrument of God’s will, ‘a well-disposed minister’ (<italic>In Canticum canticorum GNO</italic> VI 298:8-9). Once it has adopted such a role, the opposition between flesh and spirit is finally annihilated: ‘the prudence of the flesh can no longer resist the Spirit (having been mortified, the flesh cannot be in opposition)’ (<italic>GNO</italic> VI 298:5-7).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn75-0953946813484406">75</xref></sup> The opposition that Gregory has in mind here is that of Gal. 5:17—‘the flesh lusts against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh’—which, for Gregory, is overcome through ascetical acts of mortification.</p>
<p>In this brief section on embodiment and fleshly disorder, we have traced the outworking of Rom. 8:12 in Gregory’s reflections on moral transformation. Corporeality, we have seen, is enabled through its obedience to God in ascetical practice to become an indispensible vehicle of spiritual and ascetical transformation. But there is a further layer of reasoning in Gregory’s thought to which we must now attend, if briefly: one of the reasons why the body is deeply problematic—whilst also capable of the most profound transformation—is because the body and the mind mature at different rates.</p>
<p>In the <italic>In Ecclesiasten</italic>, Gregory argues that bodily ‘sensation’ (αἴσθησις) is ‘part of our nature from birth’ whereas ‘the mind [νοῦς] waits for a proper age to be reached, to be able to reveal itself gradually in the person’. For this reason, ‘the mind, which develops slowly, is … dominated by the sense, which is complete, and by compulsion grows habituated to the perpetual superiority, so that it submits to sense, judging good or bad according to whatever sense selects or rejects’. In this light, the reason why the ‘discernment of the true good’ is an arduous undertaking is because human beings are ‘prejudiced by sensual criteria’. They, therefore, end up defining what is good in light of what is ‘enjoyable and pleasant’ according to the criteria of bodily, not spiritual, sensation (<italic>GNO</italic> V 419:16–420:3).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn76-0953946813484406">76</xref></sup></p>
<p>Before we explore the theme of diachronicity in Gregory’s ascetical theology, it is incumbent upon us to ward off the suggestion that Gregory is advocating a purely Pelagian account of moral transformation, perhaps in much the same way MacIntyre’s theory of virtue ethics fails to account for the indispensability of divine aid in the attainment of virtue. Gregory’s description of the convergent activities of grace and works through προαίρεσις (‘free will’) may (though rather anachronistically<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn77-0953946813484406">77</xref></sup>) be approximated to the heresy of ‘Semi-Pelagianism’ but it has been rather more accurately termed ‘synergia’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn78-0953946813484406">78</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is clear that for Gregory no spiritual advancement can be accomplished without the gift of grace: human beings need the power of the Spirit to fight against evil since human effort and virtue are unable, in and of themselves, to cleanse the soul (<italic>De instituto Christiano GNO</italic> VIII/1 54:13-16),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn79-0953946813484406">79</xref></sup> and virtue is itself, Gregory remarks, a witness to the divine power, which is the cause of all human goodness (<italic>De oratione dominica</italic> 256:4-7).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn80-0953946813484406">80</xref></sup></p>
<p>On various occasions, Gregory avers that human initiative comes first, with grace emerging later to consolidate and collaborate with this initial movement. He claims, for example, that ‘the grace of the Holy Spirit’ is bestowed upon ‘those who are worthy’ (<italic>De vita Moysis</italic> II:121),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn81-0953946813484406">81</xref></sup> those who are <italic>already</italic> undertaking ‘the life of virtue’ (<italic>De vita Moysis</italic> II:44;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn82-0953946813484406">82</xref></sup> cf. <italic>De instituto Christiano GNO</italic> VIII/1 46:25–47:4; 47:7-11;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn83-0953946813484406">83</xref></sup> <italic>De instituto Christiano GNO</italic> VIII/1 57:13-5).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn84-0953946813484406">84</xref></sup> However, this must be counterpoised against another strand of thought: Gregory’s insistence that the human capacity to choose God is itself God-given—a point to which he appeals in the <italic>De instituto Christiano</italic> to condemn those who are tempted to excuse their ‘lack of zeal for fair deeds’. God, Gregory says, shows his love and goodness ‘as something rich and poured out like water upon all’ and ‘He furnishes to each person according to his will the ability to do something good’ so that ‘none of those eager to be saved is lacking in this ability’ (<italic>De instituto Christiano GNO</italic> VIII/1 87:19–88:4).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn85-0953946813484406">85</xref></sup> Gregory is also emphatic that ascetical practices are not to be regarded as a personal, human achievement; they are to be seen rather as ‘the flowers of labours and the fruits of the Spirit’ (<italic>GNO</italic> VIII/1 84:9-10).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn86-0953946813484406">86</xref></sup> Christian progress, in other words, is achieved jointly through ‘good discipline and the gift of the Spirit to the measure of the age of reason’ (<italic>GNO</italic> VIII/1 86:4-5)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn87-0953946813484406">87</xref></sup>—another attestation to the diachronic transformation of one’s life.</p>
<p>Now that we have ascertained the indispensability of divine aid in ascetical growth<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn88-0953946813484406">88</xref></sup> and seen how important the body is for Gregory in the process of moral transformation, we now turn to consider the specifically <italic>diachronic</italic> nature of spiritual growth—a theme of supreme significance for the maturation of ethical virtue.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0953946813484406">
<title>Ascetical Growth—A Diachronic Process of Maturation</title>
<p>Thus far in this essay, there have been two intimations of the theme of diachronicity: in the <italic>De instituto Christiano</italic> we saw that the gradual outpouring of the Holy Spirit on the soul was dependent upon the soul’s ‘age of reason’; the second reference to diachronicity was embedded in Gregory’s anthropological reflections in the <italic>In Ecclesiasten</italic> in which he reveals a disparity in the rate of maturation between the mind and the body. In this section, we will develop these points further, by offering a focused examination of the way in which Gregory schematises the Solomonic corpus according to the soul’s spiritual maturity.</p>
<p>First and foremost, however, before we proceed with this undertaking, it is worth noting that when Gregory speaks of various degrees or stages in spiritual maturity, these must be regarded not as clearly delineated stages of a rigidly successive sort, but of ‘moments in the soul’s approach to God’ (A. Louth)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn89-0953946813484406">89</xref></sup> or permanent markers of endless progress in ascent (L. Bouyer).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn90-0953946813484406">90</xref></sup> We must bear this firmly in mind when we consider how different parts of Scripture nurture and elicit different types of spiritual desire, being suited to Christians at different levels of spiritual and ascetical maturity. Following Origen (who in turn was influenced by the early rabbis),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn91-0953946813484406">91</xref></sup> Gregory schematises the Solomonic corpus so that Proverbs, Ecclesiastes and the Song of Songs correspond to ethics, physics and enoptics retrospectively.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn92-0953946813484406">92</xref></sup> But the fact Gregory does not singularly describe spiritual ascent in terms of this three-fold division in the rest of his works gives further support to the suggestion that spiritual ascent is not a rigidly staged process.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn93-0953946813484406">93</xref></sup></p>
<p>The backcloth to all this is, of course, the curriculum of the Neoplatonic schools, in which texts were studied as a means of <italic>forming</italic> the soul. The texts may be regarded as ‘spiritual exercises’, as Pierre Hadot famously put it.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn94-0953946813484406">94</xref></sup> The pedagogical purpose of the Platonic corpus is made explicit from Iamblichus onwards (and is taken up by Proclus and others): the first, <italic>Alcibiades</italic>, with its σκοπός as self-knowledge, was taken as the first dialogue for students who would ascend the ladder of virtue. What is more, Porphyry published his edition of Plotinus’ treatises in the fourth century according to a set order—modelled on the threefold division of the sciences into ethics, physics and theology—with the intention of escorting the reader from the material world to the divine Intellect and the One.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn95-0953946813484406">95</xref></sup></p>
<p>Equipped with these contextual insights, we are now in a better place to understand Gregory’s specific rendition of the three-fold division of the Solomonic corpus. In this final section, we will treat this schematisation as an illustration of Gregory’s commitments to the unfolding, diachronic character of spiritual ascent,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn96-0953946813484406">96</xref></sup> although it is by no means exhaustive of his treatment of the theme of diachronicity.</p>
<p>For Gregory, the book of Proverbs is suited to those who are still young in their spiritual development, who are ‘tender’ and ‘easily formed’ (<italic>GNO</italic> VI 18:14-15),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn97-0953946813484406">97</xref></sup> and who require ‘maternal instruction and paternal admonition’ (<italic>GNO</italic> VI 18:15-16).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn98-0953946813484406">98</xref></sup> Its purpose is to elicit the soul’s desire for virtue (<italic>GNO</italic> VI 23:6-9).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn99-0953946813484406">99</xref></sup> The book of Proverbs therefore serves to intensify—not to expunge—‘the desire of one still young according to the inner man’ (<italic>GNO</italic> VI 21:15-6)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn100-0953946813484406">100</xref></sup> and to re-direct it away from fleshly pursuits towards Wisdom.</p>
<p>The next stage of spiritual development calls for Ecclesiastes, to which the <italic>In Canticum canticorum</italic> devotes little attention because, it has been suggested,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn101-0953946813484406">101</xref></sup> Gregory already expended considerable time and energy on exegeting the text in the In Ecclesiasten. The purpose of Ecclesiastes is to cleanse the soul from the vanity of material things, to focus the soul’s attention on eternal matters, to what is beyond the senses (<italic>GNO</italic> VI 22:13-15).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn102-0953946813484406">102</xref></sup></p>
<p>Thereafter, Solomon—whom Gregory believes is the author of Proverbs, Ecclesiastes and The Song of Songs—‘initiates the soul into the divine sanctuary by means of the Song of Songs’ (<italic>GNO</italic> VI 22:16-17).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn103-0953946813484406">103</xref></sup> The Song of Songs teaches of ‘the need for the soul to reach out to divine nature’s invisible beauty and to love it as much as the body is inclined to love what is akin to itself’ (<italic>GNO</italic> VI 27:9-11).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn104-0953946813484406">104</xref></sup></p>
<p>From all that has been said thus far, it seems that the <italic>object</italic> of desire shifts from Wisdom to the incorruptible Bridegroom, and the intensity of that desire augments as the soul matures.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn105-0953946813484406">105</xref></sup> In other words, as ascetical purity is magnified and as worldly passion (πάθος) is transformed through the course of time into impassibility (ἀπάθεια) (<italic>GNO</italic> VI 27:11-2),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn106-0953946813484406">106</xref></sup> the Christian διάνοια is compelled—on reading the Song of Songs—to ‘seethe with passion for the spirit alone and [is] warmed by that fire which the Lord came to cast upon the earth [cf. Luke 12:49]’ (<italic>GNO</italic> VI 27:12-5).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn107-0953946813484406">107</xref></sup> Clearly, then, desiring the incorruptible Bridegroom intensifies spiritual desire; desire—of this laudable, ascetical sort—is not disowned along with <italic>disordered</italic> passions generally, but brought to fulfilment in Christ.</p>
<p>For Gregory, even though the Song of Songs represents the height of spiritual maturation, it nonetheless delineates variegated levels of maturity so that the reader may learn about ‘the different kinds of souls who behold the bridegroom’ (<italic>GNO</italic> VI 460:3-4).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn108-0953946813484406">108</xref></sup> Commenting on Song of Songs 6:8—‘There are sixty queens and eighty concubines, and maidens without number’—Gregory writes:
<disp-quote>
<p>We have learned that the Father’s house has many mansions [John 14:2]… God accepts each person according to free will; He allots the choice according to each one’s worthiness, bestows compensations to nobler persons, and measures out rewards to those of a lesser account (<italic>In Canticum canticorum GNO</italic> VI 459:4-5; 459:1–460:2).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn109-0953946813484406">109</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Gregory then adduces support for the various levels of spiritual maturity on the basis of Song of Songs 6:8 in which the maidens, the concubines, the queens and the bride represent different levels of spiritual advancement. The ‘maidens’ are those who ‘believe that the Word of mystery is salvific, yet it does not establish truth in them by knowledge and certainty’ (<italic>GNO</italic> VI 460:17-19).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn110-0953946813484406">110</xref></sup> Although they are included ‘among the saved’, they are ‘infantile’, possess an ‘imperfect understanding’ of spiritual realities and can be identified by their ‘brutish disposition’ (<italic>GNO</italic> VI 461:2-4).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn111-0953946813484406">111</xref></sup> The ‘concubines’ are those who cultivate virtue and refuse evil ‘out of the threat of fear’ (<italic>GNO</italic> VI 462:3-5).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn112-0953946813484406">112</xref></sup> Finally, ‘queens’ represent those ‘of a more perfect disposition’ who are ‘united in incorruptibility to God’s purity’ and are called “queens” because of their ‘associations with the king’ (<italic>GNO</italic> VI 461:19–462:3).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn113-0953946813484406">113</xref></sup> Gregory explains that the bride is ‘one of the queens’ (<italic>GNO</italic> VI 463:16-17);<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn114-0953946813484406">114</xref></sup> she represents those whose spiritual intimacy with Christ, the incorruptible bridegroom, is greatest.</p>
<p>It is important to realise, at this juncture, lest we divorce Gregory’s ‘mysticism’ from his ‘asceticism’, that persistent and patient ascetical practice, in response to the workings to the Holy Spirit, is required for spiritual maturation. Indeed, one’s ascetical practices deepen over time, alongside advances in spiritual maturation, as the Holy Spirit is poured out more abundantly upon the soul.</p>
<p>On the one hand, ascetical practices are a preparatory exercise, which must be mastered before one can even read the Song of Songs (<italic>In Canticum canticorum GNO</italic> VI 25:5-15).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn115-0953946813484406">115</xref></sup> On the other hand, however, ascetical discipline, as I have already intimated, is not for Gregory merely a matter of propaedeutics. Commenting on the astonishment of the bridegroom’s friends in Song of Songs 3:6 who marvel at the increasing beatification of the bride, Gregory claims that they testify to her ‘progress [προκοπή] in virtue’, to her ‘great change and transformation for the better’ (<italic>GNO</italic> VI 187:10-13).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn116-0953946813484406">116</xref></sup> Even as bride, therefore, the soul finds that there is always further progress to be made in the practice of virtue; after all, as Gregory himself remarks—on the topic of spiritual intimacy with Christ (though it equally suits our present point)—‘the end of the bride’s advancements becomes a beginning for further advancement’ (<italic>GNO</italic> VI 177:19–178:1).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn117-0953946813484406">117</xref></sup></p>
<p>Gregory’s insistence on perpetual moral progress is linked to a highly sophisticated pneumatology: even at the heights of spiritual ascent, ascetical self-mastery is deepened and intensified by the sanctifying power of the Holy Spirit, whose presence ensures the efficacy of bodily practices in moral maturation. Gregory explains that the Spirit ‘endures as co-worker and companion in accordance <italic>with the measure of faith</italic>, the good dwelling in each one in proportion to the eagerness of the soul in its deeds of faith’ (<italic>De instituto Christiano</italic> VIII/1 44:20-23).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn118-0953946813484406">118</xref></sup> The measure of the outpouring of the Spirit upon the soul is therefore dependent upon the individual’s capacity to receive the Spirit; with each outpouring, there is an expectation that what is given will be increased (VIII/1 44:25-27).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn119-0953946813484406">119</xref></sup> As such, the Spirit nurtures the soul in proportion to its ‘age of intelligibility’ (νοητή ἡλικία) (<italic>GNO</italic> VIII/1 45:2).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn120-0953946813484406">120</xref></sup> After these remarks, Gregory patterns spiritual growth on physical development from childhood to adulthood (<italic>GNO</italic> VIII/1 1:45; cf. <italic>In Canticum canticorum GNO</italic> VI 18:4-7).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn121-0953946813484406">121</xref></sup> The capacity of the soul to receive the Spirit is thus analogously linked to the capacity of the body to receive different types of nourishment. The young soul requires a form of spiritual food that is inferior to that given to the mature soul; each soul, in other words, is given a form of spiritual nourishment that is proportionate to the demands of its age. Much here rests on Eph. 4:13-15.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn122-0953946813484406">122</xref></sup> In Ephesians, the Pauline author summons his audience to progress from childhood—in which any and every doctrine seems persuasive—to adulthood, so that Christ may be firmly acknowledged as the ‘head’ of the entire (spiritual) body. Similarly, Gregory urges his listeners to aspire to spiritual maturity, motivated by the prospect of a richer outpouring of the Spirit. In this way, the practice of asceticism, ever dependent on the promptings of the Holy Spirit, is not deadened or diminished by advances in spiritual maturation but intensifies alongside these spiritual developments, demonstrating that—in the words of the <italic>De vita Moysis—</italic>‘the perfection of human nature consists… in its very growth in goodness’ (I:10).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn123-0953946813484406">123</xref></sup></p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In concluding this article, we can reflect again upon the seemingly paradoxical ethical insight with which we are confronted in the case of Gregory: the disciplining of the body through ascetical practice affirms the moral potency of the body in overcoming sin, even and precisely through its more dangerous capacities for moral error. On closer inspection, such a conclusion may only be regarded as ‘paradoxical’ in a liberal, consumerist, social and cultural milieu in which the indulgence of the body is itself sometimes constructed as an absolute <italic>telos</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn124-0953946813484406">124</xref></sup> and ‘asceticism’, in a sort of Foucauldian, armchair, mimicry of this post-modern consumerism, becomes enticing only and precisely because of its apparent extremes. But, for Gregory, to turn corporeality into the flaccid receptacle of excess is to override its deepest, transformative potential—its capacity to become the agent of moral transformation and the means of virtuous living.</p>
<p>We have thus also deepened our understanding of the virtuous life as a diachronic process of maturation and suggested a new perspective from which to refine MacIntyre’s moral theory of virtuous ‘practice’. We have argued that, on Gregory’s vision, ascetical practices inculcate virtue <italic>over time</italic> and require arduous striving, in response to the Spirit, at all stages in life, in order to cultivate spiritual forms of desire; desire, then, is not obliterated within this programme of moral transformation but intensified to the right goal in God. Such a vision of spiritual maturation might appear to find no place of accommodation in MacIntyre’s (modern) definition of ‘practice’, albeit one inspired by the more elusive ethical directives of the Benedictine Rule. Yet it is one of the ironies of the history of ethical theory that Benedict’s own vision owes so much, between the lines, and via Evagrius and John Cassian, to precisely this transformative ethic of desire which Gregory founded—on a creative reading, as we have shown here, of Paul via Plato. Let me suggest, in closing, that this aetiology is at least worthy of further study and reflection in contemporary meta-ethical discussions.</p>

Isaac did not marry ‘at the peak of his youth’ so that marriage would not become ‘a deed of passion [πάθος]’ (VII:3:8). After a period of sexual abstinence, Isaac married Rebecca, as Gen. 25:20 relates, motivated solely by ‘the blessings of God upon his seed’ (VII:3:10-11). Then Gregory interprets Gen. 27:1—at which the aged Isaac is said to have closed his eyes—as an indication that he completely disavowed the sensible world (and, with it, sexual activity) in order to contemplate the invisible.</p>

<p>It is worth noting that Paul never uses σάρξ in connection to the resurrection (on the contrary: 1 Cor. 15:50), but only σῶµα (1 Cor. 15). Robinson, <italic>The Body</italic>, p. 31.</p>

<p>This is not to exclude the fact that the ‘flesh’ (σάρξ) can be used pejoratively in Gregory as in Paul. Robinson, <italic>The Body</italic>, pp. 18-26. In one passage in the first Homily of the <italic>In Canticum canticorum</italic>, σῶµα and σάρξ have different nuances: the latter is presented as fallen and recalcitrant while the former denotes the redeemed corporeality of the incorruptible resurrection body: ‘[The Song] shows that we are no longer to be men with a nature of flesh [σάρξ] and blood; rather, it points to the life we hope for at the resurrection of the saints, an angelic life free from all passion. After the resurrection, the body [σῶµα] which has been transformed into incorruptibility, will again be joined to the soul. The passions now disturbing us because of the flesh [σάρξ] will not be restored with those bodies [σῶµα]; rather, we shall become tranquil… No longer will there be civil war with the passions set against the mind’s law, where the soul is overcome and taken captive by sin. Nature will then be cleansed from all such things and one spirit will be in both (I mean both in the flesh and in the spirit) and every corporeal disposition will be banished from human nature’ (<italic>In Canticum canticorum GNO</italic> VI 30:4-20, St. Gregory of Nyssa, Commentary on the Song of Songs [trans. McCambley], p. 50).</p>

<p>It is not insignificant that the majority of texts which I quote here were composed during the mature phase of Gregory’s literary career. Morwenna Ludlow has shown that Gregory focuses with greater intensity in his later works on the role of embodiment in the learning process of ascetical transformation.

<p>Robinson clarifies that Paul is not referring to ‘the conflict, familiar to Greek ethics, between man’s reason and his passions’ (<italic>The Body</italic>, p. 24). While it is certainly true that Gregory pits reason against (disordered) passion, he ultimately believes these passions will be redirected (not obliterated) towards their proper goal in Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>For Origen, in Prologue 3:1 of his Commentary, the preliminary stage of the Christian life is the moral life, represented by Proverbs. Secondly, Ecclesiastes inculcates intellectual reflection on the created order, which results in the realisation that all is ‘vanity’. Finally, through the Song of Songs, God instils into the soul the love of things divine and heavenly, this being the highest stage of spiritual ascent. The terms <italic>ethica, physica</italic> and <italic>epoptice</italic>, which correspond to the Greek words ἠθική, φυσική and ἐποπτική retrospectively, appear with their Latin equivalents (<italic>philosophia moralis, naturalis, inspectiva</italic>) in the Latin version of the Commentary (<italic>Die Griechischen Christlichen Schriftsteller</italic> 75 ll:7-9 [Leipzig: J. C. Hinrichs, 1925]). R. P. Lawson, <italic>Origen: The Song of Songs: Commentary and Homilies</italic> (Westminster, MD: The Newman Press; London: Longmans, Green and Co, 1957), p. 41.
