<abstract>
<p>Based on prior research on political business cycles, we investigate the manipulation of state budgets in battleground states. The state-based winner-take-all Electoral College system in the United States makes certain states extremely politicized during presidential elections. We hypothesize that budgets will target specific groups of swing voters in these battleground states. We test the impact of competitive state status in presidential elections on state budgets from 1982 to 2005 by creating a cross-sectional time-series regression model of state budget priorities from Jacoby and Schneider. While controlling for known determinants of budgets, we find strong support for our hypothesis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>What impact does being a presidential battleground state have on state budgets? The anecdotal evidence of budget manipulation due to battleground state status is vast. For example, there is an ongoing controversy in Ohio concerning the building of a commuter rail line connecting the main population centers in the state (Leingang 2010). There is quite a bit of opposition in the state to the expenditure of state funds associated with the project. Ostensibly, State Senate Republicans object to the $17 million in annual operating costs incurred by the State should the rail line be built. But there are others who suspect that there is at least some partisan political animus in Senate Republican opposition to the plan. Specifically, building a new rail line in the battleground state of Ohio could have reflected well on the Obama administration going into the presidential elections in 2012.</p>
<p>There is nothing particularly unusual about the political manipulation of this budget item. There is an expansive literature on the effects of partisan politics on budgeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0160323X13487386">Guhde and Mustafa 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0160323X13487386">Sole-Olle 2006</xref>). The general consensus is that electoral politics do influence policy outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0160323X13487386">Cusack 1997</xref>). It would be nice to believe that decisions in government are made purely on policy grounds, but the evidence suggests otherwise. Since politicians are known to manipulate budgets in election years and they have an incentive to help the presidential candidate of their own party, it makes sense that the presidential electoral political cycle may also come into play in competitive states.</p>
<p>Recognizing the demonstrated reality of electoral considerations in budgeting policy, in this article, we examine the effects of presidential elections on state budgeting. Because of the nature of our presidential Electoral College system, to the extent that one party or the other can manipulate the budget, we expect that in presidential battleground states, party leaders will try to foster an environment conducive to the victory of their party’s presidential nominee. Consequently, we examine patterns of state expenditures designed to help, at least in the estimation of the controlling parties, their political cause.</p>
<p>To test this proposition, we use a cross-sectional time-series (CSTS) model based on state-level budgetary spending priorities as outlined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0160323X13487386">Jacoby and Schneider (2009)</xref>. We test the hypothesis that being a competitive state in a presidential election has an impact on intrastate budgetary allocations. Specifically, we hypothesize that budgets will target groups of swing voters in these states, and, thus, budgets will likely move in a more particularistic direction in competitive states. While controlling for other known determinants of budgets, we find strong support for this hypothesis.</p>
<p>This will use a CSTS design of state-level data to show being a battleground state in presidential elections alters the spending patterns in states in predictable ways. This shows that national electoral strategy influences state-level budget decision making.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0160323X13487386">
<title>Battlegrounds and Budgets</title>
<p>There is an extensive literature on the interconnection of electoral cycles and government budgets (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0160323X13487386">Nordhaus 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0160323X13487386">Tufte 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0160323X13487386">Beck 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0160323X13487386">Alesina and Roubini, 1992</xref>). Formal models posit the incentive structure guiding politicians to manipulate budgets both on the spending and on the tax side to gain voters’ favor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0160323X13487386">Peltzman 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0160323X13487386">Cox and McCubbins 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0160323X13487386">Berry and Berry 1992</xref>). Data-based studies then validate those formal models at the state level in establishing a fairly clear connection between public budgeting and attempts to influence electoral outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0160323X13487386">Mikesell 1978</xref>; Abney and Lauth 1988, 1989; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0160323X13487386">Barrilleaux and Berkman 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>But it is not just the electoral cycle that affects governmental budgeting. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0160323X13487386">Alt and Lowry (2000)</xref> suggest that the budgetary processes are really a product of the interaction of three different sets of variables: the institutional arrangements of the various states, changes in party control, and the effect of electoral politics. The institutional structure in which budgets are created and spending decisions has a strong influence on the spending priorities of state governments such that stringent balanced budget requirements dampen the effects of the political business cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0160323X13487386">Sharkansky 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0160323X13487386">Rose 2006</xref>). In addition, changes in party control can lead to a substantial reordering of budgetary priorities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0160323X13487386">Alt and Lowry 2000</xref>). On the other hand, there is an interaction of party control and institutional arrangements such that divided government limits the impact of partisan ideology on budgets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0160323X13487386">Clarke 1998</xref>). Finally, there is a substantial literature on state ideology or the context in which decisions are made that can have an important effect on policy outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0160323X13487386">Brace et al. 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Thus, it seems that as strategic actors, elected officials use their authority over the budget to maximize their own chances to further their careers. Our research supplements this literature by testing whether budgets are also manipulated due to presidential electoral completion. Based on this clear evidence of political business cycles, we investigate the manipulation by politicians of state budgets in presidential election years.</p>
<p>The structure of the winner-take-all Electoral College system in the United States accentuates the importance of certain swing states during presidential election years. Consequently, these battleground states experience a burst of intense campaign activity due to their perceived competitiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0160323X13487386">McClurg and Holbrook 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0160323X13487386">Lipsitz 2009</xref>). Presidential election campaigns tend to agree on what constitutes a battleground state, and residents in those states see the evidence of those decisions in an increase of campaign activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0160323X13487386">Shaw 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0160323X13487386">2004</xref>). If we assume that state politicians are savvy operators, they will have a general idea which whether their state is in play or not. Any political junkie can list which states will likely be in play in 2016: Florida, Ohio, Colorado, Virginia, and so on. Conversely, politicians in Vermont of Utah have a pretty clear picture of the lack of competitiveness of their states. Thus, because of the elevated importance of these states to the final outcome, we suspect that politicians in battleground states may change their behavior and the policies of their states to help their party’s candidate for president win their state.</p>
<p>Politicians at the state level have two major incentives for helping their party’s presidential candidate win their state. A major effort is exerted by presidential campaigns to mobilize local politicians to help with campaigns in battleground states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0160323X13487386">Gimpel, Kaufmann, and Pearson-Merkowitz 2007</xref>). This includes offers to help local politicians in return for activities that are viewed as beneficial for the campaign. Thus, those state politicians who do what is necessary to win will be rewarded for their actions. Conversely, it is plausible that politicians that are viewed as not working to win the state for the campaign may face sanctions.</p>
<p>Additionally, the state-level politicians who have a desire to further their political career will benefit greatly by support from the national party. These politicians will take actions to help the party’s candidate because they are looking to develop a national reputation, and thereby, acquire support for future political endeavors. For example, Hawaii’s Lieutenant Governor Brian Schatz, President Obama’s state campaign director for the 2012 election cycle, was appointed by Governor Neil Abercrombie to the United States Senate to replace United States Senator Daniel K. Inouye who died shortly after the election. Thus, politicians are both pressured to change their behavior and do so to acquire chits to be cashed in later on.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0160323X13487386">
<title>Theory and Hypotheses</title>
<p>Our theory is that state politicians have incentives to help their party’s candidate win the presidency and that this incentive will manifest itself in the budget of states with competitive presidential elections. Politicians may well incur sanctions from voters for manipulating state budgets, so they will only risk these sanctions in states where they can make a difference in the electoral outcome. As the battleground states often decide the entire presidential election, and are often decided by a few percentage points or less, the incentive for budget manipulation is clearer in close states. Thus, competitiveness is a necessary condition for budget manipulation due to a desire to help in presidential elections. We expect that in competitive states, the budget allocations will be targeted to groups that can make a difference in the electoral outcome. Generally, these targeted spending programs will be particularistic rather than distributive because particularistic benefits are more efficient rewards for targeted groups. Thus, we expect that in competitive states, budget priorities will trend in a particularistic direction, to mobilize target groups to support the controlling party’s presidential candidate.</p>
<p>On the basis of this theoretical formation, we propose our hypothesis: states with closer presidential outcomes will have a budget moved in a particularistic direction. This is because politicians will want to mobilize targeted groups of voters in these states with targeted particularized benefits.</p>
<sec id="section4-0160323X13487386">
<title>Data</title>
<p>The data used in this project are focused on the American states and span the years from 1982 to 2005. Our dependent variable, <italic>Policy priority</italic>, is Jacoby and Schneider’s (2009) new measure of state budget spending. Jacoby and Schneider create a measure of the relative distance between states with regard to their provision of collective and particularized benefits. They do this by selecting and comparing state spending across fifteen different areas of expenditure constituting on average 88 percent of state budgets (p. 548). The result is a fairly clear delineation between two groups of policies that are strongly cross correlated. For example, transportation spending benefits specific localities and groups and is, thus, particularized; while administrative spending is generalized across the population and, thus, is designated a collective good (p. 554). This metric is useful in understanding policy priorities by measuring changes in spending in the American states. The innovative nature of this approach provides a number of benefits, chiefly an easily comparable metric that allows the budget arrangements of each state in each year to be evaluated with regard to location of those states’ policy priorities, and in relation to the rest of the states.</p>
<p>The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0160323X13487386">Jacoby and Schneider (2009)</xref> measure is estimating the change by a state over time in the priority it gives certain policies for expenditures. It has one dimension that runs from distributive spending to redistributive spending. The redistributive polices are health care, hospitals, and welfare. The measure has means of zero and in theory could go from −1 to 1; however, all states average within the range of −0.3 to 0.3, with most states clustered around 0. The distributive polices are law enforcement, parks and natural resources, corrections, government administration, highways, and education. Averaged over the entire period, New York is the most redistributive and Wyoming has the greatest distributive spending priorities. A state may over time go from spending more on redistributive projects such as welfare, to distributive projects, such as highway spending, or vice versa. They find that this one dimension of spending applies to all states and that there are no other dimensions to state expenditures. Thus, this measure captures the priorities that states give to either distributive or redistributive projects. It is a general summary of spending priorities and can be used for our purposes to see whether state change expenditures if they are a battleground state.</p>
<p>Our key independent variable, <italic>Battleground state</italic>, measures the closeness of the presidential election in each state. Presumably legislators can see that their state is the focus of national attention by the level of campaign activities by the contenders and by actions by the Federal Government such as the designation of large-scale spending projects such as the rail projects noted above. For our study, in order to standardize the designation of battleground states from one election to the next, we use the final difference in electoral percentage as a proxy for overall closeness, which again provides a variable with significant variance. This is an accepted proxy for competitiveness, as it represents a concrete evaluation of the closeness of the electoral outcomes. We dichotomize the competitiveness at 10 percent margin, where below a 10 percent final margin is coded (1) as a battleground state, and states with election margins greater than 10 percent are coded (0) as non-battlegrounds. When we leave this variable as continuous, the results are robust to this specification.</p>
<p>The literature provides a number of variables that effect budgets, and we include those variables as controls. Particularly important are governmental controls indicated by the literature on budgetary decision making (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0160323X13487386">Alt and Lowry 1994</xref>). We include a dummy variable for divided government, and include controls for which party controls the upper and lower houses of state legislatures as well as the partisan identification of the governor. We also use updated data originally reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0160323X13487386">Berry et al. (1998)</xref> to measure <italic>Citizen ideology</italic> and <italic>Institutional ideology</italic> in the American states. We expect states with more liberal ideologies to have more particularistic policies. We include Squire’s (2007) updated index of the professionalization of state legislatures (measured on a scale of 0 to1, with an average of .20 in all states and years in this sample), as more professionalized state legislatures may be more likely to manipulate the budget electoral periods. We also include total federal grants to state governments to make sure that there are not external funds allocated to states during election year and this leads to altered state budgets (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0160323X13487386">Mayer 1995</xref>). We include controls for the competitiveness of concurrent gubernatorial and U.S. Senate elections, as competition in these elections on the same ballot as a presidential election may influence state budget manipulation (measured as the percentage point distance between the top two candidates in the election). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0160323X13487386">Barrilleaux and Berkman (2003)</xref> find that demographic variables are also related to state expenditures, so we also include demographic controls for region, per capita income, education level measured in percentage of the state with a college degree, age measured as percentage that over 65 (variable named Elderly) and under 25 (variable named Youth), and the percentage that are black and Hispanic in the state. These data are from the census. Each of the demographic variables is related to the policy and budgetary decisions that affect the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0160323X13487386">Jacoby and Schneider (2009)</xref> measure.</p>
<p>The data are measured years for each state, thus may be described as longitudinal, also known as CSTS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0160323X13487386">Woodbridge 2002</xref>, 6).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Our hypothesis is confirmed by the models shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0160323X13487386">Table 1</xref>. Being a battleground state in the presidential election as measured by the closeness of the election is statistically significant in all the estimated models. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0160323X13487386">Table 1</xref> reports the results of two regressions: one with governmental controls and a model that adds the demographic controls. In each model, being a battleground state has a significant negative coefficient indicating that particularistic policies increase in these election circumstances. The effect of being a battleground state is robust to the inclusion of these demographic controls.</p>

<p>In the governmental control model, control of either house of the state legislature by the Democratic party or a having a Democratic governor has the expected effect to increase particularistic policies. States with more liberal institutional ideologies have more particularistic policies, but citizen ideology is only significant in model 2. The only demographic control variables that have an influence are higher income states, and states with increasing youth and elderly populations have more redistribution. Variables for region, education, and race and ethnicity did not have a significant impact on the model.</p>
<p>In model 2, we add demographic control variables, and we see that the results also hold in this specification. Being a battleground state remains significant and negative, even after the inclusion of additional control variables. Interestingly, we find that more professionalized state legislatures have more particularized budgets, which is an interesting finding that future research should investigate further. In a specification not shown, we ran the model with an interaction term between professionalization and battleground status, and it was not significant. Taken together, the results reported in models 1 and 2 provide evidence that the underlying theory and the hypothesis associated with it are correct. As we theorized, it appears that battleground states in presidential elections engage in more particularistic policies than do their less competitive contemporaries. Being a battleground state lowers the measure of policy priority score by about one-fifth of a standard deviation, becoming more particularistic.</p>
<p>Taken together, the results provide strong evidence for our theory. In each specification, the effect of presidential competitiveness was significant, indicating greater budget manipulation in competitive states. Our results contribute to existing findings showing the pervasiveness of budget manipulation for partisan political purposes. Based on this evidence, we conclude that elected officials use the budgetary process in an attempt to influence Electoral College outcomes and that those actions are designed to provide specific rents to specific groups, based on the needs of the states’ voters.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Former Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, Tip O’Neill once said that all politics is local (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0160323X13487386">O’Neill and Hymel 1995</xref>). That aphorism seems a bit less true when applied to the case of state budgeting in presidential election years; particularly in the case of so-called battleground states. One of the oddities of our Electoral College system is that it focuses the nation’s attention on swing states, which because they are electorally competitive, can determine the outcome in presidential elections. Because the outcomes of the elections in those states are potentially so momentous, our results are consistent with the theory that selected constituencies within those states become the focus of intense campaigning.</p>
<p>In this study, we test the proposition that legislatures in battleground states game the budgetary process to deliver votes to the national party. Even though state budgeting is one level below national politics, and even though state legislators should be thinking first about their own immediate concerns, our results are clear in highlighting the tendency of state legislative majorities to be influenced by national politics.</p>
<p>Our study adds to a growing literature that tracks patterns of political influence on policymaking. It is not surprising that politicians in democracies react to political pressures in making policy decisions. What makes our study unique is that we are able to identify a skew in the allocation of resources due to the structural idiosyncrasies of our presidential electoral system. The Electoral College clearly has effects on the allocation of campaign resources and even on electoral outcomes. After all, a candidate can win the presidency without getting a majority of the popular vote. What our study demonstrates is that the effects of the Electoral College on policy making penetrate to levels well below national decision making.</p>
<p>There are several interesting interactive hypotheses that future research should focus on. For example, it may be that due to ideological differences, the Republican and Democratic parties which control state expenditures react differentially to external pressure to help in an election year. Although we control for these factors, a multiplicative interaction of these variables would help see how they differ. Similarly, the past history of priorities of state expenditures may influence the rate or level of change in expenditures in election years, as will broader economic conditions, such as recessions. As the direct effect is clear from our findings, these more nuanced analyses would be interesting to examine.</p>
