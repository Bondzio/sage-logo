<p>Finding a good text for an online journalism course can be a challenge. While discussions of Web technology and software are, of course, key parts of producing digital content, they can easily squeeze out room for consideration of the main point: writing. Some texts, therefore, are left discussing writing itself in two chapters, one called something such as “online writing” and the other “linking.”</p>
<p>Such is not the case in Carroll’s book. This well-researched and thoughtfully organized work honors the craft of writing through its own production.</p>
<p>The book is presented in three sections. Part I begins with an excellent examination of good writing and the foundations of good journalistic form. It then introduces students to the differences between reading content in print versus digital form and why digital necessitates considerations of scanning, readability, and search for the writer. The second chapter ends with a brief introduction to HTML, XHTML, and CSS.</p>
<p>Part II, chapters 3 through 6, segues into a deeper presentation on planning and mapping news sites; yet online writing style remains the key. The third chapter concludes by examining the visual style of three well-known sites, C/Net, Razorfish, and Google, and recommends the overlooked practice of storyboarding to plan clean page design. Consideration of the visual, again, is tied into the concept of reader usability, which is as it should be for a writing text.</p>
<p>Chapter 4 centers around the importance of heads, subheads, and links; following a brief discussion of text types, the chapter ends with the practice of chunking and illustrates how it was used in two case studies.</p>
<p>Chapter 5 brings up one criticism: its focus on designing news sites and pages might easily have been incorporated into chapter 3. Instead, the text seems to bog down somewhat with considerations of balance, contrast, and unity. For example, the text’s explanation of style guides might confuse students because it comes so close at times to mixing editorial style guidelines (such as the AP’s) with coding guides or software terminology. “When presenting file names, use only lowercase letters. Examples: florence.wmv . . .” (p. 113).</p>
<p>Or consider this: “As examples, here are two terms and their style explained from Wired’s usage book: FDDI: Pronounced ‘fiddy’ and standing in for ‘fiber distributed data interface,’ this fiberbased network architecture offers a faster and more dependable alternative to ether or Token Ring. (It transmits at 100 Mbits per second over LANs and MANs.) Of course, with gigabit Ethernet on the horizon, the future of FDDI looks bleak’” (p. 113).</p>
<p>So would an undergraduate’s expression, I can imagine.</p>
<p>Chapter 6 rights its way again with important advice on editing. Not only is editing given its due, which is rare in other texts, but Carroll presents step-by-step methods students can use in their online editing attempts.</p>
<p>Part III, chapters 7 through 11, covers the many different contexts in which online writing has become a valuable skill—through blogging, citizen journalism, and corporate communication—and concludes with a comprehensive and well-written summary of key legal concepts that impact online writers. An Afterword reflects upon the core values in online journalism and helps students realize they are the same as those in print journalism: accuracy, transparency, fairness, and independence. By inclusion of this Afterword, the text comes full circle.</p>
<p>Two chapters are dedicated to the principle of “We the People.” They examine the use of social networking to gather news: the developments of citizen or crowd-sourced journalism, hyperlocal news, and the power of folksonomies to become either empowering tools of civic engagement or mere echo chambers that further destroy the common weal. Educators can easily decide how deeply they want to drill into each of these concepts with students, allowing for flexibility in course construction.</p>
<p>A chapter on corporate communication writing for intranets, extranets, and portals contains information I have not seen in any other online writing text. Public relations students, in particular, might find extra value here. It is sometimes a challenge to convince PR students that a text predicated upon the practice of journalism has meaning for what they envision their careers will be.</p>
<p>Every chapter of <italic>Writing for Digital Media</italic> ends with exhaustive source citation and a listing of Web resources available for further examination. These resources name the very best available, and it would be an invaluable addition if Routledge and Carroll produced an online companion site of even these annotated URLs.</p>
<p>Educators will find additional help in creating course structure by this text’s inclusion of brief exercises within many sections and longer writing assignments at the end of each chapter. Once again, these are excellent additions to this text, as many educators are still learning how to teach online and digital courses.</p>
<p>Two final points that set this text apart for me: Brian Carroll serves as director of the Honors Program at Berry College in Georgia and as an adjunct at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. His primary teaching and research interests include digital storytelling, First Amendment law, editing and visual rhetoric, and the history of blacks in baseball.</p>
<p>His breadth of interest and depth of knowledge show in this text, which is peppered with allusions to great literature. It would seem counterintuitive to call upon the works of Victor Hugo, William Shakespeare, or Ernest Hemmingway for a text on writing for digital media. But Carroll makes it work. Just be forewarned: writing advice on brevity from Blaise Pascal might lead to side discussions of great literature with your undergraduate and graduate students.</p>
<p>Finally, students should enjoy Carroll’s dry sense of humor. His advice to them after recounting the AD 681 burning of the library at Alexandria: “Make a copy. Back up your data. Beware of invaders.”</p>
<p>On pages 29–30, he lists thirty elements that improve a site’s credibility; then, on page 41, he exhorts students to keep lists between six and eight items as any higher number results in loss of reader interest. To prove his point, he then concludes, parenthetically: (“Did you read all of the . . . lists of factors earlier in this chapter? Be honest!”).</p>
<p>And the chapter on blogging? It’s entitled “Blogito, Ergo Sum,” of course.</p>
<p>I highly recommend Brian Carroll’s <italic>Writing for Digital Media</italic> for the value it will give students and educators in any online writing course.</p>
