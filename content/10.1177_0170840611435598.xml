<abstract>
<p>This paper analyses how a case for institutional change is made through rhetoric in an individual text. Drawing on Aristotle’s three types of rhetorical justification, logos, pathos and ethos, we make three contributions. First, we show that the multiple competing logics which often dominate a field can become incorporated into key texts. As a result, the notionally rational argumentation repertoires which underpin each logic exist in tension, and are prone to contradict each other, making it difficult for a text to support convincingly one logic rather than another on the basis of logos appeals. In such instances, the authors of a text may favour one logic over another through the strategic use of ethos (moralizing) and pathos (emotion-evoking) rhetoric. Second, we demonstrate how ethos and pathos function to construct social categories (identities) and draw on dominant cultural myths. Third, we theorize these textual strategies as acts aimed at reconfiguring relations of power/knowledge.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>How does an individual text make a case for institutional change?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0170840611435598">1</xref></sup> We address this question by analysing how an Australian Senate Committee report on aged care argued that the young disabled should be accommodated and cared for separately from the elderly. Our analysis builds on research into the evolution of institutional logics – frameworks for reason and belief – that undergird legitimacy assessments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0170840611435598">Lounsbury, 2001</xref>) and shows how persuasive language, i.e. rhetoric, articulates these logics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0170840611435598">Colomy, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0170840611435598">Creed, Scully &amp; Austin, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0170840611435598">Green, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0170840611435598">Green, Li &amp; Nohria, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0170840611435598">Jarzabkowski, Matthiesen &amp; van de Ven, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-0170840611435598">Suddaby &amp; Greenwood, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr120-0170840611435598">Zilber, 2009</xref>). Our focus is on how a specific text undertakes ‘institutional work’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0170840611435598">Lawrence &amp; Suddaby, 2006</xref>), i.e. how, by shifting the institutional logic, rhetorical argument may enable community change.</p>
<p>Institutional fields often feature multiple, contradictory, and competing logics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0170840611435598">Reay &amp; Hinings, 2005</xref>, p. 354; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0170840611435598">DiMaggio &amp; Powell, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0170840611435598">Hoffman, 1999</xref>). Despite some exceptions (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0170840611435598">Creed et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0170840611435598">Maguire &amp; Hardy, 2009</xref>), analyses of how a particular logic can become dominant ‘are relatively rare in the empirical literature’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0170840611435598">Lawrence &amp; Suddaby, 2006</xref>, p. 235). Previous work has also tended to focus on institutional logics at the macro- and meso-levels and across organizations, industries and fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0170840611435598">Heracleous &amp; Barrett, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0170840611435598">Maguire &amp; Hardy, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-0170840611435598">Suddaby &amp; Greenwood, 2005</xref>). Detailed analyses of how specific texts actually work are less common, yet such work can show how texts may effect institutional change by describing how key participants are defined and cultural myths are drawn upon (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0170840611435598">Creed et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0170840611435598">Lounsbury, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0170840611435598">Oakes, Townley &amp; Cooper, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>In the conduct of institutional work,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0170840611435598">2</xref></sup> there is growing attention to the role of discourse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0170840611435598">Maguire &amp; Hardy, 2009</xref>) and particular forms of rhetoric (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0170840611435598">Green, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0170840611435598">Green et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-0170840611435598">Suddaby &amp; Greenwood, 2005</xref>). Rhetoric is the instrumental use of language to persuade audiences to make judgements and engage in social action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0170840611435598">Bizzell &amp; Herzberg, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0170840611435598">Gill &amp; Whedbee, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0170840611435598">Green, 2004</xref>, p. 654; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0170840611435598">Herrick, 2001</xref>). Of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0170840611435598">Aristotle’s (1991)</xref> three types of rhetorical justification – logos (appeals to logic), pathos (appeals to emotion) and ethos (appeals to morality) – logos has received the most attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0170840611435598">Creed et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0170840611435598">Green et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0170840611435598">Heracleous &amp; Barrett, 2001</xref>). Studies usually give little attention to how ethos and pathos appeals can also promote specific logics. As a result, we have only a limited understanding of the rhetorical practices that legitimize institutional logics leading to social and managerial policies.</p>
<p>Our research focuses on an inquiry report produced in a policy-making context. The situation was that the same nursing homes often accommodated and cared for both the young disabled and frail elderly. The Report was a ‘disruptive’ text that sought to deinstitutionalize the practice of caring for both groups in shared facilities. It did so by championing an institutional logic centred on the discursive phrase ‘age-appropriate care’. Although the Report makes a series of logos-based arguments in support of age-appropriate care, it also refers to ‘person-centred care’ and ‘disability-appropriate care’, which (may) imply that, regardless of age, people with similar needs can be accommodated and cared for together. As a result, the Report’s logic to promote separate care for the young disabled and the elderly is intra-textually threatened. To strengthen its case for ‘age-appropriate care’, we show how the Report relies on ethos- and pathos-based rhetorical strategies.</p>
<p>In addressing our research question, ‘how does a text argue for institutional change?’ we show how multiple, competing logics are incorporated into a text and how rational arguments supporting different logics exist in tension and may contradict one another. We then demonstrate how a text may favour a specific logic through the use of both ethos (moralizing) and pathos (emotion-evoking) rhetoric. Specifically, we show how, through such rhetorical manoeuvres, the social categories of ‘young disabled’ and ‘frail elderly’ are created. We analyse how appeals to ethos and pathos function to construct these identities and draw on dominant cultural myths to support them. We theorize that such textual strategies are aimed at reconfiguring relations of power/knowledge. Our research demonstrates how social realities are constructed and how ‘hegemonic and discriminatory social relations’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0170840611435598">Bishop &amp; Jaworski, 2003</xref>, p. 246) are maintained and reproduced to render some ‘opaque aspects of discourse’ visible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0170840611435598">Fairclough &amp; Wodak, 1997</xref>, p. 258).</p>

<title>Institutional Change and Rhetoric</title>
<p>Institutions are ‘historical accretions of past practices and understandings that set conditions on action’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0170840611435598">Barley &amp; Tolbert, 1997</xref>, p. 99). They establish rules and moral obligations that favour conformity, stability and system reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0170840611435598">Caronna, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0170840611435598">Hoffman, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0170840611435598">Hoffman, Riley, Troast &amp; Bazerman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0170840611435598">Scott, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr117-0170840611435598">Wicks, 2001</xref>). Institutions are underpinned by ‘institutional logics’, frameworks of assumptions within which reasoning takes place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0170840611435598">Horn, 1983</xref>, p. 1) and which provide ‘organizing principles’, or ‘guidelines for practical action’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0170840611435598">Rao, Monin &amp; Durand, 2003</xref>, p. 795). These shape interpretations, define role identities, constrain and enable agency and stipulate criteria for legitimacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0170840611435598">Scott, 2001</xref>). Institutional logics are encoded in discourses, collections of interrelated texts that provide vocabularies, specify norms, establish meanings, and create relations of power/knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0170840611435598">Carabine, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0170840611435598">Heracleous &amp; Barrett, 2001</xref>). Through discourse, logics often become reified, and the meanings and practices they inscribe taken-for-granted and reproduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0170840611435598">Phillips, Lawrence &amp; Hardy, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>However, institutional logics may become misaligned or weakened, and under these conditions institutional change may occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0170840611435598">Maguire &amp; Hardy, 2009</xref>). Such ‘deinstitutionalization’ involves the abandonment of previously institutionalized practices and ensues when the logics with which these practices are associated lose meaning and legitimacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0170840611435598">Douglas, 1986</xref>), often because ‘better’ options are recognized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0170840611435598">Ahmadjian &amp; Robinson, 2001</xref>, p. 627). Ambiguities and contradictions between logics within a field provide increased scope for change as these mitigate certainty and make alternatives more easily available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0170840611435598">Hoffman, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0170840611435598">Rao et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0170840611435598">Seo &amp; Creed, 2002</xref>). In those instances where institutionalized practices are well established, some purposeful ‘disruptions’ may be necessary to initiate change. These are more likely to be successful when an author or other actor occupies an elite position in the field, is widely regarded as legitimate, and is central to communication networks within it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0170840611435598">Farjoun, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0170840611435598">Lounsbury, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0170840611435598">Phillips et al., 2004</xref>). For these reasons parliamentary inquiry reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0170840611435598">Brown, 2004</xref>), and reports produced by high-profile state-sponsored institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0170840611435598">Boudes &amp; Laroche, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0170840611435598">Brown, 2005</xref>) are (at least potentially) powerful disruptive devices.</p>
<p>Parliamentary reports and those produced by state-sponsored institutions may make a case for institutional change by altering perceptions of legitimate processes of organizing. Legitimacy (pragmatic, cognitive and moral) results from a set of affective and cognitive processes through which entities become embedded in taken-for-granted assumptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr122-0170840611435598">Zucker, 1977</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr123-0170840611435598">1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr124-0170840611435598">1991</xref>). Moreover, legitimacy is associated with a reduction in the scope for criticism and questioning, and ‘serves as a natural way to effect some kind of collective action’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0170840611435598">Hannan &amp; Carroll, 1992</xref>, p. 34; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0170840611435598">Meyer &amp; Rowan, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-0170840611435598">Suchman, 1995</xref>). Institutional change occurs as a ‘consequence of negotiations and contests over which logic, and thus the criteria by which organizational legitimacy is assessed, will dominate’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-0170840611435598">Suddaby &amp; Greenwood, 2005</xref>, p. 36).</p>
<p>Insurgent logics are more likely to succeed when they are tied to higher-order social values, i.e. culturally embedded assumptions regarding what is morally right and/or functionally appropriate (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-0170840611435598">Suddaby &amp; Greenwood, 2005</xref>). They are further helped if, at the same time they come into play, the moral basis of existing institutions is undermined, perhaps as a result of revelations of ongoing systemic problems, corruption or harmful consequences. Yet, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0170840611435598">Lawrence and Suddaby (2006</xref>, p. 236) note, the literature ‘contains relatively few concrete descriptions of such work’. What is clear is that this kind of ‘institutional work’ is accomplished through language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0170840611435598">Munir &amp; Phillips, 2005</xref>, p. 1669). Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0170840611435598">Berger and Luckmann’s (1966</xref>, p. 64) insight that ‘the edifice of legitimations is built upon language’ suggests that what is needed is ‘a compelling and convincing’ explanation of how discourse renders logics of action and material practices legitimate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0170840611435598">Green et al., 2009</xref>, p. 12; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0170840611435598">Friedland &amp; Alford, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0170840611435598">Green, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-0170840611435598">Suddaby &amp; Greenwood, 2005</xref>). Attention has focused in particular on the role of rhetoric.</p>
<p>Rhetoric is ‘discourse calculated to influence an audience toward some end’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0170840611435598">Gill &amp; Whedbee, 1997</xref>, p. 157), which often ‘conveys multilayered, plurivocal philosophies or worldviews’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0170840611435598">Monin, Barry &amp; Monin, 2003</xref>, p. 377), and is concerned with ‘argumentation and persuasion’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-0170840611435598">Symon, 2005</xref>, p. 1646; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0170840611435598">Sillince, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr119-0170840611435598">Watson, 1995</xref>). In the context of our study, there are two important points to make about rhetoric and its effects. First, institutional logics are constituted through language and can be incorporated into written texts such as the report that is analysed in this study, using rhetorical strategies, i.e. the skilled use of persuasive language (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0170840611435598">Maguire &amp; Hardy, 2009</xref>). Second, rhetoric is one tool by which shifts in a dominant logic can be achieved by texts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-0170840611435598">Suddaby &amp; Greenwood, 2005</xref>, p. 41): through rhetoric, actors shape, justify, rationalize and seek to modify perceptions of what is sensible, right and good (i.e. legitimate) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0170840611435598">Green et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Most attention has focused on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0170840611435598">Aristotle’s (1991)</xref> classification of rhetorical justifications: logos, pathos and ethos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0170840611435598">Bizzell &amp; Herzberg, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0170840611435598">Erkama &amp; Vaara, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0170840611435598">Golant &amp; Sillince, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0170840611435598">Green, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0170840611435598">Herrick, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0170840611435598">King &amp; Kugler, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0170840611435598">Nelson, Megill &amp; McCloskey, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0170840611435598">Nohria &amp; Harrington, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-0170840611435598">Sillince &amp; Mueller, 2007</xref>). Logos appeals are associated with the rational calculation of means and ends, and pander to desires for efficient and effective action. Such appeals help to confer both pragmatic legitimacy by playing to an audience’s self-interests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0170840611435598">Green, 2004</xref>) and cognitive legitimacy by providing plausible explanations for arbitrary choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-0170840611435598">Suchman, 1995</xref>). There is less clarity regarding conceptions of pathos and ethos. We follow <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0170840611435598">Green’s (2004</xref>, p. 659) understanding that ‘Pathos justifications impact emotions’ and ‘Ethos justifications impact moral or ethical sensibilities’. Pathos appeals prompt emotional responses and often work to construct pragmatic legitimacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0170840611435598">Green, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-0170840611435598">Suchman, 1995</xref>). Ethos appeals connect actions and institutions to cultural norms, encourage judgements regarding ‘character’ and ‘rightness’, and serve to build moral legitimacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0170840611435598">Green, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-0170840611435598">Suchman, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Empirical investigations of these rhetorics by institutionalists have concentrated on logos appeals, and the argumentation repertoires and structures that make them persuasive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0170840611435598">Creed et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0170840611435598">Green et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0170840611435598">Heracleous &amp; Barrett, 2001</xref>). Less consideration has been given to the role of pathos which constructs ‘feeling rules’ and ethos which constitutes ‘moral dilemmas’ that ‘instruct’ individuals regarding how they ought to think and feel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0170840611435598">Hopkins, Zeedyk &amp; Raitt, 2005</xref>). Yet in circumstances where multiple logics exist in competition, and each is supported by reasoned argument, pathos and ethos may play a crucial suasive role. Even when pathos and ethos have been analysed, the primary focus has been on how arguments (logos) connect with other forms of rhetoric rather than with the specific use of emotion-evoking and moralizing rhetorics (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0170840611435598">Erkama &amp; Vaara, 2010</xref>). We focus on ‘complex forms of persuasion and convincing’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0170840611435598">Erkama &amp; Vaara, 2010</xref>, p. 817; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-0170840611435598">Suddaby &amp; Greenwood, 2005</xref>) in a particular text and link this to broader discourses and policy outcomes.</p>
<p>Key texts, such as government inquiry reports, are implicated in relations of power in multiple ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0170840611435598">Boudes &amp; Laroche, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0170840611435598">Brown, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0170840611435598">Brown &amp; Jones, 2000</xref>). In formulating their positions and arguing for specific outcomes they contribute to the creation of knowledge that normalizes a certain way of believing, speaking and behaving with respect to the issues they investigate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0170840611435598">Carabine, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0170840611435598">Foucault, 1998</xref>). At a micro level, these texts deploy rhetoric to persuade readers that they are truthful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0170840611435598">Barnes, 1991</xref>), plausible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr116-0170840611435598">van Maanen, 1988</xref>), authoritative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0170840611435598">Brown, 2004</xref>) and verisimilitudinous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0170840611435598">Bruner, 1990</xref>, p. 61). Rhetoric is per se an exercise in power designed to have an effect on an audience and to influence it toward some end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0170840611435598">Gill &amp; Whedbee, 1997</xref>). Studying rhetoric can help us to understand the dynamics of power between subjects, authors and audiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-0170840611435598">Symon, 2005</xref>) and how what these actors take to be their social realities are created and reified.</p>
<p>To summarize, we address the research question: how does an individual text make a case for institutional change? There is little research that focuses on how documents, such as government-sponsored inquiries, construct arguments for change. Indeed, most research has assumed that there is an inherent conservatism in such reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0170840611435598">Brown, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0170840611435598">2004</xref>). We analyse how, in the context of multiple logics, appeals to logos may be confused and contradictory, and how ethos (moralizing) and pathos (emotion-inducing) rhetorics may be deployed.</p>

<p>A Senate Committee inquiry is a ceremonial event in which information, ideas, explanations and opinions are assembled from the statements of witnesses and site visits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0170840611435598">Gephart, 1984</xref>). Inquiry reports are ‘longer term organizational responses’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0170840611435598">Shrivastava, Mitroff, Miller &amp; Miglani, 1988</xref>, p. 292) to social challenges and crises through which learning may occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0170840611435598">Brown, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-0170840611435598">Turner, 1976</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr113-0170840611435598">1978</xref>). Moreover, they are multilevel events in ‘which micro-level sensemaking practices produce the macro social order as a set of representative meanings tracked across social settings’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0170840611435598">Cicourel &amp; Knorr-Cetina, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0170840611435598">Gephart, Steier &amp; Lawrence, 1990</xref>, pp. 44–45). A Senate inquiry report is associated with formal power (e.g. the right to speak and decide), critical resources (e.g. finance, information and credibility), network links (to other actors) and discursive legitimacy (an acknowledged right to be heard) (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0170840611435598">Hardy &amp; Phillips, 2004</xref>). At a time when it is increasingly recognized that there are ‘no master narratives or central texts’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0170840611435598">Bruner, 1993</xref>, p. 23), inquiry reports offer univocal accounts of complex issues and opinions together with specific, targeted recommendations that allow little scope for disagreement.</p>
<p>The text we analysed was the Australian Senate Community Affairs Committee Report into <italic>Quality and Equity in Aged Care</italic> (2005). We chose this report because of its importance in a broader policy drama (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0170840611435598">Marston, 2004</xref>). Australian governments at the State and Commonwealth levels have a high degree of involvement in aged care through funding, regulation and the provision of services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0170840611435598">Ergas, 2009</xref>). Since the early 1980s, aged care has been the subject of extensive public debate, while legislation and policy reforms have led to changes in funding and care models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0170840611435598">Abbey, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0170840611435598">Caddick, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0170840611435598">Courtney, Minichiello &amp; Waite, 1997</xref>). Of note also is that this Report was initiated by members of the Senate opposition. The Australian Parliament is an example of ‘strong bicameralism’ in which the Senate (upper house) and the House of Representatives are virtually equal in power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0170840611435598">Bach, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0170840611435598">Lijphart, 1999</xref>). In the period 2003–5, while the conservative Liberal-National party coalition controlled the House of Representatives, the Senate was dominated by its major rival, the Australian Labor Party. Motivated by ideological and policy differences, the Labor Party, together with independents, used the Senate committee system to hold the government accountable for problems, as was the Senate’s designated function as a ‘house of review’. Aged care had for some time been a particular concern, and was an obvious candidate for a Senate inquiry. The Senate committee system has a reputation for concerted investigation, longer-term focus and sustained development of policy. It commands widespread respect among the electorate. Moreover, the constitutional power of the Senate means that the findings of its committees cannot merely be ignored: ‘the government has to listen to what the Senate says’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0170840611435598">Hirst, 2002</xref>, pp. 202–3) and it ‘regularly compels government to account for its activities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0170840611435598">Evans, 2009</xref>, p. 97).</p>
<p>In the twelve months leading up to the referral of the matter to the Senate Community Affairs References Committee, the opposition repeatedly asked questions and voiced criticisms of the government in relation to aged care. The criticism centred on a variety of issues, including out-of-date funding models, lack of evaluation and monitoring, and long waiting lists. It also focused on delays in releasing the Review of Pricing Arrangements in Residential Aged Care (known as the Hogan Review). The review was commissioned by the government in 2002 and completed by the end of 2003, but its findings were initially withheld from the public despite leaks to the media and ongoing speculation about what it contained. The findings were eventually released on Budget night, 11 May 2004, when the federal government also announced its responses and measures to address the review’s short- and medium-term recommendations. While the Hogan Review touched on quality of care and equity of access, it focused primarily on the long-term financial viability of the sector. Members of the Senate, therefore, called for an additional Inquiry that investigated current problems with the quality of aged care.</p>
<p>These criticisms and the debates surrounding them informed the broad terms of reference for the inquiry that is the focus of our study. The terms of reference included a review of: (i) the aged care workforce; (ii) the Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency; (iii) young people with disabilities in residential aged care facilities; and (iv) home and community care programmes. The six-person committee considered 243 public submissions and ten confidential submissions from individuals and organizations. It also heard from 138 witnesses in nine days of public hearings in seven state capitals and made four site visits in Perth and Melbourne. The Report consists of an overview, a list of recommendations and seven main chapters. It also includes two appendices with details on the documentation and witnesses who testified at public hearings. Each paragraph of the report is numbered and we use this to identify particular passages of text within our paper. All 206 pages of the Report are publicly available on the Internet at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.aph.gov.au/Senate/committee/clac_ctte/aged_care04/index.htm">www.aph.gov.au/Senate/committee/clac_ctte/aged_care04/index.htm</ext-link>.</p>
<p>Texts do not stand alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0170840611435598">Culler, 1982</xref>, p. 33), but are links in chains of texts ‘reacting to, drawing in and transforming other texts’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0170840611435598">Fairclough &amp; Wodak, 1997</xref>, p. 262). To analyse the context of the Report, we conducted a search for media coverage of the inquiry using Factiva, a media database. This yielded 17 items that made specific reference to the Inquiry between February 2005 and March 2006. Media reports of further cases of alleged physical, sexual and psychological abuse in nursing homes in Victoria and the Australian Capital Territory (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0170840611435598">Butterly, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-0170840611435598">Streak, 2006</xref>) included criticism of the government for its lack of prompt action in implementing Inquiry recommendations. We also used the Australian parliamentary information database to identify commentary and announcements regarding the implementation of recommendations made in the Inquiry Report. We obtained the Australian Federal Government’s official response to the Report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0170840611435598">Commonwealth of Australia, 2007</xref>), which took two years to compile, during which time action to address some of the recommendations had already begun. These additional sources of information were analysed in order to assess how the report was received in the public domain and to identify changes in practice, if any, following the Inquiry.</p>

<title>Analytical approach</title>
<p>Our research contributes to the array of discourse analytic work within organization studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0170840611435598">Boudes &amp; Laroche, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0170840611435598">Grant, Hardy, Oswick &amp; Putnam, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0170840611435598">Potter &amp; Wetherell, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr115-0170840611435598">van Dijk, 1997</xref>). In line with other research, we regard the Report as the product of specific authorial strategies which present <italic>an</italic> (not <italic>the</italic>) understanding of issues and themes under investigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0170840611435598">Edmondson, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0170840611435598">Nelson et al., 1987</xref>). From the many discourse analytic strategies available to us (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0170840611435598">Fairclough, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0170840611435598">Potter &amp; Wetherell, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr115-0170840611435598">van Dijk, 1997</xref>), we chose an interpretive approach focusing in particular on the polysemous nature of words and arbitrariness of meaning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0170840611435598">Derrida, 1976</xref>) and drawing attention to ‘the relations between the dualities in stories’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0170840611435598">Boje, 1995</xref>, p. 1007) ideological assumptions embedded in the text of the report and ‘the suppressed interests of members of disempowered, marginalized groups’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0170840611435598">Martin, 1990</xref>, p. 340). This strategy seemed appropriate, given the politically fractious nature of the debates to which the Report contributed: despite Australia’s ageing population having been debated and reviewed 34 times in seven years (2.1): ‘Evidence received during this inquiry suggests that there has been little improvement to the situation since 2002’ (2.2).</p>
<p>Our data analysis occurred in three stages. First, the Report was read independently by the three authors and we each identified potentially interesting patterns in the arguments used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-0170840611435598">Suddaby &amp; Greenwood, 2005</xref>). These were then either discarded or refined and collapsed into more analytically compelling categories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0170840611435598">Glaser &amp; Strauss, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0170840611435598">Miles &amp; Huberman, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-0170840611435598">Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1998</xref>). We sought also to identify how salient categories structured readers’ sensemaking. For example, we identified instances where the text focused on issues of ‘age appropriateness’ and ‘age inappropriateness’ and these were then systematically coded for, and their implications analysed.</p>
<p>Second, we focused on Chapter 4 of the Report, ‘Young people in residential aged care facilities’. We did so because it contained some of the most interesting and controversial sets of logics and arguments apparent in the Report. Our analysis was guided by an understanding of an institutional logic as a discursive framework that provides organizing principles and guidelines for action. We found two contrasting categories (‘separate care’ versus ‘joint care’ of the young disabled and elderly) associated with three institutional logics: ‘age-appropriate care’ (people should be cared for separately on the basis of their age); ‘disability-appropriate care’ (people with similar disabilities should be cared for together); and ‘person-specific care’ (people should be individually assessed and cared for) – the latter two being age neutral. Separate care of the young and elderly was supported by three sets of arguments which highlighted: (i) the different care needs of both groups; (ii) their different personal and social needs; and (iii) the policy and systemic failings that made joint care unworkable. In addition, counter arguments were identified which worked to undermine the arguments in support of separate care. These findings suggested that rational argumentation founded on logic was not the only basis for advocating ‘age-appropriate’ care.</p>
<p>Third, we examined the rhetorical strategies used in Chapter 4. We adopted a form of rhetorical analysis broadly consistent with other researchers in the field (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0170840611435598">Berg, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0170840611435598">Green et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0170840611435598">Özen &amp; Berkman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0170840611435598">Sillince, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-0170840611435598">Sillince &amp; Brown, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-0170840611435598">Suddaby &amp; Greenwood, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-0170840611435598">Symon, 2005</xref>). This involved coding for the use of ‘logos’, ‘ethos’ and ‘pathos’ among the textual categories we had already identified. Rhetoric that argued for rationalizing care of the young or elderly in terms of cost, efficiency or effectiveness was coded as logos. Rhetoric that appealed to emotions, for example, individuals’ fears that they or their relatives might have to endure poor-quality care, was coded as pathos. In coding for ethos, we looked for arguments that appealed to (community) values; that is, social and collective interests that produce moral and ethical legitimacy such as the idea that the young take precedence over the old. We identified distinct but related moralizing and emotion-evoking arguments centred on two key rhetorical strategies, ‘humanization’ (ethos-based rhetoric emphasizing the moral worth of the young) and ‘narrativization’ (pathos-based rhetoric relating to emotionally resonant stories suggesting joint care was inappropriate). These findings are explained further in the next section.</p>

<sec id="section6-0170840611435598">
<title>Logics of Care</title>
<p>The Report, particularly Chapter 4, argues explicitly that disabled individuals under the age of 65 should be cared for apart from those aged over 65: ‘Young people should not be in aged care facilities’ (4.158). Relatively large numbers of young disabled people are said to be involved: 6398 in May 2005, predicted to grow to 10 000 within a few years. The key institutional logic informing this argument is that of ‘age appropriateness’. This is used to suggest significant differences in both the care and accommodation requirements of those aged under and over 65. A consensus is presented among those who gave evidence to the Inquiry that the young should not be mixed with the old: ‘witnesses stated that aged care facilities were not appropriate for young people’ (4.3). Indeed, the Report seeks to emphasize this consensus by using direct quotes from those concerned with promoting the interests of both the young disabled as well as the elderly:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Nursing homes are perceived as ‘dumping grounds’ for people that the system has given up on. (The Young People in Aged Care Alliance (YPACA) (4.4)</p>
<p>Aged care providers were also concerned that young people are placed in their facilities as the needs of the frail aged and young disabled ‘couldn’t be more diverse and both groups suffer to a greater or lesser extent’. (Horton House, New South Wales aged care provider) (4.5)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It is only by arguing that care ought to be age appropriate that separating the young from the old can be justified. Yet there are other logics mentioned occasionally, most notably ‘disability-appropriate’ and ‘person-specific’ care (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0170840611435598">Table 1</xref>). Acceptance that care ought to be disability- or person-specific tacitly recognizes that the joint accommodation of, and care for, people of different ages is apt, and perhaps even desirable in those instances where the young and elderly have the same care requirements. The Report thus makes its case for ‘age-appropriate’ care largely by ignoring the contradictory implications of these alternative approaches.</p>

<p><italic>Argument 1</italic>: different care needs. The Report states that the care needs of the young and the old are different and that accommodating them together harms them both (4.5). The young disabled are presented as having high level and diverse care needs, and are thus a more challenging group to accommodate and care for. In addition, as aged care nursing is highly specialized, the Report argues that it is unfair to require nurses to tend both younger people with disabilities and the frail elderly. Further, aged care institutions are described as ill-equipped to support the specific needs of the young disabled. This means, for instance, that staff may not take the time to communicate with someone with motor neurone disease (4.55). Moreover, aged care facilities are not obliged to respond to the changing care needs of young people with disabilities: with assistance they may recover to the extent that they are ‘able to move into the community’, whereas without aid they may deteriorate further (4.65).</p>
<p><italic>Counter arguments.</italic> The Report acknowledges that detailed figures regarding the kinds of young disabled in aged care facilities are not available, undermining the earlier statement that the young represent a broader and more complex set of care issues (4.9). The argument that the care needs of the young disabled and the elderly are different requires that there is a plausible distinction to be made between the ‘young’ and ‘old’. Yet such a distinction is not consistently made. Mostly, the phrase ‘young disabled’ seems to refer to those aged under 65, but in the Report conclusion it is argued that ‘there is an urgent need to provide alternative services for young people in aged care facilities particularly those aged less than 50 years’ (4.161). If ‘young’ refers to those under 50, then rather than 6000 to 10 000 young disabled people in aged care facilities (4.13), there would be only 1007, a number decreasing since July 2002. The Report also recognizes that the disabled may ‘age’ differently and potentially more rapidly than non-disabled people, and that they may experience the same kinds of health issues and care requirements associated with the aged. It is also stated that the current failure of nursing homes to provide care for the young is not universal, and could be redressed through increased funding (4.90, 4.91).</p>
<p><italic>Argument 2</italic>: different personal and social needs. The Report argues that the young do not have independence, dignity and opportunities for social engagement and fulfilment in aged care facilities. The pattern of daily life in residential nursing homes ‘disconnects residents [which in this instance refers only to the young disabled] from normal routines such as shopping and preparing meals which provide opportunities to exercise and stimulate rehabilitation therapy as well as allowing participation in, and add a purpose to, life’ (4.43). There is a ‘lack of social and emotional support’, in part because ‘Young people may be separated from their partners and/or children and social networks’ (4.45). Moreover, entertainments and activities in aged care institutions are aimed at the elderly, leading to depression among the young (4.45). Further, aged care facilities reduce ‘the ability of an [young] individual to work towards a future, redevelop life skills and re-establish social and inclusive networks’ (4.160), and that they limit social interaction ‘with family and friends’ and ‘the greater community’ (4.159). There are also, argues the Report, health risks in mixing the young and old, who may harm each other: the young pose risks to the elderly by venting frustration ‘in challenging behaviours such as screaming, swearing, throwing objects and hitting out’ (4.47, see also 4.54, 457); and the elderly pose risks to the young, disconnecting medical equipment and intruding on their privacy (4.44).</p>
<p><italic>Counter arguments</italic>. The Report notes that ‘there was evidence that this [placement of the young in aged care accommodation] may remain a viable choice for some people’ (4.88), in particular, ‘where there were benefits from proximity to family and networks’ (4.88). Indeed, ‘In some cases, the complex needs of a person may only be met in a nursing home setting’ (4.88). Numerous examples of felicitously shared (young/old) facilities are mentioned in three separate sections: 4.93–4.95. These examples support the alternative logics ‘disability-appropriate care’ and ‘person-centred care’, in particular for those in rural and regional areas where ‘families may choose aged care accommodation, even with a lesser level of services, to keep their young person close to them and their community of origin’ (4.162). Rather than consider these complexities the Report insists that, in general, it is not appropriate for young people to share accommodation, such as nursing homes, with older people (e.g. 4.1). There is also no attempt made to follow up suggestions from witnesses that residential facilities might be ‘redefined’ so that they could better meet the needs of all residents.</p>
<p><italic>Argument 3</italic>: policy and systemic failings. The Report argues that policy and systemic failings mean that aged care facilities cannot offer high-quality, tailored care to the young (4.101). It notes that the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) in a meeting on 3 June 2005 issued a communiqué which ‘recognised that many Australians, including the elderly and people with disabilities, face problems at the interfaces of different parts of the health system’ (4.156). It asserts that the Commonwealth State Territory Disability Agreement (CSTDA) is meant to achieve policy coordination, but is instead employed by the States and the Commonwealth governments to argue that each other has responsibility, while neither is held effectively to account (4.131). Funding problems mean that ‘aged care facilities are often ill equipped to provide appropriate rehabilitation and allied health services including occupational therapy, physical therapy, speech therapy/pathology and high level medical care’ (4.61, see also 4.102). Once in an aged care residential facility the young disabled are excluded from participating in a range of community-based programmes because of jurisdictional restrictions imposed by State and Commonwealth governments. The Report repeatedly states that the young and old have to share accommodation and care only because there is no alternative and that this arrangement typically occurs owing to failures in other parts of the health and welfare systems, implying that it is a worst-case scenario with no or limited benefits (4.35, see also 4.31).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0170840611435598">3</xref></sup></p>
<p><italic>Counter arguments</italic>. Although the Report uses policy and systemic problems to argue that the young should be separated from the old, these could also be used to call for improvements to make age-diverse facilities more attractive. The Report acknowledges that a lack of coordination between various State and Commonwealth bodies means that relatives of both the elderly and the young disabled face bewildering and excessive red tape. Most attention, though, is focused on how this problem impacts on the quality of care for the young disabled in aged care, rather than the elderly in the same facilities (4.73). The Report also implies that reorganization of the bodies coordinating the elderly and the young disabled be undertaken with the goal of providing separate care, rather than improving the overall quality of care. For example, Recommendation 23 (4.168) calls on COAG to implement reforms designed to help young people in nursing homes so that ‘age appropriate accommodation options are made available and funding is available for the provision of adequate services to those transferring out of aged care facilities’. Yet elsewhere the Report notes COAG has acknowledged that reorganization and better coordination might lead to improved health care services for both the elderly and the young (4.156). Further, the recommendation overlooks evidence by organizations such as Australian Home Care Services (representing the young disabled), which do not argue for a total separation of the young from the old, but rather for providing coordinated and planned diverse-age care determined by need (4.145).</p>

<sec id="section8-0170840611435598">
<title>Ethos and pathos</title>
<p>The confused logos-based arguments for ‘age-appropriate’ care that are apparent in the Report are complemented by appeals to ethos (morality) and pathos (emotion).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0170840611435598">4</xref></sup> While these are often regarded as separate rhetorical categories, in the Report the two are intimately related. This can be seen where the Report seeks to build a moral case for separating the young from the old: ‘Let us take the higher calling here and the high moral ground and, across all our areas of politics and government, say, “This needs to be solved”’ (MS Society Australia) (Conclusion, p. 125).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0170840611435598">5</xref></sup> Joint accommodation and care of the young disabled and the elderly is described as ‘One of the most difficult aspects of the inquiry’ (4.158), leading to the conclusion that ‘young people in aged care facilities is unacceptable in most instances’ (4.167). The Report argues that it is wrong for ‘young residents’ to be forced to ‘comply with the rules’ of aged care facilities which ‘are aimed at assisting the very frail’ (4.41). It is also said to be wrong that the relatives of young people are forced to make the decision to place them in nursing homes: ‘Many witnesses spoke of the extreme difficulty of reaching a decision to move a young person to an aged care facility’ (4.30). Here, the phrase ‘extreme difficulty’ works to underscore the putative (moral) inappropriateness of accommodating the young with the elderly.</p>
<p>To extend the appeal to ethos, the Report links the ‘problematics’ inherent in joint care strategies to the families and friends of the young disabled who are also said to be adversely affected by them. Considerable sympathy is expressed for the families and carers of the young disabled (e.g. 4.39). Indeed, frequently it is the carers rather than the care needs of the young disabled which seem to be prioritized:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Many ageing carers have provided care for family members for years, if not decades. This length of caring takes its toll on ageing carers: physically, financially, socially and emotionally. (4.15)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Furthermore, it is families’ and friends’ distaste for aged care facilities that are used as part of the rationale for removing the young from them:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Many people reported that their children stopped visiting as they found it too upsetting. (4.46)</p>
<p>Friends are discouraged by the sounds and smells of aged care facilities. The wife of one young person commented: ‘friends are reluctant to visit an establishment where all the other residents are wandering around in various stages of dementia’. (4.49)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A story entitled ‘Crying out for help’ is the harrowing account of a mother who declined to have her 21-year-old brain-injured son cared for in an aged care facility:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It broke my heart going through the nursing home process with my 21-year-old son. We were shown a mixed room – a man in his 90s in one corner, an elderly lady with dementia in another, and my son was to be put in the other corner. I went home with my son and cried my eyes out and never went back. (4.20)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In this instance, rhetorical argument functions in such a way as to imply that it is (morally) wrong to place a young person in a nursing home for the frail elderly. The account offered makes no mention of the son’s reaction, and gives no assessment of just how brain-injured he may have been.</p>
<p>Two specific rhetorical strategies are employed in Chapter 4 of the Report in order to strengthen the case for separating the young from the old. These are humanization and narrativization. The strategy of <italic>Humanization</italic> involves reference to the humanity, and concomitantly the implied moral worth of the young disabled relative to the elderly. This occurs in two ways which we label ‘biographical information’ and ‘textual referencing’ (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0170840611435598">Table 3</xref>). First, while the Report uses the first names of many young disabled people, and for some provides biographical information, we do not learn the name of a single elderly person. Second, the Report often refers to ‘the young’ in aged care facilities rather than the ‘young disabled’. Tellingly, the title of the chapter devoted to this subject is ‘Young people in residential aged care facilities’. While young people are sometimes referred to as having disabilities, usually they are described as ‘young people’ (4.13), ‘people’ (4.14), ‘children’ (4.15) or ‘young people in aged care facilities’ (4.9, 4.14). They are also referred to as ‘sons and daughters’ (twice in 4.16). The elderly, by contrast, are never referred to as brothers, sisters, mothers, fathers, parents or grandparents. The Report thus foregrounds the putative moral worth of the young disabled, and deflects attention from their (often profound) disabilities and the fact that most of these notionally ‘young’ people are considerably more than 50 years of age.</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>The strategy of <italic>Narrativization</italic> is evident in Chapter 4 of the Report where it presents six stories, and other direct quotations from the relatives of the young disabled. These seem to have been included in order to elicit emotional responses from readers (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0170840611435598">Table 4</xref>). Stories of how individuals are provided with little or ‘inappropriate’ help and support are used to critique the Australian care system. Melissa’s story (4.44), for example, is a moving account of someone living among the frail elderly. Her sister claims that ‘Her “spark” for life has gone’ (4.44), and that she is ‘living an undignifying and “abandoned” life…left sitting amongst those who are, to be blunt…waiting to die’ (4.44). As Melissa’s sister states: ‘these are young people – young people who deserve to live in surroundings that suit their age. They are entitled to have appropriate care to match their age’ (4.44). One variation on this is the final narrative, Amber’s story (4.95), which tells of a 30-year-old with cerebral palsy who was moved from aged care to supported accommodation. Amber, her mother states, ‘now has a life worth living’, as if she has escaped from incarceration.</p>

<p>In sum, humanization (ethos-based rhetoric) and narrativization (rhetoric based on pathos) function in the Report to establish conceptual boundaries between the young and the elderly. Although it has previously been noted that institutions create social order through acts of categorization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0170840611435598">Lamont &amp; Molnar, 2002</xref>), ‘the process by which categories originate and become reified has largely escaped the attention of institutional theorists’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-0170840611435598">Suddaby, 2010</xref>, p. 16). Our analysis suggests that processes of categorization can be socially constructed through rhetoric, and that these distinctions may have implications for the allocation of societal resources, associated with clear winners (the young disabled) and losers (the frail elderly).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0170840611435598">
<title>Policy outcomes</title>
<p>Tentative evidence for the persuasiveness of these rhetorical strategies can be seen not only in the Report’s final recommendations but also in the sequence and timing of government initiatives.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0170840611435598">6</xref></sup> After the report was released, one of the first actions taken by the government was to announce a joint State, Territory and Commonwealth initiative to move the young disabled out of aged care facilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0170840611435598">Brough, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0170840611435598">Commonwealth of Australia, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0170840611435598">Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, n.d.</xref>). In February 2006, COAG announced a five-year programme targeting the (approximately) 1007 people less than 50 years of age with disabilities residing in nursing homes and committed $244 million in joint State-Federal funding. This action was taken well before the government made its official response to the overall Report in September 2007. It also took place before the implementation of other recommendations calling for more frequent random inspections of aged care facilities, reform of aged care complaints handling processes, and mandatory reporting of sexual and physical assault. More fundamental reforms affecting the quality of aged care, such as increased overall funding for the sector and redressing the wage disparity that makes attraction and retention of skilled staff difficult, were rejected by the government in their response to the Report. However, these continued to be named as underlying causes of systemic problems in aged care such as malnutrition of aged care residents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0170840611435598">Metherell, 2008</xref>) and inappropriate medication of those with dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0170840611435598">Hoffman, 2011</xref>). In contrast, in 2011, the initiative to move the ‘young’ disabled out of aged care was hailed publicly as a success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0170840611435598">Horin, 2011</xref>) following a report evaluating the impact of the programme released by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0170840611435598">Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (2011)</xref>. Thus, we can identify changes in practice following the Report’s release that prioritize the institutional logic of ‘age-appropriate care’ and do so in ways that reflect and reinforce the greater legitimacy of the needs of the ‘young’ as opposed to the elderly.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this section, we elaborate three key points. First, where logos-based arguments are used to support conflicting institutional logics, arguments based on ethos and pathos may also be important. Second, this rhetorical strategy functioned by constructing distinct identities for the frail elderly and young disabled which drew upon cultural norms about the higher social value of the young, relative to the elderly. Finally, we consider how micro-analyses of texts may reveal them as exercises in power. In elaborating these themes our aim is to extend the work of theorists on the use of language within a text to theorize processes of institutional change.</p>
<sec id="section11-0170840611435598">
<title>Rhetoric and institutional change</title>
<p>Change in institutional practices is accomplished by rhetorical strategies. The Report attempted to deinstitutionalize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0170840611435598">Maguire &amp; Hardy, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0170840611435598">Oliver, 1992</xref>) joint accommodation and care for the elderly and young disabled and to promote separate care arrangements for them. The phrase ‘age-appropriate care’ was the centrepiece of an ‘institutional vocabulary’ used to expose problems in existing care practices and thus to challenge ‘the taken-for-granted nature of an existing institutional order’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-0170840611435598">Suddaby &amp; Greenwood, 2005</xref>, p. 59). However, the logos-based argument for ‘age-appropriate care’, and thus for age-based separation, coexisted with other competing logics with potentially different implications. While previous research and theorizing has emphasized that ‘the production and acceptance of arguments are the concrete mechanism of institutionally embedded agency’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0170840611435598">Green et al., 2009</xref>, p. 31), we have shown how these arguments may depend not just on appeals to logic, but also on appeals to morality and emotions. Although fields may often feature ‘institutional warfare’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0170840611435598">Reay &amp; Hinings, 2005</xref>, p. 354), within an individual text contradictions can be ‘patched over’, and the battle decided in favour of a particular logic, by representing it as the rational/logical choice and the right thing to do, and by sustaining it with emotionally compelling stories.</p>
<p>Fields are not static or fixed, rather they are always in the process of becoming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-0170840611435598">Tsoukas and Chia, 2002</xref>). The institutional structures within them ‘are continuously being operationalized and actors are being mobilized within an ongoing stream of interactions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-0170840611435598">Sztompka, 1991</xref>, p. 95). We have shown how a text uses language to affirm one logic (age-appropriate care), delegitimate and replace an existing logic (dual care), and marginalize other competing logics (‘disability-appropriate’ and ‘person-specific’ care). The changes did not entail a wholesale redistribution of power, capital or field membership; it mostly required dominant actors to do things differently. Moreover, the ‘joint care’ logic was a position that had seemingly occurred by default rather than design, and did not meet the interests of many parties, while ‘age-appropriate’ care was not a new creation of the Report, merely one of several pre-existing logics that had now found favour. In such circumstances, change was relatively easy to argue for by substantiating and dramatizing ‘the ineffectiveness and injustice of existing practices’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0170840611435598">Colomy, 1998</xref>, p. 289).</p>

<title>Rhetoric, identities and cultural myths</title>
<p>The Report’s appeals to ethos and pathos functioned by creating different kinds of identities for the frail elderly and the young disabled, drawing on cultural myths about the relative value of the young and the old. Previous theorizing has noted how institutional actors create their own identities in order to advance their claims to competence and to be heard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0170840611435598">Covaleski, Dirsmith, Heian &amp; Samuel, 1998</xref>). Less attention has been paid to how some institutional actors construct the identities of others to establish the legitimacy of their own arguments. This was important here, where the young were named, provided with biographical information, and located in networks of familial relationships as children, spouses and parents. The elderly, by contrast, were the background ‘other’ against which the young disabled could be foregrounded. A report that was notionally focused on quality and equity in aged care relied on stereotyped images of the elderly as failed, spoiled, less morally deserving of resources and as requiring separation from the young.</p>
<p>This finding reflects the cultural hostility and ambivalence towards the elderly in Western societies where they are discursively ‘stripped’ of positive identities, homogenized and marginalized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0170840611435598">Gullette, 2004</xref>, p. 122; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0170840611435598">Estes, Linkins &amp; Binney, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0170840611435598">Hazan, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0170840611435598">Minkler, 1991</xref>). Australia in particular is ‘stuck in the culture of youth’ which promotes ‘an image of aged people that denies their status as elders with useful resources to offer society’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-0170840611435598">Thomas &amp; Shute, 2006</xref>, p. 188; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0170840611435598">Edgar, 1991</xref>). In constructing young and elderly identities in these ways, the Report connected its arguments for separate care to dominant cultural myths. Myths purify and make ‘innocent’ and ‘natural’ a particular version of reality that is ‘without depth’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0170840611435598">Barthes, 1972</xref>, p. 143; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr118-0170840611435598">Yanow, 1992</xref>), shaping understandings, and imbuing them with legitimacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0170840611435598">Meyer &amp; Rowan, 1977</xref>). They are part of the toolkit of institutional work that relates specific efforts at change to broader societal sign systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0170840611435598">Lawrence &amp; Suddaby, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr121-0170840611435598">Zilber, 2006</xref>). By constructing particular versions of young and old identities to support a moral foundation for age-appropriate care, the Report shows how a cultural myth can be harnessed to transform a logic from a theoretical formulation into an institutional imperative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0170840611435598">Creed et al., 2002</xref>).</p>

<title>Rhetoric, power and legitimacy</title>
<p>This paper has analysed one means by which state-conferred power is employed to legitimate an institutional logic and a new set of institutional arrangements and policies which it implicated. ‘Age-appropriate care’ was at the heart of a ‘theorization of change’ which sought to render the separate care of the young and elderly not merely comprehensible but seemingly ‘natural’ while also overriding (though not suppressing) competing logics and contradictions. Institutionalized practices are fixed through regulative, normative and cognitive processes which establish their legitimacy and marshal conformity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0170840611435598">Scott, 2001</xref>). These were all targets which the Report sought to affect. It attempted to constrain actors’ behaviour by encouraging Government to reconstitute the regulatory framework governing care of the young disabled. It sought to influence normative beliefs regarding what was appropriate to make the separate care of the young a moral requirement. It engaged constituencies on an emotional level, to elicit feelings of guilt regarding the young, and thus to persuade its audiences to accept change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0170840611435598">Edwards, 1999</xref>). As such, it can be seen as a vehicle for influencing cognitions, encouraging conformity in understandings (shared conceptions) and for defining a prevailing orthodoxy centred on the separate care of the young which, over time, might become automatic, unconscious and unquestioned.</p>
<p>The Report consistently depicted nursing homes for the elderly as carceral institutions from which the notionally ‘young’, no matter how disabled, should be helped to escape. Alternative arguments about the nature of ageing, the naturalness of different generations living together, and the potential benefits of intergenerational care are absent. The Report’s focus on freeing the young disabled from nursing homes may be understood as a distraction tactic that deflected attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-0170840611435598">Turner &amp; Pidgeon, 1997</xref>, p. 180) from the more fundamental failings of the Australian aged care system. Indeed, the government did prioritize separating the young disabled above other recommendations that directly concerned the elderly, such as more frequent ‘spot’ inspections of aged care facilities and mandatory reporting of abuse. Thus, government inquiry reports help to specify norms and standards which produce the configuration of power/knowledge in their field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0170840611435598">Carabine, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0170840611435598">Foucault, 1998</xref>). The capacity of parliamentary reports to rebalance power/knowledge derives in part from their privileged position in their institutional environment which means that they are less affected by governance mechanisms and have a high level of cultural competence. This enables them effectively to make a case for institutional change, using rhetoric to alter perceptions of legitimate processes of organizing.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Where arguments for change based on logos are insufficient, ethos and pathos may assume significance. This finding, and the analysis which supports it, has two broad sets of implications for research. First, it suggests that further attention should be given to the role of rhetoric in processes of institutional change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0170840611435598">Heracleous &amp; Barrett, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0170840611435598">Oakes et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0170840611435598">Covaleski et al., 1998</xref>). Specifically, it demonstrates the need to scrutinize closely how shifts in dominant logics are initiated and sustained. We have analysed how moralizing and emotion-evoking rhetoric was used in an Australian Senate Committee report to establish the primacy of ‘age-appropriate care’ over other logics, to define how the young and the elderly should be conceived, and to shape understandings of what was right and proper. Our analysis illustrates the arbitrary nature of state-sanctioned choices between multiple available institutional logics as well as the way in which any specific institutional logic may be embedded in complex, even contradictory, understandings that make reference to alternative logics. Additional research is required which investigates how rhetoric is used to maintain and support existing logics, and how rhetoric is deployed to sustain categorical distinctions (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-0170840611435598">Suddaby, 2010</xref>). In this way, a more sophisticated understanding of how author-actors ‘fix’ meaning in ways that serve particular interests might be developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0170840611435598">Mumby, 2004</xref>, p. 237).</p>
<p>Second, our study suggests a need for increased attention to the political role of texts such as inquiry reports, policy and strategy documents and letters to shareholders, and to examine how they are embedded in and affect relations of power. We have provided an account of how one text played a role in a much larger policy drama (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0170840611435598">Marston, 2004</xref>). Other studies might usefully focus on discursive efforts to stabilize and reify ideological meanings, how they are contested, and how social realities are reproduced, resisted and transformed through rhetoric. Discursive closure is never total and the dominance of one logic over others is rarely, if ever, complete. As our study has shown, textual hegemonic impositions like government inquiry reports do not simply engender consent and active support, but embody and evoke complex discourses that exist in tension. This Report, like other texts, was not cohesive, but replete with internal tensions and contradictions, providing latitude for multiple readings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0170840611435598">Geertz, 1983</xref>, p. 141). Further research is needed to investigate how, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0170840611435598">De Certeau (1984)</xref> insists, texts are subject to ‘tactics of consumption’, and negotiated by sceptical, cynical, questioning audiences who appropriate them for their own purposes.</p>

<p>‘Discourse’ and ‘rhetoric’ are related, yet there are important distinctions between them, particularly with respect to notions of power and agency. In this paper, we use ‘rhetoric’ to suggest agency, while ‘discourse’ incorporates and reflects positions of power but does not itself imply agency.</p>

<p>Indeed, under the terms of the Aged Care Act 1997 ‘younger people with disabilities will be accepted into residential aged care only “where there is no alternative”’ (4.35), and the Aged Care Assessment Team (ACAT) guidelines allowed younger people to be assessed and approved for residential aged care only if ‘no more appropriate services are available’ (4.36).</p>
