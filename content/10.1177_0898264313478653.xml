<abstract>
<p><bold>Objectives:</bold> We examined the contribution of socioeconomic disadvantage and traumatic life events to ethnic disparities in disability among Israeli adults. <bold>Method:</bold> We used data from the Survey of Health, Aging and Retirement in Europe (SHARE-Israel), a sample of Israeli adults aged 50 or older (<italic>N</italic> = 1,546). Disability measures included functional limitations, limitations in activities of daily living (ADL), and limitations in instrumental activities of daily living (IADL). <bold>Results:</bold> Arabs and immigrants from the Former Soviet Union (FSU) experienced higher rates of functional limitations and limitations in IADLs compared to veteran Jews. The rate of having limitations in ADLs was similar for Arabs and veteran Jews, but was higher for FSU immigrants compared to veteran Jews. Inclusion of education, income, and traumatic life events attenuated, but did not eliminate ethnic disparities in disability. <bold>Discussion:</bold> Identifying factors driving ethnic health disparities in Israel is imperative if we hope to achieve health equity.</p>

<p>Ethnic minorities in Israel report, on average, greater morbidity and premature mortality than the veteran Jewish population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0898264313478653">Azaiza &amp; Brodsky, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0898264313478653">Brodsky &amp; Litwin, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0898264313478653">Na’amnih, Muhsen, Tarabeia, Saabneh, &amp; Green, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0898264313478653">Shmotkin &amp; Litwin, 2009</xref>). These disparities arise in part from the social location of minority groups within Israeli society; ethnic minorities in Israel have access to fewer material resources and may, as a result, experience greater stress, thereby conferring a higher risk for disease and disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0898264313478653">Baron-Epel &amp; Kaplan, 2009</xref>). Although a significant body of research exists documenting ethnic disparities in disability within the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0898264313478653">Hayward &amp; Heron, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0898264313478653">Kelley-Moore &amp; Ferraro, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0898264313478653">Schoeni, Freedman, &amp; Wallace, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0898264313478653">Taylor, 2008</xref>), few studies have investigated ethnic disparities in disability among the Israeli population or the social factors that account for these disparities, despite the existence of vast differences in power, resources, and education between Arabs, immigrants from the Former Soviet Union (FSU), and veteran Israeli Jews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0898264313478653">Okun &amp; Friedlander, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0898264313478653">Semyonov &amp; Lewin-Epstein, 2011</xref>). The purpose of this study is to examine how socioeconomic disadvantage and traumatic life events contribute to ethnic disparities in disability among middle-aged and older Israeli adults. We focus on disability given that functional status is a key dimension of adult health and reflects the ability of adults to live active and independent lives.</p>
<sec id="section1-0898264313478653">
<title>Background</title>
<p>Ethnicity is a central facet of Israel’s social stratification system and is a key determinant of socioeconomic status (SES) as defined by education, occupation, and income (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0898264313478653">Lewin-Epstein &amp; Semyonov, 1986</xref>). Three of the major ethnic groups in Israel include veteran Israeli Jews who were either born in Israel or immigrated to Israel before 1989, individuals who immigrated to Israel from the FSU starting in 1989 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0898264313478653">Litwin, 2009</xref>); and Arab Israelis who are Palestinians who remained in Israel after the establishment of the state in 1948 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0898264313478653">Al-Haj, 1995</xref>). Veteran Israeli Jews constitute nearly 73% of persons aged 50 and older in Israel, while FSU immigrants and Arabs constitute 19% and 8.7%, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0898264313478653">Litwin &amp; Sapir, 2008</xref>). In general, Arab Israelis experience significant political, social, and economic disadvantages, in part due to their limited access to state-sponsored opportunities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0898264313478653">Semyonov &amp; Lewin-Epstein, 2011</xref>). Arab Israelis complete fewer years of formal education, attain positions of lower occupational status, earn less, and achieve a lower standard of living compared to veteran Israeli Jews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0898264313478653">Adalah–The Legal Center for Arab Minority Rights in Israel, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0898264313478653">Okun &amp; Friedlander, 2005</xref>). Moreover, the majority of Arabs in Israel live in homogenous communities that are largely rural and underdeveloped (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0898264313478653">Adalah–The Legal Center for Arab Minority Rights in Israel, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Conversely, FSU immigrants are a highly selective group in terms of education. More than two-thirds of FSU immigrants arrived in Israel with at least a high school education, often holding professional and scientific occupations in the Soviet Union prior to immigrating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0898264313478653">Eckstein &amp; Weiss, 1998</xref>). Many FSU immigrants immigrated to Israel as middle-aged or older adults and as a result, experienced downward occupational mobility because they were unable to find jobs similar to those they held in the Soviet Union (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0898264313478653">Litwin &amp; Leshem, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0898264313478653">Raijman &amp; Semyonov, 1998</xref>). Over time, FSU immigrants have made gains in their occupational status and economic outcomes, but continue to lag behind veteran Israeli Jews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0898264313478653">Semyonov &amp; Lewin-Epstein, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Disability rates in Israel appear to mirror the social location of ethnic groups. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0898264313478653">Azaiza and Brodsky (2003)</xref> reported that in 2003, the percentage of Arab adults aged 65 and older who were disabled and needed help with activities of daily living (ADL) was twice as high as that of their Jewish counterparts. Another study of Israelis aged 60 years and older found that Arab Israelis had the greatest degree of ADL difficulty and comorbidity, followed by FSU immigrants and veteran Israeli Jews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0898264313478653">Brodsky &amp; Litwin, 2005</xref>). Although these studies provide evidence that ethnic disparities in disability exist in Israel, no study to our knowledge has moved beyond documenting these disparities to explaining them. Our study will address this gap by considering the contribution of SES and traumatic life events to ethnic disparities in disability among middle-aged and older adults in Israel.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0898264313478653">
<title>Theoretical Framework</title>
<p>We employ a life-course perspective in our study of disability and posit that although some risk factors for disability are immediate in their effects, such as physical injury, others take substantial time to manifest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0898264313478653">Ferraro, Shippee, &amp; Schafer, 2009</xref>). In this sense, disability in later life is the result of a complex interplay of social, behavioral, and biological predisposing risk factors that accumulate over the life course (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0898264313478653">Ferraro &amp; Shippee, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0898264313478653">Verbrugge &amp; Jette, 1994</xref>). Thus, a life course perspective contends that social stratification results not only in the accumulation of opportunities but also in the accumulation of risks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0898264313478653">Ferraro et al., 2009</xref>). For example, being a veteran Jewish Israeli or well-educated is likely to lead to a greater accumulation of opportunities that delays morbidity and disability, whereas being an Arab in Israel or having less education is likely to lead to a greater accumulation of risks that accelerates the onset of morbidity and disability.</p>
<p>Ethnic disparities in health occur via multiple pathways, including socioeconomic disadvantage. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0898264313478653">Link and Phelan (1995)</xref>, SES is a “fundamental cause of disease” because it impacts multiple diseases via multiple mechanisms. Indeed, the impact of SES on functional status and disability is well-documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0898264313478653">Crimmins &amp; Hagedorn, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0898264313478653">Haas, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0898264313478653">Mendes de Leon, Barnes, Bienias, Skarupski, &amp; Evans, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0898264313478653">Minkler, Fuller-Thomson, &amp; Guralnik, 2006</xref>). Individuals with low SES are exposed to greater adversity and psychosocial stress, and are more likely to engage in risky health behaviors than those with high SES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0898264313478653">Thoits, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0898264313478653">Turner, Wheaton, &amp; Lloyd, 1995</xref>). This is true in Israel as well; among Israeli adults, Arab Israelis and to a lesser extent, FSU immigrants, experience greater socioeconomic disadvantage compared to their veteran Jewish counterparts. Moreover, risk factors such as smoking, obesity, and physical inactivity are more prevalent among Arabs compared to veteran Jews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0898264313478653">National Health Survey, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0898264313478653">The Minister’s Report on Smoking in Israel, 2010</xref>), disparities that are driven, at least in part, by SES. Thus, it is likely that differences in SES between Israeli ethnic groups across the life course contribute to the higher rates of disability found among Arab Israelis documented in prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0898264313478653">Azaiza &amp; Brodsky, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0898264313478653">Brodsky &amp; Litwin, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Disadvantaged groups also experience greater psychosocial stress, in part due to greater exposure to traumatic life events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0898264313478653">Hatch &amp; Dohrenwend, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0898264313478653">Lantz, House, Mero, &amp; Williams, 2005</xref>). Repeated exposure to traumatic life events can lead to chronic activation of stress responses that may have harmful effects on the human body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0898264313478653">Ferraro &amp; Shippee, 2009</xref>). Specifically, chronic activation of stress responses is related to biochemical changes that influence cell function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0898264313478653">Epel et al., 2006</xref>) and compromises the immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0898264313478653">Lantz et al., 2005</xref>). That is, repeated exposure to stressful life events slowly produces wear and tear on internal organs that leads to the development of acute and chronic health conditions, which can contribute to disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0898264313478653">Miller, Chen, &amp; Parker, 2011</xref>). Consistent with this pathway, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0898264313478653">Krause, Shaw, and Cairney (2004)</xref> found that greater lifetime trauma was associated with less favorable self-rated health, more acute and chronic health problems in old age, as well as more limitations in ADLs and IADLs. Other studies have found that early adversity and socioeconomic disadvantage in childhood are associated with greater incidence of chronic diseases and premature mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0898264313478653">Dong et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0898264313478653">Dube et al., 2009</xref>). This suggests that traumatic events independently affect health and physical functioning.</p>
<p>A significant proportion of middle-aged and older Israeli adults have experienced adverse and potentially traumatic events across their life course (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0898264313478653">Shmotkin, 2008</xref>). Such events include, but are not limited to, the holocaust for European born Jews, forced displacement from their land for Arabs, immigration in adult life for FSU immigrants, multiple wars and terror attacks, and adjustment to a multicultural society. Further, socioeconomically disadvantaged persons are more likely to be exposed to traumatic events such as interpersonal violence, crime, and severe economic deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0898264313478653">Cubbin, LeClere, &amp; Smith, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0898264313478653">Hatch &amp; Dohrenwend, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0898264313478653">Lantz et al., 2005</xref>). Because Arabs and FSU immigrants in Israel are more socioeconomically disadvantaged, it is likely that they experience more of these traumatic life events as well.</p>
<p>A number of issues limit our understanding of the relationship between traumatic life events and disability in general, and among middle-aged and older Israeli adults in particular. First, the vast majority of studies were conducted in countries other than Israel and tended to focus on mental health outcomes such as life satisfaction, posttraumatic stress disorder, and depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0898264313478653">Gold, Marx, Soler-Baillo, &amp; Sloan, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0898264313478653">Krause, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0898264313478653">Shmotkin &amp; Litwin, 2009</xref>). Few have focused on middle-aged or older adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0898264313478653">Krause et al., 2004</xref>). Second, many studies focus on the influence of a discrete traumatic event, such as involvement in war (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0898264313478653">Shmotkin &amp; Barilan, 2002</xref>), which overlooks the possibility that individuals experience multiple traumas during their lifetime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0898264313478653">Green et al., 2000</xref>). Moreover, the effect of multiple adverse events might have a more profound effect on health than any one event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0898264313478653">Green et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0898264313478653">Thoits, 2010</xref>). For that reason, measures that consider exposure to multiple traumatic events may better capture lifetime trauma.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0898264313478653">
<title>Hypotheses</title>
<p>In view of the differences in many life domains between veteran Israeli Jews, FSU immigrants, and Arab Israelis, we explore ethnic disparities in disability and factors that contribute to explaining those disparities. We hypothesize that Arab Israelis and FSU immigrants will experience greater disability than veteran Israeli Jews and that SES will mediate the relationship between ethnicity and disability. We also hypothesize that cumulative exposure to potentially traumatic events will be positively associated with disability in older age after adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics. In addition, given that exposure to trauma is more prevalent among socioeconomically disadvantaged populations, and that Arabs and FSU immigrants in Israel are more socioeconomically disadvantaged, we speculate that exposure to traumatic events might explain some of the additional variance in ethnic disparities in disability.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section5-0898264313478653">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>We use Wave I data from the Israeli component of the Survey of Health, Aging and Retirement in Europe (SHARE-Israel), a nationally representative sample of Israelis aged 50 or older, who were interviewed during 2005 to 2006 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0898264313478653">Litwin, 2009</xref>). Using multistage probability sampling, the original SHARE-Israel sample included 2,598 noninstitutionalized adults residing in 1,774 households across 150 representative statistical areas. The initial response rate was 68.6% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0898264313478653">Litwin &amp; Sapir, 2008</xref>). Respondents were interviewed in Hebrew, Russian, or Arabic using computer-assisted personal interviewing. In the original SHARE sample, 72.2% were veteran Jews, 8.7% were Arab Israelis, and 19% were FSU immigrants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0898264313478653">Litwin &amp; Sapir, 2008</xref>). In addition, a self-administered questionnaire, which included information on traumatic life events, was left with respondents and returned to SHARE investigators upon completion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0898264313478653">Litwin &amp; Sapir, 2008</xref>). A total of 1,720 respondents (66% of the original sample) returned their completed drop-off questionnaire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0898264313478653">Shmotkin &amp; Litwin, 2009</xref>). Our analytic sample includes respondents who completed the drop-off questionnaire and who did not have missing data on any variables included in our analyses (<italic>N</italic> = 1,546; 1,197 Veteran Jews, 280 Arabs, and 69 FSU immigrants). We obtained IRB approval for our study.</p>
<p>We examined factors predicting item nonresponse among respondents who returned the drop-off questionnaire. In these models we assessed the independent effects of our dependent variables and the covariates included in our models on item nonresponse (<italic>n</italic> = 174). The only factor related to item nonresponse was limitations in IADLs; those with higher number of limitations in IADL were less likely to have missing data.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section7-0898264313478653">
<title>Dependent variables</title>
<p>In the current study, we adopt a broad definition of disability that includes three widely used measures of basic daily functioning—functional limitations, limitations in ADLs, and limitations in IADLs. Functional limitations assess restrictions in basic physical functioning. Respondents were asked if they had any difficulty: walking 100 meters; sitting for about 2 hr; getting up from a chair after sitting for long periods; climbing several flights of stairs without resting; climbing one flight of stairs without resting; stooping, kneeling, or crouching; reaching or extending arms above shoulder level; pulling or pushing large objects like a living room chair; lifting or carrying weights over 10 pounds/5 kilos, like a heavy bag of groceries; and picking up a small coin from a table. Responses to these yes/no items were summed into a count of functional limitations (range 0-10). Our measure of ADLs assesses the ability to perform basic self-care tasks without help. Respondents were asked if they have any difficulty: dressing, including putting on shoes and socks; walking across a room; bathing or showering; eating, such as cutting up food; getting in or out of bed; and using the toilet, including getting up or down. These yes/no items were summed into a count of limitations in ADLs (range 0-6). Our measure of IADLs assesses the ability to perform tasks related to household management. Respondents were asked if they had any difficulty: preparing a hot meal; shopping for groceries; making telephone calls; taking medications; doing work around the house or garden; using a map to figure out how to get around in a strange place; and managing money, such as paying bills and keeping track of expenses. These yes/no items were summed into a count of limitations in IADLs (range 0-7).</p>

<title>Independent Variables</title>
<sec id="section9-0898264313478653">
<title>Ethnicity</title>
<p>Respondents were categorized as veteran Israeli Jews, immigrants from the FSU (henceforth FSU immigrants) who arrived in Israel after 1989, and Arab Israelis.</p>

<sec id="section10-0898264313478653">
<title>SES</title>
<p>Two indicators were used to assess SES. Respondents’ highest educational degree attained was categorized as less than a high school education versus high school education or higher, and total household income categorized into tertiles.</p>

<sec id="section11-0898264313478653">
<title>Traumatic life events</title>
<p>Based on prior studies that examined the impact of stress and traumatic life events on health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0898264313478653">Green et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0898264313478653">Krause et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0898264313478653">Shmotkin &amp; Litwin, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0898264313478653">Turner et al., 1995</xref>), we constructed an index of traumatic life events using eight items that measured the occurrence of potentially traumatizing events in which the primary impact was upon the self. Respondents were asked to report whether each of the following events had ever happened to them and, if yes, the degree to which the event had affected their lives: they (a) experienced severe economic deprivation; (b) were at risk of death due to illness or serious accident; (c) needed long-term care due to difficulty in caring for themselves; (d) were wounded in war or military action; (e) were wounded in a terrorist act; (f) were a victim of crime such as robbery or fraud; (g) were the victim of violence or abuse; or (h) experienced sexual assault (rape or harassment). Responses ranged from 0 = did not occur, 1 = little effect, 2 = moderate effect, to 3 = great effect. The eight items were summed (observed range 0-20); higher scores indicated greater exposure to trauma.</p>

<p>In line with prior disability studies, we included as a covariate a count variable indicating the number of physician diagnosed health conditions reported by respondents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0898264313478653">Gallucci et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0898264313478653">Taylor, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0898264313478653">2011</xref>). These included heart attack, hypertension, stroke, diabetes, chronic lung disease, cancer, Parkinson disease, osteoporosis, cataracts, arthritis, or any other disease or condition. Demographic factors included age (in years), gender, and marital status (married vs. unmarried). The latter category includes never married, divorced, separated, and widowed.</p>

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>We began with descriptive statistics and bivariate analysis to understand the data distribution. In our multivariate models, we used negative binomial regression rather than Poisson regression to assess ethnic disparities in functional limitations, limitations in ADLs, and limitations in IADLs, due to issues of over-dispersion (i.e., the mean and variance were not equal). Our model building approach went as follows. First, we examined a basic model that adjusted for ethnicity, demographic factors, and chronic diseases. Next, we adjusted for education and gross household income to examine the extent to which SES mediates ethnic differences in disability. Lastly, we included the measure of traumatic life events to examine whether greater exposure to trauma explained ethnic disparities in disability beyond the contribution of SES. All analyses were weighted to account for the complex survey design using the <italic>svy</italic> commands in STATA 11.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0898264313478653">StataCorp, 2009</xref>).</p>

Respondents, on average, reported 2.1 functional limitations, 0.5 limitations in ADLs, and 0.7 limitations in IADLs. Over 75% were veteran Israeli Jews, 9.3% were Arab Israelis, and 15.5% were FSU immigrants. The mean score of traumatic life events was 1.7. Respondents were primarily female (54.7%), married (73.3%), and 30.9% had less than high school education. Respondents’ ages ranged from 51 to 94 (<italic>M =</italic> 65.5).</p>

<p>We found significant ethnic differences across all variables except for gender (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0898264313478653">Table 1</xref>). Arabs and FSU immigrants had the highest number of functional limitations and limitations in IADLs, whereas FSU immigrants reported the most limitations in ADLs (<italic>M</italic> = 1.0). FSU immigrants reported the highest scores on traumatic life events; Arabs reported the lowest. Arabs were younger and most likely to have less than a high school education (77.3%). Only 8.3% of Arabs and 5.9% of FSU immigrants had incomes in the top tertile compared with 38.2% of veteran Israeli Jews.</p>

Model 2 further adjusted for education and gross household income. Among Arab Israelis (IRR = 1.33), the higher rate of functional limitations was attenuated, but not eliminated, with adjustment for SES, whereas the higher rate of functional limitations among FSU immigrants increased slightly (IRR = 1.74). Having at least a high school education and having an income in the top tertile was associated with a lower rate of functional limitations compared to having less than a high school education or having an income in the bottom tertile. Traumatic life events did not attenuate ethnic differences in functional limitations (Model 3).

<title>Sensitivity Analysis</title>
<p>Given that 33% of the original sample did not return the drop-off questionnaire, we examined whether respondents who completed the drop-off questionnaire differed from those who did not complete the drop-off questionnaire. In these models, we assessed the probability of nonresponse as a function of the disability measures as well as all covariates in our models (except for traumatic life events). The only significant predictor of unit nonresponse was ethnicity; Arabs were more likely to return the questionnaire compared to veteran Israeli Jews, whereas FSU immigrants were less likely to return the questionnaire. To adjust for differences in nonresponse between the full sample and the sample who returned the drop-off questionnaire we created probability weights, which we used in the analyses we presented in this article.</p>
<p>Next, to determine if our results were driven by selection bias or the small sample size of FSU immigrants (<italic>n</italic> = 69) available in our analytic sample, we ran models 1 and 2 using the original sample of SHARE-Israel (<italic>N</italic> = 2,598). With adjustment for demographics, chronic diseases, and socioeconomic indicators, the direction and significance of the results with regard to ethnic differences in functional limitations and IADLs were similar to those based on our analytic sample (<italic>N</italic> = 1,546; results available upon request). With regard to limitations in ADLs we found no statistically significant ethnic differences in the original sample, as compared with the results based on our analytic sample which indicated higher rates of ADLs among FSU immigrants. This finding may be a function of the relatively small numbers of FSU immigrants in our analytic sample (<italic>n</italic> = 69) coupled with the rather rare occurrence of limitations in ADLs in the sample.</p>
<p>Finally, given that the need for long-term care can co-occur with disability, we reestimated our models with a measure of traumatic life events that excluded the item that assessed needing long-term care due to difficulty in caring for oneself. These results were similar in direction, magnitude, and significance to the results presented in our tables. We chose to retain this item in our analysis because it is possible that the need for long-term care occurred during earlier periods in the respondents’ lifetime (e.g., childhood, early adulthood).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Large differences in power, resources, and education exist between ethnic groups in Israel, which place Arabs and FSU immigrants at an economic or social disadvantage when compared to veteran Israeli Jews. The current study is the first to examine the contribution of SES and traumatic life events to ethnic disparities in disability among a nationally representative sample of Israeli adults age 50 or older. We hypothesized that (a) compared to veteran Israeli Jews, Arabs and FSU immigrants would experience higher rates of disability and (b) SES and traumatic life events would mediate the association between ethnicity and disability.</p>
<p>Our findings support our first hypothesis. After adjustment for demographics and chronic diseases, Arab Israelis and FSU immigrants experienced higher rates of disability as measured by functional limitations and limitations in IADLs than veteran Israeli Jews. FSU immigrants also experienced higher rates of limitations in ADLs compared with veteran Israeli Jews. Our findings are consistent with previous research that shows that Arabs and FSU immigrants have worse physical and mental health outcomes and are more disabled compared to veteran Israeli Jews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0898264313478653">Amit, &amp; Litwin, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0898264313478653">Azaiza &amp; Brodsky, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0898264313478653">Baron-Epel &amp; Kaplan, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0898264313478653">Brodsky &amp; Litwin, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0898264313478653">Shmueli, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Although prior studies have found greater rates of limitations in ADLs among Arab Israelis compared to Jews, our study did not. This inconsistency may have occurred for two reasons. First, prior research finds higher rates of premature mortality among Arab Israelis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0898264313478653">Na’amnih et al., 2010</xref>), which may have resulted in nonsignificant differences in our sample given that persons with the most severe health problems are selected out of the population, making the population that was initially disadvantaged appear better off (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0898264313478653">Ferraro &amp; Shippee, 2009</xref>). Second, having limitations in ADLs was rather rare in our sample across all groups, which is potentially a function of the age composition of our sample.</p>
<p>We found partial support for our second hypothesis. Adjustment for SES partially attenuated ethnic differences in functional limitations and limitations in IADLs among Arab Israelis but not among FSU immigrants. Traumatic life events, on the other hand, partially attenuated ethnic differences in ADL limitations among FSU immigrants, but had no effect on explaining ethnic differences in functional limitations or limitations in IADLs. With regard to SES, other studies have found similar results when assessing more general indicators of health. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0898264313478653">Baron-Epel and Kaplan (2009)</xref> found that objective measures of SES explained some of the disparities in physical and mental health between Arabs and Israeli Jews, but did not explain the disparities in physical and mental health between FSU immigrants and Israeli Jews.</p>
<p>Our findings for FSU immigrants may in part stem from the education-occupation mismatch that is commonly found among middle-aged and older FSU immigrants. That is, middle-aged and older FSU immigrants were unable to acquire jobs that were commensurate with their educational level upon immigrating to Israel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0898264313478653">Litwin &amp; Leshem, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0898264313478653">Raijman &amp; Semyonov, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0898264313478653">Semyonov &amp; Lewin-Epstein, 2011</xref>). This is consistent with research that suggests that education does not confer the same economic benefits for immigrants as it does for the native-born population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0898264313478653">Eckstein &amp; Weiss, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>The health of immigrant populations often differs from the health of the native-born population. That is, health selection effects usually result in immigrants being healthier than the host population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0898264313478653">Singh &amp; Miller, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0898264313478653">Singh &amp; Siahpush, 2002</xref>). The interaction between health and migration is, however, complex. In most studies, it is not clear whether migration leads to better health or if better health precedes migration. Unlike many countries, however, Israel’s “open door” immigration policy allows Jews from around the world to immigrate to Israel regardless of age, education, income, or health status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0898264313478653">Carmel, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0898264313478653">Emmons, 1997</xref>). It is possible that FSU immigrants who were in poorer health while living in the FSU were more likely to immigrate to Israel. Whether the higher rate of disability found among FSU immigrants is due to their downward social mobility upon arrival to Israel or to their poorer health prior to migration warrants further investigation.</p>
<p>Our results also show that traumatic life events were associated with higher rates of functional limitations, limitations in ADLs, and limitations in IADLs among Israeli adults. Further, traumatic life events explained some of the ethnic disparities in limitations in ADLs between FSU immigrants and veteran Jews, but did not explain ethnic differences in functional limitations or limitations in IADLs. Decades of research provide convincing evidence of the cumulative impact of stressors on individuals’ physical and mental health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0898264313478653">Lantz et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0898264313478653">Thoits, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0898264313478653">Turner &amp; Avison, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0898264313478653">Turner et al., 1995</xref>) and its role in producing health inequities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0898264313478653">Thoits, 2010</xref>). The lack of attenuation of ethnic disparities in functional limitations and limitations in IADLs after adjusting for traumatic life events could partly be a function of the limited range of stressors included in our measure which may not have captured the broad scope of stressful life events that Arab Israelis and FSU immigrants endured over their life course. Indeed, this may be part of the reason why Arab Israelis reported lower scores on our measure of traumatic life events than veteran Israeli Jews.</p>
<p>Other sources of stress due to perceived social constraints, discrimination, migration, and political exclusion might also contribute to higher levels of psychosocial stress that culminate into the development of disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0898264313478653">Gee &amp; Walsemann, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0898264313478653">Williams &amp; Mohammed, 2009</xref>). For example, the internal displacement process that Arabs endured during the 1948 war and the years following the establishment of the state of Israel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0898264313478653">Wakim, 2001</xref>) may have resulted in historical grief and trauma akin to that experienced by the American Indians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0898264313478653">Brave Heart &amp; DeBruyn, 1998</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0898264313478653">BADIL, the Resource Center for Palestinian Residency &amp; Refugee Rights (2009)</xref>, approximately 25% to 30% of current Palestinian citizens of Israel are internally displaced persons (IDPs) or descendants of IDPs. Adversities experienced by IDPs increases their exposure to psychological distress and can have a negative impact on their health. A recent study among Palestinians in Israel found that IDPs reported significantly poorer self-rated health compared to non-IDPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0898264313478653">Daoud, Shankardass, O’Campo, Anderson, &amp; Agbaria, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0898264313478653">Porter &amp; Haslam, 2005</xref>). Future research should examine the impact of these types of trauma on the physical health of the Arab Israeli population.</p>
<p>Overall, our findings lend additional support to the importance of taking a life course perspective when examining disability risk within the Israeli context. First, a life course perspective contends that social stratification results in the accumulation of not only opportunities but also risks that either accelerates the onset of disability or delays it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0898264313478653">Ferraro et al., 2009</xref>). Our results provide evidence that key forms of social stratification in Israel—including ethnicity and SES—impact the risk of disability among middle-aged and older adults. Moreover, we find that SES partially explains ethnic disparities in disability, something we expected given prior work that posits SES is a fundamental cause of disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0898264313478653">Link &amp; Phelan, 1995</xref>). Second, our findings support the proposition that the accumulation of trauma, and not just the experience of one discrete traumatic event, is important for the development of disability among this population.</p>
<p>The residual ethnic disparities in disability found after adjusting for SES and traumatic life events suggests that there are additional mechanisms linking ethnicity to disability within the Israeli population. Beyond SES and traumatic life events, commonly considered mechanisms include lifestyle behaviors (e.g., physical activity, diet, and smoking), residential segregation, and chronic psychosocial stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0898264313478653">Falah, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0898264313478653">National Health Survey, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0898264313478653">The Minister’s Report on Smoking in Israel, 2010</xref>). Future studies should explore these additional mechanisms as a way to better understand how social stratification within Israel shapes population health.</p>
<sec id="section20-0898264313478653">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Very few FSU immigrants reported limitations in ADLs in our restricted sample; thus, these estimates may be unstable and may be one reason why we found different results in our restricted sample as compared to results from the full sample. In addition, economic disadvantage and traumatic life events are only two sources of stress. Other sources of chronic stress, such as discrimination, should be examined in future studies. Finally, there is considerable ethnic heterogeneity within the veteran Jewish population (e.g., European Jews vs. North African Jews), which was not addressed in the present analysis. An important extension of the current study would be to further consider how advantage or disadvantage, as well as exposure to traumatic life events are differentially structured within veteran Jewish ethnic groups and how these experiences contribute to rates of disability in midlife and older adulthood.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Our findings support a fundamental cause perspective and suggest that SES and traumatic life events contribute to the occurrence of disability among Israeli middle-aged and older adults; however, the effect of SES explained more of the ethnic disparities in disability than the effect of traumatic life events. In addition, the effect of SES on disability was more salient for Arabs than it was for FSU immigrants. As the population in Israel ages, the number of people with disability will rise. Identifying the social factors driving ethnic disparities in disability is imperative if we hope to achieve health equity within the Israeli population.</p>
