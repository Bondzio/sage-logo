<abstract>
<p>The need for improved cost planning methods for solid waste management (SWM) is particularly strong in emerging economies where problems are severe, expectations for improvements are high, but finances are constrained. Estimating cost functions is suggested as an improved cost planning method. The research uses 1999 data from 298 Indian municipalities, covering over 140 million people. Stepwise multiple regression involving eight predictor variables was conducted on costs to detect any statistically significant correlations. The average costs on either a per tonne or per capita basis are most influenced by the total number of staff employed per capita or per tonne. The results are believed to be due to labour costs being such a high fraction of total costs in developing countries. Due to high variability in labour intensity between municipalities the data showed no clear correlation between per tonne or per capita costs and population, indicating no economy-of-scale. The data used here are subject to significant conjecture over their quality and age; however, the unique nature of the study should help future researchers investigating costs in emerging economies</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Few advances have been made in estimating direct monetary costs of solid waste management (SWM), in spite of many publications emphasizing the importance of understanding the ‘true costs’ of the service in developing countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0734242X11425565">Cointreau-Levine, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0734242X11425565">Diaz et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0734242X11425565">Parthan and Milke, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0734242X11425565">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0734242X11425565">Scheinberg et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0734242X11425565">Zhu et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Current cost estimation approaches used in developing countries generally follow the unit cost method, for example in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0734242X11425565">Asnani (2006)</xref>, which disaggregates each activity (e.g. collection, disposal) into separate items (e.g. salaries, fuel costs), noting the required quantity of each item, multiplying this with the cost per item or unit cost (developed from existing datasets or taken from price quotes) to arrive at the total cost. Knowing the population of an area or the total waste collected in an area, the average costs per capita or per tonne are calculated. To predict future investment needs, these per tonne or per capita values from the unit cost method are multiplied by the projected quantities of waste materials or population. There are three problems with these conventional cost-estimating methods. One is that these rough estimates do not help compare costs between cities, which would help in noticing particular cities that have developed better and efficient practices. Second, it does not allow analysis of the factors that influence costs on a per person or per tonne basis. Third and most importantly these current approaches do not particularly facilitate upgrading of solid waste practices, for example, estimating the cost associated with expanding the use of door-to-door collection in place of community bin collection; issues of such nature are commonly encountered by rapidly growing economies. New methods for cost planning will support waste managers when faced with difficult decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0734242X11425565">Milke, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Waste planners in the developed world increasingly use cost functions to avoid limitations of the unit cost method. A cost function is the relationship between the dependent variable which is costs, and one or more independent variables affecting costs. The variable coefficients are best estimated using regression analysis, a statistical technique. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0734242X11425565">Porter (2002)</xref> in his engaging book on the economics of waste shows how cost functions can be used by society to make decisions that are economically efficient. Developing cost functions for SWM has a number of advantages. They can help a planner in evaluating performance of different locations by allowing comparison (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0734242X11425565">Clark et al., 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0734242X11425565">Hirsch, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0734242X11425565">Stevens, 1978</xref>). They allow for future predictions such as examining the cost implications of increasing the frequency of waste collection from once to twice a day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0734242X11425565">Bagby et al., 1998</xref>; Pesko et al., 2003; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0734242X11425565">Ramboll/COWI Joint Venture, 2002</xref>). They allow one to draw conclusions concerning economies of scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0734242X11425565">Callan and Thomas, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0734242X11425565">Stevens, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0734242X11425565">Tsilemou and Panagiotakopoulos, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0734242X11425565">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0734242X11425565">Wilson, 1981</xref>). They can be used to find what set of inputs will minimize system costs for a given level of service (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0734242X11425565">Stevens, 1978</xref>).</p>
<p>The need for developing SWM cost functions is particularly strong in developing countries since problems of waste are critical but finances are limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0734242X11425565">Milke, 2006</xref>). The need for cost functions as an improved cost planning method is well understood in another type of public service- healthcare management. This is evident from the many publications on the topic, even on developing countries (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0734242X11425565">Riewpaiboon et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0734242X11425565">Wagstaff and Barnum, 1992</xref>). The World Health Organization cost project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0734242X11425565">WHO-CHOICE, 2011</xref>) has involved assembling publications, tools and standardized methods for cost estimation, and establishing regional databases or country-specific unit cost estimates using the cost function methodology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0734242X11425565">Adam et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>As no previous attempts to perform a SWM cost function analysis have been published for developing countries, the objective of this paper was to arrive at cost functions for a typical developing country dataset while stepping through the method previously used to arrive at cost functions for developed countries.</p>

<title>The Indian NIUA dataset</title>
<p>It is rare to have large datasets available for SWM cost function analysis. A previously unanalysed but comprehensive developing country dataset that presented this unique opportunity of performing a cost function analysis was from the National Institute of Urban Affairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0734242X11425565">NIUA, 2005</xref>) in India. Statistical volume III of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0734242X11425565">NIUA (2005)</xref> report covered a sample of 298 cities and towns out of almost 700 districts in India, with a total population of over 140 million people. The sampled cities and towns have been divided according to the following population ranges: Metropolitan cities (population &gt; 1 000 000) [<italic>n</italic> = 22], Class I cities (100 000 &lt; population &lt; 1 000 000) [<italic>n</italic> = 164], and Class II towns (50 000 &lt; population &lt; 100 000) [<italic>n</italic> = 112] according to the 1991 Indian census to correspond with degree of urbanization or industrialization. The NIUA Class II data also includes six towns with a population of less than 50 000. These are the capitals of the relatively small states and union territories and have been merged with Class II towns to avoid a fourth classification of towns with a very small sample size. The three ranges seem to describe distinct municipal solid waste (MSW) management practices based on their differing average waste generation rates of 0.5 kg person<sup>−1</sup> day<sup>−1</sup> in metropolitan cities, 0.377 kg person<sup>−1</sup> day<sup>−1</sup> in Class I cities and 0.297 kg person<sup>−1</sup> day<sup>−1</sup> in Class II towns.</p>
<p>Costs provided in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0734242X11425565">NIUA (2005)</xref> report are the expenditures incurred on SWM for the year 1997–1998 by individual municipalities; over 75% of these reported costs constitute expenditures incurred on salary and wages by individual municipalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0734242X11425565">NIUA, 2005</xref>). Data on annual waste collected in tonnes is also provided. Unless otherwise stated all data is from the year 1999. Other data are provided for: population and area served (in km<sup>2</sup>), transportation vehicles and number of trips made per day, amount of waste transported in tonnes, quantities of waste disposed and composted (in tonnes), landfill details on area and future life, total number of staff employed by the municipality, costs spent on private contracts in Indian rupees (reported by 24 out of 298 municipalities), revenue receipts in Indian rupees in 1997–1998, capital works undertaken between 1994–1999 and future capital works proposed by each municipality.</p>

<title>Selecting scale-free cost/dependent variable</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0734242X11425565">Figure 1</xref> indicates that waste collected per person varies from 0.1 to 0.7 kg in India. Note that both population and waste data estimated for the year 1999 from the NIUA report have been considered in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0734242X11425565">Figure 1</xref>. Inferences from costs correlated with population and costs correlated with waste quantity could be different. Hence two cost analyses are performed in this paper: one with cost per capita (CPC) and the other with cost per tonne (CPT).</p>

<p>The CPC is actually CPC per year but will be referred to as CPC in this paper for the sake of convenience. The authors have adjusted the total SWM expenditure provided for the year 1997–1998 in the NIUA report to 1 April 1999 (the start of the financial year in India), using rates of inflation from the Labour Bureau, Government of India, and an exchange rate of 1 US$ = 45 Indian rupees in 1999.</p>

<sec id="section5-0734242X11425565">
<title>Selecting independent variables</title>
<p>As no previous developing country literature was available to provide guidance on choosing appropriate cost determinants, selected socio-economic variables, for which information was available from the NIUA report, and which were presumed to have an effect on the dependent cost variables, are considered in this analysis. The following brief description of these variables indicates why or how they are determined. All these variables are applicable for the year 1999 to be consistent with the year for which total costs are computed.</p>
<list id="list1-0734242X11425565" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>Population density (number of persons km<sup>−2</sup>) (<italic>x</italic><sub>1</sub>): this is obtained by dividing the estimated population by the estimated area (in km<sup>2</sup>), both data obtained from the NIUA report. One might expect the CPC to be lower for cities that have higher population densities because of lower transport costs. On the other hand, it is harder to collect waste from densely populated areas in India (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0734242X11425565">Coad, 1997</xref>), which negatively affects the efficiency of the collection worker.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Waste collected per unit area or WPA (tonnes km<sup>−2</sup>) (<italic>x</italic><sub>2</sub>): WPA was measured as a ratio of waste collected per municipality and the estimated area (in km<sup>2</sup>). In the absence of weighbridges, the mass of waste collected is estimated based on the approximate volumes of waste collected by the transport vehicles. One might expect the CPC to be lower for cities with higher waste per unit area. If other non-municipal organizations, such as non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and community-based organizations (CBOs) share the responsibility, it is expected that the municipality’s costs per person will reduce; hence the effect of this variable on costs per person is studied.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Number of vehicles used for transportation (<italic>x</italic><sub>3</sub>): this was obtained by adding the number of motorized and non-motorized vehicles used for SWM in a city or town. Although not stated, it was assumed that the total includes out-of-service vehicles, because the NIUA study indicates that an average of 15% of vehicles are out of service at any given point of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0734242X11425565">NIUA, 2005</xref>). The depreciation, fuel and maintenance costs for a large number of vehicles can contribute significantly to the total costs of SWM for a municipality, and inefficient vehicle use would be expected to correlate with higher overall costs. This variable was normalized to give a variable on a per person basis, and also normalized to give a variable on a per tonne collected basis.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Average trips per vehicle per day (<italic>x</italic><sub>4</sub>): this is the average number of trips made by both motorized and non-motorized vehicles to transport waste from community bins and transfer stations (if any) to specified dumping sites. When these ‘legal’ dumpsites are situated far away from the city, the number of trips per day made by each transportation vehicle decreases, and the cost increases. This variable could show inefficiencies in waste transportation that are reflected in total costs.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Total number of staff employed (<italic>x</italic><sub>5</sub>): SWM activities are highly labour intensive in India. The salaries or wages of the municipal staff employed contribute anywhere between 10 and 70% of total costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0734242X11425565">Zhu et al., 2008</xref>). The data used here are the sum of the supervisory and sub-ordinate staff employed in the SWM sector. This variable was normalized by dividing by either the population or the tones year<sup>−1</sup> collected as appropriate.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Frequency of collection (<italic>x</italic><sub>6</sub>): collection frequency contributes to collection costs which in turn affects the total costs. As the minimum and most frequent collection is once daily in most municipalities across the country, it has been classified as a categorical variable; taking the value 0 if waste is collected once daily and 1 if it is collected more than once. Roughly 14% from the metropolitan sample, and 40% from the Class I and Class II sample of the NIUA report were reported to have collection more than once per day.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Privatization (<italic>x</italic><sub>7</sub>): Certain activities such as collection, disposal, and transportation, are privatized in certain municipalities by contracting them to formal private firms. Privatization is being encouraged in the SW sector in India as it has been observed to reduce average expenditures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0734242X11425565">NIUA, 2005</xref>). Hence this was included as an independent categorical variable that takes the value 0 if no activity of SWM is privatized and 1 if some aspect is privatized. Costs from the NIUA report exclude those of private organizations working under contract to municipalities. Roughly 43% from the metropolitan sample, 78 % from the Class I sample and 88% from the Class II sample of the NIUA report have not privatized any of their SWM activities to a private firm, meaning that the service is managed by the municipality alone.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Medical waste collected and disposed separately (<italic>x</italic><sub>8</sub>): Medical wastes, as per Indian law, have to be collected and disposed separately (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0734242X11425565">NIUA, 2005</xref>). However, in reality it has been observed that very few cities actually collect and dispose of them separately (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0734242X11425565">NIUA, 2005</xref>), perhaps fearing the additional cost that they might incur. Hence the effect of this variable on total costs was studied. This was classified as a categorical variable taking the value 0 if it is not collected and disposed separately and the value 1 otherwise. Roughly 28% from the metropolitan sample, 17% from the Class I sample and 16% of the Class II sample of the NIUA report were reported as not collecting and disposing their medical wastes separately.</p></list-item>

<title>Development of cost functions</title>
<p>Estimating cost functions requires a statistical tool that measures the average amount of change in the dependent variable associated with a unit change in one or more independent variables while taking all observations into consideration. Regression analysis allows one to best estimate the parameter values or constants in a cost function and has thus been used by previous researchers conducting cost function studies for solid waste management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0734242X11425565">Chang and Wang, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0734242X11425565">Clark et al., 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0734242X11425565">Hirsch, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0734242X11425565">Tsilemou and Panagiotakopoulos, 2006</xref>). Linear regression was conducted using SPSS 17 software. Stepwise regression was used to evaluate correlation. This method involves finding the best predictive variable, then controlling for its effect, and finding the next best predictor, and so on. This has the advantage of reducing the impact of co-linearity between predictive variables. In addition, the stepwise method seemed defensible in this study as no previous research of this nature was cited in the available solid waste literature for developing countries on which to base specific hypothesis for testing. A pre-set condition in stepwise regression procedure was that those variables below a significance level of 0.05 (<italic>p</italic> value associated with the <italic>t</italic>-test) would not be considered as statistically significant and would be automatically excluded from the model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0734242X11425565">Field, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Variables that are highly correlated with another explanatory variable cannot be considered independent and should be excluded. Scatter plot matrices can be useful if correlations are high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0734242X11425565">Mukherjee et al., 1998</xref>), but for this intensely scattered dataset they were not of much help. Hence a correlation matrix that gives correlations between all pairs of variables in a dataset was developed. A Pearson’s correlation coefficient was found and tests for significance conducted. A value of 0.7 or more was considered a strong association between independent variables indicating that both variables were measuring the same phenomena and that one of them could be eliminated. It was decided that the independent variables having a higher correlation with the dependent variable will be retained and the other will be excluded in the next part of analysis. The strongest correlation was between two candidate independent variables, namely population density (<italic>x</italic><sub>1</sub>) and WPA (<italic>x</italic><sub>2</sub>), indicating that one might be derived from the other in certain cases. Nevertheless unless a correlation ≥ 0.7 was reported, both variables were used in the stepwise regression.</p>
<p>Outliers had a strong effect on the results in this study. Those municipalities having unusually large differences between observed and predicted values (i.e. large regression residuals), are considered potential data outliers. <italic>Standardized residuals</italic> are residuals after they have been constrained to a mean of zero and a standard deviation of 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0734242X11425565">Field, 2009</xref>). Those municipalities having a standardized residual less than −3.0 and greater than 3.0 were defined as outliers. Outliers were removed individually, and the remaining dataset checked for further outliers. The total number of outliers removed is listed in Annex 2 of the supplementary file.</p>

<title>Cost function analysis</title>
<p>The cost functions developed are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0734242X11425565">Table 1</xref> (statistical details in Annex 3 of the supplementary file). The total number of staff, <italic>x</italic><sub>5</sub>, plays a significant role in every population range. More staff per tonne or per capita, is correlated with higher per tonne or per capita costs. This highlights the observation in solid waste literature that the service is highly labour intensive in developing countries and that major costs are salaries of staff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0734242X11425565">Hanrahan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0734242X11425565">NIUA, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0734242X11425565">Zhu et al., 2008</xref>). Thus the higher the number of staff employed per tonne or per capita, the higher are the per tonne or per capita costs. Because a large fraction of costs are labour costs, the high variability in costs per capita and costs per tonne indicate large variations in labour costs even after normalizing by population served or waste collected.</p>

<p>At first glance, the hypothesis that other variables such as <italic>x</italic><sub>3</sub>, <italic>x</italic><sub>7</sub>, <italic>x</italic><sub>6</sub> and <italic>x</italic><sub>1</sub> are useful in predicting total costs of SWM seems reasonable, but their relative importance when compared with <italic>x</italic><sub>5</sub> shows that they are weakly significant in cost predictions of SWM.

<p>The values in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0734242X11425565">Table 3</xref> show some trend between unit costs and population range indicating a possibility that economies of scale exist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0734242X11425565">Hanrahan et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The results of our study (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0734242X11425565">Figure 2</xref>) also indicate that more populous urban areas do not incur higher costs per person or costs per tonne for their SWM service than less populated cities. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0734242X11425565">Table 1</xref> and irrespective of population ranges (or city size), the total number of staff employed per person and per tonne is the single most important factor affecting unit costs of municipal SWM. High variability in labour intensity between municipalities within population ranges could be the reason that no trend could be established between unit costs and population in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0734242X11425565">Figure 2</xref>. Despite including privatization in the analysis, which could have potentially reduced distortion resulting from the variability in labour intensity, there was no indication that economies of scale existed.</p>

<title>Data limitations</title>
<p>The results of this study should be used with caution. For example, while calculating costs per person the correct population serviced by the municipality in 1999 was not known and instead the 1991 census population was projected to 1999. SWM in India is highly decentralized and is known to be managed by various agencies other than the municipality of the city. As per the NIUA report, a certain population of the city could be serviced by private agencies, some others by NGOs, some by community-based organizations, some by a public–private partnership and so on. This shared responsibility varies from one city to another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0734242X11425565">NIUA, 2005</xref>). This might be one source of error while calculating CPC causing it to be lower than actual. In the absence of weighbridges, a potential source of error that causes CPT to be higher than actual is that the actual waste collected may be estimated from assumed volumes at the waste disposal sites; the actual waste quantities collected being reduced by informal recycling that happens all along the SWM pathway. The potential for large uncollected parts of the city could also affect the proper evaluation of per capita costs. A potential problem affecting costs per tonne could be that the parts of the city where waste are not collected are also the parts where it is expensive to provide services; possibly underestimating the true costs per tonne if the whole city were to be serviced.</p>
<p>Unfortunately proper documentation of an extensive SWM database like that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0734242X11425565">NIUA (2005)</xref> in developing countries is often a challenge and even if such data are available, it may be subject to serious conjecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0734242X11425565">Parthan and Milke, 2009</xref>). The reliance of the cost function approach on good cost data could be seen as a strong motivation for solid waste managers of developing countries to further improve their accounting procedures.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>It is rare to have a comprehensive cost dataset such as the one published by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0734242X11425565">NIUA (2005)</xref> in emerging economies such as India. The results from this study show the potential, and limitations, of performing cost function analysis for SWM from developing countries. The models suggested here must be used with caution as the equations in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0734242X11425565">Table 1</xref> are not a perfect fit to the data. Furthermore, there are a number of sources of uncertainty and error such as doubts about accuracy and precision of the data. Cost evaluation of SWM, generally done on a cost per person basis or cost per tonne basis, requires good estimates of the population serviced and good documentation of the amount of waste collected by the organization that handles it. It is acknowledged that there are a number of organizations that manage waste materials in developing countries and that maintaining a good SWM database can be a daunting task. In spite of these limitations, the analysis indicates strong evidence in support of the importance of the number of staff employed per capita as a cost estimator for developing economies such as India.</p>
<p>Division into population ranges, which is commonly done during cost estimation of SWM activities in India, appears to be neither necessary nor useful. Nevertheless more analysis is required to understand the correlation of unit costs and population. Further research should include an integrated system that takes into account the cost implications of other small organizations operating alongside a municipality that employs the informal sector. These organizations play a significant role in performing the service in developing countries such as India, hence not taking such organizations into account can cause serious deficiencies while developing cost functions for SWM.</p>
<p>Similar complexities and variabilities from developing countries have not hindered research in the healthcare management sector to advance cost function analyses. That example indicates how a similar concerted effort could benefit SWM.</p>
<p>The cost function method and results are presented for the Indian SWM scenario in this paper, but with the great diversity included within such a large country, the results should extend to other developing counties. It is hoped that the methodology suggested here will be a useful starting point, and further study on this aspect is stimulated for those working in developing countries.</p>
