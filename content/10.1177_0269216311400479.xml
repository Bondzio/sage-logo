<abstract>
<p>This paper reports on undergraduate students’ evaluation of a new hospice-based interprofessional practice placement (IPP) that took place in the voluntary sector from 2008 to 2009. Ward-based interprofessional training has been successfully demonstrated in a range of clinical environments. However, the multidisciplinary setting within a hospice in-patient unit offered a new opportunity for interprofessional learning. The development and delivery of the IPP initiative is described, whereby multidisciplinary groups of 12 students provided hands-on care for a selected group of patients, under the supervision of trained health care professionals. The placement was positively evaluated and students reported an increased understanding of both their own role and that of other professionals in the team. The evaluation also suggests that additional learning opportunities were provided by the in-patient palliative care unit. The results of this evaluation suggest that the in-patient unit of a hospice caring for patients with life-limiting illness provides a suitable environment to demonstrate and learn about interprofessional practice.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>‘Professionals in Health and Social Care today need to work both professionally and interprofessionally, taking responsibility for their own role and knowledge in complex patient/client cases and having respect for other professions’ role and knowledge in the problem area’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269216311400479">1</xref></sup> Reflecting on this observation, the importance of interprofessional education (IPE) in the training of health care professionals has been recognized nationally and internationally.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269216311400479">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269216311400479">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Reviews of interprofessional training, conducted in 2007 and 2009, have demonstrated the evolution of IPE,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269216311400479">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269216311400479">5</xref></sup> but have also highlighted the need for the development of assessment tools to improve IPE curricula and delivery, together with further evaluation of IPE in real and simulated practice settings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269216311400479">4</xref></sup> There has also been a call for more rigorous randomized control trials to improve the evidence base.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269216311400479">5</xref></sup> In this paper, we report a new undergraduate interprofessional initiative introduced in a real hospice setting with real patients.</p>
<p>Dying patients have complex needs that extend beyond their physical care as ‘social, psychological, emotional and spiritual needs are equally significant care provisions for patients and their families…’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269216311400479">6</xref></sup> To provide a holistic approach in supporting these patients, palliative care is delivered by the multidisciplinary team. There has been a number of reported interprofessional training schemes developed in the palliative setting, including a four-week training course incorporating contact with carers and two clinical days,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269216311400479">6</xref></sup> interdisciplinary workshops exploring death and dying<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269216311400479">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269216311400479">8</xref></sup> and an interprofessional workshop reflecting on carers’ experiences of terminal illness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269216311400479">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269216311400479">10</xref></sup> However, within these interventions, there was limited patient contact. The multidisciplinary work setting in the clinical environment presented a new opportunity for developing interprofessional learning.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0269216311400479">
<title>Background of interprofessional practice placements</title>
<p>The concept of ward-based IPE was established at Linköping University, Sweden, where a training ward was developed to provide students from multiprofessional backgrounds with the experience of running an ordinary ward with authentic patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269216311400479">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269216311400479">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269216311400479">12</xref></sup> This model was subsequently employed as a pilot in the UK to train interprofessional students at the Royal London Hospital.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269216311400479">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Following this, a new training ward for students from St. George’s, Kingston and Brunel, Universities of London, was launched in October 2004 at Queen Mary’s Hospital (QMH), Roehampton, on an elderly rehabilitation ward. The vision was not only to provide a ‘real-life’ clinical-based learning experience for medical, nursing and therapy students to explore and develop their own unique professional skills, but also to work and learn together as an integrated interprofessional team. The programme provided the opportunity for each professional group to acquire certain basic skills, knowledge and understanding from which to develop their discipline-specific skills and competences. The care delivery sites were selected for their suitability for interprofessional learning because of their multiprofessional character. Both the rehabilitation ward at QMH and palliative care ward at Princess Alice Hospice (PAH) were known for providing expertise from a range of professionals whose mission was to work together on patient-centred care. With student facilitator support, staff were well-placed to supervise teams of students who were given responsibility for the planning and provision of care for an allocated group of patients and for leading the shift and managing the team. On the final day of each placement a student conference took place to which members of the multidisciplinary team were invited. The conference provided a forum for each of the student teams to give a short presentation reflecting on their experience of interprofessional working. Thus the interprofessional practice placement (IPP) was present in the manifest health professional’s curricula through the explicit learning outcomes that were made clear to students and staff and subsequently assessed. It was also present in the ‘hidden’ or implicit curriculum,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269216311400479">14</xref></sup> which aimed to provide positive role modelling by staff on site and to openly address issues through opportunities for reflection and de-briefing with the generic facilitator and other members of staff.The evaluation of the QMH programme was positive and the students identified that they had learned as much about relationships and professionalism as clinical skill development. With a view to expanding the IPP programme, PAH was invited to become a new host site in January 2008. The multidisciplinary hospice context for the programme was expected to facilitate a collaborative interprofessional atmosphere where student groups could work together and begin to understand the different dimensions of other health care profession roles.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0269216311400479" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>To steer the development of the placement and adapt the model to a palliative care setting, a project group was established and met monthly for six months prior to the commencement of the placement. An overall project facilitator with a background in nursing was identified and supported by two further facilitators from medical and therapy backgrounds. Whilst the facilitators had responsibility for running the programme, the students were to be supported in practice by a team of dedicated ward-based mentors who received a full day of IPP training.</p>
<p>The programme was constructed around blocks of 12 students attending for three weeks in six rotations from September 2008 to May 2009. The IPP was designed around a nursing shift pattern to give the students greater continuity of care for their patients, and also to experience the health care environment at different times of the day. The disadvantage of this shift pattern is that inevitably the role of the nursing profession can become more dominant; however, we ensured that learning opportunities with the other professions were maximized during their normal working hours. Each group comprised a mixture of final-year students from different professions, including nursing, occupational therapy, physiotherapy and medicine. The students could self-select to undertake the placement; however, numbers were made up by randomly allocating other students to the unfilled placements.</p>
<p>A two-day induction programme was developed to help prepare the students for the hospice environment. The purpose of the induction was to ensure all students understood the learning outcomes of the placement and aimed to alleviate any fears the students may have about working in the palliative care setting. To enhance the educational and training opportunities, a timetable of relevant daily tutorial topics and reflective practice sessions was agreed. To support the program, a PAH site-specific section of the student handbook was created, which included an IPP reading list. The project group also designed a patient and carer information leaflet to explain the purpose of the IPP. The aim was to help patients understand what to expect and to highlight how they could raise any concerns.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0269216311400479">
<title>Evaluating the programme</title>
<p>As the IPP was a new initiative at PAH and had not previously been piloted in a palliative care setting, four evaluations were conducted from a range of sources: (1) a generic written evaluation of the student experience of the IPP placement was already in use for placements across this and other sites, incorporating a structured questionnaire with responses measured along a Likert scale, together with space for free-text comments made in response to open questions about the interprofessional learning experience; (2) a specific evaluation for students on placement at PAH, using open questions to explore the experience of IPP in a palliative care setting; (3) patient evaluations of the students’ practice; (4) mentor evaluations of the placement. This provided a broad spectrum of feedback triangulating the perceptions of learners with those involved in the delivery of the programme and the patients.</p>
<p>This paper has been written to focus on the evaluation from the student perspective and is one of a series of articles. Detailed evaluations were also collected from the mentors throughout the programme. These evaluations have been collated and will be written up by one of our colleagues. Patient evaluations were completed, but due to the high turnover of patients during the placement and the nature of our patient population, the number of completed evaluations was unfortunately low. However, in the future we would like to explore better ways of getting feedback from patients, as ultimately the goal of IPP is to improve the patient experience.</p>

<p>The recurring themes from the written free-text and verbal feedback were also very informative about the students’ experience. The free-text evaluations were reviewed both individually and as a group by the nurse, medical and therapy facilitators in order to identify the emerging themes and specific areas of learning. Examples of feedback regarding the most useful aspects of the placement for learning about interprofessional teamwork included:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Medical student:</speaker>
<p>Close working with nursing students greatly enhanced my understanding of their work and pressures.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Medical student:</speaker>
<p>I felt the nursing and medical students were really able to learn from each other – theory from medics and hands on care from nurses.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Nursing student:</speaker>
<p>…the importance of understanding your own role and contribution to a team and taking responsibility.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Nursing student:</speaker>
<p>Working in the same team as medical students made me realise we do not work separately but can work together very easily.</p>
</speech>
<p>The free-text comments also contained positive evaluations of the overall interprofessional learning experience:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Fantastic experience, all disciplines should experience IPP.</p>
<p>Subtle learning about myself, how I work in a team and communicate with patients and professionals.Very good placement, I learnt a lot working with other members of the team.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>When asked about the least useful aspects of the placement, comments centred on the structure of the programme and the mix of different students attending the placement:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Therapy student:</speaker>
<p>Shift work was exhausting – but now understand what it is like for nursing staff on shifts.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Medical student:</speaker>
<p>Being ward-based and following nurse shift pattern made the placement very nursing in nature.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Medical student:</speaker>
<p>Initially felt like ‘a fish out of water’ providing personal care to patients, but over first few shifts this diminished.</p>
</speech>
<p>Although negative interprofessional attitudes were not specifically explored as part of the evaluation process, there were no negative comments made about students from other professions within the general free-text statements.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0269216311400479">
<title>Interprofessional learning in the hospice setting</title>
<p>The results demonstrate the additional learning opportunities that the students felt they gained from carrying out this placement on an in-patient palliative care unit, what they found challenging and how they felt their practice may change in future as a consequence of the placement. In addition to learning more about the individual roles of different health care professionals, students demonstrated an increased understanding of the wider role of the multidisciplinary team, reflecting the day-to-day clinical practice on the hospice ward.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><bold>Regarding learning experiences</bold>: The importance in team working and MDT even in the terminal stages of life</p>
<p><bold>Regarding teamwork/communication</bold>: Contribution of all the different MDT members needed to provide good holistic care for patients and families.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A key learning experience for all students was their involvement in managing a death. Forty-two students were involved in managing the death of a patient during their placement. Of these students, 16 found the experience distressing whilst 26 stated that they had not found it distressing. However, the students apart from one stated they would feel better prepared for the death of a patient in the future. When asked what they learnt from this experience, the responses fell into three main areas: symptom control, communication and other experiences:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><bold>Regarding symptom control</bold>: Importance of listening and caring about small things at the end.</p>
<p><bold>Regarding communication</bold>: To be open and honest when discussing death with patients and family.</p>
<p><bold>Regarding other learning experiences</bold>: The process of dying was very new to me, I was not sure how I would cope but I now feel I can.</p>
<p><bold>Regarding other learning experiences</bold>: Not to be afraid of death but appreciate the responsibility we have to give all patients as ‘good a death’ as possible.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Examples of some of the challenges the students experienced whilst working in the palliative setting reflect both the nature of the work and the students’ personal reaction to it:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><bold>Regarding the challenge of the hospice setting</bold>: Constant process of breaking bad news, but felt very supported by the team.</p>
<p><bold>Regarding the challenge of the hospice setting</bold>: Consoling a husband of a dying patient.</p>
<p><bold>Regarding the challenge of the hospice setting</bold>: Dealing with own emotions regarding own experiences of death - reflections were very beneficial for this.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>All the students who undertook the IPP at PAH stated that they felt the placement would change their practice in the future.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this paper, we report the development and delivery of a new undergraduate interprofessional educational initiative in a hospice in-patient unit. Fifty-nine students successfully completed the programme and the overall feedback was positive, demonstrating an important learning opportunity for both students and staff. The extensive planning and preparation work conducted prior to the initiation of the placement was essential in adapting the model used in a rehabilitation setting to the palliative care environment. The two-day induction programme was also evaluated positively by the students as preparation for the placement.</p>
<sec id="section9-0269216311400479">
<title>Interprofessional learning experience</title>
<p>Student feedback suggests the overall goals of enhancing interprofessional attitudes and collaboration were achieved. This was particularly evident in the positive comments from the medical and nursing students, who appeared to develop a degree of professional respect for each other. The feedback also indicates that the students actively engaged in learning from one another in the clinical environment. In addition to the profession-specific improvement in attitudes, deeper understanding appeared to develop amongst them of the importance of multidisciplinary teamwork in the delivery of effective patient care. The end-of-programme conferences were extremely successful, providing the students with a unique opportunity to demonstrate their interprofessional learning to each other and to the hospice staff. All the students stated that they would recommend the placement to a colleague.</p>
<p>The observations from this evaluation reflect the results of other interprofessional training wards. In an initial report of the Linköping ward, Wahlström and Sandén<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269216311400479">11</xref></sup> observed that the majority of the students experienced the placement as very valuable and rewarding, as it clarified their future professional role and contributed to their understanding of the skills and tasks of other professions. Reeves et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269216311400479">13</xref></sup> also concluded that the training ward was a valuable and relevant learning experience for pre-qualification students and highlighted that reflective sessions were considered extremely helpful in learning from the ward-based experience.The shift-based structure of the course was less popular with the medical students, creating a perceived emphasis on nursing experience over that of other professions. Mentor feedback also suggested that some of the medical students were reluctant to become involved in general patient care. These challenges were identified in the other training ward models. Medical, occupational therapy and physiotherapy students at the Royal London Hospital experienced frustration with the shift patterns, although they did acknowledge that the pattern of work allowed more time together as a team, facilitating collaborative work on the ward.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269216311400479">13</xref></sup> To encourage a team-orientated approach, the students needed a clear understanding of the goals of the interprofessional placement. Students arriving with an expectation of profession-specific experience occasionally displayed a lack of enthusiasm about participating in the interprofessional team duties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269216311400479">13</xref></sup> A similar problem was experienced in Linköping, where it was observed that training in teamwork in general care and the autonomous professional role during the same practice period seemed to conflict.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269216311400479">12</xref></sup> Fallsberg and Hammar<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269216311400479">12</xref></sup> concluded that it is important to clarify the different roles for students and emphasized that IPE must be a combination of collaborative practice and specialist content. We found that seeing the variability of work pressures and priorities during different shift patterns was excellent learning for the students from all the professions.</p>

<title>Interprofessional education in the hospice setting</title>
<p>The focus of the placement was IPE and this was emphasized to the students at induction and throughout the placement. However, we hoped there would be an additional learning experience from this IPP in a palliative care setting. Prior to commencing the IPP at PAH, serious concerns had been raised as to whether this would be a distressing environment for students. We were therefore keen to explore the students’ experience of dealing with death and dying. All the students felt the placement would alter their future clinical practice in managing patients with life-limiting illness. The experience enhanced their understanding of symptom management, communication and their own understanding and attitudes to death and dying.</p>
<p>Understandably, the students also found the hospice environment a challenging place in which to learn. Feedback indicated that for some students this was their first experience of caring for dying patients. A number of individuals reflected on the difficulty in communicating with, and providing psychological support to, patients in the terminal phase of illness. However, they also recognized the importance of developing these skills and felt supported by the interprofessional team when dealing with situations they found challenging.</p>
<p>Coles et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269216311400479">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269216311400479">10</xref></sup> and Wee et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269216311400479">10</xref></sup> incorporated contact with carers into an interprofessional palliative care workshop. Feedback from this suggested that the students felt privileged and found the experience moving, informative and interesting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269216311400479">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269216311400479">10</xref></sup> The experience of hearing the carers’ unrehearsed, authentic story enhanced the learning experience for students and often necessitated adoption of an unconscious interprofessional team approach to support the carer during the story telling process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269216311400479">10</xref></sup> At PAH students were encouraged to get involved in talking to and supporting the families and carers to gain insight into the ‘carer experience’. The process of working in the hospice setting takes this experience a step further for the interprofessional students. Working with dying patients and their families on a palliative care ward provided a safe environment that demonstrated to students the importance of interprofessional teamwork and encouraged them to unite as a cohesive team in delivering patient care and supporting one another. The daily reflective sessions were utilized by students to reflect on their team working and also to discuss their experience of working with palliative care patients.</p>
<p>It is important to consider the students’ personal emotional responses to working in palliative care. Some students reflected on the emotionally charged nature of the environment and its inevitable impact on themselves as professionals; others observed the difficulties in developing a relationship with a patient then dealing with their subsequent death. In these cases, the group and individual reflective sessions provided essential support in creating a forum to explore emotions and learn from the experience.</p>

<title>Organizational challenges and recommendations for the future</title>
<p>The variability of student numbers and the mix of students from different professions were particular challenges. Low numbers of nursing and therapy students in some groups meant these teams had less overall experience of interprofessional working. The complexity of timetabling students from the different professions was evident. In the February 2009 placement, only medical students were able to be allocated to the IPP, and although the placement was positively evaluated, without the opportunity to work alongside fellow students from other professions, the medical students did not receive such a rich learning experience during the ward work or in the tutorials and reflections. Where therapy students were allocated to the student teams the experience was enhanced and the therapy facilitator was proactive in successfully ensuring more therapists were subsequently allocated to the 2009/2010 IPP placements.</p>
<p>Feedback from the mentors and facilitators highlighted that the placements were resource intensive for the ward teams. As a result, student numbers and timing of placements were reviewed to ensure future student experience remained positive while balancing the demands on the staff. Following this review, the hospice decided to continue to support mixed-student groups of 12, but to reduce the number of three-week placements from six to four for 2009/2010.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This evaluation of a new interprofessional training ward suggests that the in-patient unit of a hospice caring for patients with life-limiting illness is a suitable environment to demonstrate and learn about interprofessional practice. The close clinical contact with patients, supported by a trained multiprofessional team, offers students new perspectives on clinical team working and a deeper understanding of the philosophy of palliative care.</p>

<title>Further research</title>
<p>This is a new initiative and the data presented here represents a pilot evaluation. To expand the themes identified from the feedback in the first year, a formal study of the interprofessional learning experience in the palliative care environment is planned. This will employ a validated interprofessional assessment tool (the UWE interprofessional questionnaire<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269216311400479">16</xref></sup>) in a before-and-after study to explore the impact of the placement on teamwork, learning, interaction and relationships between the students in the hospice setting. We anticipate that the information from this research will strengthen our initial observations and add to the evidence base supporting interprofessional practice.</p>
