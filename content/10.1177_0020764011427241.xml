<title>Objective:</title>
<p>The correlates of parental burden in schizophrenia may differ between ethnic groups, but few studies have examined this in a UK setting.

</sec>
<sec id="section3-0020764011427241">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>The strongest correlates of burden were patient symptoms and parental distress. Differences in correlates of burden between the groups emerged when individual components of service use and parental social network were tested.

<sec id="section4-0020764011427241">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>The similarities in sources of burden between the groups could be explained by a commonality of sociocultural and economic experience, resulting from the successful acculturation and affluence of this British Sikh group. The differences between the groups may be related to enduring cultural factors such as kin support, since larger family groups were associated with low burden in the British Sikh group. The nature of EE in this British Sikh group may explain why it was not associated with burden in this sample.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Understanding the sources of caregiver burden could have a significant impact on improving family intervention programmes, patient outcomes and the carer well-being. A core group of variables have been associated with burden; the strongest and most consistent drivers are patient symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0020764011427241">Aguglia et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0020764011427241">Arai et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0020764011427241">Chakrabarti &amp; Gill, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0020764011427241">Lauber, Eichenberger, Luginbühl, Keller, &amp; Rössler, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0020764011427241">Lively, Friedrich, &amp; Rubenstein, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0020764011427241">Lowyck et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0020764011427241">Madianos et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0020764011427241">Mueser, Webb, Pfeiffer, Gladis, &amp; Levinson, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0020764011427241">Ohaeri, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0020764011427241">Roick et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0020764011427241">Roick, Heider, Toumi, &amp; Angermeyer, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0020764011427241">Savundranayagam, Hummert, &amp; Montgomery, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0020764011427241">Sherwood, Given, Given, &amp; von Eye, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0020764011427241">Wittmund, Wilms, Mory, &amp; Angermeyer, 2002</xref>) and caregiver distress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0020764011427241">Barrowclough &amp; Parle, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0020764011427241">Oldridge &amp; Hughes, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0020764011427241">Provencher, Perreault, St-Onge, &amp; Rousseau, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0020764011427241">Winefield &amp; Harvey, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>Ethnicity also appears to influence the level of burden that caregivers experience, with white caregivers in the USA and Europe reporting higher levels than those from other ethnic groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0020764011427241">Guarnaccia &amp; Parra, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0020764011427241">Horwitz &amp; Reinhard, 1995</xref>). While the levels of burden may vary across ethnic groups, there may also be considerable overlap of the factors that cause it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0020764011427241">Jenkins &amp; Schumacher, 1999</xref>). The underlying reasons for such similarities and differences have yet to qualitatively explored and remain largely unclear; however, it is likely that a complex interaction of economic, social and cultural (differential expectations of role functioning) factors are involved.</p>
<p>Family burden is also experienced irrespective of residential proximity to the patient, but those who reside with or spend more time with their ill relative are more likely to experience high levels of distress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0020764011427241">Bulger, Wandersman, &amp; Goldman, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0020764011427241">Pruchno, Patrick, &amp; Burant, 1997</xref>). The findings in relation to level of income, education and caregiver burden are inconsistent.</p>
<p>Coping style and social support appear to mediate burden in some groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0020764011427241">Moller-Leimkuhler, 2005</xref>), while kin support is associated with psychological distress in others. Family response and support may be influenced by sociocultural and ethnic factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0020764011427241">Pinquart &amp; Sorensen, 2005</xref>), stage of illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0020764011427241">Hoenig &amp; Hamilton, 1966</xref>) and age of the caregiver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0020764011427241">Cook, Lefley, Pickett, &amp; Cohler, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0020764011427241">Greenberg, Kim, &amp; Greenley, 1997</xref>). There is some evidence that the composition and provision of mental health services is associated with caregiver burden. Mental health service use is also associated with caregiver burden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0020764011427241">Rudge &amp; Morse, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0020764011427241">Stengler-Wenzke, Trosbach, Dietrich, &amp; Angermeyer, 2004</xref>), and this is likely to be influenced by ethnicity and beliefs about illness.</p>
<p>International studies of expressed emotion (EE) have reported higher scores for white carers from Britain and Denmark compared to carers in India (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0020764011427241">Leff et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0020764011427241">Wig et al., 1987</xref>), raising the possibility that caregiver burden may also be higher in UK white British carers than in UK British Sikh groups. However, few studies have examined the extent of burden or the sources of it across different ethnic groups in the UK. Furthermore, World Health Organization studies have revealed better short- and long-term outcomes for schizophrenia in India compared to Britain and the USA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0020764011427241">World Health Organization, 1973</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0020764011427241">1979</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0020764011427241">1992</xref>), and concluded that investigation into cultural and family variables (i.e. EE and familial response) was due. While the concept of burden has been criticized with recent investigations favouring less negative constructs, burden has been shown to predict outcome in schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0020764011427241">Levene, Lancee, &amp; Seeman, 1996</xref>) and has been extensively used to investigate family experiences of caregiving.</p>
<p>In light of the findings from the international literature comparing burden, EE and outcome in schizophrenia, we designed a cross-cultural mixed-method study to compare the extent and sources of burden between a group of first-generation North Indian Punjabi Sikhs and white British parents caring for a son or daughter with schizophrenia. We also tested the association of burden with one-year outcome. The findings relating to our first hypothesis are reported elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0020764011427241">Lloyd et al., 2011</xref>) and suggest that while the overall extent of burden between the groups may be similar, the sources of it may differ between them. The current paper reports the investigation of our second hypothesis relating to the sources of burden in the same samples, which tested the association of burden with a series of clinical, social and service use variables and controlled for potential confounding factors in a model predicting drivers of parental burden. A third paper describing the association of burden with one-year outcome will be published shortly.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section7-0020764011427241">
<title>Setting and samples</title>
<p>The sample comprised two groups of patients diagnosed with schizophrenia and their primary carers (parent with the most contact): British North Indian Punjabi Sikh dyads (<italic>N</italic> = 23) and white British dyads (<italic>N</italic> = 16). The North Indian Punjabi Sikh group was recruited from Southall, Middlesex, which is home to a large homogenous North Indian population, and the white British group was recruited from Northolt and Ealing (i.e. areas adjacent to Southall). British Sikh parents were all born and raised in North India and migrated as adults to the UK. Their sons or daughters were either born and raised in the UK or migrated there before the age of 11. White British parents and their offspring were all of white British decent. From this point on our groups will be referred to by shorthand versions, i.e. our North Indian Punjabi Sikh group will be referred to as the ‘British Sikh’ group and the white British group will be referred to as the ‘white British’ group.</p>
<p>Local ethical approval was obtained from West London Mental Health Trust and Oxfordshire Mental Health Trust.</p>
<p>The sample was obtained by an extensive and systematic review of community mental health team caseloads in Southall and Northolt. Key workers and care coordinators approached patients about the study or gave approval for their patients to be contacted. Patients who agreed to take part were interviewed and asked to nominate their primary parental carer. Nominated parents were contacted and interviewed by a researcher blind to that patient’s symptoms and functioning. Eligibility criteria were: aged 18–50 years; self-reported white British or of British North Indian Punjabi Sikh ethnicity (born in the UK or arrived before the age of 11); diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder; two to 15 years’ duration of illness; living with or in weekly contact with a parental carer; in regular contact with community mental health services; and able to provide written informed consent.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0020764011427241">
<title>Instruments</title>
<p>All instruments used for the study were well known and well validated. We obtained a Hindi version of the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) and the Short Explanatory Model Questionnaire (SEMI) for use with the British Sikh parents. A native Punjabi speaker (SS) translated the Perceived Family Burden Scale (PFBS) and the Social Network Questionnaire (SNQ) for the purposes of this study with the help of a Hindi-speaking research assistant.</p>
<p>All parents completed the PFBS, which was designed to investigate family interaction predictors of early relapse in schizophrenia. It distinguishes between objective and subjective components of family burden by asking first if symptom behaviours are present and second if they are bothersome. Each of the 24 items is rated on a four-point Likert scale covering ‘not at all’, ‘a little’, ‘considerably’ or ‘a great deal’. Behaviours form the following four clusters: anxiety-depression (looks fearful, looks sad, mopes, threatens suicide, acts suspicious and self-harms), uncritical (talks loudly, yells, talks nonsense, laughs frequently, uses abusive language, paces), passivity (stays in bed, hardly talks, looks messy) and aggression (refuses medicines, refuses help, threatens violence, throws things, harasses others, blames others).</p>
<p>Parents also completed the GHQ-12, which is used to measure distress and to screen for psychiatric morbidity in the general population and has good levels of validity and reliability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0020764011427241">Goldberg &amp; Williams, 1998</xref>). The 12-item version is quick and easy to administer and can be scored using a Likert scale (1-2-3-4) or as a screening instrument using bimodal scoring (0-0-1-1). It has been validated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0020764011427241">Jacob, Bhugra, &amp; Mann, 1997</xref>) in British Sikh women living in Southall with an optimal threshold for caseness of 2/3.</p>
<p>Parental social networks were measured with the Social Network Questionnaire (SNQ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0020764011427241">Magliano et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0020764011427241">Magliano et al., 2003</xref>). Illness beliefs were explored using the Short Explanatory Model Interview (SEMI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0020764011427241">Lloyd et al., 1998</xref>), which is designed to elicit explanatory models of illness by exploring the subject’s cultural background, presenting problem, help-seeking behaviour, interaction with physicians and health beliefs.</p>
<p>Social and demographic characteristics were collected from both parents and patients. British Sikh parents were interviewed with a translated version of the parent interview by Hindi/Punjabi speaking researchers (PS and AS), and white British researchers (RM and KK) interviewed white parents. Parents were interviewed at home within four weeks of their son or daughter’s interview.</p>
<p>Patient psychopathology was measured by the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0020764011427241">Kay, Fishbein, &amp; Opler, 1987</xref>). Patient disability was measured by the Disability Assessment Schedule (DAS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0020764011427241">Sartorius &amp; Janca, 1996</xref>), which measures levels of social withdrawal, self-care, household participation and role relationships. EE was measured by the Five Minute Speech Sample (FMSS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0020764011427241">Magana et al., 1986</xref>). This measure has been validated against the Camberwell Family Interview (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0020764011427241">Vaughn &amp; Leff, 1976</xref>) by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0020764011427241">Malla, Kazarian, Barnes, &amp; Cole (1991)</xref> and can be reliably used to identify over-involvement and negative relationships (i.e. criticism and hostility) between family members, even by raters with limited training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0020764011427241">Leeb et al., 1993</xref>). Speech samples were obtained by asking the nominated individual to speak for five minutes about their son or daughter. Each monologue was recorded and transcribed verbatim. Annotations were used to indicate where prompts were utilized, where changes in tone and inflection occurred, and the presence or absence of emotional display. Speech samples are rated according to explicit guidelines and result in a score of high or low EE. HL rated all speech samples and a random sample of nine (25%) was also rated by another member of the team (RM). Agreement between the co-raters was good (Cohen’s κ = .76, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .05).</p>
<p>Patient social networks were measured by the Social Network Schedule (SNS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0020764011427241">Leff, O’Driscoll, Dayson, Wills, &amp; Anderson, 1990</xref>), which records the quantity, frequency and type of social contact that patients encounter in the month prior to interview. Service use was measured by a modified version of the Client Service Receipt Inventory (CSRI) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0020764011427241">Beecham, Knapp, Thornicroft, Brewin, &amp; Wing, 1992</xref>), which measures all contacts with mental health and related services over the preceding six months.</p>

<sec id="section9-0020764011427241">
<title>Statistical analyses</title>
<p>This study had 77 % power at 5% significance level to detect medium to large effects according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0020764011427241">Cohen’s (1992)</xref> guidelines. Group differences were investigated using independent <italic>t</italic>-tests or Mann Whitney <italic>U</italic> tests. χ<italic><sup>2</sup></italic> tests were used to analyse categorical variables. Fisher’s exact test (FET) was used to analyse categorical data where expected cell values in the contingency table were less than 5.</p>
<p>To investigate the relationship between burden and other variables, a Spearman’s (<italic>r<sub>s</sub></italic>) correlation was used due to the small sample size. Correlations that met the threshold for an effect according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0020764011427241">Cohen (1992)</xref> were reported when <italic>β</italic> coefficient test significance (<italic>p</italic> ≤ .05) was also met. To reduce the risk of type I errors, correlations were only performed on the variables where the planned group comparisons revealed significant differences in social networks and service use. For each correlation performed, the coefficients were compared for difference by converting them to <bold><italic>z</italic></bold> scores and calculating the difference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0020764011427241">Pallant, 2005</xref>). Where the variance in burden scores were analysed according to two or more groups – i.e. British Sikh/white British and male/female – a Kruskal-Wallis (<italic>H</italic>) test was used. Ethnicity was controlled for when the samples were combined for multiple regression tests to identify the strongest predictor of burden, and all data entered into the model met test assumptions for multicollinearity, outliers, linearity, homoscedacity, and independence of residuals.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>For our first hypothesis we compared the two groups on a series of social, clinical and service use variables. As these findings have been described in detail elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0020764011427241">Lloyd et al., 2011</xref>), only a brief summary is presented here to provide a context to the findings of the present study. The majority of British Sikh parents lived with family and were much more likely to live with the patient than their white counterparts. British Sikh households were also larger than white British households. There were no significant differences between the groups in levels of parental burden, caregiver distress, patient symptoms and duration of illness, and all the scores were relatively low. The only exception was negative symptoms, with British Sikh patients scoring slightly higher than white British patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0020764011427241">Lloyd et al., 2011</xref>). The patient groups did not differ significantly from each other in duration of illness or other symptoms.</p>
<sec id="section11-0020764011427241">
<title>Group comparisons</title>
<p>There were no significant differences between the two groups of patients in community mental health service use in the six months prior to study entry, level of disability (scores suggest fair to good social and occupational adjustment) and patient social networks, which comprised mainly family members. Similarly there were no significant differences in the proportion of parents and patients who attributed illness to biological, mixed biosocial and social models in each ethnic group. White British dyads were more likely to agree on cause of illness than British Sikh dyads, and there was a trend for higher burden scores among white British dyads who disagreed over the cause of the patient’s illness.</p>
<p>The only differences to emerge in the parental groups were on social network items concerning social contacts and psychological support (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0020764011427241">Table 1</xref>) and EE, where a greater proportion of British Sikh parents scored high than white British parents (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0020764011427241">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<p>In the British Sikh group there were moderate relationships between size of household and burden, with larger households associated with higher levels of burden. Size of household accounted for 9% of the variance in OB and 9% of the variance in SB; however, only the test for OB burden met significance. In the white British group relationships between the variables failed to meet test significance. However, higher rank burden scores were found in both groups of parents if they lived with family and their ill offspring (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0020764011427241">Table 3</xref>).</p>
<p>In the British Sikh group there were moderate associations between psychotic symptoms and burden, with higher total positive symptom scores associated with higher OB and SB. Positive symptoms accounted for 21% of the variance in OB score and 20% of the variance in SB score. In the white British group there were also strong associations between these variables, but only the former reached test reached significance, with positive symptoms accounting for 31% of the variance in OB (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0020764011427241">Table 3</xref>).</p>

<title>Variables not associated with objective and subjective burden</title>
<p>The variance in burden scores was investigated where the groups differed significantly in sociodemographic variables (education, occupational status, living situation, patient marital status) and there were no significant differences between the groups. In both groups, weak to moderate relationships between negative symptoms and burden also failed to reach test significance.

<p>Ethnicity, parental living situation, positive symptoms and parental distress were entered into a standard multiple regression model since they were the strongest correlates of OB that met test significance. Ethnicity was entered into the model because this was a cross-cultural study and separate group regressions were not possible given the small sample sizes. This model explained 38% of the variance in OB, with parental distress adding the largest unique contribution (<italic>β</italic> = .32) and explaining 8% of the total variance.

<p>Ethnicity, usual parental living situation, symptoms of general psychopathology, and parental distress were entered into a standard multiple regression model since they were the strongest correlates of SB that met test significance. Ethnicity was selected for the reason outlined above. This model explained 40% of the variance in SB, with parental distress and symptoms of general psychopathology making statistically significant and equal contributions (<italic>β</italic> = .33) to the prediction of SB. Parental distress contributed 9% and general symptoms contributed 13% to the overall variance in SB, whereas ethnic group and parental living situation did not contribute uniquely to the model (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0020764011427241">Table 4</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results from this study suggest that the two groups appear similar in all but one of the sources of burden, and that there may also be some important differences between them in some aspects of mental health service use, EE and some elements of social support.</p>
<sec id="section17-0020764011427241">
<title>Common sources of burden</title>
<p>Our findings suggest that the strongest sources of burden are similar in both British Sikh and white British parents. For example, the finding that parental distress contributed to burden in both groups suggests a common source of burden irrespective of ethnicity. Indeed, relationships between caregiver distress and burden have been reported by other studies (see introduction for references). Burden and distress may be related because appraisal of caregiving is more negative in parents with depression or anxiety. In addition, those with high levels of distress may experience impairments in role functioning that reduce their capacity to support ill offspring and discern illness behaviours from personality traits.</p>
<p>Patient symptoms have been consistently associated with burden in the literature (see introduction for references), a finding that is also supported by our study, which found that symptoms of general psychopathology appeared to be the strongest predictor of burden in both groups. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0020764011427241">Jenkins and Schumacher (1999)</xref> also found these symptoms were distressing to carers across ethnic groups. The findings from our study are also similar to those reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0020764011427241">Boye (2001)</xref> where depressed and anxious patient behaviours were associated with caregiver distress. In our sample of stabilized community patients, general symptoms may be related to burden because they contrast with established patterns of behaviour, may be difficult to manage and disrupt family cohesion, particularly when patients live in the family home.</p>

<sec id="section18-0020764011427241">
<title>Differences between the groups</title>
<p>Contact with a community mental health nurse correlated significantly with burden in the white British group but not in the British Sikh group. The lack of association between burden and psychiatric service use in the British Sikh group may be due to the fact that burden is shared among co-resident family members and the wider community. Particularly, since British Sikh parents who resided with their ill son or daughter did so in larger households than their white British counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0020764011427241">Lloyd et al., 2011</xref>). Burden may be associated with contact with a community practice nurse among white British parents because they have fewer individuals with whom to share the responsibility of ill offspring, thus resulting in a heavier use of local services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0020764011427241">Albert, Becker, McCrone, &amp; Thornicroft, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0020764011427241">Becker, Albert, Angermeyer, Thornicroft &amp; Tansella, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>A relationship between EE and burden failed to emerge despite significantly more British Sikh parents expressing high EE than white British parents. Previous studies have found associations between reductions in EE and improvements in caregiver burden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0020764011427241">Scazufca &amp; Kuipers, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0020764011427241">Smith, Birchwood, Cochrane, &amp; George, 1993</xref>). The absence of a relationship between EE and burden in our sample might be explained by the nature of EE in the British Sikh group as this was largely driven by emotional over-involvement (EOI), characterized by self-sacrificing and overprotective behaviour. Studies examining EE across ethnic groups have reported that white European relatives express more criticism than Indian relatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0020764011427241">Leff et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0020764011427241">Wig et al., 1987</xref>); it is possible therefore that the studies cited above included larger proportions of high EE (critical) relatives. Furthermore, the correlation between burden and EE in some studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0020764011427241">Scazufca &amp; Kuipers, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0020764011427241">Smith et al., 1993</xref>) could be explained by the tendency of high EE (critical) relatives to attribute patient behaviours to personality traits rather than expressions of illness. Indeed, results from the qualitative study we performed as part of this mixed-method approach certainly supports this (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0020764011427241">Lloyd &amp; Burns, forthcoming</xref>).</p>
<p>Explaining high EOI in this sample is problematic in the absence of normative data on the UK British Sikh population. Moreover, our findings are in contrast to those reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0020764011427241">Leff et al. (1981)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0020764011427241">Wig et al. (1987)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0020764011427241">Hashemi and Cochrane (1999)</xref> where the proportion of Indian relatives scoring high on EE was low compared to the white European groups. Given the low levels of burden revealed in our previous paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0020764011427241">Lloyd et al., 2011</xref>) and that EE in this British Sikh sample is driven by EOI, it is plausible that the high EE (EOI) we observed is an expression of a caring relationship and a normal expression of concern among this group of first-generation British Sikh migrants. In addition, since service use is particularly low in this group, over-involvement might therefore compensate for levels of service involvement. There is also some support for the notion that over-involvement in relatives is a state response to illness in the patient, and not personality trait-like criticism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0020764011427241">Bentsen et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0020764011427241">Schreiber, Breier, &amp; Pickar, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0020764011427241">van Os, Marcelis, Germeys, Graven, &amp; Delespaul, 2001</xref>). This may be particularly true of British Sikh families where EOI is normative and pronounced in families with an ill son or daughter.</p>
<p>While parental social networks do not appear to interact with burden in either group, there were some significant differences between them in their frequency and composition. White British carers reported more contact with friends than British Sikh carers and also reported having more trustworthy friends outside the family. These differences might be explained by the way in which the notions of ‘friends’ and ‘family’ are culturally understood. For example, extended British Sikh families often include individuals who may not be kin relations but whom are considered as family members, whereas in the white British group these individuals would be considered as friends. It may therefore be misleading to consider these British Sikh families to be lacking in social support and individuals whom they perceive to be trustworthy and supportive.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The findings from this study suggest that there are common sources of parental burden in British Sikh and white British parents with a son or daughter with schizophrenia. Such commonality in experience may be a consequence of successful acculturation and affluence of the British Sikh community resulting in many shared experiences in this domain. However, there were also important differences between the groups when burden was analysed with mental health service use, and this may be related to the differential level and composition of support that British Sikh and white British families’ experience.</p>
<p>This is the first study to explore correlates of burden in a roughly matched sample of British North Indian Punjabi Sikhs and white British parents caring for a son or daughter with schizophrenia. As such the findings are preliminary and require further investigation. Nevertheless, these results suggest that patient symptoms and parental distress are strong sources of parental burden in these groups. The high levels of EE and reduced service use among this British Sikh group may be a factor that clinicians wish to consider when engaging with British Sikh families.</p>
<p>This study is limited by a small sample size, which may have contributed to the risk of not detecting important differences between the groups. The small sample size also prohibited the investigation of predictors of burden in each ethnic group using separate regression models. As such the groups were combined and ethnicity was entered into the model as an independent variable with only the very strongest correlates entered into the regression model. It was therefore not possible to investigate the extent to which the weaker associations affected the strength of the overall model via their relationship with burden. In consideration of the above facts the findings presented here should be considered preliminary and viewed with caution. Further research is required to explore the subtle differences that emerged between the groups in relationships between burden and a range of other variables (patient disability, patient social networks, EE).</p>
