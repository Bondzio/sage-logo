<abstract>
<p><bold>Objective:</bold> Exercise capacity strongly predicts survival and aerobic interval training (AIT) increases peak oxygen uptake effectively in cardiac patients. Usual care in Norway provides exercise training at the hospitals following myocardial infarction (MI), but the effect and actual intensity of these rehabilitation programmes are unknown.</p>
<p><bold>Design:</bold> Randomized controlled trial.</p>
<p><bold>Setting:</bold> Hospital cardiac rehabilitation.</p>
<p><bold>Subjects:</bold> One hundred and seven patients, recruited two to 12 weeks after MI, were randomized to usual care rehabilitation or treadmill AIT.</p>
<p><bold>Interventions:</bold> Usual care aerobic group exercise training or treadmill AIT as 4 × 4 minutes intervals at 85–95% of peak heart rate. Twice weekly exercise training for 12 weeks.</p>
<p><bold>Main measures:</bold> The primary outcome measure was peak oxygen uptake. Secondary outcome measures were endothelial function, blood markers of cardiovascular disease, quality of life, resting heart rate, and heart rate recovery.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Eighty-nine patients (74 men, 15 women, 57.4 ± 9.5 years) completed the programme. Peak oxygen uptake increased more (<italic>P</italic> = 0.002) after AIT (from 31.6 ± 5.8 to 36.2 ± 8.6 mL·kg<sup>−1</sup>·min<sup>−1</sup>, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) than after usual care rehabilitation (from 32.2 ± 6.7 to 34.7 ± 7.9 mL·kg<sup>−1</sup>·min<sup>−1</sup>, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). The AIT group exercised with significantly higher intensity in the intervals compared to the highest intensity in the usual care group (87.3 ± 3.9% versus 78.7 ± 7.2% of peak heart rate, respectively, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). Both programmes increased endothelial function, serum adiponectin, and quality of life, and reduced serum ferritin and resting heart rate. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol increased only after AIT.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> AIT increased peak oxygen uptake more than the usual care rehabilitation provided to MI patients by Norwegian hospitals.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Exercise training is effective to increase functional capacity and quality of life after myocardial infarction (MI).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269215511405229">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269215511405229">2</xref></sup> A recent meta-analysis indicated that rehabilitation programmes reduce total and cardiac mortality by 20–26% compared with standard medical care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269215511405229">3</xref></sup> There is, however, still uncertainty regarding the most effective way to organize the exercise training for these patients. As exercise capacity has been found to be the best predictor of survival,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269215511405229">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269215511405229">5</xref></sup> it is warranted to find effective ways to increase peak oxygen uptake after MI.</p>
<p>We wanted to compare the existing exercise programme for MI patients provided by three Norwegian hospitals with an alternative exercise training model; aerobic interval training (AIT). Some previous studies have found AIT to be more effective than continuous exercise training with moderate intensity in increasing cardiovascular function in subjects with coronary heart disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269215511405229">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269215511405229">7</xref></sup> These studies were rather small and the results need to be confirmed in larger patient populations. How well the aerobic interval training model is working in a clinical setting, and compared to usual care rehabilitation, is also unknown. The primary aim of this randomized controlled study was therefore to compare the effect of 12 weeks of usual care rehabilitation versus AIT on peak oxygen uptake in MI patients. Our hypothesis was that AIT would increase peak oxygen uptake more than usual care, due to suspected lower exercise intensity in the usual care exercise training. Secondary outcome measures were endothelial function as measured by flow-mediated vasodilatation, heart rate recovery, resting heart rate, blood markers of cardiovascular disease risk, and health-related quality of life.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0269215511405229" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Patients who had suffered a MI two to 12 weeks ago in three Norwegian hospitals were candidates for inclusion in the study. They were asked to participate in the study by one of the study investigators when referred to cardiac rehabilitation at the hospitals. Exclusion criteria were: left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;30%, contraindications to vigorous physical activity, pulmonary disease clearly limiting exercise capacity, or drug abuse. After initial assessments the patients were randomized 2:1 to usual care rehabilitation or treadmill aerobic interval training, stratified by hospital and gender. The allocation was done by a computer using a randomisation code with block randomisation. The person including the patients logged on to a website and got the allocation result on screen and by e-mail. The first, the smallest and the largest block, were defined by the technicians at the unit of Applied Clinical Research at the university.</p>
<p>A difference in peak oxygen uptake improvement of 3.0 mL·kg<sup>−1</sup>·min<sup>−1</sup> between the two groups was considered clinically important.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269215511405229">5</xref></sup> With a within-group standard deviation of 3.0 this yields a standardized difference of 1.0. With a two-tailed t-test for independent samples at a power of 0.8 and α = 0.05, a total of 17 persons in each group had to be enrolled. Due to uncertainty about the assumptions used in calculating the standardized difference, variability among the participating hospitals, the 2:1 randomisation procedure, as well as an expected 10% drop-out, we included a total of 107 patients.</p>
<p>All test procedures at baseline were done prior to group allocation. At all data collection after the training period, the group allocation was open for the investigators. However, the analyses of flow-mediated vasodilatation data was done masked to both group allocation and time of testing. Individuals blinded to group allocation and time of testing, performed all the blood analyses.</p>
<p>The primary outcome measure was peak oxygen uptake. Secondary outcome measures were flow-mediated vasodilatation, heart rate recovery, resting heart rate, blood markers of cardiovascular disease, and health-related quality of life. Peak oxygen uptake was measured on treadmills. Respiratory gas was analysed (MetaMax II, Cortex, Germany/Oxycon Pro, Jaeger, Germany), and a 12-lead electrocardiogram was monitored continuously. We used a ramp-protocol individually adjusted to last eight to 12 minutes as recommended by Froelicher and Myers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269215511405229">8</xref></sup> The subjects walked at a predefined speed and the incline of the treadmill was raised 1–2% every, or every second minute. For subjects who were capable of running, the incline was held constant and the speed was increased by 0.5 km/h every second minute. Reasons to stop were subjective exhaustion or standard clinical criteria.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269215511405229">9</xref></sup> Subjective perception of exertion was assessed immediately after termination using the Borg 6–20 scale.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269215511405229">10</xref></sup> Heart rate recovery was defined as the change in the heart rate from peak exercise to one minute after peak exercise with the patient standing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215511405229">11</xref></sup> Heart rate recovery is recognised as an independent predictor of survival in cardiac patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269215511405229">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Endothelial function was assessed by flow-mediated vasodilatation of the brachial artery using a Vivid 7 scanner with a 14 MHz linear array duplex probe (GE Vingmed Ultrasound, Horten, Norway) according to Corretti et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269215511405229">13</xref></sup> at two of the hospitals (n = 68). The patients fasted and abstained from exercise, caffeine, smoking and alcohol for 10 hours, and rested for 10 minutes before the measurements. The recordings were done 4.5 cm above the antecubital fossa before inflation of a pneumatic cuff on the upper arm to 250 mmHg for five minutes, and again at one minute after cuff release. Flow-mediated vasodilatation was expressed as percentage change in diameter from baseline to one minute after cuff release. The responses were also normalized by dividing the percentage change in diameter by the shear rate (calculated as peak velocity divided by baseline diameter).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269215511405229">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Venous blood was drawn following a 10-hour overnight fast. Using standard local procedures at each hospital, we analysed for: high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, sodium, potassium, creatinine, glucose, albumin, ferritin and haemoglobin. Adiponectin was measured in plasma using enzyme immunoassay (Mercodia, Sweden).</p>
<p>Quality of life parameters were assessed using the MacNew heart disease health-related quality of life questionnaire (MacNew).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215511405229">15</xref></sup> MacNew has proved valid, reliable, responsive and applicable to patients after MI.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269215511405229">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>All patients were asked to meet for exercise training at the hospitals twice weekly, and to exercise once weekly at home, for 12 weeks. The usual care exercise training consisted of aerobic exercises to music, was lead by physiotherapists, and lasted for 60 minutes each time. After a 10-minute warm-up, the patients exercised for 35 minutes doing aerobic exercises like walking, jogging, lunges and squats. Patients were asked to exert themselves and were encouraged to exercise vigorously periodically during the 35 minutes of exercise training. After five minutes of cool-down they did stretching and relaxation exercises.</p>
<p>The aerobic interval training consisted of an eight-minute warm-up, followed by four times four minutes intervals with 85–95% of maximum heart rate, with active pauses of three minutes of walking at 70% of maximum heart rate. The exercise session was terminated by five minutes cool-down. This gave a total session time of 38 minutes. All patients in the study wore heart rate monitors (Polar Electro, Finland).</p>
<p>We calculated the heart rate in the eight minutes with the highest intensity throughout each exercise session in all patients. For the aerobic interval training group, this was the last two minutes of each interval. For the usual care group, we selected the periods throughout each session with the highest intensity by visual inspection of the heart rate curves.</p>
<p>If a normal distribution could be assumed, we analysed changes within groups using paired t-test, otherwise we used Wilcoxon’s signed rank test. We did a covariance analysis (ANCOVA) to test for between-group differences in the changes of the outcome variables from before to after exercise training. Intervention group was set as a fixed factor and baseline values of the outcome variables as covariates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269215511405229">17</xref></sup> For the primary outcome measure (peak oxygen uptake), we also did analyses with the drop-out patients included (intention to treat). We used Pearson correlation to investigate the association between exercise heart rate and change in peak oxygen uptake. Tests were two-sided and <italic>P-</italic>values ≤0.05 were considered significant; no correction for multiple tests was applied.</p>
<p>The Regional Committee for Medical Research Ethics approved the study, and the study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All subjects gave their informed, written consent.</p>

<p>Flow-mediated vasodilatation, both non-normalised and normalised to shear stimulus, increased significantly after exercise training in both groups. As seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0269215511405229">Table 2</xref>, there was no significant between-group differences (<italic>P</italic> = 0.31).

We also observed a small, but significant, increase in haemoglobin in the aerobic interval training group, with no significant between-group difference (<italic>P</italic> = 0.48).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The main finding of our study was that aerobic interval training increased peak oxygen uptake more than the usual care exercise training offered by the Norwegian hospitals. Secondary outcome measures (quality of life, endothelial function, heart rate recovery, resting heart rate and blood markers of cardiovascular disease) changed similarly in both groups.</p>
<p>One of the weaknesses of our study is that the usual care programme was not very well defined in means of exercise intensity. Since the actual aim of this study was to compare usual care rehabilitation with aerobic interval training, the study protocol did not specify the exercise intensity during usual care. We tried to compensate for this by measuring the heart rate in most off the sessions. Indeed, exercise heart rate during these sessions varied both between and within subjects. In other studies showing a larger increase in peak oxygen uptake after aerobic interval training compared to moderate intensities, the energy expenditure of the two groups has been equal.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269215511405229">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269215511405229">7</xref></sup> This suggests that it is not the average intensity, but rather the periods of high intensity during the exercise session that are important for improvements in aerobic capacity. We therefore chose to calculate the intensity in the eight minutes with the highest intensity throughout the sessions, and to use this intensity in the comparison with aerobic interval training. Also a weakness is that we do not have complete data on how many of the patients actually did their home exercise as prescribed. Possibly was it easier for the aerobic interval training patients to do their home exercise as prescribed, as it was a simpler protocol than in the usual care group. The use of aerobic interval training in a clinical setting is considered as strength of our study, as well as the multi-centre design with three participating hospitals.</p>
<p>Exercise capacity is related to survival in patients with cardiovascular disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269215511405229">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269215511405229">5</xref></sup> In a prospective study of subjects with coronary heart disease, Keteyian et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269215511405229">5</xref></sup> found a 15% reduced risk of death with every 1 mL·kg<sup>−1</sup>·min<sup>−1</sup> increase in peak oxygen uptake. The long-term effects of aerobic interval training are, however, not known, and we are not able to predict mortality risks based on our study. But interestingly, we saw higher increase in peak oxygen uptake after aerobic interval training for a total of only 38 minutes each time compared to the usual care of 60 minutes exercise sessions. Since lack of time is one of the most often reported barriers to exercise,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269215511405229">18</xref></sup> it is warranted to find time-efficient training models that patients will manage to continue with to prolong their benefits.</p>
<p>The higher heart rate achieved during the intervals in the aerobic interval training was presumed to be the reason for superior effect upon peak oxygen uptake compared to the usual care. However, we found only a weak positive correlation between individual training heart rate and changes in peak oxygen uptake. Why this correlation was not stronger than observed is currently not known, but may be related to the fact that the individual maximum heart rate was set by the exercise test at study entry. As some of the subjects did not reach their actual maximum level of exertion on this test, a true heart rate maximum could not be ascertained. In such a setting, one could question the use of target heart rate zones as the sole means to prescribe and monitor training intensity, and this may also lead to misinterpretation of the physiological effects of an exercise intervention. We saw, however, a moderate correlation between aerobic interval training heart rates and changes in peak oxygen uptake, indicating that higher exercise intensities are associated with greater response, at least in an aerobic interval training setting. This relationship has to be examined more closely in further studies.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we saw larger within individual variations in exercise intensity from one exercise session to the next among the subjects in the usual care group, possibly explaining why their peak oxygen uptake did not increase to the same extent as after aerobic interval training. On a group level, the aerobic interval training had a significantly higher heart rate during the exercise training, reflecting the larger between-individuals variations in intensity in the usual care group. This indicates that it might be easier to keep a high, as well as stable, training intensity using a treadmill aerobic interval training programme compared to the usual care group exercise seen in Norwegian hospitals.</p>
<p>When prescribing exercise intensity in aerobic interval training, our research group usually uses the % of individual heart rate maximum based on the testing at baseline and calculate the 85–95% target zone. Some subjects reach a higher heart rate at the second test (after the training period), reflecting that they did not exercise at their true maximum at the first test. In the present study, only 14 out of 89 patients (16%) had exactly the same maximum heart rate at the end of both tests, while 34 (38%) decreased and 41 (46%) increased their heart rate at the second test. This implies that using the 85–95% of baseline heart rate maximum as the target zone in a large proportion of the subjects gave a lower relative intensity than assumed. In a clinical setting, we therefore suggest to set the intensity of aerobic interval training not solely based on the 85–95% heart rate, but also to take into consideration the patients’ subjective feeling of exertion.</p>
<p>Also, almost all patients in this study were prescribed to take beta-adrenergic blocking agents (β-blockers), blocking the effects of adrenaline. When taking β-blockers patients have lower heart rates during exercise than without this medication, but it is still valid to prescribe exercise intensity by % of (β-blocked) heart rate maximum.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269215511405229">19</xref></sup> Although patients were supposed to take β-blockers, we had no formal control of this, and non-adherence to the prescribed medication could affect the heart rate recordings in the study.</p>
<p>We saw no significant between-group differences in the secondary outcome measures. In advance we had hypothesised that aerobic interval training would improve flow-mediated vasodilatation more than the usual care due to the assumed higher exercise intensity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269215511405229">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269215511405229">20</xref></sup> In studies of heart failure patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269215511405229">6</xref></sup> and subjects with the metabolic syndrome,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269215511405229">20</xref></sup> aerobic interval training gave larger increase in flow-mediated vasodilatation than moderate exercise at 70% of heart rate maximum. In the present study, the higher exercise intensity in the usual care group compared to previous studies may be the reason for the non-significant difference between the groups.</p>
<p>Increasing attention is paid to the direct vascular effects of cytokines, especially adiponectin. Hypoadiponectinemia is associated with endothelial dysfunction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269215511405229">21</xref></sup> and prevalence of coronary heart disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269215511405229">22</xref></sup> The increase in adiponectin after exercise training in our study is in line with a recent study involving similar patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269215511405229">23</xref></sup> Increased serum adiponectin has also been reported after exercise training of subjects with the metabolic syndrome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269215511405229">24</xref></sup> and obesity,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269215511405229">25</xref></sup> although data are not consistent.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269215511405229">26</xref></sup> Of interest, both adiponectin and ferritin were recently shown to be part of a new model for predicting development of type 2 diabetes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269215511405229">27</xref></sup></p>
