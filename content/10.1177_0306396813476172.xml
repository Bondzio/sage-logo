<abstract>
<p>The UAE and Qatar have been consciously constructed as specialised geographic zones for the global elite and transnational capitalism. Never undergoing a historic bourgeois democratic period and lacking citizenship rights for the large majority of their residents, the UAE and Qatar are not modern nation states. Nevertheless, the Gulf aristocracy is fully integrated into global flows of accumulation. They have adapted their societies at every level – finance, culture, leisure, education, legal structures and labour relations – to create a unique crossroads for globalisation.</p>

<p>The United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Qatar have been constructed as financial and cultural crossroads for the global elite. They occupy a distinct space in the contemporary world. Not true nation states and more than city states, the UAE and Qatar play upon a sunlit stage built on feudal institutions and financed by transnational accumulation.</p>
<p>The UAE consists of seven emirates with Dubai and Abu Dhabi holding 67 per cent of the population and about 95 per cent of the total territory. Evolving out of the British colonial system, the UAE is a hybrid urban industrial economy with a feudal political structure. The federation consists of absolute hereditary monarchies with the emir of Abu Dhabi permanently holding the position of the presidency and the emir of Dubai maintaining the office of prime minister.</p>
<p>This is not a constitutional monarchy wedded to modern society. The UAE’s hierarchy reflects a feudal social organisation, where a small slice of upper-class financial elites enjoy all the privileges denied to the general population. Only 13 per cent of the inhabitants are citizens, with immigrants 80 per cent of the workforce. Between 2005 and 2010 the population doubled, but almost all growth was by the importation of a global labour force. In fact, citizens are projected to be only 10 per cent of the country’s population by 2020. Besides the 3.5 million labourers from India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, another six per cent of the residents are expatriates from the West – some 100,000 from Britain, consisting mainly of professionals.</p>
<p>The population of the UAE ranks 115th in size in the world, but its economic clout is much bigger. The UAE is the world’s fourth largest exporter of oil, holding the seventh largest reserves. Additionally it has the nineteenth largest gas reserves, and has established a significant financial service sector. Citizens receive free health care, free education, housing, guaranteed monthly salaries and subsidised food and fuel. A per capita income of $48,500 puts the UAE among the world’s wealthiest countries, but that excludes the vast army of unskilled and semi-skilled labour.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0306396813476172">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Qatar split off from the Emirates after its independence from Britain. An absolute monarchy under the Al Thani family with Doha as its capital, it has only 200,000 citizens out of a population of two million. Qatar’s population growth ranks number one in the world, yet its birth rate ranks 188th – evidence of the huge importation of foreign labour, 40 per cent of which comes from India, Nepal and Pakistan. With a per capita income of $102,700 it has the world’s second richest citizens.</p>
<p>The above data provide the beginnings of a picture of the region’s integration into the global economy. But for the majority the UAE and Qatar lack the democratic liberties that define modern nation states. The American, French and Haitian revolutions marked a turning point in world history, establishing citizenship and inherent political and human rights as basic building blocks of contemporary states. Later the socialist revolutions in Russia, China and the popular revolution in Mexico made land distribution and economic rights for the masses a necessary component for political legitimacy. Popular consent of the governed was structured into social contracts that included such things as free education, universal health care, voting rights, guaranteed jobs, and the free association of labour. These and other basic economic and political freedoms were essential aspects (in various combinations) of both capitalist and socialist states. All of this is lacking for over 80 per cent of the region’s population. Consequently the UAE and Qatar don’t meet the definition of modern nation states, which by historic developments include citizenship and essential forms of democracy. Neither are they nation states that went through a bourgeois democratic stage only to revert to a political dictatorship. These two countries have simply never experienced a bourgeois democratic era. Yet neither are the UAE nor Qatar isolated medieval monarchies fighting off the modern world. What does exist is a project to construct a crossroads of finance and culture for the transnational capitalist class (TCC) – a node in the global network of capitalist relations connecting East and West, making the UAE and Qatar players and hosts to the global elite.</p>
<sec id="section1-0306396813476172">
<title>Labour conditions</title>
<p>The UAE’s and Qatar’s exploitative use of foreign labour fits perfectly into the neoliberal labour regime of global capitalism. The main difference is the massive legal importation of labour, rather than the use of undocumented workers or establishing overseas global assembly lines and foreign affiliates for manufacturing. But the abuse of labour is the same, whether by Nike in Indonesia, the agricultural fields of the US, or the construction industry in Doha.</p>
<p>Workers are imported into a system that binds employees to the company or sponsor that brings them to the Gulf. Workers cannot seek alternative jobs and are often denied the right to leave the country by having their passports confiscated by their employer. Many workers go deeply into debt to pay an agent to come to the Gulf. The debt is often increased due to non-payment of wages that can go on for five to six months. Workers become virtual indentured servants, living in unhealthy, cramped quarters and working in unsafe conditions. While labour laws exist on the books, they are regularly ignored in practice. Contract terms agreed upon recruitment are broken once workers arrive in the Gulf. Women domestic workers are exposed to particularly harsh conditions, often forced to live as bonded labour, their movements restricted, pay withheld, detained against their will, and exposed to sexual and psychological abuse.</p>
<p>The construction industry has been one of the most important sectors behind the economic boom in the Gulf, built on speculation, debt and dependent on imported labour. Property projects in the UAE have devoured about $350 billion worth of investments. Some of the most important have been: Burj Khalifa, the world’s tallest building; the Dubai World Central International Airport, the second-largest building in the world by floor space and sixth busiest airport for international travel; Palm Islands, the largest artificial islands in the world built exclusively for wealthy residents; Jebel Ali Port where over 200 factories operate in a free-trade zone; plus a host of iconic architecture and a vast expansion of transportation and sixty-eight new dams. The building frenzy is designed to produce an urban haven for transnational activity using the same financial methods that created the real-estate bubble in the EU and US.</p>
<p>But these world-class projects were built under labour conditions that often exposed workers to unbearable heat with no afternoon breaks or rest areas in provided air-conditioning and shelter. Arabtec Construction, which helped build the iconic Burg Khalifa, was hit by a strike of 5,000 workers demanding a $55 pay raise over their $217 monthly salary. The government struck back, rounding up seventy-one leading activists and deporting them back to Bangladesh. Since all demonstrations are illegal and workers have no right to the freedom of the press, assembly or speech, they have no democratic recourse to improve their livelihood.</p>
<p>Another dispute turned into a perfect storm of global contradictions, a cross-current of privileged culture built upon exploited international labour. One of Abu Dhabi’s most prestigious projects is the construction of the $800 million Guggenheim museum designed by Frank Gehry on Saadiyat Island. But problems erupted when 130 prominent and socially conscious artists announced they would boycott the museum unless labour conditions improved. The array of abuses included hazardous working conditions, arbitrary withholding of wages, failure of contractors to repay recruitment fees and crippling debt. As Lebanese-born New York artist Walid Raad stated: ‘Artists should not be asked to exhibit their work in buildings built on the backs of exploited workers … those working with bricks and mortar deserve the same kind of respect as those working with cameras and brushes.’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0306396813476172">2</xref></sup> But Abu Dhabi faced more serious problems than protesting artists. The global collapse in 2008 saw real-estate prices drop by half. Consequently, the government stepped in with a $10 billion bail-out of Aldar, the largest property company in the country. Saadiyat Island itself, conceived as a transnational enclave with hotels, golf courses and villas, saw much of its construction delayed.</p>
<p>As global capitalism stuttered and tripped so did Dubai, which received a bail-out of $20 billion from the UAE. Additionally, major transnational corporations in Dubai such as Dubai World, Dubai Holding Commercial Operations Groups and Dubai International Financial Centre Investment faced serious debt problems. Moody’s estimated debt exposure in the UAE at $101.5 billion, with state-owned companies accounting for $68.6 billion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0306396813476172">3</xref></sup> Although Dubai’s most prestigious real-estate projects began to recover in 2012, the industry is still holding 344,000 unsold residential units.</p>
<p>The construction industry has been a key driver of growth and power for the royal families. At both ends, that of labour and that of business, construction gives full expression to the transnational and statist character of UAE capitalism. As a local banker noted: ‘Abu Dhabi needs to spend more. If the government is not spending, no one has money. Local and international companies are not getting contracts.’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0306396813476172">4</xref></sup> State spending was evidently the agenda when the government created a property giant that will dominate Abu Dhabi’s market with access to billions of dollars’ worth of construction projects. The new corporation pulls together Aldar with Sorouh to create a $15 billion real-estate group. Aldar is 49 per cent owned by the Abu Dhabi government, which also holds a minority stake in Sorouh. Of course, when speaking of the government we are speaking of the royal families.</p>
<p>State-centric labour policies are also key in Qatar where just half of one per cent of the private workforce is made up of citizens. Qataris work for the state in government jobs. Already enjoying high pay and benefits, after the events of the Arab Spring, salaries for government workers increased 60 per cent and military wages rose 120 per cent. The economic dominance of the aristocracy is expressed through state monopolies, a mode of ownership reminiscent of feudal societies. Moreover, the social structure of class privilege parallels the European landed gentry who had three career choices – the court, the religious hierarchy or the military.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0306396813476172">5</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section2-0306396813476172">
<title>Transnational capitalist class</title>
<p>The ruling class in the UAE and Qatar is part of the transnational capitalist class (TCC), although it maintains a particular statist character. This class is thoroughly integrated into global accumulation and capital flows and shares a common capitalist culture with other global elites. But rather than deriving its power mainly through the private ownership of the means of production and finance, it wields its dominance through control of the state and its hold on energy and capital.</p>
<p>The TCC arose when corporations began to have a decisive share of their assets, employment, sales and profits linked to transnational circuits of accumulation. The class is characterised by a significant percentage of transnational stockholders in global corporations, cross-border mergers and acquisitions, joint projects, equity ownership in foreign firms, foreign direct investments, foreign affiliates, global value chains, financial speculative flows and long-term relationships with global subcontractors. As these relationships deepen there is integration of direct financial and corporate interests, and global alliances are created to serve competitive strategies. Additionally, the integration of operational leadership takes place as the composition of corporate boards merges, with membership held by TCC individuals of different national origins. Moreover, the spread of transnational political ideology and cultural values takes place in influential policy groups such as the International Chamber of Commerce or International Institute of Finance. These networks deepen the structure of the TCC by cultivating political and social integration. Mutual membership of transnational corporation boards and political policy committees, enrolment in elite schools, and bonding in exclusive clubs provide sites where TCC members develop leadership cadre, create common projects and form shared cultural attitudes and economic assumptions. As I show below, the Emirate and Qatari elite are part and parcel of these transnational capitalist networks.</p>
<p>Dubai World and its subsidiary Istithmar are major world-investment and holding corporations for UAE transnational capitalists (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0306396813476172">Table 1</xref>). Istithmar functions as a state sovereign fund or investment arm of the government. The board of directors is firmly in the hands of the UAE aristocracy, but its senior management team is a combination of western and Middle Eastern business elites. CEO Andy Watson was previously a director at Barclays.</p>

<p>Although some western business and political leaders have expressed unease over state control of sovereign wealth funds, most governments and private corporations welcome the influx of investments. A good example is the Grand Avenue Project to develop downtown Los Angeles. Seeking development funds, the Related Companies approached Istithmar for a $100 million investment. Joining the project were also three Korean insurance companies under the name of Honua. The mega project, although scaled back since the housing bust, is now owned by Related at 10 per cent, and Istithmar and Honua both with 45 per cent. A joint city-county board meeting approved Istithmar as an equity partner in a five-minute vote with virtually no debate. Such projects reveal the global integration of capital investments as well as the combination of private and statist transnational interests.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0306396813476172">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Istithmar’s parent, Dubai World (DP), enjoys a pre-eminent position as a holding company for the government with one of the world’s largest networks of global business interests. The company has over 50,000 worldwide employees in more than 100 cities with strategic acquisitions in transport and logistics, dry docks and maritime, urban development and financial services. DP is best known as one of the largest transnational marine terminal operators as well as for its iconic property developments. But it was DP’s over-extended reach that turned UAE dreams into nightmares. As the world financial crisis deepened, DP had accumulated debts of $59 billion. In December 2009, when DP announced it was unable to repay a $3.5 billion loan, the Dow Jones Index dropped 155 points. That’s when Abu Dhabi stepped in with the above-mentioned loans, which eventually totalled $20 billion. Among the biggest banks demanding paybacks are the Royal Bank of Scotland, Commerzbank of Germany and Standard Bank of South Africa, which in turn is partially owned by Chinese state financial interests. This chapter of DP’s problems is a profound illustration of the transnational nature of capitalism, and how the UAE is an important node in the cross-currents of accumulation and debt.</p>
<p>The most important player in the UAE, indeed the biggest sovereign wealth fund in the world, is the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA). With 9 per cent of the world’s oil reserves, Abu Dhabi can pour billions into its sovereign wealth fund, which totals about $700 billion. ADIA is the second-largest institutional investor in the world behind the Bank of Japan. The fund has got more aggressive in recent years, moving away from bonds and into private equity, hedge funds, real estate and infrastructure. The fund’s investors seek opportunities throughout the world with investments geared towards North America and Europe, with about 25 per cent of their capital headed for emerging markets and Asia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0306396813476172">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>The fund is firmly under control of the Abu Dhabi royal family with Sheik Khalifa bin Zayed al-Nahyan as chairman and Sheik Ahmed bin Zayed al-Nahyan as managing director. But significant authority has been given to French money manager Jean-Paul Villain, and highly valued financial advice is paid for from BlackRock and Goldman Sachs. Moreover, top talent has been wooed away from western firms. Of the 1,100 professional investors at ADIA, 70 per cent are from the US and Europe, where most UAE investors have also been educated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0306396813476172">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Among ADIA’s best known investments are a 5 per cent stake in Citigroup bought for $7.5 billion, a 10 per cent interest in Apollo Management worth $40 billion, 20 per cent ownership of Los Angeles-based Ares Management with a buy-in of $24 billion, 25 per cent of Chicago’s privatised parking meters, 10 per cent of Hyatt Hotels, 7.5 per cent of Carlyle and 4.5 per cent of Toll Brothers. ADIA has also partnered with some of the biggest transnational buyout firms co-investing in TPG’s $44.4 billion takeover of TXU Corporation and with Kohlberg Kravis Robert’s $19.4 billion buyout of Alliance Boots.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0306396813476172">9</xref></sup> Other important investments include the US hedge fund Och-Ziff; Thames Water, Alliance Medical and HSBC from the UK; Almatis and Mauser-Werke in Germany; the Industrial Development Bank and Sony in Japan; EADS, the EU defence group; EFG Hermes, a leading Arab investment bank and Banque de Tunisie et des Emirats from Tunisa.</p>
<p>What we observe above are not just global investments, but the integrated financial destinies that characterise the TCC. Perhaps one of the best examples of transnational capitalism is the UK’s second-largest airport, Gatwick, bought in 2009 by Credit Suisse (6 per cent owned by Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund) and US General Electric under the name Global Infrastructure Partners. They sought additional investment funds, which they raised by selling 15 per cent to ADIA and 12 per cent to the South Korean National Pension Service. So here we have the UK’s second-largest airport owned by major investors from four different countries, two of which are private and the others state-owned corporations. There is no national competition in this scenario, only a blending of transnational interests making profits and sharing loss, much like the example of the Grand Avenue Project in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>The pattern and method of investments we find in the UAE are repeated in Qatar. The Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) is also a sovereign wealth fund controlled by the royal family, with a capital fund of $75 billion. The Chairman and CEO is Hamad al Thani. Capital for the fund flows in from Qatar’s energy resources, which include the world’s third largest natural gas reserves. QIA has global spanning investments with a concentration in the US and Europe, but is rapidly expanding into emerging markets, including an important footprint in the Middle East. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0306396813476172">Table 2</xref> shows its main holdings in major markets, reflecting a broad range of interests in some of the world’s most important manufacturing, finance and resource transnationals.</p>

<p>In addition to the above holdings, QIA maintains a number of different investment arms. These include Qatari Diar Real Estate Investment Company ($42 billion in assets), Qatar Holding Luxembourg II, Qatar Holding Netherlands BV, Al Gharrafa Investment Company in the Cayman Islands, QDHP Swiss Management LTD and Hassad Food, which specialises in farm and agricultural investments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0306396813476172">10</xref></sup> Qatar also owns 20 per cent of the London Stock Exchange, which it shares with Dubai, which holds 28 per cent.</p>
<p>Lastly, we can examine transnational economic links through inward- and outward-bound Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) for both countries. In Qatar, inward FDI leaped from a bit under $2 billion in 2000 to over $22 billion by 2008. Concurrently its outward flow rapidly grew from $74 million to $8.7 billion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0306396813476172">11</xref></sup> By 2011 the total sum of inward FDI was at $100 billion, while its aggregate export of capital hit $23.5 billion, ranking Qatar 40th in the world.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0306396813476172">12</xref></sup> Between 2004 and 2008 Qatar invested in 102 global projects, with incoming FDI backing 203 endeavours.</p>
<p>In the UAE, inward FDI increased from just over $1 billion to well over $69 billion from 2000 to 2008. Outward-bound investments also grew dramatically, expanding from $1.9 billion to $50.8 billion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0306396813476172">13</xref></sup> By 2011 cumulative incoming FDI hit $81.33 billion, making the UAE 44th as a world destination for capital. But the UAE was even more successful in the export of FDI, with the amassed total reaching $57.93 billion, putting the Emirates 31st in the world.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0306396813476172">14</xref></sup> A good deal of this FDI went into new greenfield projects, marking the explosive rise of the UAE as a centre of both the import and export of global capital. Greenfield ventures for the UAE between 2000 and 2008 totalled 755 outward-bound investments, with 1,435 home-based projects funded by transnational FDI. The UAE’s greenfield projects far outdid any other country in the Middle East. Turkey was number two with 271 outward-bound endeavours and 483 inward-bound projects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0306396813476172">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>All the above data is clear evidence of how thoroughly the UAE and Qatari aristocracies are embedded into flows of global accumulation. Very few of these investments maintain outright ownership, instead they are joint investments with transnational capitalists the world over. The strategy has been to recirculate the massive profits from oil and gas into global holdings. It’s an economic strategy that links the wellbeing of the Gulf elite to the wellbeing and profits of the TCC. The result is that the emirate aristocracy has become part and parcel of the global capitalist class. In so doing, the internal resources and wealth of the Gulf are transformed from national wealth into transnational capital.</p>

<sec id="section3-0306396813476172">
<title>Globalised culture</title>
<p>Globalisation goes far beyond economic ties. The UAE and Qatar have immersed their societies in the cultural, educational and legal norms that align with transnational standards and practices. A new cosmopolitan identity has been created for the privileged citizens of the Gulf by inserting their society into global institutional structures and rebuilding their urban space. Their cities now mirror international cultural tastes and cater to the desires of the global elite. All this with an Arab twist well suited to the multicultural proclivities of globalisation.</p>
<p>On the educational front, about half the students in Dubai and Abu Dhabi attend private schools. The UAE hosts seventeen International Baccalaureate institutions, including programmes from the Paris Sorbonne, Michigan State, New York University and the New York Film Academy. In Qatar’s Education City, six US universities operate, including Carnegie Mellon, Georgetown, Northwestern, Texas A&amp;M, and the University of Virginia. Additionally, many of the emirate elite are sent abroad for their educational needs.</p>
<p>In the legal arena, Dubai has made a concerted effort to become a global legal centre, establishing an international financial court that takes cases from anywhere in the world. Qatar is attempting the same effort by importing judges from the UK such as Lord Woolf, former English Lord Chief Justice and Lord Cullen, former top judge in Scotland. The courts in both the UAE and Qatar use English as their official language.</p>
<p>The strategy is to build an international court system for transnational corporations to do legal battle in a country where neither party is rooted – not unlike the WTO trade courts where legal disputes are fought out in a transnational governance body. Robert Musgrove, chief executive of the Qatar Financial Centre Civil and Commercial Court argues: ‘Stateless courts are necessary for the development of global capitalism.’ Musgrove adds: ‘This is a new breed of courts that are setting up in the Middle East: effectively they are marketable commodities.’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0306396813476172">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>Qatar is also competing with the UAE on the cultural front. To counter Gehry’s Guggenheim in Abu Dhabi, Doha can show off I. M. Pei’s museum of Islamic Art. Additionally, Doha has the Qatar Fine Arts Society, Qatar Photographic Society, Qatar Music Academy, the Doha Film Institute, the Arab Museum of Modern Art, the Katara Cultural Village, and the National Museum of Qatar designed by Jean Nouvel. The money dedicated to the international arts scene is substantial and promotes the royal family as patrons. But as Lebanese artist Ninar Esber says: ‘It glitters from the outside, but from the inside, it is empty.’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0306396813476172">17</xref></sup> Missing is any content that suggests political or social themes. Such neutered art has long been a favourite for an appreciative bourgeois audience wanting to escape the cutting edge of the arts that acts as a critical reflection of the human experience. Conversations should be pleasant, only exploring intellectual questions as pale as Chablis. The director at the Qatar Museums Authority and sixteen-year Christie’s veteran Jean-Paul Engelen commented: ‘I suddenly find myself talking to people from all over the world, about the conscious and unconscious at the (Louise) Bourgeois exhibition. We are trying to show a point of view, not trying to upset the existing one.’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0306396813476172">18</xref></sup> Considering the lack of freedom in Qatar, a little upsetting art is something the royal family may need to see.</p>
<p>While marketing Doha as ‘a world leader in art and museums’, the royal family is helping to determine what art is produced through its funding of projects. Such largesse is especially effective since other funding, particularly public sources, dries up with the economic crisis. In 2011, Qatar was the world’s biggest buyer in the global art market. Among Qatar’s purchases was $72.8 million for a Mark Rothko and a reported $250 million for a Paul Cézanne. The Middle East has an $11 billion art market of which Qatar makes up 25 per cent. JP Morgan Chase and Deutsche Bank have set up regional art funds and Christie’s opened offices in Dubai in 2005 with a client base annually growing by about 25 per cent. Qatar is also beginning to purchase Arab artists, promoting the same socially vapid themes as their preferred western classics. Such art certainly deserves a place in the cultural achievements of humanity; beauty, colour and form can be spiritually uplifting. But considering the social realities of the Arab world, a sanitised artistic environment is a political statement of what is and is not important. Edward J. Dolman, former chairman of Christie’s who helps to oversee Qatar’s museum projects, notes: ‘Qatar’s royal family are very much like modern-day equivalents of the Medicis in 16th-century Florence.’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0306396813476172">19</xref></sup> And just like the aristocracy of old, the Qatari royal family is intent on creating an isolated bubble, cultivating the narrow values of the upper class.</p>
<p>Architecture is also a cultural symbol, and Doha, Abu Dhabi and Dubai are structured as global Disneylands surrounded by sands engorged with oil and gas. The most outstanding feature of these fantasy cities are dozens of iconic buildings glittering in the Arabian night. Flashing like giant billboards they send a message to come, spend and enjoy the pleasures of a zone designed to cater to the consumerist values of the privileged few. Leslie Sklair has argued that consumerism is the dominant expression of the cultural and ideological hegemony of the transnational capitalist class. Iconic architecture becomes not only its physical representation, but also an important tool that seeks to turn ‘all public space into consumerist space’. Museums, sport centres, hotels, and shopping malls create an exclusive playground for global tourism and centres of capitalist culture. Living complexes and business headquarters are also designed to reflect modernity and luxury consumption. Iconic buildings express more than the economic expansion of capital, they convey the values, power and practices of the TCC.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0306396813476172">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>To construct such urban megaprojects there are four types of actors, all fractions in Sklair’s conception of the TCC: capitalist developers and private finance to back construction; politicians and bureaucrats who often decide what gets built and guide the regulatory environment; technical professionals and architects involved in the structural features of new projects; and globalising merchants and media, or the consumerist fraction that markets architecture.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0306396813476172">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>The UAE may be one of the best urban geographies to examine iconic architecture. In a sumptuous pictorial book titled <italic>New Frontiers in Architecture</italic>, authors Oscar Bellini and Laura Daglio gush over the glass and steel wonders of Dubai and Abu Dhabi. As they write:<disp-quote>
<p>Today, cities such as Dubai and Abu Dhabi are a unique blend of modernity and the timeless desert, where East and West merge … seen as a desirable destination where every luxury can be enjoyed against a backdrop of sand dunes, sun, and sea, with daring, innovative skyscrapers, both commercial and residential, designed by some of the world’s leading architecture firms … publicizing themselves on an international scale through the creation of record-breaking buildings or projects that make headlines all over the world.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0306396813476172">22</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Here, iconic architecture as globalising culture is clearly articulated with the UAE gift wrapped as a world-class playground. The book is designed to attract and excite the global elite with its media-savvy text reading like sociological titillation. Each section of the book highlights the consumerist, iconic and privileged character of every proposed project, be it residential, business, hotels, museums, or sport venues. Again it is worth quoting at some length because the text says it better than I could ever possibly do.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Residential towers are involved in the emergent holiday homes industry … an international attraction not only for large real-estate companies, but also for small investors … Growth is both self-sustaining and boosted by a global media campaign that promotes facilities and creates tourist attractions through a series of projects in all possible sectors, ranging from sport to leisure and culture. In this context residential building transcends the mere function of housing to become an authentic consumer product … Prestige and exclusiveness are the keywords and dominant factors that drive the construction sector and constitute its main attraction … luxury has always been the primary factor on which the race for entrepreneurial success has been based; and luxury has always been identified with economic power and prestige.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0306396813476172">23</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Here we have it all. The economics of the real-estate boom advertised on a world scale (later to explode in the global meltdown). Consumerist ideology promoted through media campaigns. Iconic architecture as <italic>the</italic> consumer product, oozing luxury with the all-important message of power. Like the citadels and palaces of the feudal aristocracy, the new aristocrats of oil have created a global crossroads of privileged space where the TCC can let it all hang out, to be seen and self-admired.</p>
<p>But in order to create the desired self-conscious atmosphere of wealth, more than attractive residential and business structures must be offered. To be a truly global crossroads of culture, pleasure and leisure must be consumed. Dubai now hosts the Dubai World Cup of horse racing and Formula One racing car festival, while Abu Dhabi sponsors the Grand Prix. Additionally, there are the Manchester United Soccer Schools, the Butch Harmon School of Golf, the David Lloyd Academy for tennis and the International Global Cricket Academy. One might ask how you get beyond the sand pit playing golf in the desert? But as Bellini and Daglio write: ‘The objective is pursued whatever the cost, altering the natural environment to the extent of using desalinated water (perhaps even more valuable than oil in this part of the world) to grass golf courses and employing vast amounts of energy … in an attempt to subjugate the fierce climate.’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0306396813476172">24</xref></sup> But then why let the desert stop one’s pleasure, after all the rich have never been known for letting environmental costs spoil their fun.</p>
<p>There is also Dubailand, 107 square miles devoted to theme parks and sports. Dubai Sports City featuring Ferrari World, car museums and showrooms for Jaguar, BMW and Chrysler. The list goes on, but becomes tiresome. But it’s not all just about leisure, money is to be made. Sports and leisure property development absorbs a good amount of oil profits and the most prestigious US and European architectural firms have been hired. It’s all designed to boost tourism and fill hotels and keep the money rolling. As Bellini and Daglio explain: ‘The scale of the projects is always grandiose, nothing is left to chance and every structure is designed to draw astonished admiration before the first stone is even laid.’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0306396813476172">25</xref></sup></p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The Arab emirates have accomplished a spectacular and rapid transformation, adapting to the demands and desires of globalisation. They have constructed a unique space, inserting themselves into transnational patterns of accumulation and cultural production. Both the UAE and Qatar have skipped over the national revolutionary stage of development that swept through the Middle East after the second world war. Those regimes have now fallen or are being challenged and torn asunder; a reaction to their failed nationalist agendas and inability to fully adapt to globalisation. The once bourgeois-populist regimes of Egypt, Libya, Syria, Tunisia and Iraq have been violently pushed aside; any progressive vision lost under years of dictatorship and corruption. We can argue over whether the loss of power was justified or a manipulation of western interference, but it’s clear that the royal families in the Arab Gulf have avoided this fate.</p>
<p>Part of the answer lies in the fact that the UAE and Qatar were never nation states. There was never an anti-colonial revolution containing the hope and promise of national development based on democracy and inclusive citizenship. Rather, the semi-feudal rule of the desert emirates found an authoritarian echo in global modernity. The TCC has moved capitalism towards greater centralisation of authority, greater inequality of wealth, and governance structures far removed from democratic input. This is a system of power the royal families of the Gulf understand. They have been able to build the perfect economic and cultural home for the select few with whom they share so much. This project was constructed at a transnational level in every area – finance, real estate, labour, education, legal structure, culture, leisure, governance and business. It’s a complete vision, isolated, pristine, decadent and vapid. It thrives on a corrupted moral core of willing blindness to the vast exploitation that makes it all possible. Let the party continue! Until the music stops.</p>
