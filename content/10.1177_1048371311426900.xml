<body>
<p>At a recent conference presentation, a middle school general music teacher described and displayed projects that his students had completed on various composers, using technology in innovative and creative ways. Knowing that I teach a college-level course about women and music, the presenter looked at me halfway through the session and said apologetically, “I’m sorry that there aren’t any women included here. The only woman composer I ever learned about was Clara Schumann.” Unfortunately, this teacher is not alone; many music educators complete their degrees with little or no knowledge of women composers and performers. As educators, we naturally tend to teach the same material we have been taught; rethinking traditional curricula and searching for new resources can be a daunting and time-consuming task. However, according to the values stated on the National Association for Music Education (NAfME) website, we have a responsibility as music educators to provide our students “a comprehensive, balanced and sequential program of music.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1048371311426900">1</xref></sup> For this to occur, students in our music classes need to be informed about the many ways that women have been involved in music throughout history.</p>
<p>Women composers sometimes appear to be absent from the musical scene. Catalogs for music educators offer books, listening guides, posters, and other materials featuring Bach, Beethoven, Brahms, and a host of other male composers. Concert programs seldom seem to feature works by women. Why aren’t there more women composers? This is a frequently asked question, and the answer is twofold. First, there have been many more women composers throughout history than most people realize. However, in many cases, their accomplishments have not been recognized or preserved. For example, there is evidence that Mozart’s sister, affectionately known as “Nannerl,” possessed many musical gifts, but none of her compositions have survived. Several of Fanny Mendelssohn Hensel’s songs were published under her brother Felix’s name, and her family discouraged her from attempting to publish any of her compositions.</p>
<p>The second reason for the lack of women composers is that women have not traditionally had the same educational opportunities as men. For centuries, the doors of university and music conservatory programs were closed to women. Even when this was no longer the case, traditions were difficult to change. Germaine Tailleferre (1892–1983), a gifted composer and the only female member of “Les Six,” was forbidden by her parents to attend the Paris Conservatoire, although private tutoring sessions with faculty members were permissible. Ethel Smyth (1858–1944), the eminent English composer, was allowed to study in Hamburg only after embarking on a hunger strike in protest of her parents’ wishes that she not pursue a career in music. Until the 19th century, the only women who could pursue musical composition were from royal or wealthy families, such as Hildegard of Bingen (1098–1179) and Anna Amalia, Princess of Prussia (1723–1787), or those with male family members employed as professional musicians, such as Francesca Caccini (1587–1641) and Barbara Strozzi (1619–1677).</p>
<p>How can one begin to integrate information about the accomplishments of women into general music, music appreciation, and music history classes? The following is a sample unit for middle school and high school students that includes information about seven women from the United States who have accomplished significant “firsts” in music. The list includes women from both the classical and popular music traditions, women from the early 20th century and women who are making news today.</p>
<sec id="section1-1048371311426900">
<title>Title of Unit: Noteworthy Firsts in Music by Women in the United States</title>
<p>This unit addresses the following National Standards for Music Education: (6) listening to, analyzing, and describing music; (7) evaluating music and music performances; and (9) understanding music in relation to history and culture.</p>

<title>Module 1: Noteworthy Firsts for American Women in Symphony Orchestras</title>
<p><bold>Amy Marcy Cheney Beach</bold> (1867–1944): She was the first woman from the United States known to compose a symphony. Known as “The Dean of American Women Composers,” Amy Marcy Cheney Beach was the first woman in the United States to gain recognition for her musical compositions. Born in Henniker, New Hampshire, she was educated in Boston and made her debut as a concert pianist with the Boston Symphony Orchestra at the age of 18. She composed her first symphony, known as the Gaelic Symphony, in 1896 at the age of 29. It is the first known symphony by an American woman. Based on Irish themes, it depicts the struggles of the Irish people; “their laments, their romance, and their dreams.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1048371311426900">2</xref></sup> During Beach’s lifetime, the Gaelic Symphony was performed twice by the Boston Symphony Orchestra and twice in New York. In January of 2000, it was revived by the American Composers Orchestra during their “Roots” concert.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1048371311426900">3</xref></sup> A prolific composer, Beach wrote many large-scale works during her career, including the <italic>Mass in E flat</italic>, Op. 5 (1890) and the <italic>Concerto for Piano and Orchestra in C# minor</italic>, Op. 45 (1899). She also composed numerous choral, chamber, vocal, and piano works. Beach was a member of MENC and the Music Teachers National Association and the first president of the Society of American Women Composers.</p>
<sec id="section3-1048371311426900">
<title>Teaching strategies</title>
<p>Students read “The Story of Amy Marcy Beach” and “The Music of Amy Marcy Beach” in <italic>Meet the Great Composers, Book 2</italic>, by June Montgomery and Maurice Hinson.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1048371311426900">4</xref></sup> Students then listen to the second movement of Beach’s Gaelic Symphony (Alla Siciliana-Allegro Vivace). This movement is based on an Irish tune titled <italic>Goirtin Ornadh</italic> (The Little Field of Barley). The tune and the score to this movement can be found at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://academic.cengage.com/music/book_content/049557273X_wrightSimms/assets/more/scores/Beach_Symphony_mvt%202.pdf">http://academic.cengage.com/music/book_content/049557273X_wrightSimms/assets/more/scores/Beach_Symphony_mvt%202.pdf</ext-link></p>
<p>This tune can be sung by students or played by students on a keyboard or C instrument such as the flute or violin. After the students are familiar with the tune, explain that this movement has two speeds. The first, Alla Siciliana, is a lilting tempo in 12/8 that suggests a rocking motion. The second tempo, Allegro vivace, is fast and lively, in duple meter. Students listen to the movement and follow the guide below. The recording used for this guide is Naxos 8.559139; American Classics: <italic>Amy Beach: “Gaelic” Symphony and Piano Concerto</italic>. Alan Feinberg, piano, Nashville Symphony Orchestra, Kenneth Schermerhorn, conductor.</p>

<p><bold>Antonia Brico</bold> (1902–1989): She was the first woman to conduct the New York Philharmonic. After studying conducting at the University of California at Berkley and the Berlin State Academy of Music, Antonia Brico became the first woman conductor to achieve international fame when she conducted the Berlin Philharmonic, the Los Angeles Philharmonic, and the San Francisco Symphony Orchestras in 1930. In 1938, she became the first woman to conduct the New York Philharmonic. Unable to obtain a permanent conducting position in New York, she moved to Denver in 1942 and became the conductor of the Denver Businessmen’s Orchestra. A documentary about her life titled <italic>Antonia: A Portrait of the Woman</italic> was created by folksinger Judy Collins and Jill Godmilow and nominated for an Academy Award. In a 1975 interview, Brico stated: “If the leader knows her business, the orchestra doesn’t care whether it’s a man or a woman.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1048371311426900">5</xref></sup></p>

<title>Discussion question</title>
<p>In Brico’s obituary, it states that she “devoted her life to fighting prejudice against women in the orchestral world.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1048371311426900">6</xref></sup> What prejudice did Brico and other women involved in orchestras encounter? Do you think that this prejudice still exists today? Why or why not?</p>
<p><bold>Doriot Anthony Dwyer</bold> (b. 1922): She is the first woman to hold a principal position in a major U.S. orchestra. In 1952, after a grueling 3-hour audition, Doriot Anthony Dwyer was offered the position of principal flautist in the Boston Symphony Orchestra. She accepted, but only after successfully negotiating a larger salary. “That’s a lot of money for a little girl,” commented the manager of the orchestra. “It’s a big job,” was her reply.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1048371311426900">7</xref></sup> With this appointment, Doriot Anthony Dwyer became the first woman in the United States to hold a principal position in a major orchestra. She held this position from 1952 to 1990 and performed on most of the recordings made by the Boston Symphony Orchestra during this time. When she announced her retirement, Ellen Taaffe Zwilich was commissioned to compose a flute concerto in her honor. Dwyer premiered this work with the Boston Symphony Orchestra in April of 1990.</p>

<p>Students read about Doriot Anthony Dwyer’s career and listen to her perform the third movement of Zwilich’s flute concerto on Koch International CD 3-7142-2H1 or at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://archives.susanfleet.com/documents/doriot_anthony_dwyer.html">http://archives.susanfleet.com/documents/doriot_anthony_dwyer.html</ext-link>.</p>
<p>Before listening to the concerto, discuss the following quote by Ellen Taaffe Zwilich, the composer of the concerto: “Another challenge in writing a concerto is working out the relationship of soloist and orchestra. I think that a concerto should emphasize the starring role of the soloist yet assemble an orchestra strong enough to stand up to the solo instrument, so that a real dialogue can result.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1048371311426900">8</xref></sup> As the students listen, ask them to notice the dialogue between the flautist and the orchestra. Was Zwilich successful in her goal? If this was a dialogue between two characters in a movie, imagine what they might be discussing.</p>
<p>Ask the students to write down adjectives describing this movement as they listen. Compare their responses to the adjectives that Zwilich used to describe this movement: “brisk,” “dancelike,” “exuberant,” and “playful.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1048371311426900">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Listen to the movement again and instruct the students to create a musical map. As defined by Jody L. Kerchner, mapping is “a music listening activity that enables students to describe their music listening experiences nonverbally. . . . On their maps, students include any markings, drawings, words and/or graphs that capture what they think, feel and hear during a musical excerpt.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1048371311426900">10</xref></sup> This activity can also be done in small groups and presented as a “mapping performance informance,” as described by Kerchner (2010) in <italic>Mapping Performance as General Music Informance</italic>.</p>

<p><bold>Ellen Taaffe Zwilich</bold> (b. 1939): She is the first woman to earn a doctorate in composition from Juilliard and the first woman to win the Pulitzer Prize in music. As a high school student in Florida, Ellen Taaffe Zwilich was the first chair trumpet player in her high school band and the first chair violinist in the orchestra. After receiving her undergraduate degree in violin from Florida State, she became a member of the American Symphony Orchestra in New York and began graduate work in composition. In 1975, she became the first woman to receive a doctorate in composition from Julliard. Eight years later, she won the Pulitzer Prize for her Symphony No. 1, the first woman to receive this honor.</p>
<p>Since then, she has composed four additional symphonies and numerous orchestral and instrumental works, including <italic>Peanuts Gallery</italic>, based on characters from the comic strip. She was the first occupant of the Composers Chair at Carnegie Hall, a position she held from 1995 to 1999. During this time, she created the “Making Music” concert series, which promotes lectures and performances by current composers. After supporting herself as a freelance composer for most of her career, she is currently a member of the music faculty at her alma mater, Florida State University.</p>

<p><bold>Marin Alsop</bold> (b. 1956): She is the first woman to be the music director of a major American orchestra.

In 1989, she won the Koussevitzky Conducting Prize at Tanglewood, the first and (thus far) the only woman to receive this award. After serving as the music director of the Eugene Symphony in Oregon and the Long Island Philharmonic, as well as serving as a guest conductor throughout Europe and the United States, Alsop made history in 2007 when she became the first woman conductor of a major symphony orchestra in the United States, the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra. Alsop is also the founder of the Taki Concordia Conducting Fellowship for women conductors.

<p>As a class, individually or in small groups, students explore the official website of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, which can be viewed at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rockhall.com/">http://rockhall.com/</ext-link>. In 1987, Aretha Franklin became the first woman inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Who were the next women to be inducted, and in which year? An exhibit titled <italic>Women Who Rock</italic> is on display at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame from May 2011 to February 2012. Who are some of the women featured in this exhibit?</p>
<p><bold>Bonnie Raitt</bold> (b. 1942): She is the first woman for whom an electric guitar is named. Winner of nine Grammy awards, Bonnie is the cofounder of the Rhythm and Blues Foundation, an organization that seeks to provide recognition and better financial conditions for rhythm and blues musicians. She is also the founder of the Bonnie Raitt Guitar Project, which is currently working with 200 Boys’ and Girls’ Clubs around the world to provide music instruction to students. In 1995, Fender named a guitar after Bonnie Raitt, with all royalties going to this project.</p>

Why did she create this program? What advice does she give to young people?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>2. Bonnie Raitt is a member of the Board of the Rhythm and Blues Foundation. She has worked with many blues singers and recorded many blues songs. Students can create a blues song by selecting a topic such as “Homework Blues,” “Cold Weather Blues,” or “Messy Room Blues.” Students create verses in AAB form, such as the following</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>I’ve got the homework blues, I’m as blue as I can be</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>I’ve got the homework blues, I’m as blue as I can be</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>There’s too much work to do, and it really bothers me.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>After creating a melody based on the blues scale, students add chords and play them on keyboard or guitar, as follows:</p>
<list id="list12-1048371311426900" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>I</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>I’ve got the homework blues, I’m as blue as I can be</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>IV I</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>I’ve got the homework blues, I’m as blue as I can be</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>V IV I</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>There’s too much work to do, and it really bothers me.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Percussion can also be added, with an emphasis on the second and fourth beats of the measure. Students may also be given the opportunity to improvise. A useful resource on this subject is <italic>The Blues: Roots of a Musical Legacy</italic> by Joe B. Buttram (1993).</p>
<p>The title of this article is not intended to belittle the accomplishments of Clara Schumann, a gifted pianist and composer who performed more than 1,300 recitals and achieved worldwide fame during a career that spanned six decades. Rather, her inspiring story should be one of many noteworthy women’s stories shared with our students as we teach them about historically significant musicians and their important contributions. This unit presents a small sample of the many women whose musical accomplishments are worthy of study; additional resources are included at the end of this article.</p>
<p>We live in an age when individuals such as Doriot Anthony Dwyer, Marin Alsop, and Bonnie Raitt are breaking down barriers and making history before our very eyes. Our students, both female and male, deserve to know about these changes and the context in which they occurred. As social reformer Jane Addams stated, “Old fashioned ways which no longer apply to changed conditions are a snare in which the feet of women have always become readily entangled.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1048371311426900">15</xref></sup> Let us respond to the changed conditions and improved status of women composers and performers by providing our students with opportunities to learn about these inspirational individuals.</p>
