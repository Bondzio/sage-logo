<abstract>
<p>This article focuses on strategies adopted by British trade unions to promote education to their members and their impact on attempts to organize among migrant workers. The relationship between this activity and broader debates around union revitalization is analysed, particularly in terms of how union involvement in learning intersects with broader organizing and community focused union activity. A diverse range of approaches to education provision for migrant workers can be identified from this research. The influence of internal union politics on attempts to organize migrant workers, work in conjunction with state policy and improve access to education among their members is also analysed. The study highlights a diverse range of outcomes, raising important issues regarding union organizing strategies and their relationship to union provision of education for their memberships.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>This article explores the relationship between two areas of activity that unions in Britain have been increasingly involved in over recent years: involvement in the provision of training and education for their memberships; and organizing activity aiming to raise union membership and representation levels among migrant workers. Much of the emphasis in the literature on union revitalization relates to union organizing strategies aiming to increase membership levels overall and to attract demographic groups that have historically been underrepresented among unionized workers (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0950017012458022">Behrens et al., 2004</xref>). Organizing strategies involving non-union actors and other campaigning organizations, denoted as ‘community unionism’, have also been prominent in the literature on union revitalization, both in Britain (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0950017012458022">McBride and Greenwood, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0950017012458022">Wills, 2008</xref>) and the USA (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0950017012458022">Fine, 2006</xref>). A number of studies have focused on the relationship between union involvement in learning and processes associated with union revitalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0950017012458022">Findlay and Warhurst, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0950017012458022">Moore, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0950017012458022">Munro and Rainbird, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0950017012458022">Wallis et al., 2005</xref>). Union involvement in learning has been highlighted as having the potential, through the work of union learning representatives (ULRs) and support from the Union Leaning Fund (ULF), to attract more diverse constituencies to union membership, including migrant workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0950017012458022">Moore, 2009</xref>). There is a developing literature on union organizing among migrant workers in Britain, particularly since the accession of eight central and eastern European states to the EU in 2004 (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0950017012458022">Fitzgerald and Hardy, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0950017012458022">Martinez Lucio and Perrett, 2009a</xref>). During the same period, unions have also been heavily involved in state fostered programmes seeking to improve access to education and training for their members. The relationship between this involvement in learning and concurrent strategies aiming to organize migrant workers has as yet been relatively less explored (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0950017012458022">Heyes, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0950017012458022">Moore, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Union involvement in learning is premised on a degree of cooperation with the state over accessing funding and the setting of priorities; a range of actors with differing interests are involved in this activity. In a highly critical discussion of union involvement in learning, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0950017012458022">McIlroy (2008)</xref> dismisses possible links between learning and union revitalization on the grounds that the forms of learning promoted through these auspices do not directly address the issue of revitalization itself. It is argued that, because of constraints associated with accepting state funding, such as the ULF, it is unlikely that unions will be able to assert a more radical agenda that contributes towards organizing processes and, by extension, processes of union revitalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0950017012458022">McIlroy, 2008</xref>). It has been argued elsewhere that, while these constraints exist, unions have been able to critically engage with learning in a way that supports their own interests rather than representing incorporation into the objectives of the state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0950017012458022">Rainbird and Stuart, 2011</xref>). This tension between the agency of unions and the state over learning is a key concern of this article.</p>
<p>The overall research question addressed by this article is: what relationship does union involvement in learning have with organizing strategies attempting to stimulate membership levels and activism among migrant workers? A subsidiary question is: how is this work affected by the structures and internal politics of unions and the influence of the state? Five case studies of union involvement in learning focused on migrant workers are analysed to address these questions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0950017012458022">
<title>Union revitalization, union involvement in learning and migrant workers</title>
<p>A range of different strategies have been adopted by unions which share the common goal of reversing declining membership levels and reduced influence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0950017012458022">Frege and Kelly, 2003</xref>: 9). These strategies, denoted as union renewal or revitalization, have been conceptualized as consisting of four broad dimensions: the ‘membership dimension’ concerns efforts to increase union membership and density and to diversify the composition of membership; an ‘economic dimension’, covering bargaining power and the ability of unions to impact on the distribution of wealth; a ‘political dimension’, including the ability of unions to influence state policies; and, an ‘institutional dimension’, concerning the internal dynamics, politics and organizational structures of unions and their capacity to adjust to new strategies and contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0950017012458022">Behrens et al., 2004</xref>: 20–22). The membership dimension of revitalization is argued to require more than a simple increase in membership and density levels, with a need for more women, migrant workers, part-time workers and workers on atypical contracts to be recruited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0950017012458022">Behrens et al., 2004</xref>: 20–21). It has been noted that this compositional change needs to be handled sensitively by unions, as these changes and perceptions regarding the allocation of resources may be resented by their ‘core’ memberships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0950017012458022">Behrens et al., 2004</xref>: 20–21).</p>
<p>For unions in Britain, organizing has principally focused on membership recruitment, strengthening workplace representation and activism and in some cases building links with other social movements such as community organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0950017012458022">Frege and Kelly, 2003</xref>: 9). The TUC, from the mid-1990s, adopted a dual strategy aiming to revitalize the union movement, including the adoption of the organizing model (premised on mobilization, adversarial orientations and increased membership activism), while also drawing on notions of social partnership (involving cooperation with employers, engaging with state policy and funding and consequently attempting to lend increased legitimacy to unions as ‘responsible’ labour market actors) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0950017012458022">Daniels, 2009</xref>: 256). Earlier research on organizing strategies highlighted tensions between a transformative vision of organizing that originally emphasized self-organization and increased membership participation and organizing strategies that were largely driven and managed by full-time union officers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0950017012458022">Carter, 2000</xref>: 133). The end result of union organizing has also been questioned, with organizing campaigns often assumed to have the objective of establishing the ‘traditional and narrow union functions’ of bargaining agent and representative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0950017012458022">Heery, 2002</xref>: 32). The emphasis has generally been on recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0950017012458022">Simms and Holgate, 2010</xref>) as opposed to the more radical transformations associated with some of the earlier union organizing literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0950017012458022">Carter, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>There is a need within organizing campaigns to ensure activists are adequately trained to be able to represent members and engage with further organizing and recruitment activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0950017012458022">O’Grady and Nowak, 2004</xref>: 155). Education and training provision can bring workers into contact with ULRs and union tutors, raising awareness of the potential benefits of union membership and information around employment rights, leading them to join unions and therefore impacting on recruitment and organizing more generally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0950017012458022">Heyes, 2009</xref>: 185). While the ULR role supports workplace focused involvement in learning, much union learning activity has been driven by access to funding from the ULF. ULF projects are typically managed by union officers, an approach which resembles the more top-down, bureaucratically led approach of much union organizing activity, in contrast to notions of organizing developing in a more autonomous, member led fashion. These tensions over which actors within unions control such projects mean that intra-union politics are likely to have a marked effect on the outcomes of this work.</p>
<p>There is strong evidence that migrant workers in the UK are often employed on low rates of pay in jobs that do not match their skills and work experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0950017012458022">Anderson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0950017012458022">Mackenzie and Forde, 2009</xref>). They frequently face social and economic exclusion and long hours, often hold multiple jobs and may face a spectrum of problems outside of work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0950017012458022">Datta et al., 2007</xref>), relating to ‘immigration, housing, racism and basic survival’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0950017012458022">Holgate, 2005</xref>: 478). The levels of exploitation faced by migrant workers have been identified as a source for potential mobilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0950017012458022">Meardi, 2007</xref>), which unions could potentially address and harness. Union support for ESOL (English for speakers of other languages) courses linked to the development of union activists, and the provision of advice services concerned with employment and training, have been identified as central to attempts by unions to support migrant workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0950017012458022">Martinez Lucio and Perrett, 2009a</xref>).</p>
<p>The role of community focused migrant worker organizing as a means of revitalizing unions has been emphasized in the US literature (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0950017012458022">Fine, 2006</xref>). Community-based union organizing has, in the UK, largely taken three forms: initiatives on minimum and living wage issues; union engagement with networks and campaigns specifically focused on black and minority ethnic (BME) and migrant workers; and the setting up of community-based union learning centres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0950017012458022">Martinez Lucio and Perrett, 2009b</xref>). Examples of this work include links between unions and Polish community and religious organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0950017012458022">Fitzgerald and Hardy, 2010</xref>) and links between unions and the London Citizens community activist network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0950017012458022">Holgate, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0950017012458022">Wills, 2008</xref>). These examples are exceptional, but represent a process of broadening the spatial focus within which unions operate. There has been relatively little research to date on links between community organizing and union involvement in learning (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0950017012458022">Heyes, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0950017012458022">Martinez Lucio and Perrett, 2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0950017012458022">2009b</xref>). This area is worthy of further investigation as a number of examples of the ULF being used to support community organizing campaigns have arisen in recent years.</p>
<p>While accurately assessing the prevalence of language difficulties among migrant workers is impossible, survey evidence from central and eastern European migrant workers indicated that over a fifth reported ‘basic’ English language skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0950017012458022">Anderson et al., 2006</xref>: 36), suggesting potentially high levels of demand for ESOL provision. Case studies of union provision of learning for migrant workers highlight general recruitment benefits, notably infill recruitment, especially where ESOL courses were made available. Support from employers for these courses had been gained as they led to improvements in health and safety, communication and organizational performance. Employer support was crucial to the sustainability of this work, as ULF funding was temporary and public funding for ESOL has become increasingly restricted since 2006 (Thompson et al., 2007). The failure of government to force employers to address the ESOL needs of migrant workers creates opportunities for unions to fill this gap through their own education provision, raising their profile and demonstrating their ability to deliver benefits for the migrant workforce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0950017012458022">Heyes, 2009</xref>). Union learning centres with ESOL provision have featured predominantly in medium-to-large unionized workplaces, where established bargaining channels have been used as a means of gaining employer support for union driven learning activity focused on migrant workers. This is problematic as these initiatives can be fragile, unstable and potentially isolated, with unions reliant on the state and employers to be able to engage in this work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0950017012458022">Martinez Lucio and Perrett, 2009a</xref>).</p>
<p>Union strategies focused specifically on migrant workers face two main challenges. First, the resources needed to support such strategies are significant and unions may struggle to maintain this activity over time. Second, there is a risk that focusing specifically on migrant workers and setting up separate migrant workers’ branches may ‘encourage real or perceived separatism’, raising questions over how migrant worker focused projects can be linked to the concerns of the wider membership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0950017012458022">Heyes, 2009</xref>: 194) and whether they may lead to tensions within the memberships of unions. These tensions may be exacerbated by perceptions that local workers are competing in the labour market with migrant workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0950017012458022">Fitzgerald and Hardy, 2010</xref>). This article analyses the relationship between union involvement in learning and migrant worker organizing strategies, using detailed case study research to highlight: how learning and organizing complement each other (or not); tensions within union bureaucracies and memberships over these strategic changes; and the outcomes for workers and union organization from the integration (or otherwise) of these strategies. The precarious nature of this work, in that it relies on state funding that is not guaranteed to be sustained, as well as support from unions that face considerable financial pressures and demands from their existing membership, is also highlighted in the analysis of the case studies.</p>

<title>Research methods</title>
<p>Five union regions across three unions were the basis for the case studies, with an individual ULF project analysed in close detail within these regional contexts. The five union regions were Unite-TGWU (London), Unite-TGWU (North West), GMB (Southern), GMB (North West) and USDAW (North West). There is considerably more variation and autonomy within union regions in Unite-TGWU and the GMB than in USDAW, which is why two case study regions were chosen in the former two unions. The five case studies were based on 46 in-depth interviews with 56 participants conducted between 2006 and 2008, split almost equally between workplace reps (stewards and ULRs, with most working in both of these roles), union learning project workers (generally attached to the union’s education department and at least partially funded through the ULF), union educators (employed directly by the union in the case of Unite-TGWU in the North West but more generally from education providers working closely with union learning projects) and union full-time officials and organizers (based mainly at regional levels but with at least one national officer in each case), along with two organizers from the London Citizens network in the Unite-TGWU (London) case. Interviews were recorded, transcribed and template analysis techniques were applied.</p>
<p>In the Unite-TGWU (London) case, 10 interviews were held with 10 participants (three workplace reps, two learning project workers, one union educator, two full-time officials and two London Citizens organizers). In the Unite-TGWU (North West) case, nine interviews with 12 participants were held (four workplace reps, three learning project workers, three union educators and two full-time officials). In the GMB (Southern) case, nine interviews with 10 participants were held (four learning project workers including the branch chair, one union educator and five full-time officials – this branch did not have an established workplace rep structure at the time of research). In the GMB (North West) case, nine interviews with 14 participants were held (four workplace reps, four learning project workers, two union educators and four full-time officials). In the fifth and final case study of USDAW (North West), nine interviews were held with 10 participants (two workplace reps, three learning project workers, one union educator and four full-time officials). These interviews were augmented with site visits, observation of courses and meetings and internal documentation.</p>
<p>An overview of the cases is followed by a thematic analysis of key issues across the five union regions, including the contribution of learning towards organizing among migrant workers, followed by an exploration of intra-union tensions and the role of the state in influencing this work.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0950017012458022">
<title>Case studies – overview</title>
<p>The five cases differ considerably and allow for cross-comparison of different union strategies. The Unite-TGWU (London) and GMB (Southern) cases involved learning supporting community organizing work among migrant workers; the approach to organizing migrant workers in the Unite-TGWU (North West) case was based more on supporting workplace organization rather than community organizing; the GMB (North West) region had engaged with providing ESOL for migrant workers but in an inconsistent and patchy way; and in the USDAW case some innovative but small-scale use of ESOL for organizing migrant workers was evident. Strategic integration of learning and organizing activity varied considerably.This contributed to existing discussions on union involvement in learning, organizing, community unionism and the influence of the state and internal union politics on this activity.</p>
<p>The first Unite-TGWU case study examined the London region of the union, with a particular focus on a ULF project supporting the Justice for Cleaners campaign, which involved unions working alongside community organizations to secure a living wage and unionize contract cleaners working in offices in Canary Wharf, the City and on the London Underground. This campaign has been discussed elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0950017012458022">Wills, 2008</xref>), but the role of union involvement in learning within the campaign has not been analysed in detail to date. The union had established learning centres and ESOL provision in a number of established unionized employers such as in public transport, and the central project (named Learning for Justice) built on this existing work. Living wage agreements had been secured for around 4000 of these cleaners at the time of fieldwork, with around half of this constituency recruited as members. The main community organization engaged with was London Citizens, a network of unions, community and religious organizations that campaigns on social justice issues including low pay and the living wage. The union had been providing English language classes and briefings on employment rights at the union’s headquarters for members affiliated to this campaign, who mostly originated from Latin America, eastern Europe and Africa. This was used as a platform for enrolling activists to train as stewards and ULRs. It allowed access to ESOL provision for workers who would not have been able to access it otherwise due to cost or immigration status, with an organizer explaining that ‘if the immigration system has failed, and people have made it to this country, as long as they’re workers they have the right to union protection and we’re not interested in immigration status … we don’t even ask the nationality.’</p>
<p>The second Unite-TGWU case focuses on the North West region of the union. In this region the union had set up a network of learning centres, mainly in established unionized workplaces within public transport, distribution and manufacturing employers. These learning centres were set up with support from the ULF, most notably through assistance from the union’s learning project workers, and funding to provide IT and course materials. Innovative approaches aimed at making ESOL provision more sustainable had been adopted, which had provided a platform for the union to maintain its ESOL provision despite the widespread cuts to funding availability that were being made at the time of research. In this region union education tutors and learning project workers had gained degree level qualifications for teaching English, and a cohort of 10 ULRs were at the time of research going through similar training, indicating that the union was committed to providing ESOL in a way that relied less on fluctuating funding availability and was more self-sufficient. Learning project workers had, through teaching ESOL classes, developed strong links with groups of migrant workers, providing support and advice on a broad range of issues including employment rights and broader social welfare problems relating to housing, immigration, tax and benefits.</p>
<p>The first GMB case focused on the union’s Southern region, with a specific focus on their migrant workers’ branch. This had been set up with support from the ULF and in conjunction with a union learning centre based in the community rather than a workplace. ESOL classes provided within the centre had been used as an organizing tool and to provide a space for a disparate group of workers, mostly in the hospitality industry, to take part in courses and access advice on employment, housing, accessing financial and public services and legal issues. This branch was set up in early 2007 and, by the time of fieldwork in early 2008, had approximately 560 members. A Polish project worker and former GMB steward acted as the branch secretary, with meetings held in Polish due to problems with integrating non-English speaking members into established local GMB branches. The breadth of issues dealt with by this centre had been contentious:
<disp-quote>
<p>[W]e do quite regularly have the debate, ‘As a trade union should we be dealing with all of the other issues as well?’ … with housing and immigration control … we can’t then go out getting organized in the workplaces if we’re here dealing with issues outside of employment issues. (Learning project worker)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The second GMB case was focused on the North West region, where the union had been involved in a number of pilot projects centred on ESOL provision, including some with a community rather than workplace focus. These had been short-lived due to funding constraints, internal political tensions within the union region including scepticism from the region’s new leadership over the value of these projects, variable demand for ESOL among the migrant workers approached and the use of a non-union training provider that did not provide ESOL. The overall approach was one of isolated initiatives that were not strategically linked, which was largely explained by interviewees in terms of problems with funding and lack of demand for ESOL from the migrant workers they had approached. Subsequently, the union’s approach to organizing migrant workers in this region had become more focused on developing stewards among migrant workers in GMB organized workplaces.</p>
<p>The final case study analysed the North West region of USDAW, with a focus on ULF supported learning projects within the supermarket retail sector. Migrant workers were only present in very small numbers within this sector, estimated at around 5 per cent of staff. Pilot projects where ESOL courses were provided had been set up in some of the distribution workplaces where the union was recognized, but again these had proved difficult to sustain in light of cuts to ESOL funding and changing levels of commitment to ESOL provision from employers. Overall, the union had not developed an integrated, national strategy on organizing migrant workers at the time of research, and had struggled to provide ESOL following the changes to funding in 2006. A national organizer from the union explained, ‘We don’t necessarily have, at the moment, a coherent message to those workers, and a strategy for getting their membership … [future] campaign(s) will be an attempt to address those shortcomings.’ The longer-term strategy of USDAW in relation to migrant workers since the fieldwork has been to focus on gaining collective agreements with employment agencies rather than promoting ESOL extensively, in large part due to the funding constraints, and so the work described here was of an exploratory, pilot nature.</p>
<p>The two following sections explore the contribution of learning to organizing among migrant workers, followed by analysis of the role of intra-union politics and the state in determining the form and outcomes of this activity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0950017012458022">
<title>Learning, organizing and workplace organization</title>
<p>In the Unite-TGWU (London) case, approaches had been made to individual employers and the employers’ association in the contract cleaning sector over recognition and learning agreements, with some success. Securing formal agreements with employers was acknowledged by a learning project worker as a crucial foundation for further organizing and learning activity: ‘once you get the agreement you’ve industrialized the behaviour … [if] the employer reneges, then we would be able to use our grievance procedures to deal with that.’ However, promoting learning was described by an organizer as unfeasible in situations ‘where you’re at war with the employer’, over issues around recognition, initial recruitment and similar processes associated with organizing greenfield sites. A process of identifying and training shop stewards and ULRs was underway at the time of research and was having an impact on the internal organization of the union, as explained by a learning project worker: ‘Some of them have come through the ranks, the rank and file cleaners have become leaders, shop stewards, and then have got jobs within the organizing department.’ Some of the migrant workers who had accessed these courses had, through the confidence and language skills gained via union learning projects, gone into jobs matched more closely to the training and experience they had gained in their home countries:
<disp-quote>
<p>[W]ith migrant workers, they’ve not come here to be cleaners, it’s their first job. So they’re the ones, the energetic, life giving ones, they’re the ones that come forward to become the leaders, they’ve already had some form of education. (Learning project worker)</p>

<p>While these qualities presented rich potential for developing union activist networks, training and improved language ability would often be used by migrant workers as a means of moving into jobs more suited to their training and experience, which reportedly presented problems in terms of building sustainable representative structures among the target group.</p>
<p>In the GMB (Southern) case, problems raised by individuals through the migrant workers’ branch were used by the union as a means of gathering intelligence on where migrant workers were located and how they might be supported:
<disp-quote>
<p>[W]e look at groups of people rather than solving just individuals’ problems … if we can see that there is one person from a company coming to us, there is possibly 20 people there. So we’re trying to invite all of them because this problem might be … whole groups of people, not just one person. (Learning project worker/Branch secretary)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>A process of identifying ‘informal’ stewards within workplaces employing migrant workers had been used as a platform for attempting to develop more formal representative structures and collective agreements. The branch secretary had acted as an ‘informal’ shop steward in a GMB-organized workplace representing a group of mainly Polish and Portuguese migrant workers, before being employed by the union for her organizing and language skills. A number of interviewees, including the branch secretary, confirmed that the provision of ESOL, among other union services including employment advice and representation, had been vital in convincing migrant workers of the utility of union membership. It had also improved the ability of migrant workers to represent themselves, according to a learning project worker: ‘people cannot communicate … very often employers rely on that to exploit people. And then when people start to understand what kind of rights they have at workplaces they can have a dispute with their employer, in English.’ However, the migrant workers’ branch in this form was short-lived, as the breadth and complexity of individual, often non-employment related issues dealt with were not matched with commensurate improvements in workplace organization and recruitment:
<disp-quote>
<p>The advice centre approach we’d taken in the past, we found it almost impossible not to get buried in very urgent requests from migrant workers that are not really our core business … those kinds of approaches failed to build any workplace organization. (National official)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The union had subsequently taken an approach to organizing migrant workers that focused more on developing workplace organization, a more collective approach than the centre’s tendency to deal with more individual problems. In both of the Unite-TGWU (London) and the GMB (Southern) cases, community organizing approaches had been adopted, but there was a recognition of the fragility of this work and the need to link it to stronger workplace organization in order for it to be sustainable.</p>
<p>Difficulties in organizing migrant workers were also noted in the GMB (North West) case. A workplace rep indicated that, when attempting to promote learning and involve migrant workers in the union, ‘a lot of people were just not interested. They had no interest in assimilating themselves into the local culture as it were … they just wanted to earn money and go back’. In this case, the main learning provider affiliated to the region’s ULF project did not provide ESOL, and attempts to access provision from elsewhere had been restricted due to problems with funding. A learning project worker indicated, ‘About 80 per cent of our learning centres have ESOL needs within them but we can’t get the people in [because of] funding, lack of tutors or commitment.’ This was partly due to funding issues but also, according to the same interviewee, due to reps in GMB-organized workplaces who ‘see the normal union agenda with the indigenous employees but haven’t stepped over the yard to go and get [others] because they’re outsourced somewhere else’. Links had been developed with migrant community organizations, and migrant workers had been supported to become workplace reps. This was described as a lengthy and problematic process but appeared to have had more of an impact on the development of union organization among migrant workers than the inconsistent provision of ESOL that was apparent in this region.</p>
<p>In both of the Unite-TGWU cases, the union’s experience of working with migrant workers and of delivering ESOL in large, unionized employers such as in public transport provided the basis for further learning initiatives and attendant organizing benefits in other workplaces and sectors. This was mainly relatively small-scale infill recruitment within established organized employers, but there was also a significant contribution to strengthening workplace organization, as ESOL students in numerous cases had gone on to access training as stewards and ULRs. In the Unite-TGWU (North West) case, tutors indicated that ESOL provision for migrant workers in the bus industry had allowed them to recruit large numbers of workers from central and eastern Europe and south Asia, with an increasingly diverse cadre of workplace reps now present in the workplaces they organized. An estimated 10 per cent of workers in public transport in this region were from central and eastern Europe at the time of research. ESOL was said by a learning project worker to be a ‘marvellous tool for recruitment’ and had allowed for almost all of the participants taking part in ESOL courses to be signed up as union members. This had strengthened union organization in these workplaces and helped to alleviate problems associated with core-periphery divides within workforces premised on employment status and nationality. This case demonstrated the strongest links between learning, organizing and workplace organization among the five cases, and was seemingly the most sustainable and effective approach adopted.</p>
<p>Campaigns had been organized in the USDAW (North West) case where learning project workers, seconded union reps, union organizers and education providers would promote training and education within the four main supermarket chains comprising the union’s largest collective agreements. Learning had in this instance supported the union’s organizing objectives, which focused heavily on general recruitment due to high levels of membership turnover. In retail, it was estimated that around 5 per cent of the workforce was from a migrant worker background. Small-scale pilots had been run providing ESOL in connection with organizing activity and there had been some success in gaining support for these projects from employers in distribution workplaces where numbers of migrant workers would be higher. A national officer indicated that ‘it’s axiomatic that the provision of ESOL is a very useful tool for organizing … [ESOL has] deliberately and consciously linked the learning side with the membership side as opposed to letting it be stand-alone.’ Funding problems had constricted the expansion of these ESOL pilot schemes at the time of research, with USDAW’s subsequent approach to organizing migrant workers focusing more on gaining agreements with employment agencies as opposed to looser approaches based on servicing. This move away from the more individualized servicing approaches apparent within some ESOL pilot projects was also evident in both of the GMB cases.</p>

<title>Intra-union tensions and engagement with the state</title>
<p>Some senior officials within Unite-TGWU were said to be wary of working alongside London Citizens, taking the view that it represented ‘a handing over of power’, according to a London Citizens organizer. The same interviewee indicated that support for London Citizens was stronger among union organizers than among senior officials in the union: organizers tended to view working with the network in terms of pragmatic benefits, rather than conceding ground to a rival organization campaigning on labour market issues. Further concerns were apparent over the sustainability of the union’s involvement in the campaign:
<disp-quote>
<p>The resources put into it have been significant financially and yet the membership growth they’ve had … doesn’t justify it. I would argue that it’s been a very high profile, progressive campaign which they should be sinking money into … even when it doesn’t pay the bills immediately. (London Citizens organizer)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Strategic alliances with community organizations had allowed Unite-TGWU to engage with groups of workers that it would have struggled to reach otherwise, especially migrant workers, but this work was also viewed as resource intensive with difficulties in retaining a stable membership return from this investment. Splinter groups had left Justice for Cleaners due to a perception that they had not been sufficiently supported over key disputes including unofficial strikes. There appears to be a risk associated with raising expectations among newly organized groups of workers, expectations which may be constrained by available union resources, relatively inconsistent returns in terms of new membership and the difficult legal position unions find themselves in when dealing with a fragmented, outsourced workforce.</p>
<p>Learning activity in the GMB (Southern) region was said to be well supported by the regional leadership. However, the casualized status of most of the workers who were members of this branch, and difficulties associated with setting up stable union organization in weakly regulated areas of the service sector, presented a range of problems for the union in this case. Some tensions were noted by a learning project worker from within more established local GMB branches regarding the level of resources that were being directed towards the branch: ‘There’s one or two within that branch that [complain] “I’ve got to be Polish to get this or that”.’ A learning project worker in the Unite-TGWU (North West) case also acknowledged that there were risks associated with the union investing in the organization of migrant workers, having noticed some resentment among local members who compared the investment made in time off and courses funded for migrant workers with a perceived lack of concern for themselves: ‘If you’re not doing anything for your non-migrant workers that’s going to cause you a problem … these guys get 60 hours paid English training. The English guys don’t get [anything].’ Similarly, in the GMB (North West) case, divides within workplaces between direct employees and agency workers were exacerbated by the demographics of the workforce. In many distribution and manufacturing workplaces, agency workers were mainly from eastern and central Europe. This divide in employment status had a segregating effect that hardened the divisions between migrant workers and the local workforce, which in turn was reflected in levels of union organization. There was serious concern over the treatment of migrant workers and the multiple pressures they faced:
<disp-quote>
<p>[T]hey’re not only getting attacked by their fellow workers … accusations of taking our jobs, overtime … but they’re also getting attacked from the government as well, with them checking on documentation … when you try to approach them, they look on you as part of the government and they’re very scared and hard to break into. (Full-time official)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The role of the state in determining the forms and outcomes of learning provision supporting migrant worker organizing is crucial. It had an impact on the activity discussed here in a number of ways. The Polish branch secretary of the GMB (Southern) migrant workers’ branch indicated that, among workers from formerly communist countries, unions were strongly associated with the state, leading to problems with recruitment: ‘The political scene was something that people didn’t want to identify with … people stopped believing in what the government can do for them … people feel more like dealing with problems on an individual basis.’ This view was reinforced by comments from an organizer in the GMB (North West) case: ‘They are very scared of unions … they believe it’s like the government and Big Brother watching them and they don’t understand how the unions work in this country.’</p>
<p>Incoherent state approaches to ESOL provision were felt acutely by those within unions working in this area. The development of the workplace based ULR role as the main means of unions promoting training and education to their memberships was in part a response to the exclusion of unions from broader policy and institutional structures in the UK. This was problematic, however: a learning project worker from USDAW explained, ‘You’re being told by government that this is something you should be bargaining with employers to pay for, and yet the government wouldn’t give unions … the right to bargain on training. That’s the big omission out of the agenda’. This lack of support contradicts notions of union involvement in learning resonating with the principles of social partnership. While unions were engaging with this agenda, state and employer support was generally weak or inconsistent.</p>
<p>In the GMB (North West) case, engagement with ESOL had been inconsistent and was not explicitly linked to wider organizing strategies. This was in large part due to funding availability, some reported hostility from those migrant workers approached and the main education provider used by the union not having the capacity to address these issues. In the Unite-TGWU (London) case, there had been greater engagement with non-state external bodies such as London Citizens, and more availability of public funding from regeneration agencies and local government due to the higher policy priority migration has within a city like London, and so changes in central government funding seemingly made this work less vulnerable. In the Unite-TGWU (North West) case, state funding had been accessed but had been augmented by the union training up its own ESOL tutors, developing a more sustainable model of provision that would be less reliant on external resources in the future. The approach in this case seemed to address these problems more convincingly than in the other cases as it was more sustainable and embedded in the union’s regional organization, with more direct links to building workplace organization than elsewhere. This approach in itself was, however, problematic as the focus was on established organized workplaces rather than reaching out to the less organized sections of the labour market where migrant workers are often found. That broader approach was more apparent in smaller, more innovative (if less sustainable) projects such as the GMB (Southern) case, and the pilot projects set up by USDAW and in the GMB (North West) case.</p>

<sec id="section7-0950017012458022" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Three main themes are apparent in the findings from this research. First, all five union regions analysed in this study had, to greater or lesser extents, been active in providing ESOL to migrant worker members, a strategy which had supported broader organizing objectives in varying ways. These organizing objectives included infill recruitment, activist development, supporting the development of new recognition agreements and supporting the capacity of migrant workers to represent themselves at work, augmenting findings elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0950017012458022">Warhust et al., 2007</xref>). This activity had contributed towards the development of a more diverse union membership and activist base, highlighted as central to the ‘membership dimension’ of union revitalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0950017012458022">Behrens et al., 2004</xref>). The representation function of unions is often underplayed in its significance in comparison with the broader, transformative associations of union organizing and union revitalization (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0950017012458022">Carter, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0950017012458022">Heery, 2002</xref>). The use of learning centres, with learning project workers and union tutors coming into contact with migrant workers and providing advice and information on employment rights, including in translated form, represented a significant source of support for migrant workers given the weak regulatory and enforcement context. This support and representation led to these workers being more likely to engage with unions as a source of support, representation and advice relating to their employment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0950017012458022">Heyes, 2009</xref>). However, the most urgent problems affecting migrant workers tended to relate to employment in conjunction with a broad range of issues related to social welfare. Consequently, there were limitations in terms of what unions were able to deal with given the breadth of problems faced and constraints in terms of how effectively this activity strengthened workplace organization, which ultimately led to the demise of the approach to organizing migrant workers adopted in the GMB (Southern) case.</p>
<p>Second, the process of organizing migrant workers with support from union learning initiatives led to a plethora of institutional tensions within and between unions and other affiliated organizations, including community organizations, and the state. The position of learning within the ‘institutional dimension’ of union revitalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0950017012458022">Behrens et al., 2004</xref>), or how it relates to political dynamics within unions and among their memberships, can be seen to be complex and sensitive. While union links to community organizations represent a broader spatial focus than more traditional union organization, with such pluralist relationships having the potential to stimulate political activity (with unions by no means the leading organizations), this may come into conflict with broader union strategies and politics, especially given the lack of control that unions would have over such developments. These tensions have been identified elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0950017012458022">Holgate, 2009</xref>). Weak membership and recognition returns from adopting more community focused organizing campaigns had seriously undermined this activity, leading to scepticism within the Unite-TGWU (London) case from senior officials and the demise of the GMB (Southern) migrant workers’ branch. There are numerous difficulties faced by unions in attempting to make this work sustainable, including generally low levels of commitment to funding training from employers, and inconsistent state investment in (and weak regulation of) workplace learning in general. The role of the state, including the contingent nature of state funding and changing government priorities, is a fundamental determinant of much union involvement in learning. Unions have been using this funding in a largely independent way that supports their existing objectives, countering criticisms that it represents incorporation of unions into state objectives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0950017012458022">Rainbird and Stuart, 2011</xref>). However, sustaining this work and planning its future will be very difficult, raising questions regarding the ultimate outcomes of this process of ‘critical engagement’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0950017012458022">Rainbird and Stuart, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>A third finding related to tensions within union memberships over the allocation of resources towards organizing migrant workers. Numerous interviewees indicated that some union members had expressed resentment that resources were being, in their view, directed towards newly recruited migrant workers as opposed to the more established membership. These tensions, apparent in three of the five case study union regions analysed here, have been identified elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0950017012458022">Fitzgerald and Hardy, 2010</xref>). These problems were more significant where migrant workers were a minority within the workforce and core-periphery divides premised on employment status, and often nationality, were more marked. ESOL provision by unions for migrant workers was motivated by two main issues: supporting migrant workers so they would be more aware of their rights and more able to challenge management over working practices; and supporting migrant workers in confronting exploitative practices which allow employers to exacerbate this core-periphery divide. This support in turn restricted the ability of employers to divide workforces along those lines, strengthening the status of the core workforce and adherence to existing collective agreements which were consequently more difficult for employers to undermine.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0950017012458022" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Union involvement in learning consequently covers three principal areas of union activity. First, it addresses issues related to union organizing, in that it has some potential to attract new members including migrant workers and contributes towards the training of workplace representatives, providing spaces, not just in workplaces but also in ‘the community’, where educational activity can be supplemented by a union presence. Second, it resonates with the overall agenda of social partnership in that it involves constructive work in conjunction with the state to address aims that ostensibly benefit workers, employers and state attempts to increase skill levels within the labour force. This needs to be qualified, as although unions have engaged with these principles, employer support has varied considerably and state support has been limited to small-scale funding rather than the kind of wider regulatory change that would be needed for this work to expand significantly. Third, union involvement in learning represents individual servicing of members, although there may be a collective dimension to such services. Learning has to an extent supported organizing, more diverse representative structures and the strengthening of existing collective agreements. It has also improved access to unions for those in need of representation at work and improved awareness of and capacity to act over abuses of employment rights among migrant workers. These are highly significant outcomes and represent a significant improvement in the protection available to the workers concerned.</p>
<p>There is evidence in this study that unions have used state support to address their core interests. Some recruitment benefits and an increased level of union activism can be discerned across the cases discussed here. This counters, to an extent, some of the more strident criticisms of union involvement in learning as an implausible contributory factor to processes of union revitalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0950017012458022">McIlroy, 2008</xref>). The benefits gained by migrant workers in these cases relate to often quite basic provision of information and advice on rights at work, which in the weakly regulated UK labour market context is highly significant, if not of the order of the transformations envisaged in the union revitalization literature. However, this activity is fragile and reliant on unstable support from the state and employers and within unions themselves. Learning can support organizing objectives, but more established organizing and bargaining processes and the identification of grievances among vulnerable workers appear more fundamental to improving levels of union representation and organization among migrant workers.</p>
