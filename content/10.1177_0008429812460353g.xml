<p>The title of the book – at first sight unusual and incomprehensible – hides a genuine and profound effort of the author to overcome the limitations and dead-ends of contemporary theological and philosophical thought. It is an introduction to a new and rich vocabulary, which exceeds the boundaries of already established theological expressions and phrases. Lieven Boeve is a professor of fundamental theology at the Catholic University of Leuven (Belgium) whose research concerns theological epistemology, philosophical theology, Christian tradition development and hermeneutics.</p>
<p>This book is his attempt to find an appropriate theological method, which would try to overcome the anti-modern and modern theological divisions between the presumption of continuity of the Christian faith and the contemporary context, and the presumption of their discontinuity. The key term – interruption – is introduced as an alternative to both continuity and discontinuity: it stands against an outdated understanding of continuity since it interprets faith as a radical intrusion into the existing context, but it is also opposed to the ideas of discontinuity because the “interruption” of the context does not bring its end. In a way, the term tries to embrace both continuity and discontinuity – it occurs “where discontinuity and continuity encounter one another” (p. 103).</p>
<p>In all three parts which compose the book, Boeve treats separate thematic units, different methodological issues and aspects, which are contextually related and make a thoughtful whole. The first part, “Theology in a Post-Secular Context: About Recontextualization and Interruption,” provides an analysis of the contemporary context and contemporary religious situation in Europe. The book states that the current religious situation in Europe has changed, especially in the last decades, and therefore can be identified as a post-secular or post-Christian era or context. It points to the so-called religious revival, as a result of a weakened hegemony of secularization. This new situation has increased the awareness of religious pluralism, which is becoming more evident, and prompted by increasingly frequent dialogues.</p>
<p>Then the author presents a new theological method as a result of contextual changes, which represents a transition from correlation to recontextualization. “Interruption” is proposed as a new theological term or category, which should express the relationship between Christian religion (or theology, or tradition) and its current context (present day culture), and between continuity and discontinuity.</p>
<p>At the end of the first part, emphasis is placed on two completely different perspectives on the relation of the Christian narrative and context: “The Outer Perspective: The <italic>Ad Extra</italic> Dimension of the Communication between Christian Faith and the Context” and “The Inner Perspective: The <italic>Ad Intra</italic> Dimension of Our Communication with Culture and Society.” The chapter ends with the question: “Where Is the Boundary between the Inner and the Outer Perspective?” and we are given the answer that it is difficult to set this limit because some of the authors interpret it as too broad, and others, as too narrow (pp. 55–56).  </p>
<p>The second part, “Between Bridge and Rupture: Religious Experience, Rituals, and the Dialogue with Science,” contains analyses of the following topics: religious experience; the relationship between life rituals and sacraments; and the dialogue between faith and science. In each of these the “interruption” is used as a conceptual category and hermeneutical method in the service of a critical–productive recontextualization of theology, being a middle ground between strategies of continuity and discontinuity.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the discussion of religious experience, Boeve analyses the term “experience,” which could be interpreted in different ways with different standards: “experiment, momentary sensation or experienced occurrence and being experienced” (p. 60). These different understandings of religious experience are discussed based on the works of Edward Schillebeeckx and Antoon Vergote, who wrote about the role of experience in the Christian faith. The author also analyses the position of religious experience in theological epistemology.</p>
<p>Boeve discusses the views of Schillebeeckx on rites of passage and the sacraments in relation to practical contemporary issues and the question of continuity and discontinuity. He precedes the discussion with a note, under the subtitle “Sacramental Interruption of the Rites of Passage”: “The classic Christian rites of passage (baptism, communion, marriage, funeral) appear to have survived the dramatic decline in institutional religious practice, while at the same time new rituals have emerged in both the personal and social existence of many” (p. 92). It is an inevitable fact to which much needed attention is devoted in this part of the book. And the whole theme is completed with the conclusion that the context has changed and that the task of future generations is to engage in what Metz called “<italic>korrektivtheologie</italic>.”</p>
<p>At the end of the second part, in Chapter 6, “Narratives of Creation and Flood: A Contest between Science and Christian Faith?” Boeve explores the contemporary debate on topical issues, dealing with relations between science and Christian faith. The investigations begin with a discussion between creationists and evolutionists and their theses. This is a discussion of two completely different sides, which support two completely different realities: a reality with God and a reality without God (p. 117). From an historical perspective, there are three different models of relationships between faith and science (pp. 127 and 131). On contemporary issues that concern religious experience, rite and the relationship between religion and science, we should look for answers from the perspective of the current context.</p>
<p>The third part, “God Interrupts History: Narratives on God, Incarnation, and Time,” discusses the topics related to current religious phenomena, religious revival, so-called religious revival or faith in “something-ism.” These are also current phenomena in the sphere of religious life, which leads us to reflect on the negative or apophatic theology.</p>
<p>In contemporary social circumstances, where secularization has weakened, detraditionalization and religious pluralization have caused the evolution of religiosity inside and outside the Christian churches (p. 139). In such socio-religious circumstances the possibility of a new form of belief in “something-ism” (recognizable in the sentence: “I believe that there is something more!”) emerged. This new type of “faith” is the subject of analysis and an attempt is made to define it with emphasis on the relationship between Christian faith and the new religious phenomena. At the same time, Boeve compares two different theological approaches, negative or apophatic theology and positive or cataphatic theology, and introduces the differences between the cultural and the Christian negative theology.</p>
<p>In the face of omnipresent pluralism Boeve re-examines the question of the truth of the incarnation of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, for all Christians. This is a key topic in interfaith dialogue, because a Christian point of view should not include compromise on the issue of Christ’s incarnation, which is one of the basic Christian truths – or dogmas (p. 161). From this perspective, Boeve explores the weaknesses of three classic theological strategies dealing with the incarnation in an attempt to establish intercultural dialogue between Christianity and non-Christians: exclusion, inclusion and pluralism.</p>
<p>In the last chapter of the book Boeve deals with revived apocalyptic issues (or sensitivities). Boeve states that this is again a popular and prevailing topic, which interests not only theologians, philosophers and historians, but film producers as well. He questions the authenticity of this revival, thus giving one more dimension to his research on the relation between Christian narrative and the contemporary context.</p>
<p>In conclusion, contemporary social and cultural circumstances have produced various theological and philosophical trends and methods, both opposing and analogous, from which useful elements should be drawn but not at the expense of the purity of Christian faith. It is a difficult task and this book – when it comes to its intentions – deals with it in an uncompromising manner. Just as the author states, “the context is changing,” and in this framework one has to prove that the truth must not be (and is not) variable. In an effort to achieve this goal, Boeve discusses almost all the basic Christian themes (narratives) while confronting them mercilessly with the challenges of the post-modern social and cultural context. It is obvious that the author hopes that the “interruption” of the context in his book has actualized the narratives, showing that God is an unavoidable part of human life and that the narratives and their underlying dogmas are an inseparable part of the Christian perspective, not only as a “teaching” but also as a special (virtuous or patristic) way of life. And truly, it is for the reader to decide if Boeve’s introduction of the “interruption” is just another linguistic device which tries to embed “all things visible and invisible” into an all-inclusive scheme, or if it really succeeds in its intention to create a middle road between tradition and post-modern context which may lead to the preservation of faith in Salvation.  </p>
<p>The book is undoubtedly systematically reasoned, methodologically diverse and thematically relevant. From a theological perspective, it can serve as a textbook for different disciplines: contemporary religious studies, theological epistemology, fundamental theology, and it can even be partly useful in the field of practical liturgics. In any case, it may be interesting and informative to all curious readers but will most certainly benefit post-modern researchers in the field of philosophy that deals with the relations between theological dogma and cultural sensitivity.  </p>
<p>Finally, it should be noted that in spite of Boeve’s effort to apply Christian narratives to the entirety of the post-modern (post-Christian) context, his analysis does not include Christianity as a whole. Still, it could be argued that this is an exciting book, which could be seen as a serious theological contribution and a challenge to the whole of Western and Eastern Christendom.</p>
