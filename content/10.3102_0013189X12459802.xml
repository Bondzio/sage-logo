<abstract>
<p>The Common Core Standards for the English Language Arts (CCSS) provide explicit guidelines matching grade-level bands (e.g., 2–3, 4–5) with targeted text complexity levels. The CCSS staircase accelerates text expectations for students across Grades 2–12 in order to close a gap in the complexity of texts typically used in high school and those of college and career. The first step of the band at second and third grades is examined because it marks the entry into the staircase and a critical developmental juncture. In this article, we examine the theoretical and empirical support for three assumptions that underlie the acceleration of text complexity in Grades 2–3. Then we identify patterns in American reading achievement and instruction to illustrate the potential and far-reaching consequences of an increase in the first step of the CCSS staircase.</p>

<p>The Common Core Standards for the English Language Arts (CCSS) represent an unprecedented initiative with the support of at least 46 states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0013189X12459802">CCSS Initiative, 2010</xref>). In a review of the CCSS, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0013189X12459802">Porter, McMaken, Hwang, and Yang (2011)</xref> noted that the standards signified considerable change from previous standards but lacked specificity. But in one critical way—text complexity<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0013189X12459802">1</xref></sup>—the CCSS contain much more specific language than previous standards. Earlier documents employed nonspecific terms to address text complexity (e.g., “can determine cause-effect with grade-level text”), but the CCSS devote an entire standard to increasing students’ capacity with complex text. Text complexity, according to the CCSS, is to be established through a combination of qualitative, quantitative, and reader-task analyses. Two of the systems—qualitative and reader-task—are described in general terms. In the case of the qualitative, a handful of traits are offered without clear anchors at different grade levels and reader-task is described as the purview of teachers. Only the quantitative system is described explicitly. In the CCSS Appendix A, targeted text levels are expressed in terms of a readability system, Lexiles. Previous recommendations on Lexile levels across the grades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0013189X12459802">MetaMetrics, 2000</xref>) have been revised to ensure that Grades 11–12 texts have levels comparable to texts of college and careers. To ensure college and career readiness (CCR), a text complexity staircase is introduced that recommends accelerated Lexile levels beginning with the Grades 2–3 band (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0013189X12459802">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Addressing the complexity of text is rightfully central to ensuring that students attain the levels of literacy required for the digital-global age. The lack of definition as to appropriate text levels for different developmental levels has meant that teachers and students have not been focused on increasing capacity and sophistication in reading texts. However, vague guidelines for the qualitative and reader-task dimensions could mean a heavier weight on the clearly prescribed quantitative dimension. The state legislators who adopted the CCSS could interpret the specific quantitative readability levels as a policy imperative. The imbalance in the level of guidance for the three dimensions of text evaluation could also be reflected in the texts selected for tests by the two state consortia responsible for new assessments.</p>
<p>Our motivation in this article is to raise cautions about the text complexity staircase so that potential, unintended consequences do not occur for students in the primary grades. The focus in this article on the primary grades emanates from a review of the existing research, especially that cited by the CCSS writers as the rationale for accelerated text levels. Our review of the research, as will become apparent in this article, shows that it is middle and high school levels where text levels have decreased over the past 50 years, not the texts of the primary grades. Students’ reading levels at the end of Grade 3 have been linked to consequential outcomes such as dropping out of high school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0013189X12459802">Hernandez, 2011</xref>). At present, a significant portion of American fourth graders already is not attaining the proficient level on the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0013189X12459802">National Center for Education Statistics, 2011</xref>), and this level of achievement is with texts that are now expected of <italic>third</italic> graders in the accelerated CCSS staircase of text complexity. In this essay, we examine the theoretical and empirical rationale for beginning the acceleration in Grades 2–3 and we raise potential consequences of this policy. We preface this discussion with background on readability formulas.</p>
<sec id="section1-0013189X12459802">
<title>The Common Core Standards and Readability Formulas</title>
<p>As already noted, the CCSS describes three components to the measurement of text complexity: two qualitative and one quantitative. Unlike the assessment of writing compositions that has a long history (see e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0013189X12459802">DiPardo, Storms, &amp; Selland, 2011</xref>), the qualitative assessment of text features has been less and, when it has occurred (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0013189X12459802">Fountas &amp; Pinnell, 2009</xref>), has not been the source of research on validation and reliability. With little precedent, it is not surprising that the CCSS provide vague guidelines for and examples of qualitative analyses. Guidelines for the reader and task analyses are even more cursory than for the qualitative text features with statements that teachers make judgments based on their students and classroom contexts.</p>
<p>The lack of specificity on the two qualitative schemes is in sharp contrast to the quantitative dimension where a table with specific Lexile ranges is provided for grade bands (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0013189X12459802">Figure 1</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0013189X12459802">2</xref></sup> These reading levels, which appear in Appendix A of the standards, are referenced in Standard 10 of the main document of the CCSS for each grade. Standard 10 addresses text complexity using almost the same language for all grade levels, while interchanging the relevant grade-level bands and specifying the degree of proficiency required within different grades of a band. The exact language of the standard at different levels in a band is provided in the following with emphasis added to highlight the distinctions:
<disp-quote>
<p>STANDARD 10—GRADE 2; By the end of year, read and comprehend informational texts, including history/social studies, science, and technical texts, in the grades 2–3 text complexity band proficiently, <italic>with scaffolding as needed at the high end of the range</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0013189X12459802">CCSS Initiative, 2010</xref>, p. 13)</p>
<p>STANDARD 10—GRADE 3: By the end of the year, read and comprehend informational texts, including history/social studies, science, and technical texts, <italic>at the high end of the grades 2–3 text complexity band independently and proficiently.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0013189X12459802">CCSS Initiative, 2010</xref>, p. 14)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The only place in the CCSS where ranges are given for grade-level bands is in the presentation of the accelerated grade-level ranges in Appendix A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0013189X12459802">CCSS Initiative, 2010</xref>, Appendix A, p. 8). Thus, although they reside in an appendix and appear to be only a part of a three-part scheme for addressing text complexity, the text levels in Appendix A are closely tied, if indirectly referenced, to the standards.</p>
<p>Over the course of their almost 100-year history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0013189X12459802">Lively &amp; Pressey, 1923</xref>), some changes have occurred in readability formulas, but the primary components remain the same. All of the most widely used readability formulas have two text measures, a word factor or vocabulary index and a syntax factor. In first-generation readability formulas such as the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0013189X12459802">Spache (1953)</xref> and Dale-Chall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0013189X12459802">Dale &amp; Chall, 1948</xref>) that governed the earlier era of enactment, the word factor typically represented the match of the words in a text with graded word lists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0013189X12459802">Mesmer, 2008</xref>). The Lexile Framework represents second-generation formulas (e.g., ATOS, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0013189X12459802">Milone, 2009</xref>; Degrees of Reading Power, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0013189X12459802">Koslin, Zeno, &amp; Koslin, 1987</xref>) where the vocabulary index is the mean frequency of words relative to words in a digital databank. A logarithm of word frequency and mean sentence length produce a point on The Lexile Framework from 0 to 2,000 with a standard error of measurement of + 50L (Lexile; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0013189X12459802">White &amp; Clements, 2001</xref>). In the Lexile Framework, Rausch modeling is also used to create equivalent reader measures.</p>
<p>Readability formulas can be useful in giving writers and test makers an indication of the overall complexity of texts. However, several features of words and written discourse—and the failure of readability formulas to recognize these features—can contribute to less than perfect matches for the selection and creation of specific texts for use in instruction and assessment. Formulas can inflate or deflate true complexity at both the word and sentence levels. First, at the word level, content area texts often receive inflated readability scores since key concept words that are rare (e.g., <italic>photosynthesis, inflation</italic>) are often repeated which increases vocabulary load, even though repetition of content words can support student learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0013189X12459802">Cohen &amp; Sternberg, 1983</xref>). A second problem—the skewed distribution of words in written English—is specific to digitized readability formulas, which establish vocabulary frequency relative to all of the words in an existing database. In the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0013189X12459802">Zeno, Ivens, Millard, and Duvvuri (1995)</xref> database of 156,491 unique words within a 17.5 million-word corpus from K–12 schoolbooks, 930 words (.6% of all unique words) account for approximately 67% of total words, while 93,900 words (approximately 61% of the unique words) account for approximately .5% of total words in the sample. The result of a pattern where a small group of words has high frequencies and the majority of words share very low frequencies means that the variation across texts on the vocabulary measure is limited. Even with statistical procedures to compensate for such a skewed distribution, mean sentence length can predict a text’s complexity estimate to a greater degree than the word frequency measure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0013189X12459802">Deane, Sheehan, Sabatini, Futagi, &amp; Kostin, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Third, at the syntactic level, the typical measure used by text complexity systems—average sentence length—has been established as a limited index of a text’s syntactic complexity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0013189X12459802">Pearson, 1974</xref>). Shortening sentences to suppress text readabilities can artificially deflate complexity because the removal of connectives makes syntactic relationships vague (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0013189X12459802">Davison &amp; Kantor, 1982</xref>). Readabilities of narrative texts are especially prone to deflation due to the presence of dialogue that typically consists of short sentences. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0013189X12459802">Hemingway’s (1926)</xref> <italic>The Sun Also Rises</italic> has a Lexile of 610 that falls in the low end of the CCSS Grade 2–3 band in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0013189X12459802">Figure 1</xref>. Lastly, research has indicated that other measures may be more sensitive to estimating text complexity for primary-level readers, such as words or morphemes per T-unit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0013189X12459802">Cunningham et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Beyond the word and sentence levels, another limitation of readability formulas is their incapacity to account for reader variables that will impact the match between text and reader, namely, engagement and conceptual knowledge. High or low levels of engagement with a particular text or topic can influence the match since readers with high levels of engagement will typically persevere through more difficult texts and those with low levels of engagement will often not persevere through texts that are theoretically at their levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0013189X12459802">Schiefele, 1999</xref>). With respect to content area materials (a text type that receives heavy emphasis in the CCSSS), a reader’s conceptual knowledge can render a text more or less readable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0013189X12459802">Guthrie et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Prior history of American reading textbooks suggests that readability formulas are easy to misapply and misinterpret (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0013189X12459802">Anderson, Hiebert, Scott, &amp; Wilkinson, 1985</xref>). Readability levels have not been part of the standards documents that were written in the 1990s and early 2000s, but from the mid-1960s through mid-1980s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0013189X12459802">Tyson-Bernstein, 1988</xref>), they were part of the criteria used for statewide textbook adoptions, most prominently in California and Texas. By the early 1980s, readability formulas were often used to manipulate or write texts, not simply evaluate them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0013189X12459802">Davison &amp; Kantor, 1982</xref>). A national commission that reviewed the research on the effects of readability formula on textbooks stated “overreliance on readability formulas by the schools and their misuse by the publishing industry has contributed to bad writing in schoolbooks” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0013189X12459802">Anderson et al., 1985</xref>, p. 65).</p>
<p>Our concern with the potential effects of readability ranges for grade levels, especially the acceleration at the primary grades, stems from this history within reading education and the publishing history. We believe that the designation of these levels within the CCSS could have consequences unintended by the readability developers. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0013189X12459802">Chall (1985)</xref>, the developer of the most prominent formula until the digital age, emphasized that it is the use of the formula, not the formula itself, that can have unintended effects. Thus, our concern is not with the Lexile framework or other quantitative systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0013189X12459802">Nelson, Perfetti, Liben, &amp; Liben, 2012</xref>) but with the use of these tools to accelerate text levels for second and third graders. When quantitative ranges are connected to a standards document adopted by the legislatures of the vast majority of American states and the accompanying standard indicates that students need to read texts from the “top” of a text complexity range, potential for misinterpretation exists.</p>

<sec id="section2-0013189X12459802">
<title>The Rationale and Evidence for Accelerating Growth in Second-Third Grade</title>
<p>In this section, we describe three assumptions that underlie the text complexity staircase of the CCSS and the rationale for increased text levels beginning in the Grades 2–3 band. We examine the research evidence that the CCSS writers brought to bear for each assumption, and when empirical evidence is not provided (as is the case with the third assumption), we consider existing evidence.</p>
<list id="list1-0013189X12459802" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Assumption 1: Many current high school graduates are not prepared to read the texts of college and the workplace.</italic></p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The 2006 ACT report <italic>Reading Between the Lines</italic> seems to have been a major impetus for the focus on text complexity in and around CCR. This report found an association between the complexity of texts to which students are exposed in high school and their probability of earning a C or better in college courses such as psychology, U.S. history, and science. Notably, the ACT research begins with eighth-grade students, not elementary ones. Following the ACT study, a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0013189X12459802">Williamson (2006)</xref> reinforced the gap between the Lexile levels of texts traditionally used in high schools (1220L) and those of college and careers (1350L) as measured on college admissions tests and documents used in the military, community colleges, workplace, and citizenship. Thus, the literature does provide support for the assumption that secondary school students may not be reading texts at the requisite complexity to prepare them for college and career, but this literature is mute on the connection between second- and third-grade text levels and future performance in the texts of college and career.</p>
<list id="list2-0013189X12459802" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Assumption 2: K–12 texts have decreased in complexity.</italic></p></list-item>
</list>
<p>This assumption is stated explicitly in Appendix A of the CCSS: “<italic>K–12 reading texts have actually trended downward in difficulty in the last half century</italic>” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0013189X12459802">CCSS Initiative, 2010</xref>, Appendix, A, p. 2). The statement can hardly be the case with kindergarten texts since kindergarten texts became part of core reading programs only within the past decade as part of the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) initiatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0013189X12459802">Hiebert, 2008</xref>). An examination of the evidence from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0013189X12459802">Chall (1977)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0013189X12459802">Hayes, Wolfer, and Wolfe (1996)</xref> also raises questions about this assumption in the primary grades. In hypothesizing a link between declines in textbook complexity and SAT scores, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0013189X12459802">Chall (1977)</xref> analyzed the texts of 6th and 11th grade that were used in the early 1970s. Based on the Dale-Chall readability formula, the Grade 11 texts had readability levels of 9–10, well below the SAT passage complexity of 11–12 and 13–15. Chall’s conclusion that first-grade texts were not sufficiently challenging was based on data from her landmark study, <italic>Learning to Read</italic> (Chall, 1967/<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0013189X12459802">1983</xref>), which used texts with 1956 and 1960 copyrights. By 1977, the 1956 and 1960 copyrights were no longer in use (and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0013189X12459802">Hayes et al., 1996</xref>, would show these to be considerably easier than the copyrights that followed). The pattern that Chall reported for the 11th-grade texts is similar to that described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0013189X12459802">Williamson’s (2006)</xref> analysis of current high school texts, but her analysis does not support the assumption of declining text levels in Grades 2 and 3 from the 1970s to the present.</p>
<p>The CCSS Appendix A drew further evidence that primary-level texts had gotten more difficult from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0013189X12459802">Hayes et al. (1996)</xref>, who analyzed texts from Grades 1 through 8 across three time periods (1919–1945, 1946–1962, 1963–1991). Hayes et al. showed numerous changes in texts over the three periods, including evidence of schoolbook simplification. However, the pattern of simplification did not hold for Grade 3, where vocabulary complexity was highest in the final period. In sum, an assumption of declines in text complexity appears valid for upper grades, especially in high school, but it is not supported for primary-level texts.</p>
<list id="list3-0013189X12459802" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Assumption 3: Increasing the complexity of texts from the primary grades onward can close the gap between the levels of texts in high school and college.</italic></p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Before examining this assumption, we consider how increases in text complexity are distributed within the CCSS staircase of text complexity. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0013189X12459802">Figure 1</xref> illustrates the text acceleration in Appendix A of the CCSS with the grey bars showing old Lexile-to-grade matches and the black bars showing the new levels. In examining this graphic, the discrepancies between growth expected in the elementary grades (K–5) and that expected in Grades 6–12 is evident. Even though the Lexile framework is described as an equal interval scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0013189X12459802">Smith, Stenner, Horabin, &amp; Smith, 1989</xref>), yearly growth expected in grades K–5 averages 163L, while average growth in Grades 6–12 is 53L. The end of Grade 3 may represent less than a third of students’ school careers but the 790L target for the end of third grade represents 58% of their reading competency. It could be argued that students’ reading does not develop evenly and that the text acceleration in the elementary years reflects a natural growth spurt. As discussed in the following paragraph, growth curves studies with large samples might more closely inform the degree to which the proposed text levels coincide with development. Of course, this pattern might also be a reflection of the tool used to measure text. In the areas captured by readability measures (i.e., word frequency and sentence length), the pattern holds but it may not hold if other measures were used. The flattening of the curve at the secondary level may reflect the ceiling of possible sentence lengths in text and rare or infrequent words that, as described previously, are equated in frequency but perhaps not in complexity.</p>
<p>The text complexity staircase appears to have been informed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0013189X12459802">Williamson’s (2006)</xref> analysis of reader growth in Lexiles of a cohort of 67,908 North Carolina students. These students were in Grades 3–8 between 1999 and 2004, a period that showed marked growth on NAEP reading test in North Carolina. Reader-Lexile levels on the state test from the end of each grade were used to propose a theoretical text complexity growth curve that intersected with successful reading achievement. The end-of-the-year level for third grade on this curve was 700L. Subsequently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0013189X12459802">Williamson (2008)</xref> suggested that this level may have been limited by a ceiling on textbook complexity. Even so, the exit level of the Grade 2–3 band on the CCSS staircase of text complexity of 790 is almost two standard deviations above the 700L level at which a well-performing third-grade cohort was performing.</p>
<p>No longitudinal evidence is available to show that reading at the 790L level at third grade is a prerequisite for reading complex texts at high school level (including texts at the accelerated high school levels). At present, there is a single study that connects third-grade reading levels to high school performance: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0013189X12459802">Hernandez’s (2011)</xref> analysis of data from the National Longitudinal Surveys. Of the almost 4,000 students who were followed longitudinally, those who were not reading proficiently by third grade were four times more likely to fail to graduate from high school than proficient readers. The test that was used to establish third-grade reading proficiency was the Peabody Individual Achievement Test (PIAT) Reading Recognition subtest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0013189X12459802">Dunn &amp; Markwardt, 1970</xref>). In that this subtest of the PIAT assesses word recognition in isolation, it was not possible to obtain a Lexile (which requires connected text). Comparable norm-referenced tests that were identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0013189X12459802">Hiebert (2002)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0013189X12459802">Pearson, Hiebert, and Kamil (2007)</xref> have Lexile ranges from 540L to 585L for the 50th percentile at third grade.</p>
<p>In sum, the CCSS text complexity standards for Grade 3 appear to be aspirational, much like the No Child Left Behind Adequate Yearly Progress targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0013189X12459802">Shepard, 2008</xref>). The small set of studies that have examined text complexity over time does not show that text complexity at Grade 3 has deteriorated. Neither is there evidence that the accelerated targets in the primary grades are necessary for high school graduates to read the texts of college and careers.</p>

<sec id="section3-0013189X12459802">
<title>Potential Effects of Accelerated Text Levels in the Primary Grades</title>
<p>The CCSS has moved text complexity into conversations of reading instruction where it rightfully belongs. At the same time, a consideration of potential negative consequences of a policy initiative as widespread as the CCSS is part of the profession’s responsibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0013189X12459802">Linn, 2000</xref>). We claim neither clairvoyance in identifying unintended negative consequences of the third-grade acceleration nor can we bring research to bear at this point that “proves” that these unintended, negative consequences will occur. There is research, however, on performance levels of American students over the past decade. We base our projections of potential consequences on these data. Without substantial investments in new texts, curriculum, or teacher development (and to date, the U.S. Department of Education has allocated new funds for assessment but not for other dimensions of the initiative), data on past performance levels are likely good indicators of future performance levels.</p>
<p>Changes in instructional texts require substantial financial investments, making changes in text levels as part of instruction less certain in many states that have experienced decreases in educational spending. It is highly likely, however, that the accelerated text levels of the CCSS will be reflected in the new assessments. Third grade is the first level at which new assessments will be employed. To comply with Standard 10 of the CCSS that third graders be able to “read and comprehend . . . at the high end of the grades 2-3 text complexity band independently and proficiently” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0013189X12459802">CCSS Initiative, 2010</xref>, p. 14), texts in the assessments could have Lexiles as high as 790 to 820 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0013189X12459802">Student Achievement Partners, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Our predictions of how third graders will perform on tests with these text levels come from two large-scale projects of American students’ reading performances. The first is the already referenced <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0013189X12459802">Hernandez (2011)</xref> study that showed that one-third of a large national sample failed to read at a third-grade level (where vocabulary was approximately in the range of 540L–585L) and this group was four times more likely to fail to graduate from high school than peers who attained the third-grade level.</p>
<p>The second source are two special studies conducted by the NAEP, the first in 1995 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0013189X12459802">Pinnell et al., 1995</xref>) and the other a decade later (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0013189X12459802">Daane, Campbell, Grigg, Goodman, &amp; Oranje, 2005</xref>). Students in these studies were fourth graders (point of entry on the NAEP) and Lexile levels for the 1995 text—<italic>Hungry Spider</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0013189X12459802">Courlander, 1987</xref>)—was 580 and that for the 2006 text—<italic>The Box in the Barn</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0013189X12459802">Conner, 1988</xref>)—was 620. Relative to the accelerated Lexiles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0013189X12459802">Figure 1</xref>, these texts are around the midpoint of the Grades 2–3 band. In both the 1995 and 2006 assessments, one-third of the fourth-grade cohort failed to attain a basic level in the silent version of the test and another third failed to attain the proficient level. In other words, two-thirds of an American cohort at fourth grade performed below the proficient level with texts in the range of 580L to 620L. For this reason, we predict that the proportion of third graders proficiently reading texts at 790L to 820L would be considerably lower (provided, of course, that the tasks and proficiency levels mirror those of the NAEP). If fourth graders failed to attain proficient levels with texts that have now been designated for mid-second grade (580L–620L), the likelihood that third graders will be able to read materials at 790L to 820L is dim.</p>
<p>What are potential outcomes for primary-grade reading instruction of these shifts in text complexity, especially after reports from the first round of tests are released in 2015? A potential indirect effect of increased text demands in the primary grades could be decreased levels of automaticity and fluency in recognizing words. In the primary grades, literacy development is not just about comprehension but also about mastering what the CCSS characterize as foundational skills—automaticity in recognizing words. When texts become too difficult (as measured by high percentages of unfamiliar words), automaticity can suffer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0013189X12459802">Cramer &amp; Rosenfield, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0013189X12459802">O’Connor et al., 2002</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0013189X12459802">Foorman and Connor (2011)</xref> argue that assessments of word recognition and fluency should not be designed to simply address whether students are accurate and fluent but whether they are fluent on specific populations of words that they will be expected to read in the future. Unlike earlier readability systems (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0013189X12459802">Dale &amp; Chall, 1948</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0013189X12459802">Spache, 1953</xref>) where text difficulties were anchored to particular vocabulary, current digital readability systems do not provide this information. Texts can have high percentages of rare words, yet have low readability levels because of short sentences. For example, a text that the CCSS offers as an exemplar for the Grades 2–3 band—<italic>Bats: Creatures of the Night</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0013189X12459802">Milton, 1993</xref>)—has the same mean log word frequency as an exemplar for the Grades 11–12 CCR band—<italic>Common Sense</italic> (Paine, 1776/<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0013189X12459802">2005</xref>). The rare words in <italic>Bats</italic> (e.g., <italic>hoverer, rafters</italic>) are overall more concrete than the rare words in <italic>Common Sense</italic> (e.g., <italic>disquietudes, precariousness</italic>), but even so, a high rate of unknown words can be an obstacle for many young readers. A lack of attention to the word recognition challenge of texts for young readers may mean that at least some students fail to attain the foundational skills that are required for success on the CCSS staircase of text complexity.</p>
<p>Another potential indirect effect on students may be their motivation and engagement. The engagement of reading among American students is already low, as indicated by a 2001 nationally representative sample of fourth graders from 35 countries that ranked the United States 33rd in an index of students’ motivation for reading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0013189X12459802">Mullis, Martin, Gonzalez, &amp; Kennedy, 2003</xref>) and 35th out of 35 countries in the revised index of attitudes toward reading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0013189X12459802">Twist, Gnaldi, Schagen, &amp; Morrison, 2004</xref>). At present, there is research indicating that motivation decreases when tasks become too challenging and none that indicates that increasing challenge (and potential levels of failure) earlier in students’ careers will change this dismal national pattern of disengagement with literacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0013189X12459802">Guthrie, Wigfield, &amp; You, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Similarly, the literature is silent on the effects of summative assessments on students’ identity and motivation as readers. Formative assessments within classrooms can facilitate or hinder students’ engagement in reading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0013189X12459802">Afflerbach, 1998</xref>), but the role of summative assessments that are part of large-scale accountability programs is less clear. Test results have become part of the cultures of schools with test results announced in schools (e.g., assemblies) and communities (e.g., newspapers, websites) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0013189X12459802">Ward &amp; Burke, 2004</xref>). The stakes and results for individual students are more obvious in some states where failure to attain grade-level status can lead to retention, a trend that is increasing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0013189X12459802">Robelen, 2012</xref>). But even in contexts without such policies, a question that should be addressed in anticipation of 2015 test results is: “When a majority of students is already failing to attain the proficient level, will pushing down demands increase their engagement?”</p>
<p>Third-grade students may be unaware of their performances on summative assessments, but it is a certainty that their teachers know how their students do. High-stakes assessments do influence teachers’ sense of efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0013189X12459802">Day, 2007</xref>). How, in turn, teacher efficacy influences their reading instruction is less certain. A pattern that is clear is that the level of satisfaction among American teachers has declined in the past 2 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0013189X12459802">Markow &amp; Pieters, 2012</xref>). Teacher attrition (especially in failing schools) may be an outcome of poor test performances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0013189X12459802">Olsen &amp; Sexton, 2009</xref>). Third grade was the grade at which practices initiated by No Child Left Behind policies were ultimately assessed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0013189X12459802">Gamse, Jacob, Horst, Boulay, &amp; Unlu, 2008</xref>). Now the third-grade teachers who have dealt with the NCLB demands in failing schools (of which there are many nationwide) are being asked to raise their students’ reading levels dramatically. How third-grade teachers are to accomplish this feat, especially without substantial investments in new texts, professional development, and instructional techniques, remains uncertain. The effects of this policy on teachers’ agency and efficacy—as well as retention in the profession (especially in the schools where students are most in need)—should be a central topic in the research program of federal agencies.</p>

<title>Proposed Research Directions</title>
<p>Will the intended outcomes of higher levels of literacy for all students be realized by setting the bar arbitrarily at third grade? Our review suggests that the unintended negative consequences could well outweigh the intended positive outcomes. To prevent a situation where good intentions result in less opportunity for the students most dependent on America’s public schools, several research avenues need to be pursued with due haste.</p>
<p>First and foremost, we believe that the evidence cited by CCSS writers to verify declining levels of text complexity pertains to middle and high schools, not the primary grades. Some overgeneralizations of the textbook simplification research have resulted in large changes at the primary grades. The early acceleration of text complexity takes the focus off of secondary level where the patterns of declining challenges in texts have been clear and consistent for a 40-year period. As is stated in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0013189X12459802">ACT (2006)</xref> study, “We can no longer afford to ignore reading instruction in high school. Something must be done to improve the reading proficiency of students” (p. 7). One recommendation of the ACT report is to incorporate complex reading materials into all high school courses. The expertise of the community of scholars on adolescent literacy needs to be brought to bear on how to accelerate students’ capacity with complex texts (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0013189X12459802">Snow &amp; Biancarosa, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Second, we call for empirically informed guidelines to govern the text complexity staircase in Appendix A. Instead of aspirational text levels at the Grades 2–3 band, the text complexity levels should be informed by research. Studies that mirror Williams (2006, 2008) with more broadly sampled U.S. populations (and oversampled populations of interest) might better ground the text levels that could both simultaneously challenge and support students. At this point, they are purely aspirational.</p>
<p>Third, we call for research that investigates the consequences of higher text levels on the instruction and achievement in the primary grades in particular. Just as researchers claiming textbook simplification studied trends in SAT test results and textbooks (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0013189X12459802">Chall, 1977</xref>), researchers need to examine adaptations in instruction practices and student performances on a variety of literacy tasks as states implement the Common Core. How recommendations for accelerated levels are reflected in the texts purchased by schools also requires attention, similar to the analyses that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0013189X12459802">Foorman, Francis, Davidson, Harm, and Griffin (2004)</xref> conducted of reading programs following the decodable text policies of the past decade.</p>
<p>Fourth, we call for theoretically driven research on text features in the primary grades. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0013189X12459802">Mesmer, Cunningham, and Hiebert (2012)</xref> have proposed a model for examining primary-grade text that includes three text-level variables (words, syntax, discourse) and four program variables (pace, repetition, content, sequence). What constitutes appropriate text for students in the early phases of learning to read is not clear, and current text-complexity measurement systems do not reliably predict beginning reading text levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0013189X12459802">Hiebert &amp; Pearson, 2010</xref>). To ensure that readers’ first steps are sufficiently challenged but also simultaneously facilitative of substantial progress, researchers need to conduct theoretically grounded studies of the interaction between young readers and texts that vary in critical text-level variables and also the effects on students’ reading of particular configurations or programs of text longitudinally.</p>
<p>Finally, we propose a large-scale study, similar in scope to studies conducted by the NAEP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0013189X12459802">National Center for Education Statistics, 2011</xref>), that answers the question: Why are many American third graders not attaining the fundamental level of reading associated with future school success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0013189X12459802">Hernandez, 2011</xref>). The level of third-grade reading that predicted high school completion in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0013189X12459802">Hernandez (2011)</xref> study falls far below current expectations. As long-time literacy researchers and educators, we believe that this empirically validated level of third grade is entirely attainable by American students. A large-scale study could begin to provide insights into what is going awry—inappropriate choices of materials, tasks, allocation of time, classroom facilities, or a variety of other potential variables.</p>
<p>Increasing the pressure on the primary grades—without careful work that indicates why the necessary levels are not attained by many more students—may have consequences that could widen a gap that is already too large for the students who, at present, are left out of many careers and higher education. How sadly ironic it would be if an effort intended to support these very students limited their readiness for college and careers.</p>

<p>The Common Core Standards (CCSS) use the term <italic>text complexity</italic> throughout the document and we will adopt that term here. However, our observation both within the document and the larger literature is that the terms <italic>text complexity</italic> and <italic>text difficulty</italic> are being used interchangeably. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0013189X12459802">Mesmer, Cunningham, and Hiebert (2012)</xref> have argued that <italic>text difficulty</italic> “always implies a dependent or criterion variable: the actual or predicted performance of multiple readers on a task based on that text or feature. In contrast, <italic>complexity</italic> of a text or text feature, as we use the term, always implies independent or predictor variables: textual elements or factors that can be analyzed, studied, or manipulated. Treating the terms <italic>text complexity</italic> and <italic>text difficulty</italic> as synonymous conflates causes with effects” (p. 5).</p>

<p>In discussing these levels, we hasten to emphasize that it is not a single readability scheme that is now recommended for use by CCSS personnel. Since the publication of the standards (and the accompanying appendix in which the staircase of text complexity was provided), a study has been conducted of the predictive validity of six text difficulty systems in addition to Lexiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0013189X12459802">Nelson, Perfetti, Liben, &amp; Liben, 2012</xref>). The indices of four of the systems (two of which analyze text features in addition to vocabulary and syntax: SourceRater and Reading Maturity Metric) and the Flesh Kincaid are now included in presentations by CCSS personnel (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0013189X12459802">Pimenthal, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0013189X12459802">Student Achievement Partners, 2012</xref>). The predictive validity of these additional measures is within the same range as that of the Lexile Framework. In that the recommendations of CCSS personnel have not been officially integrated into Appendix A, we have chosen to focus on the Lexile Framework, which is part of Appendix A.</p>
