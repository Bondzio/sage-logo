<abstract>
<p>In this article we study the reciprocal relationship, the coevolution, between different forms of trust and control. We conduct comparative case study of two spatial planning projects in The Netherlands. We find that trust and control are related through contingent causation, resulting in divergent paths of coevolution. Our research shows that not only - and often stated in other research - that informal control can contribute to trust, but also formal control can lead to increasing trust. The coevolution of trust and control depends on the specific initial situation in which the relationship between trust and control unfolds.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Both trust and control are mechanisms that facilitate complex decision making (see. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0095399711413876">Das &amp; Teng, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0095399711413876">C. Lane &amp; Bachman, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0095399711413876">Leifer &amp; Mills, 1996</xref>). Decision making in a governance context is often complex because of the many interdependent actors with, oftentimes, contrary values and interests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0095399711413876">Koppenjan &amp; Klijn, 2004</xref>). Trust and control reduce ostensible complexity by limiting the number of possibilities to be taken into account. In the case of the trust strategy, people are not required to make precise forecasts of all possible negative consequences because they expect that the outcome will be positive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0095399711413876">Bachmann, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0095399711413876">Nooteboom, 2002</xref>). Complexity is handled by excluding “certain possibilities of development … from consideration” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0095399711413876">Luhmann, 1979</xref>, p. 25). Another way of handling complexity is through the use of control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0095399711413876">Leifer &amp; Mills, 1996</xref>). The control strategy reduces complexity by regulating and reducing the number of possibilities for development.</p>
<p>The literature is not clear about the relationship between trust and control in social interaction. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0095399711413876">C. Lane (1998)</xref> concludes that there is a “fundamental disagreement in the literature” on the relationship between trust and control. On one hand, scholars stress the mutual exclusive relationship between trust and control: Emphasis on control mechanisms would lead to a decrease in trust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0095399711413876">Gambetta, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0095399711413876">Milward, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0095399711413876">Zand, 1972</xref>). On the other hand, scholars underline that the relationship between trust and control is complex and that trust and control can have a mutually positive reinforcing relationship: Informal and social forms of control can increase trust between actors in interaction processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0095399711413876">Das &amp; Teng, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0095399711413876">Frankema &amp; Costa, 2005</xref>). Based on the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0095399711413876">Deutsch (1962)</xref>, many authors have defined trust in terms of the willingness to become vulnerable to another whose behavior is not under one’s control (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0095399711413876">Gambetta, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0095399711413876">Lorenz, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0095399711413876">Mayer, Davis, &amp; Schoorman, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0095399711413876">Zand, 1972</xref>). In keeping with this line of thinking, the trust strategy loses its meaning and potency if elements of control were to be involved (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0095399711413876">Dasgupta, 1988</xref>). Control and trust exclude each other by definition. One <italic>either</italic> trusts <italic>or</italic> controls another.</p>
<p>However, we expect, along with others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0095399711413876">Das &amp; Teng, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0095399711413876">Frankema &amp; Costa, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0095399711413876">Fryxell, Dooley, &amp; Vryza, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0095399711413876">Inkpen &amp; Currall, 2004</xref>;), that the relationship between trust and control is of a more complex nature. Actors attempt to realize effective decision making through trust and control. Different forms of control and trust seem to influence and reinforce each other. “Trust and control co-evolve over time with trust influencing control and being influenced by the type of controls that the partners implement” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0095399711413876">Inkpen &amp; Currall, 2004</xref>, p. 589).</p>
<p>In this article, we further study the reciprocal relationship, the interplay between different forms of trust and control theoretically and empirically. We are not just interested in the interplay between trust and control, which has been studied by others already, but we aim to add to existing studies by applying the notion of coevolution to study how the character of trust changes under influence of different forms of control and vice versa. We thus aim to go beyond studies that treat trust and control as uniform concepts and take characteristics of trust and control as given. Instead, we aim to uncover how different forms of trust and control coevolve continuously in complex governance processes. The goal of this article is to refine the existing literature on the interplay between trust and control with the help of the notion of coevolution. We will use two case studies to analyze the relationship between trust and control, find empirical conditions that facilitate trust–control interplays, and add to theory on trust and control.</p>
<p>The structure of this article is as follows: In the section titled “Positioning Trust and Control Within Two Schools of Public Administration,” we discuss two schools in public administration, New Public Management (NPM) and Governance, to position the strategies of trust and control within the scientific debate. Section titled “Theorizing Trust, Control, and Coevolution” describes the concepts of trust and control and introduces a complexity theory point of view toward the concept of coevolution. Sections titled “Case Study 1: Urban Renewal in the City of Breda” and “Case study 2: Nature Conservation in Friesland” provide two empirical examples of the coevolution of trust and control. In the section titled “Conclusion and Discussion,” we draw conclusions.</p>

<title>Positioning Trust and Control Within Two Schools of Public Administration</title>
<p>This section positions the strategies of trust and control within two major schools of public administration: NPM and Governance. In the past decade, NPM got a lot of attention in writing as well in practice. The development toward NPM can be shortly characterized as follows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0095399711413876">Milward &amp; Provan, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0095399711413876">Pollitt, 2003</xref>):</p>
<list id="list1-0095399711413876" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>a shift from inputs and processes toward outputs (test results and inspection reports) and outcomes (standards and institutions);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>a shift toward more measurement and quantification, for example, “performance indicators” and “standards”;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>a preference for more specialized, “lean,” “flat,” and autonomous organizational units rather than large hierarchical organizations;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>a widespread substitution of contracts (contracting out of public activities) for what were previously formal, hierarchical relationships;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>a broadening and blurring of the frontiers between the public sector, the market sector, and the voluntary sector, for example, by the use of public–private partnerships); and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>a deployment of market mechanisms (e.g, through competitive tendering) for the delivery of public services and emphasizing service quality and consumer orientation.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Control plays an important role in the NPM approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0095399711413876">Koppenjan &amp; Klijn, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0095399711413876">Milward, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0095399711413876">Pollitt, 2003</xref>). Control is applied to simplify phenomena by regulating them, not allowing randomness, but reducing the array of possible trajectories. In the NPM approach, complexity of the public sector is handled through control mechanisms like performance indicators, explicit standards, and control protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0095399711413876">Boston, Martin, Pallot, &amp; Walsh, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0095399711413876">Milward &amp; Provan, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0095399711413876">Pollitt, van Thiel, &amp; Homburg, 2007</xref>). There is an emphasis on top–down control (at arms length) through formal accountability, data collection, and contracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0095399711413876">Kettl, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0095399711413876">J. Lane, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0095399711413876">Milward &amp; Provan, 2003</xref>). Ideas about new contract forms crop up in a large number of countries. They are not only worked out in particular detail in the U.K. Private Finance Initiative projects but also applied in Dutch private public partnership projects (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0095399711413876">Klijn, Edelenbos, van Twist, &amp; Kort, 2008</xref>) and others. Two conditions are often stressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0095399711413876">Koppenjan &amp; Klijn, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0095399711413876">Milward &amp; Provan, 2003</xref>):</p>
<list id="list2-0095399711413876" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Clear product specification:</italic> It is essential to know beforehand what (which public sector activities) is being contracted out, and this provides the principal with a basis for evaluating the performance of the contractor.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>The need to monitor:</italic> Close monitoring is emphasized because the quality of the output in a contract relationship depends on the contractor’s efforts. Monitoring is considered an instrument in countering opportunistic behavior of contractors.</p></list-item></list>
<p>The other major school of thought in public management theory is Governance, which can shortly be characterized as follows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0095399711413876">Koppenjan &amp; Klijn, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0095399711413876">Sørensen &amp; Torfing, 2007</xref>):</p>
<list id="list3-0095399711413876" list-type="simple"><list-item><p>Emphasis on horizontal types of steering, assumed to increase cooperation from societal actors. These horizontal types of steering supposedly ensure that actors will use their veto power less frequently (enhance support);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Emphasis on a better use of the knowledge gained from private organizations and societal actors to improve the quality of policy and public services (quality improvement);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Emphasis on the early involvement of societal actors so that the legitimacy of decisions is enhanced (enhancing legitimacy). Frequently, governance reform proposals aim to improve the democratic process or at least try to reestablish the link between politics and citizenry;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Strategic and substantive uncertainties in decision-making processes can be dealt with by involving actors early in the decision-making process and by tapping into the different knowledge sources of actors to arrive at a shared vision (enhancing quality and innovative capability).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>In the Governance school, the emphasis is on trust, in contrast to the NPM school. Trust helps people to tolerate uncertainty and make decisions in case of uncertainty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0095399711413876">Bachmann, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0095399711413876">Luhmann, 1979</xref>). Trust facilitates making decisions without complete knowledge. If horizontal, voluntary relationships in modern societies are increasing in importance, trust becomes an important coordination mechanism because uncertainties can no longer be managed through hierarchical power, direct surveillance, or detailed contracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0095399711413876">C. Lane &amp; Bachmann, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0095399711413876">Loose &amp; Sydow, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0095399711413876">Ring &amp; Van de Ven, 1994</xref>). Cooperation between different actors with diverging interests is stressed to come to effective and satisfactory results. Trust between actors is an important precondition for cooperation.</p>
<p>Thus, it can be argued that there is an emphasis on control in the NPM literature and more attention paid to trust in the Governance literature. However, we stress that this argument needs nuance. Contemporary literature on NPM does pay attention to the horizontal and relational aspects of policy-making processes (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0095399711413876">Christensen &amp; Laegreid, 2007a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0095399711413876">2007b</xref>). Moreover, we see that Governance literature addresses the need for vertical aspects like power and control in governance processes (see. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0095399711413876">Sørensen &amp; Torfing, 2007</xref>). Still the relationship between trust and control is underdeveloped in both theories. The one-sided attention to either control or trust does not do justice to the complexity of the practice of public management. In practice, public managers have to deal with the complex interplay between trust and control all the time. We therefore turn to complexity theory for a better understanding of the interrelations between trust and control.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0095399711413876">
<title>Theorizing Trust, Control, and Coevolution</title>
<p>We approach coevolution as an ongoing process of mutual adjustment and reciprocal selection between two or more phenomena (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0095399711413876">Teisman, van Buuren, &amp; Gerrits, 2009</xref>), in our case trust and control. What is crucial here is the idea that adjustment and selection between phenomena means that certain characteristics of the phenomena change. Coevolution between trust and control is about mutually related changes in the characteristics of trust and control. The characteristics of different kinds of trust and control must be identified before coevolutionary processes of particular forms of trust changing into other kinds of trust under the influence of (changing) forms of control, and vice versa, can be described. We first turn the conceptualizations of the concepts trust and control, and then to the coevolutionary relationship between the two.</p>
<sec id="section4-0095399711413876">
<title>Trust</title>
<p>There are many descriptions of trust. For some, trust is an expectation (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0095399711413876">C. Lane &amp; Bachmann, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0095399711413876">Rousseau, Sitkin, Burt, &amp; Camerer, 1998</xref>), whereas for others, it can hardly be separated from shared norms or rules (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0095399711413876">Putnam, 1995</xref>). Here, trust refers to a positive expectation that other actors refrain from opportunistic behavior even when they have the opportunity to do so (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0095399711413876">Edelenbos &amp; Klijn, 2007</xref>). Within this definition, different categorizations can be made.</p>
<p>One is that trust refers to three objects of trust, namely, individuals, institutional arrangements, and institutions (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0095399711413876">Edelenbos &amp; Klijn, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0095399711413876">2007</xref>):</p>
<list id="list4-0095399711413876" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Individual trust is the trust of a trustor in an individual, the trustee. Individual trust is based on face-to-face contacts, long-term acquaintance, and mutual reliable credentials.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Trust in institutional arrangements refers to trust in structures, such as organizations or contracts.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Trust in institutions is trust in formal and informal rules. Institutions are trusted on the basis of their continuity.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Another relevant distinction is that between the different sources of trust, which lead to the following four forms of trust:</p>
<list id="list5-0095399711413876" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Competence-based trust is trust in the experience and knowledge of an individual or organization (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0095399711413876">Nooteboom, 2002</xref>). This involves trusting the ability of an actor to make things work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0095399711413876">Das &amp; Teng, 2001</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Goodwill trust is trust in the good intentions of an individual or organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0095399711413876">Nooteboom, 2002</xref>). This refers to the intentions of an actor to make things work. Goodwill trust reduces the perceived chance of opportunism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0095399711413876">Das &amp; Teng, 2001</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Cognition-based trust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0095399711413876">McAllister, 1995</xref>) is based on knowledge of the others’ attitude and behavior. This may develop when a relationship lasts long enough for actors to get to know one another.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Affect-based trust is based on affection stemming from loyalty and empathy with the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0095399711413876">McAllister, 1995</xref>). This often takes a long time to develop in interorganizational cooperation.</p></list-item>
</list>

<sec id="section5-0095399711413876">
<title>Control</title>
<p>Control can be perceived as “a regulatory process by which the elements of a system are made more predictable through the establishment of standards in the pursuit of some desired objective or state” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0095399711413876">Leifer &amp; Mills, 1996</xref>, p. 117). Loosely based on the literature that distinguishes between internal value-based control and external measure-based control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0095399711413876">Das &amp; Teng, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0095399711413876">Eisenhardt, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0095399711413876">Ouchi, 1979</xref>), four types of controls are identified here:</p>
<list id="list6-0095399711413876" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p><italic>Informal control:</italic> This is organized in an informal way. Informal control may be based on frequent meeting, communication, and socialization among actors in everyday life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0095399711413876">Das &amp; Teng, 2001</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Formal control:</italic> This relies on formal rules and procedural rationality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0095399711413876">Eisenhardt, 1985</xref>). This often implies predefined indicators and planned procedures for control and can be carried out through formally institutionalized monitoring schemes and through output indicators.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Internal control:</italic> The main thrust of this form of control is that systems, actors, or groups control themselves. Internal control reduces goal incongruence and the divergence of preferences among groups of actors (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0095399711413876">Das &amp; Teng, 2001</xref>). Internal control may be value based (organized formally through selection or training, or informally through socialization) or measurement based (organized through formal monitoring schemes and auditing procedures or informal monitoring in everyday life).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>External control:</italic> This is control that comes from outside a system or group, for example, when an independent organization is hired to carry out monitoring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0095399711413876">Eshuis &amp; Van Woerkum, 2003</xref>).</p></list-item>

<title>Coevolution: A Concept From Complexity Theory</title>
<p>Complexity theory originates from natural sciences, but it has gained popularity within social sciences in the last decade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0095399711413876">Byrne, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0095399711413876">Kauffman, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0095399711413876">Mitleton-Kelly, 2003</xref>; Teisman et al., 2008). From complexity theory, we use the concept of coevolution because we believe that it enables a more sophisticated analysis of the complex reciprocal relationship between mechanisms or—in the words of complexity theory—between systems or species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0095399711413876">Gerrits, 2008</xref>; Teisman et al., 2008). Coevolution is described as follows: “When there is interdependence between organizations, this drives them to adapt to and suit themselves to the behavior of each other—to coevolve. Co-evolution is the evolutionary mutual changes of species (or organizations) that interact with each other” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0095399711413876">Merry, 1999</xref>, p. 272).</p>
<p>We differentiate between two specific forms of coevolution, borrowed from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0095399711413876">Odum (1971)</xref> to specify the coevolutionary relationship between trust and control. We distinguish symbiotic coevolution to indicate a mutually reinforcing relationship between trust and control, and interferential coevolution to indicate a mutually weakening relationship between trust and control (see. Teisman et al., 2008). In the next two sections, we describe both interactions in more detail.</p>
<sec id="section7-0095399711413876">
<title>Interferential coevolution: Trust and control as substitutes</title>
<p>Several scholars have approached trust and control as a zero-sum game and described negative relationships between trust and control (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0095399711413876">Bradach &amp; Eccles, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0095399711413876">Gambetta, 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0095399711413876">Ring &amp; Van de Ven, 1994</xref>). They have stressed how trust and control interact as substitutes, without dealing with changes in the nature of trust and control. The idea is that the presence of trust leads to a decrease in opportunism, and therefore, there is less need for control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0095399711413876">Gambetta, 1988</xref>). A decrease in trust would lead to an increase in opportunism and a stronger need for control.</p>
<p>However, more control is thought to lead to less trust because control can be seen as a sign of distrust (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0095399711413876">Goshal &amp; Moran, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0095399711413876">Sundaramurthy &amp; Lewis, 2003</xref>). Moreover, the more an actor is able to control someone else, the less he has to rely on trust. The use of control instruments may also diminish the intrinsic motivation among actors to behave in a trustworthy manner. This is called the “crowding-out effect” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0095399711413876">Frey, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0095399711413876">1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0095399711413876">Sundaramurthy &amp; Lewis, 2003</xref>). In short, the substitutive point of view implies that trust removes the need for control and control chases away trust.</p>
<p>In public management, the substitutive view of trust and control implies that trust lessens the need for legal ordering or contracting as modes of control (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0095399711413876">Bradach &amp; Eccles, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0095399711413876">Nooteboom, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0095399711413876">Zaheer &amp; Venkatraman, 1995</xref>). Contracts are not required (or require less specification) because trust provides the basis for coping with uncertainties. Contracts decrease the level of trust because they place too much emphasis on negative aspects such as the use of coercion or the threat of sanctions. The substitutive view of trust and control places legal and social governance in opposition to each other. Strengthening trust implies a weakening of control and vice versa. Public managers must find a productive balance between working on the basis of control and working on the basis of trust.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0095399711413876">Das and Teng (2001)</xref> have come close to a description of coevolution when they describe how different forms of trust influence control and how different forms of control influence trust. They argue that formal control (on outputs and behavior) undermines goodwill trust and competence trust. Formal control throws the goodwill of actors into doubt, which creates “an atmosphere of mistrust” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0095399711413876">Das &amp; Teng, 2001</xref>, p. 263). Formal behavioral control tends to give the impression of a lack of trust in the competency to decide how to realize end-goals.</p>
<p>When an organization uses specific measures for output-control, for example, in a partnership, this is easily regarded as a lack of trust in the competence of partners to decide what is best for the partnership. An emphasis on output control may lead to a focus on particular indicators and short-term results, without taking into account integral outcomes or the long term.</p>
<p>Thus, when trust has a damaging effect on control and vice versa, this is referred to as interferential coevolution. This interplay weakens possibilities for coordination through combinations of trust and control.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0095399711413876">
<title>Symbiotic coevolution: Trust and control as complements</title>
<p>Trust and control can also be seen as complements to each other. In this view, they do not harm each other but rather mutually reinforce each other (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0095399711413876">Bachmann, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0095399711413876">Luhmann, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0095399711413876">Zand, 1972</xref>). Through mutual reinforcement of trust and control, symbiotic coevolution can develop. In this view, there can be synergy and positive mutual adjustment between (forms of) trust and control. A positive change in trust leads to a reinforcing effect on control and vice versa.</p>
<p>How can the reinforcing relationship between trust and control be explained? <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0095399711413876">Zand (1972)</xref> argues that people who trust each other are more inclined to provide timely and accurate information. This facilitates control. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0095399711413876">Das and Teng (2001)</xref> confirm this, explaining that trust reduces the level of resistance and brings harmony and interpersonal trust to the controller–controllee relationship. In other words, individual and affect-based trust may assist the implementation of formal control. In cases where people do not trust each other, they will try to minimize their vulnerability vis-à-vis the other and evade control by the other. If evasion causes suspicion, this may lead to increasing attempts to control, increasing distrust, and increasing evasion. A downward spiral of decreasing trust and increasing attempts to control but decreasingly effective control develops.</p>
<p>Control may increase trust by providing a “track record” for those who perform well. In controlled (monitored) processes, actors may increase trust by displaying their good intentions and competences over time in well-understood circumstances (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0095399711413876">Dasgupta, 1988</xref>, p. 53; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0095399711413876">Das &amp; Teng, 1998</xref>). Formal control can enhance trust based on reputation (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0095399711413876">Lewicki &amp; Bunker, 1996</xref>), especially if control is performed by an independent, professional, and neutral controller. Besides, the act of voluntarily submitting oneself to monitoring can increase trust. “When one is prepared to be monitored, one indicates that one has nothing to hide” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0095399711413876">Eshuis and Van Woerkum, 2003</xref>, p. 385).</p>
<p>A view of trust and control as mutually reinforcing strategies has implications for public administration. In this view, trust increases the preparedness to be vulnerable and to commit oneself to a relationship (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0095399711413876">Zand, 1972</xref>). From this perspective, a contract is a basis for trust because it limits the opportunities and incentives for opportunism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0095399711413876">Klein Woolthuis, Hillebrand, &amp; Nooteboom, 2010</xref>). Formal control, in written incomplete contracts, facilitates the development of trust in institutional arrangements and personal relationships. Thanks to the latent existence of potential control options, actors need not fear that their trust will be breached. This facilitates the development of trust. Note that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0095399711413876">Luhmann (1979)</xref> stresses that in the context of a trusting relationship, it is crucial that rules are latent and only mobilized as an ultimate appeal (when no other option is available). In case of trust, instruments of control operate “tacitly, without poisoning the relationship with the threat of sanctions and thus putting paid to emergent trust” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0095399711413876">Luhmann, 1979</xref>, p. 36).</p>
<p>Moreover, contracts can be seen as the consolidation of commitment between actors. As such, trust would precede a contract and a contract can be understood as a sign of trust or the consolidation of trust (Durkheim, 1893/<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0095399711413876">1984</xref>). Often, a specific form of contract emerges, that is, “incomplete contracts,” which are less detailed (fewer clauses) and have a more open-ended character. This leaves more room for solving issues through trustworthy and informal interaction and communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0095399711413876">Klein Woolthuis et al., 2010</xref>). Drawing up a contract facilitates the development of trust in a partnership. In this regard, some refer to “agreement trust,” where a contract is a source or token of trust (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0095399711413876">Deakin &amp; Wilkinson, 1998</xref>, p. 146; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0095399711413876">Zucker, 1986</xref>).</p>
<p>Another mechanism of forms of control positively influencing types of trust can be found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0095399711413876">Das and Teng (1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0095399711413876">2001</xref>). Here it is proposed that informal control has a positive effect on intentional trust and competence trust (as opposed to formal control, which has a negative effect). Informal control, as opposed to formal control, means that controllers monitor controllees through direct communication and face-to-face contact. During these interaction processes required for implementing social control, people get to know each other better. This may enhance cognitive trust, intentional trust, and competence trust. People become familiar with the frames of references used by other actors, the intentions driving their actions and their competences.</p>
<p>In short, when trust and control reinforce each other, this is called symbiotic coevolution. In case of symbiotic coevolution, the possibilities for coordination on basis of combinations of trust and control increase.</p>

<title>Research Design, Methodology, and Analytical Framework</title>
<p>In this article, we are especially interested in the interplay between trust and control in complex interorganizational decision-making processes. Therefore, we did not apply intrinsic case studies, which are studied out of interest for the case itself, but we applied instrumental case studies, which are researched to find out more about a particular phenomenon (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0095399711413876">Stake, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>We selected our cases strategically to research our subject of interest. Both cases were initially part of a larger research program on complex decision-making processes. During the course of the research program, we developed special interest in trust and control because the literature indicated that those were important mechanisms in the face of complexity. We selected two cases to further analyze the trust control nexus: (a) the case of urban renewal in the Dutch city of Breda and (b) the case of nature conservation in the Dutch province of Friesland. These cases were selected first because trust and control played an important role in the cases. There was a starting condition of low trust, and the municipalities involved attempted to improve trust while maintaining control. In this transition phase, the trust–control nexus and its specific characteristics (possibilities and problems) explicitly appear in practice. A new balance between trust and control has to be found, and this provides opportunities to study control and trust and their interplay. A second reason for selecting the two cases was that there was a clear trust–control nexus that could be clearly defined at the interface between citizens and government. There was a clear distinction between controllers and controllees; the cases revolved around community-based initiatives, which gave more responsibility to citizens or farmers to develop and implement governmental spatial planning policy. Citizens and farmers are the controllees, whereas the municipal organization is the controller (monitoring the way stakeholders develop and implement municipal policy).</p>
<p>We conducted case studies not in a purely explorative manner. Rather, we conducted theory-informed case studies in a focused way, to empirically analyze a particular theoretically relevant issue and generate new theoretical knowledge from the empirical analysis. The research design of two case studies does not enable us to develop generalized empirical knowledge, but it does provide a detailed understanding of contextual and situational conditions influencing the trust and control interplay. From the cases, we draw theoretical insights, which need to be empirically validated in other contexts before we know how far they can be generalized. This is in accordance with conventional case-study methodology (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0095399711413876">Stake, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0095399711413876">Yin, 1984</xref>). We thus applied theory to analyze the cases, and we used the cases to develop new theory (emerging from the cases).</p>
<p>Data were collected through a combination of interviews, observations, and document analyses. For Breda, 13 semistructured interviews were conducted and for Friesland 15. To analyze the data, we used an analytical framework that consists of three core variables: (a) trust, (b) control, and (c) coevolution. We operationalize trust as the willingness of a party to be vulnerable to the actions of another party based on the positive expectations that the other has the intentions and the competences to perform a particular action important to the trustor (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0095399711413876">Lewicki &amp; Bunker, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0095399711413876">Mayer et al., 1995</xref>). The level of trust has been researched by determining the degrees of trust in intentions and competences of an actor. The data were analyzed with the following questions regarding actors’ expectations about the behavior of others:</p>
<list id="list7-0095399711413876" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>To what extent does the actor expect that the intentions of the other parties are good in principle?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To what extent does the actor expect that other parties will not take action that harms you, if it is in their interest?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Respondents’ answers were placed in the following three categories:</p>
<list id="list8-0095399711413876" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>a positive expectation (+),</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>a neutral expectation (0), and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>a negative expectation (−).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Computing these two questions, we determine the overall level of trust between actors:</p>
<list id="list9-0095399711413876" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>high-level trust (++);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>moderate trust (+);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>indifferent (0);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>moderate distrust (−); and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>high-level distrust (—).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>For competence trust, we did the same exercise. Competence is about expectations about the knowledge, experience, and abilities of an actor. We asked two questions,</p>
<list id="list10-0095399711413876" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>To what extent does an actor expect that the competences of other parties are good?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To what extent does an actor expect that other parties have the right resources?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The answers of the interviewees were categorized in the same way as with the first question on goodwill trust leading to overall statements of high-level trust; moderate trust; indifferent, moderate distrust; and high-level distrust.</p>
<p>Control is operationalized as a regulatory process by which the behaviour of an actor is made more predictable through the establishment of formal and informal standards in the pursuit of some desired objective (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0095399711413876">Das &amp; Teng, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0095399711413876">Leifer &amp; Mills, 1996</xref>). The level of control has been researched by determining the degrees of control through informal and formal control mechanisms. Informal control is monitoring of actors through personal (face-to-face) communication and oral agreements. We analyzed the data posing two questions:</p>
<list id="list11-0095399711413876" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>To what extent is there personal, face-to-face communication between controller and controllee?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To what extent are agreements made on an oral basis?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Answers to both categories are categorized as follows:</p>
<list id="list12-0095399711413876" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>to a high extent (+),</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>neutral (0), and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>to a low extent (−).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Subsequently, we distinguish formal control. This is the monitoring of people through an impersonal information procedure (by a measurement system), carried out on the basis of written documents. We addressed the following issues in interviews:</p>
<list id="list13-0095399711413876" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>To what extent is there a system of control procedures in which controllers monitor controllees?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To what extent are agreements made on a written basis?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The answers of the respondents on these two questions were categorized threefold:</p>
<list id="list14-0095399711413876" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>to a high extent (+),</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>neutral (0), and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>to a low extent (–).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>This operationalization enables us to establish the degree of different forms of trust and control. It also enables us to determine whether high or low scores on different forms of trust and control are related to each other. Thus, we established the coevolutionary relationship between (different forms of) trust and (different forms of) control. We speak of interferential coevolution when trust and control are substitutes, that is, when the development of the one goes at the expense of the other. We speak of symbiotic coevolution when trust and control are complements, that is, when the development of the one has a positive effect on the development of the other.</p>

<title>Case Study 1: Urban Renewal in the City of Breda</title>
<sec id="section11-0095399711413876">
<title>Introducing the Case</title>
<p>In 2000, the municipality of Breda started a project called “Lusten en Lasten” (Likes and Dislikes) in the Northeastern district of the city. The project was focused on urban renewal, improving safety, liveability, and the local economy. An important aspect of this project was that citizens were made responsible for improving the liveability of their own surroundings. The municipality started this project and introduced the citizen-involvement approach to improve the relationship with their citizens. The relationship between the municipal organization and its citizens had deteriorated over the last 15 years. In general, the inhabitants had low trust in the capacity of the municipality to solve the persistent problems in their district. Interestingly, this project was an attempt to increase trust among citizens by giving them more control. However, at the same time, the municipality wanted to maintain certain control over the project.</p>
<p>The start of this citizen-involvement project marked a big change in the way the municipality approached urban renewal and regeneration. Civil servants were used to be in control in developing and implementing policy for urban regeneration in Breda. With the new approach, citizens got at their disposal a budget to resolve problems in their district. The municipality remained owner of the allocated budget, but citizens had freedom in the disposal of the budget. In the 1st year, inhabitants of the district came up with 220 ideas for implementation. The citizens were mobilized through general communication on the project. Everyone living in the district got the opportunity to submit a plan to improve the surroundings. These plans were all presented on a public event. Eventually, 18 plans were selected for implementation with a total budget of 315,000 euro. The projects varied from creating playing zones for children to establishing a new crossover and organizing sports activities.</p>
<p>A team of civil servants and professionals assisted in this process. This team was called the “implementation team.” It consisted of professionals from the municipal agency, societal organizations, and external advisors. This team monitored the implementation of ideas for the municipality to retain some control over the project. The team appointed several street-level bureaucrats from within the municipal organization who assisted the citizens in the implementation of the plans. These bureaucrats were most familiar with community-based approaches. This new approach meant that citizens got new roles, that of budget holder and project manager, which were not familiar to them. The street-level bureaucrats gathered information on ongoing implementation and developed low-profile control mechanisms through social contact and face-to-face communication with citizens.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0095399711413876">
<title>Describing the Trust–Control Interplay</title>
<p>The citizens received this way of working with great enthusiasm. Citizens felt they were being taken seriously and were under the impression that the municipality trusted them to develop and implement plans to improve the neighborhood.</p>
<p>Because citizens were in charge, they were able to influence the implementation of their projects. The fact that the projects led to implementation and “quick wins” contributed to maintaining enthusiasm and generating faith in the overall project. The relationship between citizens and the municipality improved through this project (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0095399711413876">Van de Wijdeven, Cornelissen, Tops, &amp; Hendriks, 2006</xref>). Citizens were satisfied with the goodwill that the municipality showed, and therefore, trust in the municipality started to emerge.</p>
<p>However, in 2001 things changed. One implementation plan went badly; its implementation failed and financing of the project almost got out of hand leading to a budget overrun (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0095399711413876">Edelenbos et al., 2005</xref>). This accident was alerted to the City Council leading to political discussion and a wish to tighten control on the implementation plans. As a consequence, supervision by contact civil servants became more tight and formalized. Contact civil servants set new rules and conditions, and increased their grip on the citizens’ implementation plans. The initial distant monitoring and supportive attitude of the civil servants changed into a desire to check and control the projects through several bureaucratic rules and conditions (formal paper work). This accident led in general to a stricter control on all implementation plans by the citizens and to a return of the reluctant attitude of some civil servants and local politicians to “handing over” city projects to citizens. They saw this accident as a possibility to regain control over municipal projects.</p>
<p>An example of this is the development of more stringent control through rules about hiring contractors to implement the projects. The local government provided suggestions for hiring specific contractors. Citizens felt that their projects were being taken over by the local government agencies. The amount of room to maneuver was restricted. The original idea of a bottom–up and demand-driven approach was now being altered toward a formalized top–down controlling approach. As a respondent from the municipality of Breda commented, “When projects run badly, the municipal civil servant is always held accountable. You cannot expect a citizen to justify oneself” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0095399711413876">Edelenbos et al, 2005</xref>, p. 20).</p>
<p>Citizens regretted this development, certainly at this point of time when the local government finally seemed to want to invest in improving the relationship with their citizens and restoring trust in government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0095399711413876">Weterings &amp; Tops, 2001</xref>). Citizens considered this move as a sign of distrust by the local government. The intervention by the municipality caused frustration and demoralization among many citizens. After this, there was a small decline in the number of plans and ideas that were submitted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0095399711413876">Edelenbos et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>In the eyes of several civil servants, working with district budgets threatened standard procedures and, more importantly, the order as controlled by the municipal bureaucracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0095399711413876">Weterings &amp; Tops, 2001</xref>). The result was that all kinds of rules and routines became dominant again and infiltrated the more informal, less bureaucratic way of implementing policy-implementation plans. Citizens interpreted this as “they—the civil servants—took over and impose their frame of reference and bureaucratic controlling ways of behavior on the implementation plans” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0095399711413876">Weterings &amp; Tops, 2001</xref>, p. 20).</p>
<p>However, the decline in enthusiasm was temporary. Over time, the balance between self-organization in the district and control from the municipal agency has been restored. Civil servants are now able to hold more control from the municipal agency. They fulfill a role as intermediaries between citizens and bureaucratic municipal organization, whereas also citizens have gained more control and responsibility via the project.</p>

<sec id="section13-0095399711413876">
<title>Specifying the Trust Control Interplays in the Case Breda</title>
<p>In this case, we witness two different interrelations between trust and control at different periods of time in the project. We see a negative cycle of trust and control (interferential coevolution) and a positive cycle of trust and control (symbiotic coevolution). We discuss them subsequently.</p>
<sec id="section14-0095399711413876">
<title>Symbiotic coevolution between trust and control</title>
<p>The case indicates that symbiotic coevolution between trust and control exists. In the initial phase of the project, there was symbiotic coevolution between trust and control. This was initiated by giving citizens a formal say in developing and maintaining their surroundings. Public managers displayed trust in citizens by providing them with the power to allocate resources. Citizens had the freedom to develop and execute plans for improving their environment. However, this does not imply that the local government withdrew completely. The municipality supervised the progress of the citizen-projects through supervision from a distance. The street-level bureaucrats intentionally remained at a distance; the idea was that citizens needed to discover things for themselves and that tight and formal control would impede citizens’ initiatives. Citizens qualified the control mechanisms by the public managers as informal. Citizens and civil servants talked the projects through in face-to-face meetings at the request of the citizens. The contact civil servants operated as “street-level bureaucrats” in the sense that they were often visible in the local areas where the projects were being implemented. This ensured that civil servants and citizens were able to find each other easily. In this way, the contact civil servants did not have to use procedures of formal control in obtaining updated information on the progress of the projects. Interaction and communication between the civil servants and the citizens flourished in this positive ambiance. Civil servants supervised the projects without making citizens feel as if they were strictly being monitored.</p>
<p>Respondents indicated that they had trust in the good intentions of the civil servants, helping them sincerely in developing and implementing local projects that would improve the surroundings of the district. Civil servants showed trust in the abilities of the citizens and helped them where necessary to implement the projects properly. Citizens were also positive about the abilities of the civil servants in really helping them to implement the projects through providing the necessary resources. However, civil servants indicated that they had very positive expectations about the good intentions of the citizens in improving their surroundings. Citizens themselves had something to gain here; it was their own surroundings that badly needed improvement. No written agreements and no formal monitoring systems were used in the relationship between citizens and civil servants. There was a situation that can be labeled as high-level trust.</p>
<p>It can be inferred from this that the specific way in which informal mechanisms of control are developed and implemented has a positive effect on building trust, especially competence and intentional based trust. Citizens have the opportunity to develop their competence in making and implementing projects with the help of civil servants and other professionals. The characteristics of control are informality, face-to-face communication, and facilitation instead of inspecting attitude; contact civil servants acted as <italic>servants for</italic> the citizens. Control is not (formal) rule based but informal and aimed at the realization of a common goal, namely, a proper implementation of the citizens’ project. This fuels trust in the competence of citizens in implementing the projects themselves.</p>

<sec id="section15-0095399711413876">
<title>Interferential coevolution between trust and control</title>
<p>This case also highlights interplay between control and trust as coexisting substitutes; it shows an interferential coevolutionary relationship between trust and control. Turning point is an accident in the implementation of one of the projects, as previously described. The high level of trust that was built in the early stages appeared to be vulnerable. A single setback was enough for the development of distrust among citizens and civil servants. Civil servants said they were held responsible for the project and installed new formal and stricter rules of control. These were in contrast to the informal and relatively loose character of control before the incident. There was less room anymore for face-to-face monitoring; more systematic and formal control was installed through formal meetings. Rules and conditions were written down on paper, and civil servants took over control of some projects in a top–down manner (without discussion). Citizens were of the opinion that this was contrary to the original idea that citizens themselves could decide on the development of their neighborhood. This change caused frustration among the citizens and was seen as a sign that the government did not trust them and their way of working. As a reaction, citizens’ level of trust in the government agency declined.</p>
<p>When taking a closer look at the characteristics of trust and control, it can be seen that in the period in which a few projects ran less successfully, the municipal agency tightened its grip through formal rules and close monitoring and supervision. Their trust in the competence of citizens had declined. Civil servants followed the projects with suspicious concern because they knew most citizens had little or no experience in making and implementing plans. Civil servants partially substituted trust for control, especially formal control.</p>
<p>However, this tight and formal way of control through new rules that were determined in a one-sided manner was not welcomed among citizens. They did not trust bureaucratic rules as a way of actually realizing solutions. Had the municipality not been formulating plans to improve the district for more than 15 years, without realizing actual improvements? Citizens distrusted the competence of the municipal agency to implement solutions in the district. They had more confidence in their own competence.</p>

<title>Case Study 2: Nature Conservation in Friesland</title>
<sec id="section17-0095399711413876">
<title>Introducing the Case</title>
<p>After a long history of conflict, the authorities of a Friesian municipality and an environmental cooperative of farmers cooperated on landscape management and conservation. The local government paid farmer members of the cooperative for implementing parts of the municipality’s Landscape Policy Plan.</p>
<p>The Landscape Policy Plan was developed in the early 1990s. The plan met with protests from farmers who feared it would threaten their farming business. As a result of the plan, the farmers had the feeling that the municipality prioritized the conservation of the landscape over agricultural production. The farmers began to distrust the intentions of the municipality with regard to agriculture.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0095399711413876">
<title>Describing the Case</title>
<p>Implementation of the plan turned out to be problematic because many farmers refused to cooperate. Sometimes, the police had to intervene to prevent farmers from illegally removing hedgerows. This raised suspicion among officials with regard to farmers’ willingness to take care of the environment. Mutual distrust had developed between municipality and farmers. However, both farmers and the local government began to realize that things had to change. The municipality realized that the policy process would not be successful without the cooperation of the farmers, and the farmers realized that not complying with the law would lead to a lot of trouble.</p>
<p>During this time period, farmers in a neighboring municipality initiated an environmental cooperative and started a subsidized landscape management project. Their success in landscape management and the fact that they were able to earn money from this project led the farmers in our municipality to become interested in doing the same thing.</p>
<p>They came to the conclusion that it would be in their interest to engage in landscape management. A couple of farmer leaders created an environmental cooperative. The cooperative sought to protect the landscape and earn money from this. The farmers approached the municipality for a subsidy. The municipality received the farmers’ initiative positively because it thought that this would increase effectiveness with regard to landscape management. During the first round of talks between the farmer members of the cooperative and the municipality, a form of intentional trust developed; they started to trust each other a little because they agreed that they had the same interest—namely, landscape management. However, the farmers had not proven their competence in this field, nor did the municipality fully trust the farmers’ intentions because there was a suspicion that the farmers only wanted the subsidy but were not really interested in carrying out landscape management properly.</p>
<p>Thus, the issue of trust was still problematic, but what helped was that the alderman at the time was a farmer himself. This led to some individual trust between the alderman and the farmer leaders and facilitated the initial contact between them. After some discussion, the municipality appeared to be willing to finance landscape maintenance by the environmental cooperative, as long as there would be proper inspection. The municipality wanted control, as they did not have enough trust in the farmers or their environmental cooperative. Also, the municipality insisted that the goals of their Landscape Policy Plan would be realized. Mutual understanding developed, which in the beginning of the process was facilitated by the alderman being a farmer himself, but the municipality did demand results of the cooperative.</p>
<p>Therefore, a formal monitoring system with specified output-control parameters was developed, and an independent inspection committee (monitoring team) was installed. This was done in close consultation between the environmental cooperative, the municipality, and a nongovernmental organization called Landscape Management Friesland (LBF). Agreement was reached among the parties about all members of the team; the monitoring team was accepted and trusted by all the parties. The parties had selected the members of the team not only on the basis of their independence but also on the basis of their expertise. They had selected people with field experience of the implementation of landscape management. The farmers accepted the inspection activities of the monitoring team, as they trusted in its competencies (expertise) and intentions (independence). Because the monitoring team was trusted by the farmers, it was able to carry out its work without being met with protest.</p>
<p>Thanks to the monitoring process, farmers were able to prove that their agricultural conservation was proper, and this built trust with the municipality. Also, during the nature conservation process, the environmental cooperative as an institutional arrangement inspired trust within the municipality. The monitoring system facilitated a coevolutionary change from a low level of intentional trust and high level of formal control, to a high trust in the competence of the farmers and the cooperative, and high trust in the intentions of the farmers and their cooperative.</p>
<p>The inspections by the monitoring team were carried out on the basis of a system agreed on by the parties involved. The system was not new but rather one that had been developed and applied in the region for years in many partnerships between the LBF and farmers.</p>
<p>The way in which the monitoring team used the control system was crucial. The monitoring team conducted inspections within the spirit of the law: Inspections were not geared toward checking to see whether landscape maintenance met the output criteria precisely but mainly to determine whether it had been carried out properly in relation to the ultimate goal of landscape maintenance. Because the monitoring team had expertise and was trusted, it need not follow the letter of the law. In this way, the level of trust among farmers increased. Because the team was strict in terms of the ultimate goals, it also enjoyed the trust of the municipality.</p>
<p>Another important aspect was that the monitoring team was less strict in the 1st year and became stricter in the following years. In this sense, a loose form of control changed into a strict form of control. This gave farmers room to improve their performance in case they did not meet the criteria in the 1st year, without facing fines immediately. The monitoring team displayed trust that the farmers who did not meet the criteria in the 1st year would meet the criteria in the 2nd year even if they were not penalized immediately.</p>
<p>The monitoring team thus displayed its good intentions. They were not out there to catch as many wrongdoers as possible; rather, they wanted to give the farmers a genuine opportunity to implement nature management in the manner that had been agreed on. This method of control led to the development of trust among the farmers. It prevented farmers from quitting when they were not able to meet the criteria in the 1st year itself. It prevented new resistance from developing on the part of the farmers, which would have impeded further implementation of the Landscape Policy Plan.</p>

<sec id="section19-0095399711413876">
<title>Specifiying the Interplays Between Trust and Control</title>
<p>In this case, there was symbiotic coevolution between control and trust; control in the shape of formal monitoring increased trust. The independence of the monitoring team generated trust in the intentions of the team, whereas expertise built trust in its competencies.</p>
<p>Control increased trust because it was carried out in a way that was agreed on by all parties and by a committee that was agreed on by all as well. The development of the control system had been conducted in a collaborative and mutually coordinated manner. The moderate level of trust that developed after agreeing to have the same interest (landscape management) made possible the collaborative way of creating and implementing a monitoring system, which then contributed to further trust. Moreover, the control instrument was seen as one that would contribute to a common goal, namely, proper landscape management.</p>

<title>Conclusion and Discussion</title>
<p>This article has shown that the relationship between trust and control is multiform and has also shown that when dissected, how different forms of control may enhance or decrease different forms of trust and vice versa. In particular, this article has shown that different coevolutionary pathways of trust and control exist.</p>
<p>The Breda case showed how initial distrust developed into more trust after the municipality had trusted its citizens and combined this with informal forms of control. A symbiotic coevolution took place between trust and control; the specific form of control (informal, based on face-to-face communication and without formal, written rules) fit well with the idea of providing citizens with more influence and this reinforced trust, specifically competence- and individual-based trust. In the interferential coevolutionary relationship, the citizens approached the formal control negatively, especially because they felt that it violated earlier agreements to provide citizens with more say. Competence-based and intentional trust were substituted for formal control through the creation and use of bureaucratic rules and monitoring systems. The case also indicates that mutually reinforcing feedback between trust and control can change into a loop of decreasing trust and formal control after a change event. Instead of seeing the interplay between trust and control as solely virtuous or vicious cycles that can go either upward or downward (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0095399711413876">Zand, 1972</xref>), the interplay between trust and control appears as a fluctuating, sometimes dynamic, or even erratic form of coevolution. This is even more so in situations where new ways of cooperation between government and society through citizen participation are explored and tried out. Here, trust is not firmly established yet, and this makes trust and control sensitive to critical events. In such situations, trust turns out to be a fragile governance mechanism.</p>
<p>The Friesian case shows how formal control can coevolve with both intentional and competence-based trust when inspectors use formal control to gain knowledge of how controllees think and work. The coevolution of formal control with trust diverges from the Breda case where formal control led to decreasing trust. How can we understand this divergence?</p>
<p>An explanation can be found in variations in the initial conditions of the two cases. In the Breda case, the parties had agreed on trusting citizens groups to initiate and implement projects. Control would be applied internally by the groups themselves in combination with informal control by contact civil servants. However, after one incident, the municipality took control, resorting to formal control. What caused distrust among citizens in this specific trajectory was that citizens thought they had an agreement on coordination, based on trust and informal control, and then this agreement was tampered with.</p>
<p>In the Friesland case, formal control coevolved symbiotically with trust because the starting condition was that the parties had agreed on this formal control. Collaboratively, parties came to the conclusion that this form of formal control would increase their chances of success. Formal and hierarchical control, implemented by an independent and trusted committee, is conducive to trust when there is mutual agreement on the way in which control is developed in parameters and the method of inspection. So, we can conclude that formal control can symbiotically coevolve with forms of trust.</p>
<p>This finding has implications for the existing thinking on the relationship between trust and control. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0095399711413876">Das and Teng (1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0095399711413876">2001</xref>) argue that formal control undermines trust, whereas social—or informal—control increases trust. Our research shows that this is true in some cases but false in others. The Breda case provides evidence for this argument, but the Friesian case counteracts it by showing that formal control can contribute to increasing trust when parties agree on formal control to realize a common goal. This research shows that the coevolution of trust and control depends on the specific (initial) situation in which the relationship between trust and control unfolds. Trust and control are related through complex and contingent causation, resulting in divergent paths of coevolution.</p>
<p>What general lessons can we draw from this study? Given the limitations of our study—we conducted research on only two cases in a single country (The Netherlands) and within one specific field (spatial planning)—we wish to be careful in generalizing our findings. However, certain patterns can be witnessed in these two case studies, which we do not want to leave undiscussed.</p>
<p>With regard to the coevolutionary relationship between trust and control in complex governance processes, one—in our view—important lesson can be drawn from the cases. Governance of complex interorganizational processes is not done by either choosing trust or control as a governance mechanism but can be implemented by developing the art of gentle combination and alternation of trust and control. Public management is the art of combining different forms of trust and control in such a manner that symbiotic coevolution between the two emerges. This is relevant to two main streams of public administration, NPM and Governance, which tend to concentrate on either control or trust. When dealing with complexity, public managers can implement a dual approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0095399711413876">Klijn et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0095399711413876">Möllering, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0095399711413876">Teisman, 2005</xref>) based on a combination of strategically and situationally chosen forms of trust and control. When decisions have to be made between an emphasis on particular forms of trust or control, the emergent combination of trust and control needs to be an integral part of their considerations. In doing so, it is important to approach trust and control in specific appearances and combinations, not as general and isolated concepts.</p>
<p>Rather than switching from trust to control, the art is to subtly switch from an emphasis on trust to an emphasis on control and vice versa, depending on what is required in the specific context and with full awareness of the fact that one is actually working on both simultaneously. Combining trust and control may be compared with skiing: When skiing one continuously uses two legs, but one changes the amount of weight placed on one or the other leg to maintain balance and keep to the right direction in a continuously changing environment.</p>
<p>It is crucial for public managers to use instruments of control not only as instruments of control but also as a means of increasing trust. Similarly, trust should just be developed not only as a value as such but also as a way to increase control on a complex project. This form of double acting implies that tools for control are better used not only just for purely increasing control but also as ways through which trustful relationships can be developed and enhanced. Tools of control become part of the management of trusting relationships. Trusting relationships become part of the management of control.</p>
