<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Total hip arthroplasty in the young and active remains a challenge for the orthopaedic community, one that has been met by the use of metal-on-metal hip resurfacing arthroplasty. The advantages of resurfacing arthroplasty relate to its improved wear characteristics, reduced dislocation rate and ability to meet the higher demands and expectations of younger patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269215513478437">1</xref></sup> However, the use of hip resurfacing remains controversial, largely owing to the high level of reported complications and lack of published long-term follow-up studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269215513478437">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269215513478437">3</xref></sup> Despite the recent adverse publicity associated with identified complications and increased awareness of the incidence of pseudo-tumour, there is strong evidence that with careful patient selection excellent results can be obtained,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269215513478437">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269215513478437">5</xref></sup> and for many surgeons, hip resurfacing remains the preferred surgical procedure for young, male patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269215513478437">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>In young active adults hip resurfacings have been shown to provide good outcomes in the early and medium term.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269215513478437">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269215513478437">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269215513478437">7</xref></sup> However, most studies that report function do not detail the postoperative protocols used<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269215513478437">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269215513478437">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269215513478437"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269215513478437"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215513478437"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269215513478437">12</xref></sup> resulting in little evidence-based guidance on the rehabilitation of these patients. Currently, there is an over reliance on using the same rehabilitation protocols for both resurfacing and traditional hip arthroplasty and these often include the use of hip precautions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269215513478437">13</xref></sup> even though the design of the resurfacing prosthesis with the large diameter femoral head allows for more innate joint stability and a significantly reduced risk of dislocation.</p>
<p>Previous work has suggested that following all types of hip arthroplasty, muscle weakness and deficits in high level functional mobility persist.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269215513478437">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215513478437"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269215513478437">16</xref></sup> For patients with resurfacing, an enhanced rehabilitation programme may be beneficial in terms of improving muscle strength, postural stability and perceived function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269215513478437">17</xref></sup> As this surgery tends to be performed in younger and more active patients with fewer comorbities a more dynamic rehabilitation regime should be possible.</p>
<p>This study aims to establish whether a postoperative rehabilitation programme, tailored for patients with hip resurfacing, is more effective than current standard practice at improving self-reported function, hip range of motion and muscle strength in the year following surgery. Second, it aims to investigate the pattern of recovery during the first postoperative year.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>This study was a randomized controlled trial with follow-up at six, 16 and 52 weeks. All patients listed for primary hip resurfacing surgery at the host institution from 2009 to 2010 were sent written information about the trial and invited to participate. The exclusion criteria were patients due for bilateral arthroplasty or minimally invasive surgery, patients in whom further lower limb joint surgery was planned within 12 months and patients unable to provide informed consent. Informed consent was sought from interested patients who met the eligibility criteria. The study was approved by a local research ethics committee (LREC Reference 06/Q1605/110).</p>
<p>The intervention was developed following the Medical Research Council’s framework for the development and evaluation of randomized controlled trials for complex interventions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269215513478437">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269215513478437">19</xref></sup> Following a review of the available evidence, a consensus meeting of the Arthroplasty Care Practitioners Association was held in 2008 to compare existing protocols and two focus groups agreed the important components of postoperative rehabilitation following resurfacing.</p>
<p>While in hospital, all patients had treatment twice daily and were discharged once they were mobilising safely and independently. Patients in the intervention group followed an enhanced recovery protocol up to week 8, with no hip precautions and full weight bearing from day one. Gait re-education continued throughout the intervention, including decreasing the use of aids, increasing distance, progressing from walking indoors to outdoors, practicing sideways and backwards stepping and changes of direction and speed. Exercises focused on improving the active range of hip movement and lower limb strength. Activities, such as sit-to-stand, balance retraining through single-leg stance and weight bearing exercises to correct abnormal movement patterns, improve pelvic stability and strengthen hip abductors, were included in the programme.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269215513478437">20</xref></sup> Two weeks postoperatively, the intervention group received one additional physiotherapy session either at home or as an outpatient. All patients were given a booklet containing guidelines for return to work, sport and leisure activities, and details of the home exercises with specific guidelines for individual exercise progression, including new exercises every 2 weeks, spread over an 8-week period.</p>
<p>Physiotherapy for the control group followed routine hospital care for total hip arthroplasty using the integrated care pathway, the use of hip precautions and no additional input. The exercises were partial weight bearing to regain range of motion and included isometric strengthening exercises. All patients were given a booklet, designed via multidisciplinary consensus, to standardise the postoperative exercises and advice. The information in these booklets follows the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons guidelines.</p>

<p>Allocation was concealed from the two research physiotherapists, who were therefore blinded to group allocation. They collected baseline data the day before surgery and again at six, 16 and 52 weeks, with 52 weeks being the primary end-point. They followed a detailed, standardised measurement protocol to promote reliability. Operations were all performed by consultant-grade orthopaedic surgeons. Immediately postoperatively patients were randomized to the intervention or control group if operation records confirmed resurfacing. The randomization sequence was generated by computer; using blocks of 20. The sequence was concealed in opaque, numbered envelopes; an administrator opened the envelopes sequentially and informed the clinical physiotherapist of group allocation. The clinical physiotherapists were trained regarding blinding and concealment and worked independently to the research team.</p>
<p>The primary outcome measure was the Oxford Hip Score (OHS).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269215513478437">21</xref></sup> Patients also completed other self-report outcome measures of function and quality of life, the Hip disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269215513478437">22</xref></sup> the UCLA activity score<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269215513478437">23</xref></sup> and the EuroQol (EQ-5D-3L).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269215513478437">24</xref></sup> Further details of these are in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0269215513478437">Table 2</xref>. Examination recorded Charnley Score and the presence or absence of a Trendlenberg sign. Hip flexion, abduction and extension range of motion were measured using a long arm goniometer. We conducted a pilot study of the reliability of our measures using two physiotherapists and 24 patients. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for the inter-rater reliability for hip range of motion was 0.98 for hip flexion, 0.97 for hip abduction and 0.96 for hip extension. Hip muscle strength for flexion, abduction and extension was measured using a hand-held dynamometer (Lafayette Instruments, Lafayette, IN 47903, USA). Good inter-rater reliability was attained using the mean of three repeated measures. For hip flexors the ICC was 0.88, for hip abductors 0.93 and for hip extensors 0.90.</p>

<p>A patient selected goal for treatment outcome was recorded and complications following surgery were monitored using a prespecified checklist and review of medical notes. We used patient report diaries to record the total amount of home physiotherapy and exercise undertaken by each group after discharge. This monitored intervention integrity and compliance, recording both treatments given and exercises undertaken. We considered patients to be compliant if they completed at least 75% of the set exercises as listed in Appendix 1 in terms of combined frequency and duration.</p>
<sec id="section11-0269215513478437">
<title>Sample size</title>
<p>The OHS was used to calculate the study sample size. The values for variance were based upon the OHS scores from patients in a pilot study. A change of four points on the OHS indicates a meaningful clinical difference (δ), pooled variance (s) = 5.1, significance level = 0.05 with a power of 90%. With a standardised difference (φ) = 0.78 and using Altman’s nomogram,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269215513478437">25</xref></sup> the minimum number needed to detect a difference between groups was 33 per group.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0269215513478437">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>The baseline characteristics and measures for each group were described and compared using the two tail <italic>t</italic>-test for normally distributed variables, the Mann Whitney test for non-normal data and the chi-square test for categorical data. For those participants with missing measures at baseline (<italic>n</italic> = 0 for OHS, <italic>n</italic> = 2 for other measures), their next available recorded measure was substituted as part of the intention to treat analysis. For those with missing measures at 52 weeks (<italic>n</italic> = 2 for OHS, <italic>n</italic> = 5 for other measures), their last available recorded measure was used.</p>
<p>Linear regression was used to determine the association between the OHS at 52 weeks and group. The model was adjusted by the corresponding baseline measure to account for the potential bias in determining significant predictors caused by the small sample size (<italic>n</italic> = 40). The multivariable model was restricted to two variables to avoid over fitting. This model is synonymous to an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model, and provides additional information on the associations through beta coefficients. Similar regression analyses were performed using the HOOS, UCLA, EQ-5D, hip range of motion and muscle strength at 52 weeks.</p>
<p>Finally, data at six and 16 weeks was incorporated to form a repeated measures (marginal) model, to show when any improvements occurred. The marginal means were derived by taking the numerical derivative of the mean expected outcome with respect to time. That is, averaging the effect of changes in outcome over time. The effect size for the difference between the changes in the two groups was calculated using Cohen’s d: (mean control – mean intervention)/pooled standard deviation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269215513478437">26</xref></sup> Linear regression diagnostics, repeated measures diagnostics and interactions in time were satisfied. All statistical analyses were performed using Stata SE v12.0 (StatCorp, College Station, TX, USA).</p>

<p>At 52 weeks follow-up there was a clear difference between the two groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0269215513478437">Table 4</xref>). The mean (SD) OHS of the intervention group was higher at 45.1 (5.3) than the control group 39.6 (8.8). This result was supported by a linear regression model, adjusted by baseline OHS, which detected a 5.8 unit change in OHS at 52 weeks (<italic>p</italic> = 0.001). Similarly there was a statistically significant increase in total HOOS scores of 12.4% at 52 weeks (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0005) when comparing the groups. The UCLA activity score showed a 1-point change between the groups at 52 weeks (<italic>p</italic> = 0.373). The EQ-5D summary index increased by 0.17 (<italic>p</italic> = 0.031) at 52 weeks. Interaction with time revealed marginal means at one year of 0.85 for the intervention group (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). Hip flexion with a mean increase of 17.9 degrees, (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0005) and hip extension mean increase of 5.7 degrees (<italic>p</italic> = 0.004) also showed a marked improvement between the intervention and the control group. Large effect sizes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269215513478437">27</xref></sup> were found for the OHS, HOOS, EQ-5D and range of hip flexion and moderate effect sizes for range of extension and abduction (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0269215513478437">Table 4</xref>). While there was an actual improvement in muscle strength between the intervention group and control group, these changes were not sufficient to meet statistical or clinical significance, with effect sizes being small at &lt; 0.2.</p>

<p>At the outset of the trial, participants were asked to set a goal that they hoped to achieve. Examples included skiing, kneeling, playing with grandchildren and travelling on holiday without pain. At 52 weeks in the intervention group 32/40 (80%) had fully met their goal compared with 22 (55%) in the control group; 7 (17.5%) in the intervention group and 6 (15%) in the control, had partly met their goal; 2 (5%) participants in the intervention group failed to meet their goal and 8 (20%) in the control.</p>
<p>There were eight reported adverse events (complications), spread between the groups. There were two cases of femoral neck fracture (intervention group); three cases of metal reaction or confirmed pseudotumour (two in the intervention group, one in the control), two cases of heterotrophic ossification (control group) and one case of unexplained pain (control group). The complications were not assessed as being related to the treatment allocation. The overall level of complications was within reported expected levels of 1.9% for fracture,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269215513478437">27</xref></sup> 29% for heterotrophic ossification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269215513478437">28</xref></sup> and 2% for pseudotumour.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269215513478437">29</xref></sup> Records, from patient exercise diaries of compliance, showed the compliance for both groups was above 75% in all cases.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study has confirmed that a tailored rehabilitation programme following Metal On Metal Hip Resurfacing Arthroplasty (MOMHRA) improves self-reported functional outcomes and quality of life compared with a traditional rehabilitation programme. The improvement in all outcome measures was larger than we expected. The improvement in OHS in the intervention group was nearly 50% larger than the control group, with the difference most marked at one year. Following Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA) differences in function at one year tend to persist in the long term.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269215513478437">30</xref></sup> Therefore, this study’s relatively small intervention is likely to result in a persisting improvement and so be highly cost effective.</p>
<p>We previously found that a significant proportion of patients with MOMHRA continue to experience some functional difficulties up to one year after surgery. In that study we reported poor recovery of hip abduction and flexion range of motion (ROM) at one year, with a mean value for hip flexion of 94.5°, some way below the age-related norms of 120 SD 14°.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269215513478437">31</xref></sup> In this study we sought to devise an intervention to address these issues. We aimed to vary the rehabilitation content rather than changing the intensity (frequency of rehabilitation sessions) or duration (length of time programme continued for); so any new protocol, if proven to be effective, would be deliverable within standard UK NHS resources, or within insurance reimbursement limits.</p>
<p>This study showed that early improvement of hip motion is safe and practical. In the intervention group with no hip precautions and specific hip flexion exercises flexion rose to 110°. Our results exceed those of earlier MOMHRA series<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269215513478437">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0269215513478437">33</xref></sup> and equalled those reported by dela Rosa et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0269215513478437">34</xref></sup> who reported a range of 110° flexion at one year. This increase in hip ROM was associated with a clear increase in those functional outcomes that rely upon good hip mobility, specifically the highly statistically significant improvements in the HOOS subscales for stiffness, function of daily activities and function in sport and quality of life.</p>
<p>The control group reported mean flexion of 93° at one year, which is similar to our previous report. It is particularly notable that our series only included males, as women are reported to have a greater range than men<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0269215513478437">35</xref></sup> and a comparatively better range after THA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0269215513478437">34</xref></sup> Restricted ROM may reflect a rehabilitation strategy that has over emphasised the importance of hip precautions and the risks of dislocation, without tailoring the advice to the different risks associated with hip resurfacing.</p>
<p>A return to an active lifestyle, with the resumption of professional and recreational activities, is one of the most important reasons why patients undergo hip arthroplasty. At one year on the UCLA activity scale, a third (13 of 39) of participants in the control group rated themselves as active (median score of 7) whereas over a third in the intervention group rated themselves as ‘very active’ (median score eight), indicating they regularly participated in activities such as bowling or golf. This one point difference represents a 10% change in activity. A significant number of patients (five in the control group and 10 in the intervention group) reported higher UCLA scores with the ability to participate in high impact sports, such as running, football, skiing and cricket. This compares very favourably with other reported series, such as Killampalli et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269215513478437">12</xref></sup> with mean UCLA scores of 6.7, Fisher et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0269215513478437">36</xref></sup> median UCLA of 6.8 and Hall et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215513478437">11</xref></sup> who reported a mean UCLA of 8.</p>
<p>At the outset we had sought to improve both range of motion and muscle strength. While there was a small improvement in muscle strength between the intervention and control groups, this was not statistically significant. Hip-abductor strength is important to postural stability, balance and normal gait, e.g. preventing excess hip abduction in mid-stance and a Trendelenberg gait pattern. A positive Trendelenberg sign was found in only 18 patients preoperatively in single leg standing (10 in the intervention, eight in the control group), but gait patterns were not assessed. At one year all patients were able to stand on one leg with normal alignment of the pelvis, indicating that the strength of the hip musculature had improved. It is possible that, had our rehabilitation protocol placed still greater emphasis on hip strengthening, further improvements could have been attained. Alternatively, our outcome assessments may not have been sufficiently sensitive to detect small improvements at a higher functional level. These may have been better investigated using more robust measures, such as isokinetic dynamometry and in-depth gait analysis. We based our sample size calculation for the trial on self-reported function, this may have resulted in the trial being underpowered to detect a difference in muscle strength.</p>
<p>The intervention group demonstrated a significant improvement, not just in the physical impairment and activity limitation domains of function, but also at participation level, and 80% of the intervention group achieved the self-selected goal that they had set at the start of their treatment. These goals were all set at the level of participation and clearly demonstrate that the intervention was successful at achieving a higher level of rehabilitation. As Davis et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0269215513478437">37</xref></sup> report, participation restriction has frequently been overlooked in reports of rehabilitation outcome, which tend to focus on physical impairment and activity limitation. However, while these three constructs are related, without rehabilitation that addresses outcomes of social and community participation, programmes will not achieve the goals of patients who are concerned about the return to higher demand activities and participation in social roles and leisure pursuits.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0269215513478437">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>There are certain limitations to the study. It only included male patients. At the outset we did not intend to exclude females, but early in the recruitment phase of the study there were increasing reports about complications following MOMHRA in women and in April 2010 the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) issued an alert concerning the use of MOMHRA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0269215513478437">39</xref></sup> In our institution this led to a marked tightening of the selection criteria for patients receiving MOMHRA and the cessation of its use in women.</p>
<p>We based the new protocol upon expert consensus opinion from focus groups, as well as published UK protocols. The intensity and duration of the intervention was much less than that advocated in the North American literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0269215513478437">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0269215513478437">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0269215513478437"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0269215513478437">42</xref></sup> However, our results for functional outcomes are equivalent to those attained using these far more intensive programmes and are affordable within a public-funded healthcare setting.</p>
<p>Overall, the cohort, irrespective of treatment allocation, obtained a good level of functional outcome one year after their surgery. However, a relatively small change to the rehabilitation strategy that focussed on rehabilitation tailored to the differing biomechanics of the resurfacing prosthesis and differing demands and expectations of the hip resurfacing patient population, conferred significant additional benefit. This prospective, single-blind randomized controlled trial has shown the benefits of a tailored rehabilitation programme in achieving superior functional outcomes in patients undergoing hip resurfacing.</p>
