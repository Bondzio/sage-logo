<p><italic>In the final part of the three part series on expert witnesses, Medical Protection Society</italic> Solicitor, <italic>Louise Morgan, discusses the practicalities of working as an expert</italic>.</p>
<sec id="section1-2051415813491668" sec-type="intro">
<title>Introduction</title>
<p>When acting as an expert witness your role is to provide the Court with impartial, unbiased, expert opinion in relation to the medical issues in the case.</p>
<p>Your duty is to the Court and not to the party instructing you, whether you are an expert giving evidence in Civil, GMC or Coroner’s proceedings. Whilst less than 2% of the negligence claims MPS handles proceed to trial you should approach a case on the basis that you could end up in the witness box.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-2051415813491668">
<title>Before Accepting Instructions</title>
<p>Before accepting instructions consider whether there are any reasons why you should not accept those instructions:</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-2051415813491668">
<title>Conflicts of Interest</title>
<p>Have you been professionally or personally involved with the claimant, doctor or any other party in the proceedings?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-2051415813491668">
<title>Area of Expertise</title>
<p>If you are asked to comment on a surgical technique or other treatment, which you do not routinely perform, can you realistically claim to be an expert? The GMC stipulate that you must recognise and work within your area of competence and no different standard should apply to your medico-legal work.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-2051415813491668">
<title>Skeletons in the Closet?</title>
<p>Is there any reason why you should not act in the case? Are you subject to any civil claim, complaint or GMC investigation, which if it came to light would cast doubt on your credibility as an expert, or otherwise be professionally embarrassing? Remember that the job of the opposing barrister at trial will be to undermine your credibility by cross-examination and so do not give them any ammunition.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-2051415813491668">
<title>Commitment to the Case</title>
<p>You will be required to provide advice and assistance in many different ways throughout the duration of the case, including:-</p>
<list id="list1-2051415813491668" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Providing and amending / updating reports</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Attending conferences with Counsel.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Attending meetings/telephone discussions with your opponent expert and then producing a joint statement.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>In an attempt to control the ever increasing costs of litigation the Civil Procedure Rules have recently changed. The Courts will now be proactive in their management of costs and the litigation timetable. They will be far less tolerant of delay than previously and timetables will be strictly enforced. This means that:-</p>
<list id="list2-2051415813491668" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>You will have to provide a detailed estimate of fees at the outset of each case</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>You will have to comply with the agreed timetable for the preparation of your report and make yourself readily available for conferences and expert meetings.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The case may, on occasions, have to take precedence over your clinical commitments.</p></list-item>
</list>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-2051415813491668">
<title>Your Duties</title>
<p>You have an overriding duty to assist the Court on matters within your expertise. You must be familiar with Part 35 of the Civil Procedure Rules and remember that the Court will expect your evidence to be responsible, reasonable, respectable and capable of withstanding logical analysis.</p>
<p>In addition to your professional duties, you will also have a contractual duty to your instructing solicitor, to co-operate and in particular deliver on time.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-2051415813491668">
<title>The Expert Report</title>
<p>Make sure that any report you prepare:</p>
<list id="list3-2051415813491668" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Provides expert opinion only in relation to matters within your field of expertise. Do not comment on a doctor’s breach of duty if that doctor does not practise in your discipline.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Provides an analytical, objective, balanced and accurate opinion. Do not “<italic>sit on the fence”.</italic> You must give an opinion based on the balance of probabilities i.e. a chance of 51% or more. Therefore, you should avoid using words like “<italic>might” “possible”</italic> or “<italic>may”.</italic></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Complies with Part 35 of the Civil Procedure Rules.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Complies with your instructions. You must answer the questions put to you.</p></list-item>
</list>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-2051415813491668">
<title>Your Obligations</title>
<p>Throughout the case your obligations will include:-</p>
<sec id="section10-2051415813491668">
<title>Conferences with Counsel</title>
<p>You may be asked by your instructing solicitors to attend a conference with a barrister and their client. The purpose of the conference will be to test the factual and expert evidence and to identify any areas of vulnerability or concern. Your obligation is to continue to provide objective, unbiased expert opinion in relation to any points raised.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-2051415813491668">
<title>Expert Meetings</title>
<p>Once your report has been exchanged, you will be required to meet with your opposing expert according to an agreed agenda. The purpose of the meeting is to discuss the issues in dispute in an open and frank way and if possible to reach areas of agreement. You will then have to prepare and agree a joint statement setting out the areas of agreement and disagreement. Make sure you read and check it for accuracy before signing.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-2051415813491668">
<title>Giving Evidence at Court</title>
<p>Ultimately, you may be required to give evidence at Trial. You will be cross-examined by the other side’s barrister. He or she will focus on any areas of inconsistency in your evidence, with a view to undermining your credibility.</p>
<p>You will then be re-examined by your own party’s barrister who will attempt to redress any points of concern raised in cross-examination.</p>
<p>Throughout both processes you should remain alive to the fact that your overriding objective is to assist the Court in understanding the medical issues in dispute.</p>
<list id="list4-2051415813491668" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>When giving evidence make sure you maintain an air of calm professionalism, particularly under cross examination and you should aim to give reasoned and considered answers to the questions posed.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>It is helpful to address your evidence to the judge and to speak at a pace which matches the judge’s note taking.</p></list-item>
</list>

<sec id="section13-2051415813491668">
<title>Being sued as an expert</title>
<p>Previously, experts had been largely immune from suit, but the law was changed by the case of <bold><italic>Jones -v- Kaney</italic></bold> [2011] UKSC 13.This was a personal injury claim in which the expert witness for the Claimant signed a joint expert statement, which conceded many points contrary to her original evidence. As a result, the Claimant had to settle his claim at a significant discount. He brought a claim against the expert who entered a defence of immunity. The Supreme Court decided that the joint statement had been prepared negligently and there was no compelling reason why the expert should benefit from immunity. Therefore, if you do not comply with your obligations as an expert you could end up on the wrong side of a Court case.</p>

<title>How to avoid criticism</title>
<list id="list5-2051415813491668" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Remember that you must give an independent opinion and that your primary duty is to the Court.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Provide expert opinion only on matters within your professional expertise</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Ensure that your expert opinion is objective and unbiased and supported with reference to up to date medical practice, law, guidance, regulations and literature.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Ensure that you follow your instructions carefully and deal with all the questions put to you.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Ensure that you comply with the agreed timetable for producing your report and any other time limits or procedural obligations.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>If your opinion changes at any time, notify your instructing party as soon as possible and explain your reasons.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Ensure that you understand and comply with your obligations as an expert witness as set out in the Civil Procedure Rules Part 35, the Civil Justice Council Protocol for the Instruction of Experts and the GMC’s guidance.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Prepare carefully for expert joint discussions and take care over drafting joint statements. They can make or break a case.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Ensure that you do not have a conflict of interest.</p></list-item>

<sec id="section15-2051415813491668" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>A great deal hangs on an expert’s opinion, whether it be money in the Civil Courts or a doctor’s reputation and career at the GMC. Therefore, the role of an expert is a very important one, which requires commitment and dedication. As Sir Nicholas Wall comments in his Judgment in the case of <bold><italic>X, Y and Brain Morgan –and- A Local Authority</italic> [2011] EWHC 1157</bold> regarding anonymity in Court cases, <italic>“…where work is properly done and the methodology is professionally sound…”</italic> Experts <italic>“…have nothing to fear from the courts…”</italic></p>
