<abstract>
<p>This paper investigated the effects of an air cleaner and ventilation strategies on the removal of VOCs in an office in association with the influence of moisture on the air cleaner performance. Here, a transient three dimensional air flow field and concentration distribution of VOCs emitted from a desk were considered. Commercial software FLUENT 6 was utilised to solve the continuity and momentum equations together with the low Reynolds number <italic>k</italic>-ε turbulence model. Numerical results showed that both the moisture and ventilation strategies have notable impacts on the VOCs concentration distribution. Cases under stronger ventilation take less time for the VOCs concentration to reach the steady state. But, in the cases with the function of the air cleaner, VOCs could be removed more considerably. The combination of the use of the air cleaner and enhanced ventilation strategies could yield more desirable indoor air quality within a relatively short time. The results showed that moisture can have a slight effect on the performance of the air cleaner, but lower moisture would be helpful to the effectiveness of the air cleaner. Thus, based on this work, suitable concentrations of indoor moisture, together with appropriate ventilation strategies have been recommended for control of indoor air quality.</p></abstract>

<sec id="sec1-1420326X11419928" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>As reported, nowadays, average people may spend more than 90% of their time indoors. Increasingly, indoor air quality is becoming an important issue for architects and building managers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1420326X11419928">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1420326X11419928">3</xref>] as this would pose a significant impact on human health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1420326X11419928">4</xref>]. Considerable attention has been directed towards the emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in indoor environments, which have been regarded as an important source of indoor air pollutants. VOCs can be released from multiple indoor sources (e.g. paints, varnishes, floorcoverings, disinfectants, new furnishings, plywood and other wood-based products) and have a potential to affect human health and comfort. VOCs may contribute to sick building syndrome and other effects such as allergic sensitisation or asthmatic syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1420326X11419928">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1420326X11419928">6</xref>]. Thus, it is of great importance to reduce VOCs emissions for the sake of good indoor air quality. Usually the best ways to control VOCs indoors are to reduce or eliminate the sources of pollutants, and to apply ventilation to the house. However, some VOCs are essential parts of the formulations of some building (e.g. coatings and adhesives) and consumers’ products (e.g. airfreshners and polishes) and some emissions to indoor air cannot be avoided during application in buildings. On the other hand, the effect of the ventilation could be limited by outdoor weather conditions or levels of contaminants contained in the outdoor ambient air [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1420326X11419928">7</xref>]. Moreover, enhanced ventilation would be undesirable due to energy consumption. Recently, there have been much focus on the use of air cleaners and the objective of this study was to investigate the effect of moisture on the performance of an air-cleaner in an office environment and to determine the optimum ventilation needed to provide an effective indoor air quality (IAQ) control strategy for buildings.</p>
<p>The impacts of air velocity, temperature and humidity on long-term VOCs emissions from building products have been reported by Wolkoff [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1420326X11419928">8</xref>]. Ten cases under different environment conditions were performed; two sample specimens from two different batches were compared to examine the repeatability and homogeneity. The experimental data could be the important information for standardisation of the emission testing. Experiments about the effect of the ventilation on controlling concentrations of indoor VOCs have also been reported by many researchers. Hodgson et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1420326X11419928">9</xref>] studied the relationship between air ventilation rate and concentrations of VOCs emitted indoors in a call centre office building, which described that the efficacy of ventilation for controlling VOCs concentrations, which could vary considerably due to the operation of the building, the pollutant sources and the physical and chemical processes affecting the pollutants. Hence, source control methods, in addition to adequate ventilations, would be needed to limit concentration of VOCs inside buildings. Recently, the installation of air cleaners is considered to be one of the most feasible ways to enhance indoor air quality. Owing to the merits of the effective conversion of VOCs and the safety, photocatalytic oxidation (PCO) air cleaners have gained increasing attention among multiple types of air cleaners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1420326X11419928">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1420326X11419928">12</xref>]. Obee and Brown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1420326X11419928">13</xref>] investigated the influence of humidity and trace contaminant levels on the oxidation rate of VOCs. Experimental data showed that the effect of humidity on the oxidation rate was critically dependent on the VOCs concentration. The experimental data have been successfully corrected by the Langmuir–Hinshelwood rate form. The dependencies of the oxidation rates on humidity and contamination concentrations were explained as being a result of competitive adsorption on available hydroxyl adsorption sites and of changes in hydroxyl radical population levels. Wang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1420326X11419928">14</xref>] conducted an experiment to examine the kinetics of PCO of trichloroethylene (TCE) in gas phase over TiO<sub>2</sub>-coated glass beads. The effects of flow rate, moisture, initial concentration of VOCs and light intensity were discussed. The experimental results provided a good coincidence with the predictions of the Langmuir–Hinshelwood model.</p>
<p>Though experiments of VOCs could give reliable data, it is costly and time-consuming for testing long-term VOCs emissions. Because of these disadvantages, the utilisation of mathematical model has been appreciated by many researchers to predict VOCs emissions. Nowadays, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) technique is commonly found in ventilation studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1420326X11419928">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1420326X11419928">16</xref>] and it also has been widely adopted to simulate VOCs emissions from building materials. CFD models can offer much detailed information about VOCs emissions and their corresponding control measures. Yang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1420326X11419928">17</xref>] built a numerical model of VOCs emissions from dry materials, which showed a fairly good agreement with experimental data. Also there are studies about the usage of the ventilation for reducing VOCs emission. Deng and Kim [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1420326X11419928">18</xref>] presented a CFD simulation of VOCs concentrations in a residential building fitted with a new carpet under several different ventilation strategies, which showed that ventilation strategies could have a small effect upon VOCs emission from the carpet, and the ventilation of living space of a building should run before the arrival of residents in order to reduce the VOCs concentrations at a low level by air flushing. There have been researches reported in literatures illustrating the use of CFD for modelling to investigate air cleaner performance, especially PCO air cleaners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1420326X11419928">19</xref>]. Hossain et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1420326X11419928">20</xref>] presented a three-dimensional CFD model for analysing the operating performance of photocatalytic air cleaners. Model predictions coincided with experimental measurements under a range of inlet formaldehyde concentrations, humidity levels, various lengths and configurations of monolith. Zhang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1420326X11419928">21</xref>] presented a model that analysed the removal of VOCs by a PCO reactor, which showed a good agreement with existing experimental data.</p>
<p>This paper reports the use of CFD models for assessing the performance of an air cleaner working in an actual office under different environmental conditions, which could provide information for optimising strategies to ensure better indoor air quality for commercial buildings.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-1420326X11419928"><title>Experimental</title>
<p>The objective of this study was to numerically investigate the efficacy of a PCO air cleaner for removal of VOCs emitted from a desk placed in a modelled room. Different ventilation strategies were also operated in tandem with the cleaner in the office. The CFD simulations were carried out based on unsteady cases. Various situations with different ventilation strategies, operating with and without the function of the air cleaner were studied in detail. The influence of moisture on the performance of the air cleaner was also investigated. In this study, the top surface of the desk was considered to be the only VOCs source, and the adsorption of VOCs on other building materials in the office was neglected. The air pollutants VOCs were assumed and treated as only one species. The concentration in the breathing zone (1.3m from the floor) of a person sitting behind a desk, working in the office was the subject of concern in this study.</p></sec>

<sec id="sec4-1420326X11419928"><title>Geometry of the Studied Model</title>
<p>The modelled office is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1420326X11419928">Figure 1</xref>. The room has a dimension of 6×3.5×3m<sup>3</sup>. The office room has two air inlets and two outlets, respectively; these are of the same size of 0.2×0.2m<sup>2</sup>, which are all located in the ceiling. The outdoor air comes into the office through the inlet, and then goes out of the office through the outlet.
<fig id="fig1-1420326X11419928" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>The geometry of office model.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1420326X11419928-fig1.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The air cleaner of 0.2×0.2×0.5m<sup>3</sup> in size, was located at a height of 1.35m from the floor and above the centre of the desk (1.5×0.6m<sup>2</sup>, top surface). It is a simplified model of a PCO air cleaner consisting of a UV light, reaction surfaces and other parts. The inner walls of the air cleaner are coated with a catalyst, which provides the oxidation sites for degradation of VOCs. The contaminated air goes into the air cleaner via the bottom surface and comes out through the top surface. A humidifier for adjusting indoor moisture was placed at the left hand corner of the office room. Moisture was considered to be released from the top surface of the 0.5×0.5m<sup>2</sup> humidifier. VOCs were supposed to be emitted from the top surface of the desk, which was assumed to be the only source of VOCs in the room. The emissions of VOCs from other building materials such as the wall surfaces were not considered in this study.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec5-1420326X11419928"><title>Governing Equations</title>
<p>Indoor air flow plays an important role in the transportation of VOCs, which has a strong impact on the VOCs distribution. The continuity equation and three dimensional Navies-Stokes equations for turbulent flow have been used to describe the air flow.

<sec id="sec7-1420326X11419928"><title>Numerical Procedure</title>
<p>The finite-volume method was used to solve the three-dimensional governing equations. The software GAMBIT was employed to generate grids for the office model. The three-dimensional office model was divided into around 80,000 wedge grids. Furthermore, finer grids were applied near the surfaces of the air cleaner, the top surfaces of the desk and the humidifier. Commercial software Fluent 6 was utilised to solve the governing equations. The second-order upwind scheme was used to discretise the convective terms and the central difference scheme for the diffusion terms. Velocity–pressure coupling was implemented by the SIMPLEC algorithm.</p></sec></sec>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1420326X11419928">Figure 2</xref> shows a comparison of the changes in concentrations of VOCs within the breathing zone of an office worker, with time for Cases 1, 3, 5 and 7. In Cases 3, 5 and 7 the air cleaner was not used and the VOCs emitted were removed to the outside by ventilation. As for the Case 1, no ventilation was applied, and the decline in VOCs concentration was due mainly to the removal of the air cleaner. The application of ventilation with an increase in air change rate had an effect of reducing the VOCs concentration at a much faster rate to reach a steady state in a shorter period. The use of air cleaner had an effect of reducing the VOC concentration efficiently and smoothly as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1420326X11419928">Figure 2</xref> and the steady-state concentration was reduced to a much lower level in comparison to the other cases with a higher air change rate. However, the use of a higher air change rate as in Case 7 produced a more effective reduction of steady-state VOC concentration, thus illustrating that the use of enhanced ventilation could improve indoor air quality. The air cleaner was a more efficient means of reducing the indoor concentrations of VOCs.

<p>The average concentration of VOCs in the breathing zone with time for Cases 2 and 3 are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1420326X11419928">Figure 3</xref>. The application of the air cleaner in association with a ventilation rate of 1 ACH in the Case 2 brought about a better indoor air quality in contrast with the situation of Case 3, illustrating that the use of an air cleaner would complement the ventilation to achieve a big difference in the removal of VOCs in indoor environment. In Case 2, VOCs concentration decreases very quickly in the early stage and before reaching a steady state, which means that most of the VOCs would be removed during the earlier time. As for Case 3 without the use of an air cleaner, VOCs concentration first increased a little bit in association with the transient motion of air during the earlier stage and with the start of VOCs emission from the top surface of the desk, the concentration dropped only gradually with a slight decline. This means that because of the weak ventilation, VOCs were not sufficiently removed by the ventilation whilst the VOCs were still being emitted from the table all the time. So the changes in VOCs concentration in Case 3 was very slow, and would need a longer period to reach the steady state and with a higher VOCs concentration.

<p>The comparison between Cases 4 and 5 as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1420326X11419928">Figure 4</xref> was similar to that of Cases 2 and 3. But the difference in VOCs concentrations between these two cases was smaller than that between Cases 2 and 3 due to the higher ventilation rate used in Cases 4 and 5. The similarity is also illustrated in the comparison of the concentrations in Cases 6 and 7 shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1420326X11419928">Figure 5</xref>. In Cases 6 and 7 a stronger ventilation strategy was applied. The difference in concentrations between cases 6 and 7 was the smallest among the three pairs of cases. The higher ventilation used in cases 6 and 7 was shown to be effective in the removal of VOCs. The three pairs of cases showed illustrated the complementary potential effect of combining ventilation with the use of an air cleaner which would provide an excellent efficiency for VOCs removal.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1420326X11419928">Figure 6</xref> shows the changes in concentrations of VOCs with time within the breathing zone for four cases. These Cases were all with the use of an air cleaner. The steady-state VOCs concentrations in these four cases do not differ much from each other. In the Case 1 with no ventilation, the final VOCs concentration was a little higher than that of other three cases. Because of no ventilation (Case 1), the VOCs concentration would take longer to decline to reach a steady state than the others, and in Case 6, the steady-state concentration was reached at a shortest time due to the strongest ventilation of 4 ACH. The results have demonstrated the advantage of using the air cleaner in association with ventilation which complement each other in delivering the most effective and efficient means of removal of VOCs.

<p>In Cases 8 and 9 no ventilation was applied but in Case 8 a different humidity flux from the humidifier was applied and higher humidity flux would bring higher humidity concentration. Moisture is an essential factor for human health and comfort. According to ASHRAE Standard (1992), the United States Environmental Protection Agency recommends keeping relative humidity between 30% and 60% or around 5.00E06 to 1.00E07µgċm<sup>−3</sup> in the present condition. Moisture is also an important parameter for the oxidation of VOCs in Langmuir–Hinshelwood model equation mentioned above. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1420326X11419928">Figure 7</xref> shows the changes in concentrations of VOCs within the breathing zone of an office worker, with time for these two cases, illustrating that the effect of moisture on the performance of the air cleaner was small. Though the difference between the two cases was very slight, the lower humidity flux yielded a better performance from the air cleaner.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1420326X11419928">Figure 8</xref> illustrates the distributions of the concentrations of VOCs within the breathing zone at different times for Case 4. At the beginning, the concentrations of VOCs within the breathing zone was very high, almost equal to the initial concentrations of VOCs. Because the air from the inlet flushes into the office, the VOCs concentrations of the left part of the breathing zone would be lower than that of the right part. At time of 1200s, the VOCs concentration dropped to a small value and at time of 2400s, VOCs concentration was almost reduced to the minimum level. At each time, the highest concentration of VOCs was centralised above the desk, showing that the top surface of the desk was the only VOCs source.

<sec id="sec9-1420326X11419928" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In this paper, the efficacy of an air cleaner working in complement with different setting of ventilation air change rate was examined by numerical simulation. The effect of moisture was also included in the consideration. Commercial software FLUENT has been employed to solve the continuity, momentum and species equations. Nine cases of different measures were reviewed. The numerical results showed that when a higher ventilation rate was applied, the time needed for the concentrations of VOCs to reach a steady state would be shortened. However, the use of the ventilation would not be sufficient and as effective as the use of an air cleaner. In the case when only an air cleaner was used without ventilation, VOCs would be removed much more considerably in contrast to the cases in which only the ventilation was applied. However, the use of air cleaner would take longer for the VOCs concentration to reach a steady state. The numerical data illustrated that if ventilation was complementing the air cleaner and were applied simultaneously, this would allow attainment of good indoor air quality within an adequate time period. The enhancement of ventilation was shown to have the effectiveness of delivering a shorter time period for the emission of VOCs to reach a steady-state low concentration. The supplementary use of an air cleaner would thus allow saving in energy while optimising the ventilation requirement to achieve an adequate indoor air quality for office occupants. Moisture could have a slight influence on the performance of the air cleaner which would perform more effectively in a drier environment.</p></sec></body>
