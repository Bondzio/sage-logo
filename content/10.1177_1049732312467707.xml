<abstract>
<p>The popularity of British hospice day care signals the expanding boundaries of palliative care beyond end-stage illness. In this article, I examine the ways hospice philosophy was interpreted and implemented in an outpatient day therapy setting run by a multidisciplinary team of health professionals. Findings suggest that hospice day care staff members used several strategies to help patients cope and retain a sense of personhood while facing numerous emotional and physical challenges associated with life-threatening illness. Health professionals in the United States will need to prepare for patients accessing hospice and palliative care services earlier in the illness trajectory to take advantage of these opportunities for patient support and advocacy.</p>

<body>
<p>Hospice care has become a key topic of social science inquiry. The modern hospice movement was founded in the United Kingdom in 1967 by Cicily Saunders as an alternative to the hospital-based end-of-life care available at the time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732312467707">Siebold, 1992</xref>). Hospice day care is an outpatient therapy program that has existed for several decades in the United Kingdom but is less established in the United States. Over time, the margins of palliative care have greatly expanded to include patients in multiple stages of illness, not necessarily limited to the final days or weeks of life. According to Margaret Robbins, author of <italic>Evaluating Palliative Care: Establishing the Evidence Base</italic>,
<disp-quote>
<p>Current debate over the boundaries of palliative care suggest its appropriateness in some form from the time of cancer diagnosis, as well as being applicable to patients with other clearly defined terminal illnesses (progressive neurological conditions) and those with less apparent terminal illnesses (stroke, chronic obstructive airways disease). (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732312467707">1998</xref>, p. 44)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>These margins have expanded to reach beyond the previously imagined boundaries of end-stage care. Multidisciplinary hospice teams can make a difference in the daily lives of clients at much earlier phases in the illness trajectory, allowing clients to reject or delay the social status of “full-time patient” for as long as possible.</p>
<p>Current research on end-of-life care in the United States exposes a need for programs that better address the concerns of elderly patients as well as their families and caregivers, such as continuity of care, care planning regarding life-sustaining treatment, and finding necessary resources to meet the potentially large care burden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732312467707">Gardner &amp; Kramer, 2009</xref>). Day therapy or day care was a British outpatient therapy hospice program for patients with active disease who were in need of support to maintain independent living. Patients received care one day per week and could use all of the hospice services before returning to their own homes each evening. Many used transportation volunteers to get to and from the facility, and a social worker was assigned to each patient regardless of whether he or she was admitted as an inpatient or day care participant.</p>
<p>As part of the multidisciplinary team, the social workers managed benefits as well as coordinated with social workers in the community to synchronize care and prevent discontinuity of services. One of the key principles of day care was to help return a sense of normality to the lives of the patients who continued to live in the community, rather than inpatient residents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049732312467707">Kabel &amp; Paul-Ward, 2011</xref>). This sense of normality and rejection of patienthood was often attempted via the provision of highly customized, individualized care.</p>
<p><italic>The Dying Process</italic>, by Lawton, was one of the first ethnographic explorations of British hospice care. Lawton was critical of the claims made by the hospice movement to help people live with illnesses, and found that dying patients were often suffering a “loss of self” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732312467707">2000</xref>, p. 89), finding themselves reduced to “a body object” (p. 82). Continuing the critique, Lawton viewed day therapy as basically a tool to extend the denial of illness on behalf of those still able-bodied enough to do so. Day therapy patients, unlike those residing in the inpatient units, were not at the very end stages of life and might have had the ability to participate in the social world to a greater extent than those more advanced along the illness trajectory. In contrast to Lawton, other researchers found that the success of day therapy rested with its staff members’ ability to create a space where those attending were reminded that they were more than just patients, as if being a patient was not their primary social identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732312467707">Langley-Evans &amp; Payne, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049732312467707">Payne, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049732312467707">Thompson, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>Personhood, one’s identity as a social person, is both cross-culturally variable and culturally specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049732312467707">Armstrong &amp; Fitzgerald, 1996</xref>). Knowing how personhood is defined at the end of life enables more appropriate and humane care for the dying, higher-quality end-of-life care, and a fuller understanding of what it means to be human. Modern Western notions of personhood have been traced back to John Locke, who conceptualized a person as “a thinking, intelligent being that has reason and reflection and can consider itself as itself” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049732312467707">Kittay, 2001</xref> p. 563). Yet this type of approach, although well known in Western contexts, has also been criticized. Kittay questioned the wisdom of using “rational agency” (p. 563) as a requirement for personhood, especially because it excludes individuals with cognitive impairment from being considered full persons. The pervasiveness of this categorical scheme is not surprising in Western contexts, where cognition is highly prized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732312467707">Post, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>The support of personhood is complicated by illness and disability, making hospice an ideal location for the study of how this process occurs. Issues surrounding personhood, such as cross-cultural definitions of personhood and factors resulting in the negation of one’s status as a full adult person, have long been the concern of anthropology and the social sciences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049732312467707">Dumont, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732312467707">Fortes, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732312467707">Lawton, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732312467707">Luborsky, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049732312467707">Mauss, 1938</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732312467707">Trosset &amp; Caulkins, 2002</xref>), and should now be the concern of the health sciences and social work. As hospice care responds to earlier involvement in the illness trajectory, it is imperative that the health professions, mental health professionals, and rehabilitation professionals, as well as the social science community, focus attention on these changing social phenomena.</p>
<p>Understanding the changing context of end-of-life issues is crucial as palliative care renegotiates its place within the health care spectrum, expanding the traditional boundaries. Examining the ways in which hospice philosophy is actually implemented sheds light on how patients and practitioners create and recreate the hospice culture. In this article, I illustrate the interplay of hospice policy and down-on-the-ground practice, and examine how the staff members of a British hospice day care supported patients as full adult persons.</p>
<sec id="section1-1049732312467707" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>I observed and interviewed hospice day care patients and staff members over the course of the 14-month study. I obtained permission through the institutional review boards overseeing both the facility in the United Kingdom and my home institution in the United States. In-depth interviews were conducted with staff members (<italic>n</italic> = 35) and day care patients (<italic>n</italic> = 3). Observations were made of approximately 50 individuals in the facility. I approached interview participants in person after sufficient rapport was established. The majority of interviews were about 1 hour in length, conducted in private, and focused on patient care strategies and experiences in the facility. Staff and patient accounts of the activities and experiences in day care were supplemented with months of observation and researcher–participant interaction. The majority of the day care patients were elderly White women, reflecting the over-age-65 population in Great Britain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732312467707">Office for National Statistics, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Interviews were transcribed verbatim, indexed, and coded for analysis using a constant comparative method. I identified and interpreted themes from coded data. This approach allowed a broader examination of the goals and mission of the hospice movement and compared them with the actual day-to-day practices carried out by hospice staff members. In other words, the manifestations of broader cultural values in end-of-life care are experienced both by individual bodies and social bodies. Thus, individual as well as collectively lived experiences are relevant domains for investigational exploration. These data were collected at a hospice facility located in northern England. Green Leaf Landing (pseudonym) was an upper-middle-class neighborhood, and the hospice facility there was nestled among affluent homes.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Staff members and patients called day care the “Snog and Grog Club” (British slang for kissing and drinking alcohol). The day care approach enabled the provision of services in a relaxed, homelike atmosphere, and the same patients came each week on an assigned day. The facility was decorated like a living room in a traditional British home, with couches, upholstered chairs and coordinating accent pillows, drapes, and wallpaper. The day care supervisor, Sister Sandy, described a typical day in day care, where patients were greeted warmly (snog) and offered a drink (grog). Her comments encapsulated how the day care came to be known as the Snog and Grog Club:
<disp-quote>
<p>The patients themselves have actually christened us the “Snog &amp; Grog Club” because they are very warmly greeted on arrival, but we are sensitive to that. We don’t hug and kiss everybody if they don’t want to be, and they can have a little tipple of whatever they fancy at lunchtime: sherry, whiskey, brandy, gin—whatever they like. We have quite a stock of drink [alcohol]. They just have a little drink with their mid-day meal, so that’s what we’ve been christened. They’re warmly greeted on arrival, as I said, and they have tea and coffee.</p>

<p>It should be noted that alcohol is considered a normal part of adult British life, and serving it in this palliative care context is in no way stigmatized or inappropriate. Therapeutic interventions were seamlessly integrated with crafts and leisure activities. Numerous hours of observation were required before it was apparent that therapy was actually taking place. One could spend a considerable amount of time waiting for the therapy to start, having no idea that the therapy was taking place all around the facility. The very subtle nature of the way care was delivered, disguised as a social club, was part of its appeal to patients, along with the successful techniques used to help with pain management and relaxation, and provide other services.</p>
<p>The key component of the day therapy program was the goal of returning a sense of normality to the lives of the patients by deemphasizing their patient status. For example, day care participants could discretely be transported from the group activities without a separate appointment for any of the hospice services, including occupational therapy, physical therapy, having their hair done in the facility salon, bathing with the accessible tub and lift, having medications adjusted, receiving complementary therapy and massage, or participation in any of several activities. One such activity was the afternoon outing, or day trip, discussed by Sister Sandy:<disp-quote>
<p>We will go out, perhaps for afternoon tea. We’ll take the patients out for afternoon tea. Occasionally we’ll take them out for lunch. We’ve got quite a few local holes around here; we can take them round there or sometimes just to go shopping, you know. A patient might not have—we’ve got one young lady who hadn’t been shopping for four or five years on her own and was very dependent on her husband, who was reluctant to take her shopping. So you know, we’ll take the patients shopping and perhaps on to a garden center for lunch, and it’s trying to bring normality back into people’s lives.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Something as simple as a shopping trip took on much larger importance in the context of serious illness. Staff members shared examples of how the day therapy was used to bring normality back into patient’s lives by helping them rebuild confidence. Some patients feared facing the outside world after undergoing medical procedures which might have resulted in a lack of control over bodily functions, or an altered body image.</p>
<p>The interaction style utilized in the facility was described as “drawing alongside.” This pattern was observed numerous times but could easily be overlooked because of its subtlety. In the following comment, Sandy detailed the subtle approach that had become the hallmark of day care staff:<disp-quote>
<p>We’ll round each patient in a very relaxed fashion and just draw alongside each patient, talk to them. There’ll be a nurse responsible for a number of patients, etc. They will talk mainly to them and see how they’ve been through that last week, see if they’ve had any more pain or symptoms, any problems at all, any financial worries, family worries, anything. You know, the main thing is that we draw alongside patients and glean whatever problems they might be encountering—physical, psychological, social problems. But our main aim is to get to know our patients well so that they will trust us and share whatever is troubling them.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Sandy’s understanding of patient assessment was a highly customized type of care tailored to the individual patient. Drawing alongside allowed members of the multidisciplinary team to assess the needs of each patient and was an essential part of the unique contribution of this program, but could easily be missed by the casual observer.</p>
<sec id="section3-1049732312467707">
<title>Snog and Grog Folklore</title>
<p>In addition to drawing alongside, individual, customized attention was another hallmark of this program. The “bow-tie bingo” incident had become a cherished part of Snog and Grog folklore, perhaps because it exemplified customized care disguised as a social activity. According to the narrative, patients and staff once colluded to fix the result of a bingo game so that an elderly patient known for bow ties would win on his birthday. I collected the most complete account from a long-serving day care volunteer. The elderly birthday celebrant was thrilled to win the weekly bingo game on his birthday, and didn’t suspect any clandestine plots until he saw that the prize for this particular week was a bow tie (called a “dickey bow” in Britain). Staff members and volunteers shared stories about this event and added that the patient was quite excited to sport his new bow tie the following week at day care.</p>
<p>Day care activities were designed to provide opportunities for patients to participate in reciprocal relationships, which could be challenging when facing serious illness. Craft work, specifically, seemed to provide new social roles for patients in unexpected ways. Crafting sessions were held in the facility around a large table with patients, nurses, volunteers and, depending on the day, a social worker or occupational therapist, making special craft items to be completed during the session. Patients as well as staff members shared crafting stories during interviews and several patients identified the craft sessions as the reason they wanted to attend day care initially. These stories stood out as excellent examples of the link between crafts, reciprocity, and personhood. For example, an occupational therapist shared that he saw a transformation in an older man who was at first reluctant to have anything to do with the craft table, and who eventually declared himself the “craft supervisor” and went so far as to make a name tag for himself advertising his new role.</p>
<p>Sister Sandy shared a story, referred to here as the Tapestry Tale, of a middle-aged woman who learned how to weave tapestry in day care. This story became part of the Snog and Grog club folklore, perhaps because it served to inspire the care team by highlighting the importance and deeper meaning attached to the day-to-day tasks they supported. According to the Tapestry Tale, a woman struggling to accept her life-threatening diagnosis developed a passion for long-stitch tapestry work (after learning how to do it in day care) and began teaching her friends at home how to do it. By teaching her friends the craft, she could once again participate in a balanced relationship with them, after being on the receiving end of treatment and therapy; she could be on the “giving end” by taking on the teaching role. This teaching role was transformational in the woman’s life, allowing her to come to terms with her illness and the bodily realities accompanying it. Several patients saved their craft work for the summer fair hosted by the hospice each year. Additionally, the crafts were sold to fundraise for the hospice, allowing the patients reciprocity by having a hand in supporting the facility.</p>

<sec id="section4-1049732312467707">
<title>Shelly</title>
<p>Shelly was a woman in her 50s, working as a hospital telephone operator when she started experiencing reoccurring pain. She went to her doctor expecting to be diagnosed with a repetitive motion injury and was shocked to find that she had lung cancer. Along with her treatment, she also participated in the hospice outpatient clinic for breathing exercises, and learned about the day therapy program and what it had to offer. She initially said that she came for the craft work, but upon probing, explained that a nurse at the outpatient respiratory (breathlessness) clinic referred her. Shelly found there were broad benefits to using the services of day care:<disp-quote>
<p>It’s not only beneficial for me, it’s beneficial for those around me as well. Because, like this morning I got up and had a shower and got ready and come out, and we always have a laugh. We always end up having a laugh, and also the doctor is always here. You’ve met the doctor, haven’t you? So she’s quite good, and then if you’ve got a hospital six weeks between, it’s quite a long time sometimes, and little things start to niggle you. But coming here each week, it’s been a good help.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Attending day care was important to support Shelly’s goal of remaining in her home, because it allowed her to use the services of the hospice one day per week and also provided respite to her husband. She became emotional when discussing the toll her cancer diagnosis and treatment had taken on her attempt to maintain a consistent sense of self. She indicated that it had been hard for her to be the same person once her daily activities had to be altered, and her leisure occupations were for the most part off limits:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer (I):</speaker>
<p>Do you feel that you are the same person you were before you had your diagnosis?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Shelly (S):</speaker>
<p>I try to be, but I know I’m not really [crying]. Sorry.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>I:</speaker>
<p>I’ve got a tissue for you here.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>S:</speaker>
<p>It’s just hard sometimes.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>I:</speaker>
<p>When you say that you try to be, what types of things do you try to do?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>S:</speaker>
<p>Well, we do go out, and we try to, but it’s an effort sometimes.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>I:</speaker>
<p>Do your friends still relate to you the same way they did, or . . . ?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>S:</speaker>
<p>Yeah, they do, and we do have days. Well, they come over for the day and they all kept in touch, so I’m lucky in that respect. I’ve got a lot of good friends.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>I:</speaker>
<p>[Is it] an effort to go out?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>S:</speaker>
<p>Oh, yes, if we feel up to it. Sometimes I just feel tired. I don’t bother. But if we go out in the nice garden, it’s just nice enough to smell the flowers and relax.</p>
</speech>
<p>Gardening had been Shelly’s hobby before she found that she could no longer do the bending and lifting required. She found pleasant substitutes at the hospice facility:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>S:</speaker>
<p>You get so many ideas of what to do, what hobbies to do, like painting and doing different things.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>I:</speaker>
<p>So you enjoy the craft work?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>S:</speaker>
<p>Um hmm, yes.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>I:</speaker>
<p>What do you do with the crafts after you make them?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>S:</speaker>
<p>Well, this time I, there was a summer fair, so I bring them back and put them in the summer fair.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>I:</speaker>
<p>So the hospice sells them?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>S:</speaker>
<p>Yes, yeah. Because you could go on and on and get tissue boxes and vases and all sorts, so it’s just nice to give something back, really.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>I:</speaker>
<p>Do you ever give them away as gifts?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>S:</speaker>
<p>Yes, I have to friends, yes. I’m no good at crafts or anything, but they do art and things that you can do and build up on it really, because I said, “I can’t paint,” and she said, “Oh, come on. You don’t have to be able to paint really well.” You know, just gets you going, things like that. Yeah, it’s been good.</p>
</speech>
<p>Shelly struggled with her status as a full-time patient and fought to maintain a connection to her prediagnosis self. Having cancer threatened her ability to be the person she wanted to be, but her membership in the Snog and Grog Club provided refuge from that struggle.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1049732312467707">
<title>Joan</title>
<p>Joan joined the Snog and Grog Club when a doctor referred her to help manage anxiety. She was retired in her early 60s when she developed colon cancer. With the help of her brother and sister-in-law, she was able to live independently. Joan shared that the treatment phase of her illness transformed her in the eyes of friends and family. She reported believing she was “just a body,” and not a person when friends would ask detailed questions about her cancer and treatment without regard to the toll these questions took on her. She said, “Everyone was asking about my body but forgetting about me.” She lost interest in most things, including clothes shopping because she “couldn’t see the point of it” before coming to day care.</p>
<p>Joan experienced a number of painful losses when hospital roommates and one of her day therapy friends passed away. When revealing this information, she used the experience as an example of why she no longer wished to inquire about her fellow day therapy participants, and then reconsidered that decision upon hearing herself:
<disp-quote>
<p>You see, I was unfortunate the first three times I went into hospital; someone died on the ward. I was only in three days. The first was a heart attack and the other two were cancer related, but I’ve had to reason out to myself that this is a hospital and this is going to happen, and that is what I’ve tried to do here [at day care], as well.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Thinking on it and discussing it, Joan added, “I mean, I probably would ask if somebody didn’t show up now [at day care], but probably it makes me a bit more aware [to hear bad news].” Joan reflected on the memories of emptiness, not seeing the point in shopping, participating in hobbies, or interacting socially before she started attending day care. She resisted the way her diagnosis stripped away her social boundaries, leaving her uncomfortably exposed and objectified. At the time of the interview, she considered whether or not to proceed with additional treatments and reported that the day care experience contributed to her getting out of “limbo” and back to her authentic self.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1049732312467707">
<title>Vera</title>
<p>Vera was referred to day care once it was determined that the treatment for her bone cancer was not working. In her words, “They found out that it wasn’t doing me a bit of good.” She was a retired grocery manager in her 70s. Vera never learned to drive a car, but proudly reported that she biked to work every day until the age of 67. She lived independently at the time of data collection, receiving regular visits from adult children to help with shopping, cleaning, and transportation. She stated that her cancer diagnosis did not get in the way of being herself, adding that people are “bound to have something wrong with [them]” as they age.</p>
<p>She indicated that her health problems were linked to aging and did not seem to threaten her identity. Her husband died suddenly while on vacation in Europe, leaving her shocked and bewildered because he had no previous history of health problems. She considered herself to be “very lucky” to age and manage health-related symptoms such as pain and swollen legs rather than die unexpectedly like her husband. She came to day care because she wanted to meet people and have a “day out.” Vera used several of the facility services, including massage for her legs, transportation, and the hospice hair salon. She was also an avid dominos player and raved about the afternoon meal prepared at day care:<disp-quote>
<p>The meal is lovely. The meal is very, very nice. Very nice. You have your soup, and you have your dinner, and you have a sweet, and have a drink of sherry and a drink of orange juice; cup of tea in the afternoon before you go home. It’s your day out, in’t it? You feel as if you can cope better, I think.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Vera participated in a fair amount of banter with the other Snog and Grog members, especially regarding the dominos games:<disp-quote>
<p>I like playing dominos with Fred. I keep winning, you know, and he keeps saying, “You’re a cheat!” I said, “Well, I don’t mean to win, and I won’t play then.” Then there was nobody playing and they said, “Vera, are you playing?” and I said, “They don’t like me winning.” Sometimes I go to the back table and do a bit of painting and that, but I’d rather sit with my legs up to rest my legs really, which I do in the afternoon at home. I put my legs up and rest them, because they get so swelled, my legs.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Overall, day care was a day out for Vera and an opportunity to access the various services of the hospice facility. The day care program allowed her to continue living independently while receiving the benefits of the palliative care team. Living independently allowed Vera to suspend or resist acquiring the status of a full-time patient.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Day therapy seemed, on the surface, to offer a relaxing day and light refreshments with the opportunity to use the hospice services, yet so much more was actually transpiring. Through multiple visits it became clear that activities in the day care sessions were part of the Snog and Grog Club habitus, and were extremely important to staff as well as patients on multiple levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049732312467707">Bourdieu, 1977</xref>). Simple activities like craftwork participation or having one’s hair styled played a major role in supporting the hospice ethos of helping patients live with their illnesses, as well as supporting patient personhood case by case. The Green Leaf Landing day therapy program worked to offer participants a break from patienthood. Counseling was available privately, as were all other services of the hospice, but the day care setting was a place where a given participant could be more than a patient. However, it required a well-organized system to resist the prevailing cultural forces which were always at the ready to cast the newly diagnosed into the role of full-time patient, superseding their prior roles as persons.</p>
<p>The participation of the Snog and Grog Club “members” in the plot to celebrate the elderly gentleman’s birthday by fixing a bingo game indicates a certain level of meaningful activity, engagement, and customized care. Of course, not every patient received or would want to receive a bow-tie bingo prize. The bow tie was a special gesture for this particular patient, and only those individuals who spent time with him and developed rapport with him would appreciate the significance, if not for the incident living on through Snog and Grog Club folklore. This account serves as an example of how personhood can be supported in the face of serious illness, and as an illustration of what is possible with low staff-to-patient ratios and multidisciplinary team involvement. To dismiss it as trivial would waste a valuable opportunity for insight into the workings of this unique program. Fixing the bingo result served as a bonding experience for the club members, as well as a way for staff and patients to acknowledge not only his birthday and his status as full adult person, but membership in the Snog and Grog Club and the connections they shared.</p>
<p>Shelly and Joan both felt their identities were threatened by their illnesses and the way those illnesses manifested in their personal lives. Joan’s ambivalence regarding whether or not to inquire about the status of another day therapy patient (for fear of hearing bad news) oscillated between the knee-jerk reaction of not wanting to hear bad news to being curious about the patients she came to know in the Snog and Grog Club. Such oscillation was not uncommon among people dealing with anxiety-provoking situations, and did not represent a lack of a cohesive self-representation, but rather the context-dependent negotiations that take place universally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732312467707">Ewing, 1990</xref>). Joan’s original anxiety about becoming a body rather than a person simultaneously echoes and rejects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732312467707">Lawton’s (2000)</xref> suggestion that people face a nonnegotiable loss of self at the end of life. The members of Joan’s social web of relations left her believing she was a body without a person inside it. That experience of emptiness was what inspired her to start attending day care, negotiating what Lawton deemed nonnegotiable, and participate in the Snog and Grog Club. Participation in the Club is what provided her the tools to resist the emptiness and objectification experienced elsewhere.</p>
<p>Vera greatly enjoyed day care and was an active participant in the Snog and Grog Club activities; she benefited from the program in a more practical sense. Day care provided a day out, social interaction, the opportunity to check in with her doctor, have her hair done, receive a message, and participate in the group outings. Vera’s personhood was not nearly as threatened as in the cases of Joan or Shelly. She did not arrive at day care with a “broken” identity in need of repair. Independence was the key to Vera’s sense of personhood, and her day care participation allowed her to avoid institutional placement.</p>
<p>The nature of working with people facing life-threatening illnesses calls for a protocol to address the deaths of program participants. The day care staff members developed a method of gently informing the other patients individually by drawing alongside and allowing clients to come to terms with the news at their own pace. The pattern of drawing alongside individual patients, combined with low staff-to-patient ratios, was completely consistent with the hospice mission of caring holistically for the unique needs of the patients, and was one of the ways the care team worked to create and recreate the hospice culture. The number of patients receiving day therapy at any one time was limited to about 15. Directing the focus to 15 patients at a time might appear frivolous; however, it was the belief of the organization that larger groups could not have been accommodated with the same level of individual attention.</p>
<p>Spending time in the day therapy unit helped to bring the shifting boundaries of palliative care into sharper focus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732312467707">Robbins, 1998</xref>). What became known as the Snog and Grog Club used craftwork, bingo, afternoon tea, and expert nursing care to help patients cope with their illnesses, suspend patienthood, and retain their sense of personhood. The patients came to day care at a time when they were facing emotional and physical challenges. The multidisciplinary team provided emotional support for patients who were at various stages of illness and might have believed they were between living and dying, trapped in a liminal space. The support provided by the staff, along with the small group size and low staff-to-patient ratios, illustrated the interplay between hospice policies and down-on-the-ground practices in this unique end-of-life care option.</p>
<p>Through participant observation, the salience of the everyday activities that took place in day care became more apparent. The craftwork, dominos, bingo, and day trips had a transforming effect on the patients, and provided opportunities for meaningful engagement and the minimizing of distress. The apprehension expressed by the patients because of concerns about appearance and control of bodily functions was reminiscent of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049732312467707">Goffman’s (1967)</xref> concept of deference and demeanor. Ideally, the day care experience could provide an opportunity for patients to renegotiate their relationships with the outside world, conduct themselves with the desired demeanor, and be paid the appropriate deference. Thus, a simple shopping trip with the Snog and Grog Club was transformed into an activity which could help to rebuild confidence and be profoundly meaningful. This renegotiation was reflected in Becker’s study of disrupted lives: “The body becomes an unknown terrain that must be relearned; flawed and distorted, it becomes the focus of identity, the shaky ground on which a new order—if there is to be order—must be built” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049732312467707">1997</xref>, pp. 81-82). The Snog and Grog Club members had to relearn the limits of their bodies postdisruption. Through individual planning, group activities, and personal encouragement, full adult personhood was supported by the hospice team, and they saw this aspect of the job as an integral part of the hospice professional practice.</p>
<p>Staff members worked to create a safe environment in which a sense of normalcy could be renegotiated to accommodate the new reality of these patients’ lives. The concept of what constitutes normalcy is of course a cultural construct, as are “dominant ideologies about how life should be lived” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049732312467707">Becker, 1997</xref>, p. 17). Those who attended day care were in the midst of coping with the fact that their illnesses cast them outside the margins of normalcy. Therefore, the day care environment offered a salient opportunity to step outside of their patienthood (when one’s status as a patient dominates), and reinforce culturally constructed notions of personhood.</p>
<p>Creative approaches to patient support, such as craftwork, day trips, massage, and reflexology reflected the shared social environment as well as the down-on-the-ground practice of the facility. The program used a subtle approach to restore a sense of personhood to patients who often began the program distressed and grieving about terminal prognoses. The creative nature of day therapy powerfully acknowledged the patients as full persons. The careful, delicate work carried out by the multidisciplinary team promoted and sometimes restored a sense of personhood to the patients, and I would argue reinforced occupational satisfaction to the clinical and volunteer staff.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>By observing and participating in the day care activities as well as interviewing staff, volunteers, and patients, I recognized the continual process of creating and recreating the day-to-day understanding of appropriate and effective care. As the day care staff drew alongside each patient and made an assessment of his or her needs, they allowed the patient to utilize the services of the hospice and cope with illness at his or her own pace. The feedback staff received from patients, both positive and negative, allowed them to continually adjust and fine-tune their practices. This process was significant because it provided an insider’s view of how this multifaceted and nuanced program operated. I witnessed how the hospice culture shaped the actions of the staff and how the staff and patients shaped the hospice culture. Spending such an extended period of time in this research setting provided an opportunity to experience the magnitude of this very gentle approach to patient support and advocacy.</p>
<sec id="section9-1049732312467707">
<title>Implications</title>
<p>The fact that day care patients were referred to the program at various stages of terminal illness is indicative of the expanding boundaries in palliative care, extending the coping techniques to patients long before they reach final stages of illness. Traditionally, hospice care was offered to patients in the final weeks or months of life, but those guidelines are changing, creating opportunities for all members of the physician and nonphysician health professions to work with patients in palliative care settings earlier in the disease process, as well as opportunities for study of palliative care at earlier times in the life course. The small group size was one key to allowing the individual attention and customized care that helped make the program so popular. The staff-to-patient ratio is important for American programs looking to expand in similar modalities. The patients studied here were living in the community, but still able to access all services of the hospice one day per week. This access allowed the palliative expertise from social workers, occupational therapists, physical therapists, and nurses to play a larger role in their lived experience. As patients in the United States start to utilize hospice and palliative care earlier in the illness trajectory, social work, mental health, and rehabilitation professionals will need to prepare for this changing social phenomenon and the opportunities it brings for patient support and advocacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049732312467707">Christ &amp; Sormanti, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049732312467707">Kramer, Christ, Bern-Klug, &amp; Francoeur, 2005</xref>).</p>
