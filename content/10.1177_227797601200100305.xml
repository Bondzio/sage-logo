<p>Sociologist and scholar of agrarian studies, Henry Bernstein is the former editor of the <italic>Journal of Peasant Studies</italic> (1895–2000) and founding editor of the <italic>Journal of Agrarian Change</italic> (2001–08). For four decades, he has been at the forefront of North Atlantic debates on the agrarian question, distinguishing himself as a theorist of agrarian sociology and African political economy. His new book is the inaugural volume of a series on the agrarian question published by Fenwood Publishers in Canada and Kumarian Press in the United States.</p>
<p>As would have been expected of a veteran scholar, Bernstein’s treatment of the class dynamics of agrarian change is driven by an ambition to draw macro-historical and inter-regional comparisons and elaborate concepts with universal appeal. Nevertheless, his approach reveals an economistic and indeed, Eurocentric vocation, manifest in the ‘pure’ notions of capitalism which he espouses and his nonrecognition of the specificity of peripheral capitalism.</p>
<p>The book is divided into eight chapters. After a brief introduction, the author embarks in Chapter 1 on an elaboration of Marxist concepts related to the division of labour, accumulation, exploitation and reproduction under the capitalist mode of production. The exposition has a didactic style, whose purpose is ostensibly to present ‘the basic’ concepts in accessible language. However, this purpose is undermined from early on by a partial presentation of concepts and an economistic bias. The author, seemingly in Leninist fashion, seeks to abstract the capital-labour relation from the social and political ‘impurities’ that influence the concrete process of accumulation. What goes missing is precisely a fair treatment of the diversity of Marxist perspectives on the development of capitalism, including the diversity inspired by Leninism.</p>
<p>Thus, it would have been useful to include references to Luxemburg’s critique of ‘self-contained’ capitalism and the extensive debates on primitive accumulation; the tradition drawing on Lenin/Bukharin on monopoly capitalism (which appears in passing as late as Chapter 3) and its relevance to the agrarian question; and the equally historic contributions, emanating from Africa, Asia, and Latin America, on the <italic>centre- periphery</italic> contradiction and the relationship between the agrarian and national questions. Missing also is the obligatory prior question to any conceptual discussion: What is the agrarian question today? In recent years, the author has provoked a stir, especially in Africa and Asia where his work is best known, for arguing that the ‘classical’ agrarian question, including its land component, has ‘ended’. Oddly enough, in this book there is no explicit reference to this thesis, or to the critiques thereof, or to any other discernible proposal for the twenty-first century.</p>
<p>Chapters 2 and 3 present the diverse trajectories of capitalism in the countryside, from its English and other European origins to those of Asian and other Southern regions marked by the colonial experience. Here, the author counterposes two analytical tendencies not flagged in the theoretical chapter: the ‘conventional’, which generalizes the ‘purity’ of the English path and relegates the rest, especially those of the South, to ‘pre-capitalist’ stages; and another which relaxes the concept of capitalism to contemplate the functional relationship between capitalist expansion and apparently ‘pre-’ or ‘non-’ capitalist social relations. The author presents these two approaches without taking sides, ostensibly in the interest of ‘debate’. Yet, the conceptual tools elaborated in Chapter 1 already preclude fair consideration of the second tendency.</p>
<p>Bernstein’s economistic bias becomes clearer in the subsequent discussion on the agrarian transition in Latin America, where the author presents one single perspective (by reference to one single scholar) which likens the colonial regime in Latin America to European feudalism. It should have at least been acknowledged—for didactic purposes, if nothing else—that this basically Soviet version of the ‘purity’ thesis came under sustained challenge in Latin America from the 1960s onwards, by a whole generation of intellectuals and activists drawn to dependency theory. In the case of Africa and Asia, the author persists with the same minimum-reference strategy, recurring to one or two authors, who despite their importance, do not, by any means, reflect the richness of the debates on these two continents.</p>
<p>It is worth adding that Bernstein’s analysis limits itself to <italic>capitalist</italic> transitions, at the exclusion of the socialist, such as the Soviet and the Chinese, despite the political and intellectual influence they exercised in the twentieth century. In a book that intends to be didactic, it would have been useful to at least alert the younger generation to the existence of such debates.</p>
<p>The author completes Chapter 3 by considering the contribution of colonialism to the expansion of capitalism in Europe and especially to the Industrial Revolution. Without much ado, he concludes that colonialism was not a ‘sufficient condition’ for such expansion. This conclusion might not, in itself, be problematic, but the real question remains unanswered: what <italic>is</italic> the function of the periphery? The author avoids such a challenge, which would draw him directly into a discussion on imperialism and makes only superficial reference to the debate regarding the ‘blocking’, or not, of development in the periphery.</p>
<p>Chapters 4 and 5 are dedicated to the evolution of the global agro-food ‘regime’ since 1870. The author briefly outlines the contributions of Philip McMichael and Harriet Friedmann, and divides the ‘regime’ in three periods: 1870–1914, 1940–70 and 1980 to the present. This would have been one of those necessary discussions, given that the ‘global’ determinants of the agrarian question have so often—as above—been marginalized in North Atlantic debates. Nonetheless, the recuperation of the ‘global’ via ‘regime theory’ does not compensate for the silences on imperialism. The concept of ‘regime’ has not obtained the necessary conceptual rigour, given its retreat into discrete ‘issue areas’ (the agro-food system, in this case) and isolation from the broader power relations which give form and substance to the imperialist system.</p>
<p>To take just one example, in the case of the ‘second’ regime (post-WWII), its characterization as ‘mercantilist-industrial’ does not properly recognize the tectonic movements brought about by national liberation struggles, against monopoly capitalism, including the pioneering experience of de-linking in China. More precisely, what is missing is an understanding of the Cold War as the key systemic rivalry, between evolved monopoly capitalism and struggles to delink, which determined the trajectory of the agro-food system. Perhaps inadvertently, the author recognizes this, contrary to the implications of regime theory, when he concludes that the fall of the second regime owed to the end of the Cold War!</p>
<p>This is all a strange debate which, despite the welcome research that it has produced by McMichael and Friedmann, has indeed been subject to constructive critique—readers might consult the introductory chapter to Sam Moyo and Paris Yeros (Eds), <italic>Reclaiming the land: the resurgence of rural movements in Africa, Asia and Latin America</italic> (London and Cape Town: Zed Books and David Philip, 2005), a book to which Bernstein contributed, and of which he cannot claim ignorance. One might wonder: what didactic purpose does it serve not to recognize and respond to critique?</p>
<p>Another question raised at the end of Chapter 5 refers to the ‘disappearance of the peasantry’ thesis and the struggles for reproduction in the countryside. Once again, the author pretends to be impartial on the matter, without openly taking sides. Yet, his wish for a post-peasant world is palpable and he clearly reveals his aversion to those who defend the peasantry, by lumping them together and dismissing them as ‘agrarian populists’. Clearly, the author does not see in the defense of the peasantry a possible anti-imperialist project; his notion of transition to socialism is as pure as his notion of transition to capitalism.</p>
<p>The author’s thinking on this issue is elaborated in Chapters 6, 7 and 8, which are dedicated to the social and political dimensions of contemporary rural society. The author here presents his theory of ‘complex variations’, situating the post-peasant rural population in a diversity of class situations, from salaried labour to petty-commodity production and a diversity of other relations, namely of gender, ethnicity, and race. This belated attempt to grapple with the class and ideological complexities of capitalism, tinged with concessions to post-structuralism, in no way absolves Bernstein of economism: for the ‘diversity’ in question is simply ‘added on’ to pure capitalism. On the one hand, the so-called peasantry has for long been in a flux, reproducing itself <italic>not</italic> as an indeterminate post-peasantry, but as a <italic>semi-proletariat</italic>, structurally necessary and permanent to peripheral capitalism. On the other hand, the question of identity has been intrinsic to the expansion of the system, never an ‘add on’, as well as to the social forces that have opposed it. Yet, we are left with a picture of rural politics in a structural vacuum, where identities do not appear to have any special ideological function, or significance for social struggle, or indeed any notable strategic objective among their diverse demands, which so often, we know, is the control of land.</p>
<p>Such conceptual shortcomings have further consequences, as in the author’s understanding of the land question itself. In his previous writings on land reform in the postwar period, the author has downplayed the social basis of land struggles, to portray land reform as the result of a ‘redistributive’ political will, differently from the current neoliberal period in which such will has dissipated. This book recounts the same narrative, divested of class struggle or systemic logic, and surrendered to its mysterious ‘variations’. But the key questions, known to the author, do not themselves surrender: what was the relation of forces that produced, from one continent to the next, such diverse outcomes in land reform? What was the relationship between reform and revolution, given the systemic pressure which the latter generated? Why did the United States, in particular, support certain land reforms, including radical land reforms in East Asia, against the will of local ruling classes, while suppressing and combatting others, as in Latin America and Africa, in line with ruling classes there? A theory of ‘complex variations’ is a poor guide to the history of the land question.</p>
<p>The theory also falls short of explaining contemporary land politics. More reflection would have been necessary on the nature of the expanding global reserve army of labour; this has added to the ranks of the semi-proletariat and escalated its struggle for land, both rural and urban. The author makes only passing reference to the concept of ‘semi-proletarianization’, with no desire to engage. This concept has, in fact, constituted a critique of his ‘complex variations’ thesis, by stressing the systemic character of super-exploitation in the periphery and the continuing importance of land as a political and economic resource.</p>
<p>The author moves on to a discussion of contemporary social struggles in the countryside, which he essentially reduces to the MST in Brazil and Via Campesina. This amounts to another bland discussion, again based on a minimum of references, grossly inadequate in themselves and restricted to the work of researchers in the North writing about the South. Bernstein’s only discernible preoccupation here seems to be with the ‘populism’ of these movements, not their real tactical, strategic, or ideological dilemmas, or indeed their failure to make headway on the land question at a time in which land struggles are escalating.</p>
<p>It is noteworthy, in this surreal debate, that the author avoids discussing a rural movement which did make headway, specifically in Zimbabwe, to obtain the most comprehensive land reform since the end of the Cold War—the period supposedly superseding land reform! Empirical evidence has now confirmed the breadth and depth of Zimbabwe’s land reform, permitting comparisons with the other great land reforms of the twentieth century, including the Mexican, Russian, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Taiwanese, Cuban, and Mozambican. The author has ample knowledge of the Zimbabwe debate; he has participated in it as an intellectual adversary of the land reform. What purpose does it now serve to smother this unique and instructive debate, and to divert attention to the non-debate of populism in the MST?</p>
<p>Finally, the book does not address the new scramble for land in the South, a process gaining momentum over the last quarter-century. This grave oversight follows logically from his exotic thesis (not explicitly repeated here) that the agrarian question, especially ‘of capital’, has ended. Yet, monopoly-finance capital is now in overdrive, with the ominous potential of undermining further the economic basis of whole regions, for decades to come. Can we really come to grips with the ‘class dynamics of agrarian change’ without taking into account this new imperialist assault?</p>
<p>This book should be read widely, not despite its shortcomings, but because of them. It is a clear example of stubborn academic imperialism, of the Marxist variety, which, half a century after decolonization, remains full of silences and evasions and contempt for researchers and debates in the South. One can only hope that the new generation of researchers in the North Atlantic, in these times of crisis, will take sincere interest in the agrarian question as a North-South relation and show the solidarity necessary to think through, collectively, the long transition to socialism.</p>
