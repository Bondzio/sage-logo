<p>During recent decades we have witnessed some intermittent, but huge, waves of transnational activisms against neoliberal globalization. Since anti-WTO protests in Seattle in 1999, anti-G8 summit protests burst out repeatedly in 2001, 2005, 2009, 2010, and 2011. These events set the scene for a great deal of scholarly books and articles, attracting the attention of many sociologists and political scientists to theory-building and empirical analyses of transnational activisms. <italic>Power and Transnational Activism</italic>, edited by Thomas Olesen, reflects the efforts to strike a balance between optimism and pessimism on the past and future of anti-globalization protests from a synthetic perspective of discursive opportunity structures facing transnational activists.</p>
<p>Contributors consistently emphasize interdisciplinary communicative approaches, securitization theory from international relations theory, and framing and discursive opportunities from social movement theory, in order to discuss strengths and weaknesses as well as opportunities and limits in transnational activisms. Power and its limits of transnational activists are primarily appraised by Ulrich Beck, David Chandler, and Ruth Reitan, respectively, in terms of global public awareness, negative rejection of state-based politics, and coordination of major leftist philosophy. While discussing under the rubric of transnationalism, some contributors including Jeffrey Ayres, Donatella della Porta and Herbert Reiter, Caroline Fleay, and Sarah Stroup also persuasively reveal how national contexts create and change transnational opportunity structures. Shannon Gibson, Anna Holzscheiter, Jutta Joachim, Dieter Rucht, and Håkan Thörn, in the final section, discuss the impacts of international institutional and mainstream media on the national shapes of transnational activisms.</p>
