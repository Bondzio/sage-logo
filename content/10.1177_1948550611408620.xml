<abstract>
<p>In light of U.S. society’s ever increasing need for activity, the authors used three experiments to examine how <italic>general action concepts</italic>, activated by subtle priming methods, influence choices to approach information that confirms a recent decision. Findings from Experiments 1 to 3 revealed that viewing action (vs. control) words prior to information selection increased selective approach to supporting information, but viewing inaction (vs. control) words reduced this bias. Experiment 3 also showed that the effect of the action words on this confirmation bias was smaller when participants were allowed to self-affirm by writing about an important personal value. In addition, the experiments found that viewing the action words caused the selection of more <italic>total</italic> information than viewing the inaction words. The authors conclude that the growing need for activity in the United States may contribute to a loss of objectivity in the way citizens gather information.</p>

<p>Recent trends suggest that the U.S. society craves activity. Over the last few decades, the average U.S. citizen watches more hours of television (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1948550611408620">The Nielsen Company, 2009</xref>), works longer hours on the job (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1948550611408620">National Sleep Foundation, 2005</xref>), eats more food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1948550611408620">Farah &amp; Buzby, 2005</xref>), engages in more leisure-time physical activity (e.g., golf; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1948550611408620">Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 2010</xref>), and performs better on cognitive tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1948550611408620">Flynn, 1987</xref>; also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1948550611408620">Grissmer, Kirby, Berends, &amp; Williamson, 1994</xref>), all while enjoying less sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1948550611408620">National Sleep Foundation, 2005</xref>). Consider also that nearly 75% of North Americans consume caffeine habitually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1948550611408620">International Food Information Council, 2010</xref>), 70% of our soft drinks are caffeinated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1948550611408620">Griffiths &amp; Vernotica, 2000</xref>), and the “energy-drink” industry (e.g., “Red Bull”) made over five billion dollars in profits in 2006 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1948550611408620">Packaged Facts, 2007</xref>) and is currently one of the fastest-growing industries—500 new energy drinks were released nationally in 2006, 200 of which were released in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1948550611408620">Johnson, 2006</xref>). Citizens' ever growing need for activity comes at a time when technological advances and a growing media industry allow people access to a wide array of information conveying diverse opinions on important topics such as business, health, politics, and religion. In light of these two trends, the current research set out to explore how situational manipulations that are known to influence the accessibility of <italic>general action concepts</italic> affect decisions to approach information supporting or opposing prior decisions.</p>
<p>More specifically, the current research tested the effects of general action concepts on the preference for supportive information following a decision, a bias that is present in most conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1948550611408620">Hart et al., 2009</xref>). Past research has shown that general action concepts can be activated to influence activity levels on a variety of tasks. For example, exposure to words denoting action (vs. words denoting inaction; e.g., <italic>go</italic> vs<italic>. stop</italic>) gives way to general action (vs. inaction) concepts that in turn produce higher or lower degrees of cognitive and motor pursuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1948550611408620">Gendolla &amp; Silvestrini, 2010</xref>). Specifically, participants shown general action (vs. inaction) words subsequently ate more available food, correctly solved more difficult verbal problems, showed better recall of a text, and preferred active tasks to rest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1948550611408620">Albarracin et al., 2008</xref>). Although the effects of action concepts have been demonstrated in a variety of important domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1948550611408620">Albarracin, Wang, &amp; Leeper, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1948550611408620">Laran, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1948550611408620">Noguchi, Handley, &amp; Albarracin, in press</xref>), their influence on exposure decisions awaits empirical test.</p>
<p>In the current article, participants indicated a decision on an issue (e.g., whether colleges should allow defamatory speeches on campus)—knowing that they would later select and read new information on the issue—and subsequently were primed with either action, inaction or, in some cases, control words. Following priming, participants were given an opportunity to select new information that clearly supported or contradicted their earlier decision. We anticipated that the presentation of action words prior to information selection would result in selecting more information to read and making the selection in a more biased fashion. A critical reason underlying approach to decision-consistent information is that confronting contradictory information elicits evaluative uncertainty and unpleasant arousal that can be avoided by decision-congenial exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1948550611408620">Festinger, 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1948550611408620">Frey, 1986</xref>). Moreover, activation of general action concepts may strengthen tendencies to avoid uncertainty about the desirability of a past decision as a way of enhancing decisive, effective ongoing action (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1948550611408620">Boninger, Krosnick, &amp; Berent, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1948550611408620">Fazio &amp; Zanna, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1948550611408620">Sivacek &amp; Crano, 1982</xref>). As such, it seems reasonable that the activation of general action (vs. inaction) concepts should predispose individuals to select information that supports past decisions. As examples, smokers prefer information that <italic>denies</italic> a link between lung cancer and smoking over information that <italic>confirms</italic> this link (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1948550611408620">Brock, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1948550611408620">Brock &amp; Balloun, 1967</xref>), voters prefer information that <italic>praises</italic> their preferred candidate over information that <italic>criticizes</italic> this candidate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1948550611408620">Rhine, 1967</xref>), and parents prefer information that <italic>supports</italic> their parenting philosophy over information that <italic>challenges</italic> this philosophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1948550611408620">Adams, 1961</xref>). These biases in selective exposure may be amplified when people’s level of activity is higher due to accessible action concepts.</p>
<p>The hypothesized effects of activating action and inaction concepts on selective exposure are consistent with and build upon prior research in important ways. An action-based model of cognitive dissonance has purported that people seek cognitive consistency by devaluing unselected alternatives to enhance unconflicted action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1948550611408620">Harmon-Jones &amp; Harmon-Jones, 2002</xref>; for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1948550611408620">Harmon-Jones, Amodio, &amp; Harmon-Jones, 2009</xref>). In this past research, participants who thought about implementing a recent decision or a personal goal preferred a selected (vs. nonselected) alternative (“spreading of alternatives”) to a greater extent than participants who thought about a typical day in their lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1948550611408620">Harmon-Jones, Harmon-Jones, Fearn, Sigelman, &amp; Johnson, 2008</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1948550611408620">Harmon-Jones &amp; Harmon-Jones, 2002</xref>). Further, participants with higher levels of trait behavioral activation sensitivity (BAS), which entails high arousal positive affect such as elation, show greater consistency between their attitudes and a recent behavior than participants with lower levels of this trait (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1948550611408620">Harmon-Jones, Schmeichel, Inzlicht, &amp; Harmon-Jones, in press</xref>). In this context, our focus on selective exposure is novel because this prior research has focused exclusively on <italic>evaluative change</italic> rather than actual, <italic>overt</italic> attempts to <italic>add</italic> new, supportive cognitions (for a comparison between evaluation and selective exposure, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1948550611408620">Frey, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1948550611408620">Jonas, Greenberg, &amp; Frey, 2003</xref>). In addition, prior work has not investigated the influence of <italic>general</italic> action/inaction priming but rather has concentrated on <italic>specific</italic> action plans or the high arousal positive affect measured by BAS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1948550611408620">Clark &amp; Watson, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1948550611408620">Gray, 1994</xref>). Hence, our research on generalized action versus inaction concepts, which are orthogonal to positive and negative affect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1948550611408620">Albarracin &amp; Hart, in press</xref>) and known to affect generalized activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1948550611408620">Albarracin et al., 2008</xref>), come to complement and extend prior research.</p>
<p>In three experiments, we explored the effects of general action and inaction primes on selective exposure and the overall amount of information selected to read. In each experiment, participants reported a tentative decision on an issue, completed a priming task with action, inaction or, in Experiment 1, control words, and then selected articles that either supported or contradicted their prior decision. We hypothesized that the activation of general action (vs. inaction) concepts prior to information selection would increase selective approach to consistent information. In addition to augmenting selective exposure, general action concepts may influence the amount of information sought after a decision. For example, action concepts may promote willingness to think about new information to a greater extent than inaction concepts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1948550611408620">Albarracin et al., 2008</xref>). Consistent with this idea, before making a decision, action (vs. inaction) concepts cause the analysis of larger amounts of information than inaction concepts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1948550611408620">Laran, 2010</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1948550611408620">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Given that effects of action primes on selective exposure are presumed to be guided by attempts to reduce evaluative uncertainty (and hence to strengthen decisions), Experiment 2 tested implications of this proposal directly by measuring decision strength (indexed as certainty in and commitment to the decision) following the decision. We assumed that action primes would promote feelings of decision strength that would in turn amplify selective exposure to a greater extent than inaction primes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1948550611408620">Brannon, Tagler, &amp; Eagly, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1948550611408620">Fischer, Greitemeyer, &amp; Frey, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1948550611408620">Jonas, Schulz-Hardt, Frey, &amp; Thelen, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1948550611408620">Jonas, Traut-Mattausch, Frey, &amp; Greenberg, 2008</xref>). Furthermore, given that self-affirmation is known to promote an even-handed evaluation of consistent and inconsistent information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1948550611408620">Sherman &amp; Cohen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1948550611408620">Sherman, Nelson, &amp; Steele, 2000</xref>), Experiment 3 examined whether self-affirmation would reduce or completely remove effects of the primes on selective exposure.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1948550611408620">2</xref></sup></p>

<title>Experiment 1</title>
<p>As an initial step, we investigated the effects of action and inaction primes on selective exposure. Participants indicated an initial decision on a business case, were primed with action, inaction, or control words, and then had an opportunity to select information from an array of supportive and unsupportive thesis statements. We predicted that participants exposed to action (vs. control or inaction) words would show a greater preference for supportive information. We also expected that action primes would promote the selection of more information than inaction or control primes.</p>

<p>Participants were 125 introductory-psychology students. The design had three conditions (action, control, and inaction primes).</p>

<sec id="section5-1948550611408620">
<title>Materials and procedure</title>
<p>Participants completed all the tasks as part of what was described as unrelated experiments. Participants were told that the first study dealt with decision making. Participants were asked to imagine that they were a store owner faced with the decision of whether to extend the contract of their current manager (Miller) who, according to a vignette, had mixed success with the company (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1948550611408620">Fischer, Jonas, Frey, &amp; Schulz-Hardt, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1948550611408620">Frey, 1986</xref>). After reading this information describing positive and negative aspects of Miller, participants were asked to provide a tentative decision about whether they wanted to extend his contract by clicking on one of the two boxes labeled “extend his contract” or “end his contract.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1948550611408620">3</xref></sup> As in prior research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1948550611408620">Fischer et al., 2005</xref>), participants indicated their choice thinking they would have the opportunity to read more information about the case later in the session and, if desired, revise their choice.</p>
<p>After indicating a decision, participants were told that they would take a brief break from the business-decision task to complete a verbal measure being pilot tested for use in future studies. On this task, participants were presented 12 words with missing letters and were asked to fill in the missing letters to make an English word. In the inaction-prime condition, participants received eight incomplete inaction-related words that must be completed as <italic>still, pause, interrupt, calm, freeze, unable, stop</italic>, and <italic>inactive</italic>. In the action-prime condition, participants received eight incomplete action-related words that must be completed as <italic>motivation, doing, behavior, engage, action, make, go,</italic> and <italic>active</italic>. In the control condition, participants received eight incomplete control words that must be completed as <italic>ring</italic>, <italic>air</italic>, <italic>screen, space, green, building, tooth</italic>, and <italic>ranch</italic> in addition to four control words present in all conditions (<italic>that</italic>, <italic>cup</italic>, <italic>wall</italic>, <italic>door</italic>). Previous research has shown that the presentation of action and inaction words has no influence on mood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1948550611408620">Albarracin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1948550611408620">Laran, 2010</xref>). Yet, because selective exposure depends on mood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1948550611408620">Jonas, Graupmann, &amp; Frey, 2006</xref>), we made sure that mood was unrelated to the priming by having participants indicate their mood on a 1 (<italic>very negative</italic>) to 10 (<italic>very positive</italic>) scale immediately after the prime task.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1948550611408620">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Subsequently, participants were given an opportunity to select new information about the business-decision task. This additional information was presented as 12 thesis statements ostensibly authored by the manager’s coworkers. Each statement contained a conclusion as to whether to extend the contract and an argument in favor of that conclusion. The statements were presented sequentially on the computer screen and participants indicated whether they wanted to read the article by clicking on a box labeled either “yes” or “no.” Participants were led to believe that the computer would retrieve the requested articles after selection. We offered six statements to support extending the contract and six statements to support not extending the contract; the presentation of these statements was randomly determined by the computer program. After selection, participants were asked to make their final decision on the case, were probed for awareness of the experiment’s purpose, and were debriefed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1948550611408620">5</xref></sup></p>

<title>Information search</title>
<p>We conducted a 2 (Information type: consistent vs. inconsistent) × 3 (Prime: action, inaction, control) analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures on the first factor (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1948550611408620">Table 1</xref> for cell means). The analysis revealed a significant main effect of information type, <italic>F</italic>(2, 117) = 32.81, <italic>p</italic> = .001, showing that more consistent information (<italic>M</italic> = 2.74, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.78) was selected than inconsistent information (<italic>M</italic> = 1.78, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.50). As anticipated, however, this main effect was qualified by an interaction with priming, <italic>F</italic>(2, 117) = 11.71, <italic>p</italic> = .001. Although participants in the action-prime, <italic>t</italic>(117) = 6.76, <italic>p</italic> = .001, and control-prime, <italic>t</italic>(117) = 3.25, <italic>p</italic> = .002, conditions showed a significant preference for consistent over inconsistent information, participants in the inaction-prime condition did not show this preference, <italic>t</italic>(117) &lt; 1. Consistent with our expectations, post hoc contrasts (using the least significant difference [LSD] method) between the three priming conditions revealed that the selective exposure bias was accentuated in the action-prime (vs. control-prime) condition (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) and was reduced in the inaction-prime (vs. control-prime) condition (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). Finally, we examined the effect of the prime on how much (total) information was selected. As predicted, more information was selected in the action-prime (<italic>M</italic> = 5.13, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.65) relative to the inaction-prime condition (<italic>M</italic> = 3.82, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.01), <italic>t</italic>(117) = 2.25, <italic>p</italic> = .03. Also as expected, the behavior of the control participants fell in between the action and inaction conditions (<italic>M</italic> = 4.60, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.99), but did not significantly differ from either prime condition, |<italic>t</italic>s| &lt; 1.4.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1948550611408620">6</xref></sup></p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Experiment 1 revealed that action (inaction) priming enhanced (reduced) selective approach to information that confirms prior decisions relative to control priming. These findings thus support the possibility that action concepts promote attempts to seek evaluative certainty through selective exposure. Interestingly, inaction concepts led to selections that could allow for evaluative uncertainty, perhaps as a way to support a delay in action (i.e., an inaction) until a firm decision is reached. Experiment 2 attempted to replicate and build upon the results of Experiment 1 by including a measure of decision strength. As decision strength should follow from attempts to establish evaluative certainty, we anticipated greater perceptions of decision strength in the action-prime condition, which should mediate the effects of the primes on approach to confirming information.</p>

<p>Procedures were similar to those used in Experiment 1 with two changes. First, we used a real-world issue instead of a fictitious hiring choice. Participants were asked to consider their view on whether hate speech should be allowed or banned on college campuses. A cover story indicated that the issue is debated because it represents a clash between freedom of speech and the protection of minority rights. After participants read the cover story, they indicated their decision.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1948550611408620">7</xref></sup> As before, participants indicated their choice knowing they would have the opportunity to read additional information on the issue. For the second change, we introduced questions concerning the strength of their current decision on hate speech immediately after the prime task. After participants completed the prime task, they indicated how strong their view on hate speech was by answering, on a scale from 1 (<italic>not at all</italic>) to 9 (<italic>extremely</italic>), “I have a strong view toward the issue of censoring hate speech” and “I feel committed toward my view on censoring hate speech.” These items are similar to past items that have been used in selective exposure research to index decision strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1948550611408620">Jonas &amp; Frey, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1948550611408620">Jonas et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1948550611408620">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1948550611408620">Fischer et al., 2008</xref>).

<title>General Discussion</title>
<p>The current research was conducted to explore implications of priming generalized action and inaction concepts for selective exposure to information. Experiment 1 demonstrated that the preference for consistent over inconsistent information was greater after action (vs. control) primes and lesser after inaction (vs. control) primes. Experiment 2 showed that action (vs. inaction) primes promoted stronger decisions and led to greater selective exposure. Moreover, Experiment 3 revealed that when a self-affirmation task was placed between the decision and the priming manipulation, action (vs. inaction) primes had no discernable influence on selective exposure. Presumably, self-affirmation created an even-handed processing of post-decisional information that interfered with the implications of the prime on selective approach to consistent information. All in all, our research is consistent with prior theorizing suggesting that people seek evaluative certainty (consistency among cognitions) to fulfill a requirement for efficient action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1948550611408620">Albarracin &amp; Handley, in press</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1948550611408620">Beckmann &amp; Irle, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1948550611408620">Harmon-Jones &amp; Harmon-Jones, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The current research contributes to understanding how general action and inaction concepts influence behavior. Interestingly, prior research has shown that the subtle activation of action (vs. inaction) concepts promotes more output on a variety of cognitive (e.g., enhanced performance on academic tasks) and behavioral tasks (e.g., eating; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1948550611408620">Albarracin et al., 2008</xref>). However, research on <italic>how</italic> these concepts influence behavior output is in its early stages. Some research suggests that action (vs. inaction) primes automatically mobilize effort to increase activity on a variety of tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1948550611408620">Gendolla &amp; Silvestrini, 2010</xref>). Yet, it is also possible that action primes influence activity by enhancing certainty in implementing a behavior. For example, action concepts may promote a stronger decision to perform a behavior that in turn supports a commitment to vigorously engage in a behavior. As initial support for this mechanism, the current research showed that action concepts promoted stronger initial decisions and greater approach to consistent information than inaction primes.</p>
<p>Over the last few decades, verb phrases that denote general action such as “get active,” “get moving,” “do something,” and “make something” have been used more frequently in books published in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1948550611408620">Google labs, 2010</xref>; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1948550611408620">Michel et al., 2010</xref>). As action cues have become more available, technological advancements in media dissemination have also given citizens greater access to news and facts. Unfortunately, our research shows that priming general action concepts can directly contribute to more defensiveness and the loss of objectivity in the way citizens gather information.</p>

<p>We performed separate analyses on the consistent and inconsistent information and found an effect of the prime on the selection of consistent information, <italic>F</italic>(1, 68) = 10.00, <italic>p</italic> = .001, but not the selection of inconsistent information (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1948550611408620">Table 2</xref> for means).</p>

<p>We ran separate 2 × 2 ANOVAs for consistent and inconsistent information. For consistent information, the analysis revealed a significant effect of prime, <italic>F</italic>(1, 78) = 7.80, <italic>p</italic> = .01, a marginal effect of self-affirmation, <italic>F</italic>(1, 78) = 2.74, <italic>p</italic> = .11, and a significant interaction between prime and self-affirmation, <italic>F</italic>(1, 78) = 5.11, <italic>p</italic> = .03. Whereas priming influenced the amount of consonant information selected in the no self-affirmation condition, <italic>t</italic>(78) = 3.43, <italic>p</italic> = .01, it failed to have influence in the self-affirmation condition, <italic>t</italic> &lt; 1. The ANOVA for inconsistent information revealed no significant main effects of the prime or self-affirmation and no interaction.</p>
