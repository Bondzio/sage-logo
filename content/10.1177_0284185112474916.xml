               <title>Background</title>
               <p>Pseudoprogression is a treatment-related reaction with an increase in contrast-enhancing lesion size, followed by subsequent improvement. Differentiating tumor recurrence from pseudoprogression remains a problem in neuro-oncology.</p>

               <title>Purpose</title>
               <p>To validate the added value of arterial spin labeling (ASL), compared with dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) perfusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) alone, in distinguishing early tumor progression from pseudoprogression in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).</p>

            <sec>
               <title>Material and Methods</title>
               <p>We retrospectively evaluated 117 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed GBM who underwent surgical resection and concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) as standard treatment modality. Sixty-two patients who developed contrast-enhancing lesions were assessed by both ASL and DSC perfusion MRI and classified into groups of early tumor recurrence (<italic>n</italic> = 34) or pseudoprogression (<italic>n</italic> = 28) based on pathologic analysis or clinical–radiologic follow-up. We used a qualitative analysis and semi-quantitative grade system on the basis of the tumor perfusion signal intensity into those equal to white matter (grade I), gray matter (grade II), and blood vessels (grade III) on ASL imaging. ASL grade was correlated with histogram parameters derived from DSC perfusion MRI.</p>
            </sec>
            <sec>
               <title>Results</title>
               <p>Pseudoprogression was observed in 15 (53.6%) patients with ASL grade I, 13 (46.4%) with grade II, and 0 (0%) with grade III, with early tumor progression observed in seven (20.6%) patients with ASL grade I, 11 (32.3%) with grade II, and 16 (47.1%) with grade III (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0022). DSC perfusion histogram parameters differed significantly among ASL grades. ASL grade was an independent predictor differentiating pseudoprogression from early tumor progression (odds ratio, 4.73; <italic>P</italic> = 0.0017). On qualitative review, adjunctive ASL produced eight (12.9%) more accurate results than DSC perfusion MRI alone.</p>

               <p>ASL improves the diagnostic accuracy of DSC perfusion MRI in differentiating pseudoprogression from early tumor progression.</p>

         <title/>
         <p>The prognosis for patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) remains dismal, even with aggressive surgical resection using state-of-the-art preoperative and intraoperative neuroimaging, along with recent advances in radiotherapy and chemotherapy. A factor contributing to poor prognosis is the limited ability of current surveillance strategies to reliably distinguish early tumor progression from pseudoprogression, a problem exacerbated since the introduction of concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) with temozolomide as the new standard treatment modality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-12-0477C1">1</xref>). Pseudoprogression is a subacute treatment-related reaction with an increase in contrast-enhancing lesion size, followed by subsequent improvement or stabilization without any further treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-12-0477C1">1</xref>). Pseudoprogression is most likely induced by a pronounced local tissue reaction with an inflammatory component, edema, and abnormal vessel permeability causing new or increased contrast enhancement on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations. Pseudoprogression may occur in up to 20% of patients treated with CCRT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-12-0477C2">2</xref>). Since the accuracy of histopathologic diagnosis depends on representative sampling of tissue, sampling errors may occur, and pseudoprogression involving the residual infiltration of tumor cells can be erroneously interpreted by the pathologist as tumor progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-12-0477C3">3</xref>). Therefore, therapeutic strategies are needed that depend on both the interpretation of MRI findings and clinical manifestations. Recently, advanced imaging techniques, including fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography, MR spectroscopy, and MR diffusion-weighted or diffusion-tensor imaging, have shown variable success in distinguishing treatment-related change from true tumor progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-12-0477C4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-12-0477C7">7</xref>).</p>
         <p>The increase in size or development of new enhancing lesions in patients with both early tumor progression and pseudoprogression may fulfill the updated conventional MR criteria for worsening disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-12-0477C8">8</xref>). Current MRI techniques can evaluate tumor vascularity more easily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-12-0477C9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-12-0477C13">13</xref>), especially since vascular proliferation is an essential diagnostic feature of GBM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-12-0477C14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-12-0477C15">15</xref>). Thus, dynamic susceptibility-weighted contrast-enhanced (DSC) and arterial spin labeling (ASL) perfusion MRI have made possible hemodynamic measurements within the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-12-0477C9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-12-0477C13">13</xref>). Several studies have assessed the ability of DSC perfusion MRI to differentiate tumor progression from radiation necrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-12-0477C16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-12-0477C20">20</xref>). To our knowledge there have been no studies objectively comparing ASL and DSC perfusion MRI in GBM patients receiving post-surgical CCRT to differentiate tumor progression from pseudoprogression. ASL perfusion MRI is a non-invasive technique for measuring tissue perfusion (blood flow), which uses magnetically labeled arterial blood water protons as an endogenous tracer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-12-0477C21">21</xref>). Practical advantages of ASL perfusion MRI are insensivity to susceptibility artifacts, the immediate availability of these images, low cost and low risk of nephrogenic systemic sclerosis, and the ease of quantification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-12-0477C21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-12-0477C22">22</xref>). We therefore assessed the added value and diagnostic performance of ASL perfusion MRI, compared with DSC imaging alone, in distinguishing early tumor progression and pseudoprogression in patients with newly diagnosed GBM.</p>

            <title>Patient population</title>
            <p>A review of our institutional database identified 117 consecutive patients with pathologically proven GBM treated from October 2008 to July 2011. Sixty-two of these patients: (a) were newly diagnosed with a primary GBM (without transformed low-grade or anaplastic glioma) based on MR findings in the brain; (b) had undergone surgical resection, with a diagnosis of GBM confirmed histopathologically; (c) had received postsurgical CCRT; (d) had subsequently demonstrated new or progressively enlarged enhancing lesions within the radiation field, as indicated by first follow-up MR images, including ASL and DSC perfusion MRI, within 4 weeks after the end of CCRT; and (e) had undergone surgical resection of these enhancing tissues or adequate clinical–radiologic follow-up, distinguishing early tumor progression from pseudoprogression. All patients received 6000 cGy of radiation therapy fractionated into dosages of 200 cGy per day over approximately 6 weeks. All patients initially received a standard regimen of temozolomide (Temodar; Schering-Plough, Kenilworth, NJ, USA), consisting of 75 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/day followed by six cycles of 150 mg/m<sup>2</sup> for 5 days every 28 days. When clinically indicated, decisions were made to either continue temozolomide or switch to an alternative chemotherapeutic regimen, based on each patient's clinical manifestations, the onset of development of enhancing lesions, patterns of contrast enhancement, general health status, and perfusion MR images. MRI follow-up was performed at intervals of 2 to 3 months.</p>
            <p>Early tumor progression was confirmed on pathologic analysis (<italic>n</italic> = 14) or as a steady increase on subsequent contrast-enhanced MRI (<italic>n</italic> = 20). Pseudoprogression was also confirmed from pathologic analysis after second-look surgery (<italic>n</italic> = 5) due to neurologic compromise, or by the diminishment or resolution of features of previously enhancing lesions on regular follow-up MRI (<italic>n</italic> = 23). There were 37 men (mean age, 51.0 years; range, 22–79 years) and 25 women (mean age, 46.7 years; range, 22–69 years), with an overall mean age of 49.3 years (range, 22–79 years).</p>
            <p>This retrospective study was approved by our local institutional review board, and prior written informed consent for routine brain tumor MRI protocols was obtained from all patients.</p>

            <title>Imaging protocol</title>
            <p>MRI was performed using a 3-T system (Achieva; Philips Medical Systems, Best, The Netherlands) with an eight-channel sensitivity encoding head coil. Our conventional MRI protocol included transverse T2-weighted fast spin-echo imaging, transverse T1-weighted spin-echo imaging, conventional T2*-weighted gradient-echo imaging, diffusion-weighted spin-echo imaging, and contrast-enhanced transverse, sagittal, and coronal T1-weighted spin-echo imaging. The parameters for transverse T2-weighted fast spin-echo images were: repetition time (TR) msec/echo time (TE) msec, 3000/80; field of view (FOV), 20 cm; section thickness, 5 mm; matrix, 348 × 270; and acquisition time, 1 min 54 s. The parameters for transverse T1-weighted spin-echo images were: TR/TE, 475/10 msec; FOV, 20 cm; section thickness, 5 mm; matrix, 256 × 190; and acquisition time, 3 min 42 s. The parameters for diffusion-weighted images were TR/TE, 3804/46 msec; FOV, 22 cm; section thickness, 5 mm; matrix, 128 × 126; and acquisition time, 1 min 17 s. Contrast-enhanced transverse, sagittal, and coronal T1-weighted spin-echo images (TR/TE, 450–495/10 msec; FOV, 20–22 cm; section thickness, 5 mm) were obtained after administration of 0.1 mmol of gadopentetate dimeglumine (Magnevist; Bayer Schering Pharma AG, Berlin, Germany) per kg body weight.</p>
            <p>DSC perfusion MRI was performed using a gradient-echo echo-planar sequence during the administration of a standard 0.1 mmol/kg dose of gadopentetate dimeglumine (Magnevist; Bayer Schering Pharma AG, Berlin, Germany) at a rate of 4 mL/s with an MRI compatible power injector (Spectris; Medrad, Pittsburgh, PA, USA), followed by a 20-mL bolus of saline, injected at the same rate. The detailed imaging parameters for DSC perfusion MRI were: TR/TE, 1407/40 msec; flip angle, 35°; FOV, 24 cm; matrix, 128 × 128, with a total acquisition time of 1 min 30 s, and performed using the same section orientations as for conventional MRI, covering the entire tumor volume.</p>

            <title>ASL data acquisition</title>
            <p>Inflowing blood was labeled by signal targeting using alternating radiofrequency pulses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-12-0477C23">23</xref>). A gradient-echo sequence with pulsed STAR labeling of arterial regions (PULSAR) was used for multislice imaging acquisition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-12-0477C24">24</xref>). Imaging parameters were TR/TE, 3000/13 msec; labeling time, 1700 msec; labeling width, 130 mm; gap between the proximal slice and the labeling slab, 20 mm; vascular crushing, no; acquisition matrix, 64 × 59; acquisition voxel size, 3.44 × 3.67 × mm; reconstruction matrix, 128 × 128; reconstruction voxel size, 1.72 × 1.72 × 6 mm; FOV, 220 × 220 × 104 mm, 15 slices with 6-mm thickness and 1-mm slice gap; scan orientation, transverse; slice scan order, ascend; SENSE factor, 2.3; half scan factor, 0.645; scan time, 5 min. To map cerebral blood flow (CBF), acquired EPI data were realigned and resliced to correct for motion of the subject's brain using Statistical Parametric Mapping – version 5 (SPM5, Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, London, UK) software. The ASL data processing toolbox was used to map CBF, assuming a single compartment of the brain for each subject (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-12-0477C25">25</xref>).</p>

            <title>Imaging processing and analyses</title>
            <p>To assess the added value of qualitative ASL perfusion MRI to DSC perfusion and conventional MRI for differentiating early tumor progression from pseudoprogression, we performed two consecutive reviews blinded to clinical and histopathologic findings. Two review sessions were spaced 4 weeks apart to avoid recall bias. In the first review, two neuroradiologists with 8 and 5 years of experience in neuroimaging were given conventional MRI and DSC perfusion MRI. In the second review, the same two neuroradiologists were given conventional MRI and DSC perfusion MRI with adjunctive ASL perfusion MRI.</p>
            <p>The tumor perfusion grade on ASL perfusion MRI was semi-quantitively assessed, with findings compared in groups with early tumor progression and pseudoprogression. The highest perfusion area of ASL perfusion MRI results were interpreted based on the appearance of normal vessels and gray and white matter perfusion by direct visual comparison while blinded to early tumor progression or pseudoprogression. Lesions were graded by tumor perfusion signal intensity (gTP) into those equal to white matter (grade I), gray matter (grade II), and blood vessels (grade III). These perfusion grades on ASL were correlated with the histogram parameters (range and maximum) derived from DSC perfusion MR images. The range represented the width of the interval and the maximum represented normalized CBV value of the maximum frequency in a set of normalized CBV data on histogram. These images were transferred from the scanner to an independent personal computer with perfusion parametric maps obtained using a dedicated software package (NordicICE; NordicNeuroLab, Bergen, Norway). After eliminating recirculation of contrast agents with gamma-variate curve fitting, we computed the relative CBV by numeric integration of the curve. On a pixel-by-pixel basis, the normalized maps were calculated by dividing every relative CBV value by a CBV value for unaffected white matter, as defined by same neuroradiologist with 8 years of experience in neuroimaging. These normalized CBV maps were displayed as color overlays on postcontrast T1-weighted images. Regions of interest defining the enhancing lesions on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images were manually drawn on a selected representative imaging section, which is highest perfusion area of the tumor by the same neuroradiologist, avoiding vessels, areas of necrosis and the cystic portions of lesions, and were applied to spatially registered normalized CBV maps from DSC perfusion MRI. The tumor size of each enhancing lesion was generated by measuring maximum diameter over all regions of interest defined on individual sections of pretreatment MRI. As described in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-12-0477C26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-12-0477C27">27</xref>), histograms were generated by means of classiﬁcation of the normalized CBVs in each region of interest into a predeﬁned number of bins. The interval between the minimum and maximum pixel values was divided into 108 equally spaced bins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-12-0477C26">26</xref>). The number of pixels corresponding to each bin was counted, and frequency counts were plotted as a function of the bin locations. The perfusion characteristics of the contrast-enhanced lesions on posttreatment MR images were assessed by means of measuring the range and maximum. The range indicated the histogram width and could represent the heterogeneous distribution of the degree of the normalized CBV. The maximum indicated the normalized CBV value of the maximum frequency, might provide insight into the dominant pathologic type for post-treatment contrast-enhancing lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-12-0477C17">17</xref>).</p>

            <title>Statistical analysis</title>
            <p>Patient age at diagnosis, sex, ASL grade, range and maximum derived from DSC, tumor size, degree of resection, and Karnofsky performance scale (KPS) in patients with early tumor progression and pseudoprogression were statistically compared using unpaired t-tests or Chi-square tests. Factors, including age, sex, degree of resection, initial tumor size, KPS, and ASL grade, were tested singly to determine those that could be used to distinguish between the two groups in univariate logistic regression analysis. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to investigate relationships between type of disease (early tumor progression or pseudoprogression) and each ASL grade after adjustment for the other variables. Difference in value of maximum and range derived from DSC according to ASL grades were determined by one-way ANOVA. A receiver-operating characteristic curve was constructed to differentiate early tumor progression from pseudoprogression according to ASL grade. The McNemar test was used to assess whether ASL results could enhance the value of DSC perfusion MRI in the qualitative diagnoses. All statistical analyses were performed with statistical software (SPSS, version 19.0, SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA; MedCalc, version 9.0, MedCalc Software, Mariakierke, Belgium). A <italic>P</italic> value &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p>

         <title>Discussion</title>
         <p>We determined whether the addition of qualitatively review of ASL and semi-quantitatively assessed tumor perfusion grade on ASL increased the ability of DSC perfusion MRI to differentiate between early tumor progression and pseudoprogression in patients with newly diagnosed GBM. Our results indicated that adjunctive ASL perfusion MRI could enhance the differential diagnosis compared with DSC perfusion MRI alone. The diagnostic accuracy, specificity, and positive predictive value of adjunctive qualitative assessment of ASL perfusion MRI plus DSC perfusion were higher than those of DSC perfusion MRI alone. Adjunctive qualitative assessment of ASL produced four fewer false-positive and false-negative results than DSC perfusion MRI alone. Semi-quantitative analysis showed that ASL grade differed significantly between patients with early tumor progression and pseudoprogression. Moreover, we observed significant differences in the maximum and range of DSC perfusion histogram parameters according to ASL grade. Qualitative visual assessment of ASL and DSC perfusion MRI are available immediately after acquisition, with only minimal postprocessing, an advantage in clinical settings. Our finding, that combined ASL and DSC perfusion MRI, could reliably differentiate early tumor progression from pseudoprogression. Therefore, improving the diagnostic accuracy compared with DSC perfusion MRI alone, has important diagnostic and prognostic implications.</p>
         <p>Vascular hyperproliferation and necrosis are diagnostic features differentiating GBM from low-grade glioma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-12-0477C14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-12-0477C15">15</xref>). Both DSC and ASL perfusion MR techniques may be of value in assessing tumor grade based on neovascularity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-12-0477C9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-12-0477C13">13</xref>) with the two methods showing a close correlation in determining blood flow in brain tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-12-0477C28">28</xref>). Similar to untreated GBM, tumor recurrences are characterized by vascular proliferation manifested as elevated tumor vasculature density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-12-0477C29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-12-0477C31">31</xref>). Whereas, after antiangiogenic therapy, recurrence is seen by increases in high signal intensity on T2-weighted images without accompanying prominent enhancement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-12-0477C32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-12-0477C33">33</xref>). Histopathologically, pseudoprogression is quite different, being characterized by extensive fibrinoid necrosis, vascular dilation, and endothelial injury of the surrounding normal cerebral vasculature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-12-0477C34">34</xref>). Although perfusion MRI has been used to differentiate tumor progression from radiation necrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-12-0477C16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-12-0477C20">20</xref>), those studies focused primarily on DSC rather than ASL perfusion MRI. Because radiation therapy has been shown to induce breakdown of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) and vascular leakage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-12-0477C35">35</xref>), quantitative analyses of astrocytomas have also documented that rCBV derived from DSC perfusion MRI is reduced after radiotherapy and that this reduction is dose-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-12-0477C36">36</xref>). Moreover, intratumoral susceptibility artifacts due to hemorrhage (deoxyhemoglobin, hemosiderin deposition) resulted in falsely low sensitivity on DSC perfusion MRI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-12-0477C37">37</xref>). ASL perfusion MRI may be better for assessing perfusion in GBM because it is theoretically less likely to be affected by BBB breakdown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-12-0477C28">28</xref>) and is not based on susceptibility effects. In ASL perfusion MRI, water is used as a freely diffusible intrinsic tracer, and the method is non-invasive and does not require exogenous contrast media. Arterial blood outside the imaging section is labeled using an inversion pulse. After transit from the labeling region to the imaging section, blood spins exchange with water in tissue at the capillaries. Subtracting a control, unlabeled image results in only transported magnetization, resulting in a perfusion-weighted image. Other important practical advantages of ASL perfusion MRI are the immediate availability of these images, its low cost and low risk of nephrogenic systemic sclerosis, and the ease of quantification without extensive postprocessing. The ASL perfusion MR technique has several limitations, however, including its lower spatial resolution and longer scan time than that of DSC perfusion MRI.</p>
         <p>Previous preliminary study demonstrated that, compared with CBV derived from DSC perfusion MRI, ASL perfusion MRI may more accurately distinguish predominant recurrent high-grade glioma from radiation necrosis after radiation therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-12-0477C20">20</xref>). Although that analysis was quantitative, it had several limitations, including a small sample size, the acquisition of only one ASL image slice per patient, a lack of standardization of chemotherapy or radiation therapy, and heterogeneous WHO grades of gliomas. To date, no objective comparisons of multi-slice ASL with DSC perfusion MRI in homogeneous GBM patients group following postsurgical standardized CCRT have shown the value of ASL perfusion MRI.</p>
         <p>Our study had several limitations, including the small number of patients. Prospective analysis of these techniques in GBM patients treated with more homogeneous CCRT regimens will be necessary to validate our results. Second, we did not analyze for confounding variables in exploring the relationships among post-treatment pathologic type, ASL grade, and histogram parameters after adjustment. Third, our qualitative analysis did not reveal a significant difference in the overall diagnostic accuracy of DSC imaging <italic>versus</italic> adjunctive ASL perfusion MRI. However, semi-quantitative analysis showed that the diagnostic accuracy of DSC MRI alone was 75.8%, whereas the addition of ASL perfusion MRI increased the accuracy to 88.7%.</p>
         <p>In conclusion, the combination of ASL and DSC perfusion MRI may improve the diagnostic accuracy in differentiating between pseudoprogression and early tumor progression in patients with post-treatment GBM. The combined application of these two methods is feasible as part of routine follow-up brain tumor imaging protocols.</p>
