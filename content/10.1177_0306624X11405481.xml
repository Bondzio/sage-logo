<abstract>
<p>This article examines the political and legal barriers to introducing restorative justice (RJ) in Hong Kong. It argues that the processes involved in RJ may be in conflict with the rule of law, which is regarded by the citizens of Hong Kong as sacrosanct in their resistance to the “mainlandization” of criminal justice practices after China resumed sovereignty of Hong Kong. It is argued that, because it could admit such potentially harmful Chinese criminal justice concepts as “rule by the people,” “absence of the presumption of innocence,” “leniency for self-confession and severity for resistance,” and “toeing the party line,” RJ would be devoid of any restorative substance and could breach the principles of due process.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>There is no consensus on a definition of restorative justice (RJ), but three main principles lie at the heart of a restorative approach to justice. The first is the participation of those most affected by the events and to some extent empowering them to take responsibility for decisions about how matters will be resolved; this includes offenders, victims of the offense, and members of the community who have been affected by the offending. The second is a focus on acknowledging the harm that was done and, to the extent that is possible, developing a plan to help to repair the harm, such as apologizing to the victim, returning stolen money, or doing community service. The third is to work toward the reintegration of the offenders and those affected by the offending into the community by ensuring that they have the support and help that they need to become constructive members of the society. Consequently, social institutions, such as the family, school, workplace, and neighborhood, are transformed into constructive social units for the reintegration of victims and offenders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0306624X11405481">McCold, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0306624X11405481">Morris, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0306624X11405481">Skelton &amp; Sekhonyane, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0306624X11405481">Sullivan &amp; Tifft, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0306624X11405481">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0306624X11405481">Van Ness, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0306624X11405481">Zehr &amp; Toews, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>One of the first examples of the use of RJ in the context of a modern society occurred in New Zealand with the adoption of new legislation that created the practice of family group conferences (FGCs) for young offenders. The FGC is a meeting arranged by a trained facilitator, which brings together all the members of the family with the victim/s of the young offenders and a representative of the police to discuss what happened and hear the stories of those involved. The next stage of the FGC is to develop a plan that aims to make amends to those hurt by the offending and to assist the young person and his or her family to have their needs met in ways that reduce the likelihood of further offending (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0306624X11405481">Maxwell &amp; Liu, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0306624X11405481">Maxwell &amp; Morris, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Today, many jurisdictions have adopted the use of such conferences as a way of resolving offending by young people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0306624X11405481">Miers, 2001</xref>). For instance, South Australia introduced the first statutory-based conferencing scheme in 1994 under the Young Offenders Act 1993 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0306624X11405481">Daly, 2003</xref>). In Queensland, a youth justice conference has been available since 1996 under the Juvenile Justice Act 1992 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0306624X11405481">Chui, Kidd, &amp; Preston, 2005</xref>). In England and Wales, a new referral order, with strong influence from RJ thinking, has been available nationwide since April 2002. Young people receiving such a referral order are obliged to attend meetings of the Young Offender Panel, which will prescribe an agreed-on program of behavior with the participation of victims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0306624X11405481">Dignan, 2005a</xref>). In Singapore, family conferencing was piloted in 1994 and formalized in 2001 under the amended Children and Young Persons Act (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0306624X11405481">Chan, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0306624X11405481">Magnus, Lim, Mesenas, &amp; Thean, 2003</xref>). In Macau, restorative conferencing was introduced in 2007 for the rehabilitation of young offenders. The question that is the focus of this article, therefore, is why a similar system has not been adopted in Hong Kong.</p>

<sec id="section2-0306624X11405481">
<title>The Juvenile Justice System of Hong Kong</title>
<p>The age of criminal responsibility in Hong Kong is 10 years. Teenagers between 10 and 15 years of age who have committed a criminal offense other than homicide are tried in a juvenile court. The options available to the juvenile court are unconditional discharge, conditional discharge of the offender on his or her entering into a recognizance, fine, confiscation of equipment and money related to the crime, compensation order, hospital order, supervision order, and care or protection order, as well as a limited number of community and custodial penalties. The community sentence is of the traditional type, including probation and/or a community-service order. The custodial options are probation home, reformatory school, rehabilitation center, detention center, drug-addiction treatment center, training center, and youth prison. The only preprosecution diversion program for young people under the age of 18 is the police superintendents’ discretion scheme, that is, police cautioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0306624X11405481">Chui &amp; Lo, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In 1998, the Law Reform Commission of Hong Kong began a review of the law governing the age of criminal responsibility (then 7 years) and the presumption of doli incapax. The commission published a consultation paper to collect public opinions on what should be the appropriate age at which a person should be held accountable for his or her offending. The commission found that public opinions were inclined to support a raise of the age of criminal responsibility. However, because it will no longer be possible to prosecute children below the age of criminal responsibility, it is important to ensure that adequate and appropriate measures alternative to prosecution are available. Thus, during the amendment of the related ordinance, the government also aimed to ensure that adequate alternative measures to prosecution could be put in place to handle unruly children and young people. Against this background, the government commissioned a team from City University of Hong Kong to conduct research on this subject, without specific intention to adopt RJ as a justice measure. However, the resulting report from City University recommended that FGC be used as pre- and postsentence measures for young offenders aged between 10 and 17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0306624X11405481">Lo, Wong, &amp; Maxwell, 2003</xref>). The purpose would be to involve those most affected by the offending in developing a plan that would respond to offending in ways that make the young person accountable for what he or she has done, repair the harm to victims, and prevent further offending. However, no action has yet been taken by the government on these recommendations.</p>

<title>Is Hong Kong Ready for RJ?</title>
<p>In Hong Kong, RJ plays no part in the criminal justice system. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0306624X11405481">Young (2008)</xref> contends, “While much literature now exists on restorative justice, it has yet to be generally accepted in Hong Kong sentencing law, nor has the legislature enacted provisions aimed at furthering restorative justice” (p. 177). In New Zealand, a strong element that led to the development of the FGC was Maori traditional practice, where the <italic>whanau</italic> (extended family) would meet to resolve disputes through consensus. In Hong Kong, the Chinese values underpinning social and family life are also consistent with both the principles and processes underpinning RJ, which emphasize the involvement of family and community in taking responsibility to respond to conflict. The Chinese cultural heritage of Hong Kong emphasizes collectivism in society or communitarianism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0306624X11405481">Braithwaite, 1989</xref>). Although the small apartments are not able to house the multigenerational and extended family, the tradition of conflicts being resolved in the families or communities where they arose, rather than in courts of law, is still remembered and practiced as part of the culture.</p>
<p>In the late 1990s, social workers of Hong Kong began to learn the concept of RJ through their contacts with overseas counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0306624X11405481">Hong Kong Federation of Youth Groups, 1998</xref>). Since then, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) have been experimenting with the use of RJ through small community projects. For instance, based on the concepts of RJ, a Harmony School Project was implemented in primary and secondary schools to tackle school bullying. It concluded that, for restorative approaches to succeed in reducing school bullying, the necessary and important strategies were a firm commitment of management to restorative goals, positive attitudes of school management, high involvement of teachers and parents, peace education on the curriculum, and peer-mediation training for students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0306624X11405481">Wong, Ngan, Cheng, &amp; Ma, 2007</xref>). Another NGO also experimented with restorative conferences for juveniles who were under police cautioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0306624X11405481">Ho et al., 2007</xref>), and the result was encouraging. The juveniles who went through mediation and a restorative conference understood more about their own faults and the feelings of their victims. Furthermore, a survey conducted through the University of Hong Kong found that 88.9% of 333 respondents of various age groups supported the use of restorative practices and related approaches in Hong Kong (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0306624X11405481">Lee, 2008</xref>). The United Nations International Crime Victim Survey found that, although slightly more than half of the 2,000 Hong Kong respondents expressed that they would be very or somewhat willing to resolve a dispute out of court and use an informal process involving third parties, a smaller proportion, just more than one third, “believed that negotiations between victims and offenders are useful alternatives to the court system” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0306624X11405481">Broadhurst, Bacon-Shone, Bouhours, Lee, &amp; Zhong, 2010</xref>, p. 40).</p>
<p>Although Hong Kong has a relatively high level of collectivism and sufficient experiences of restorative practices outside the criminal justice system, why is it lagging behind its Eastern and Western counterparts in introducing RJ? This article argues that political and legal considerations, not social and cultural considerations, are influential in deciding whether RJ has a role to play in Hong Kong’s criminal justice system. Since the return of the territory to China in 1997, Hong Kong has attempted to retain and develop a legal system based on principles that are consistent both with its past as a British colony and with its ongoing position as part of the international community. The best shield against the arbitrary use of power so often witnessed in China is the upholding of the rule of law that Hong Kong citizens cherish so much. Thus, the development of RJ is hampered by the citizens’ overwhelming emphasis on the rule of law.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0306624X11405481">
<title>Why the Rule of Law Is Regarded as Sacrosanct in Hong Kong</title>
<p>The rule of law is the principle that governmental authority is legitimately exercised only in accordance with written, publicly disclosed legal codes that are adopted and enforced in accordance with established procedures. The principle is intended to be a safeguard against arbitrary governance and to protect the interests and rights of all individuals so that no individual is above the law (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0306624X11405481">Neumann, 2002</xref>). To put the rule of law into practice in criminal justice, the legal system of a society should assure the following to every individual within its jurisdiction: recognition and equality before the law, not to be tried or punished twice, rights in criminal proceedings, humane treatment when deprived of liberty, no retrospective criminal laws, the right to liberty and security, the right to privacy and reputation, freedom of movement, fair hearings, and protection from torture and inhuman or degrading treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0306624X11405481">Ward &amp; Langlands, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite the lack of democracy in the form of direct election, the rule of law has been regarded as a cornerstone of Hong Kong’s success as a leading international financial center in Asia and a gateway to China. The rights and freedom of the citizens have been protected, the independence of the judiciary has been upheld, and the capitalist way of life in Hong Kong has been maintained. All these indicate that the rule of law worked very well before the resumption of the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong by the People’s Republic of China in 1997 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0306624X11405481">Chui &amp; Lo, 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0306624X11405481">Jones (2007)</xref>, explained why the rule of law was essential for the British colonial administration:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The introduction of the rule of law probably owed as much to the realpolitik of the colonial rule as the “civilizing mission”—experience elsewhere had taught the Colonial Office that the best means of establishing the pax Britannica was by attaching the native population to colonial rule through rule of law and associated institutions. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0306624X11405481">Jones, 2007</xref>, p. 3)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It is quite true that democracy and rule of law are twins in some developed countries, but in Hong Kong, where the citizens know they have no democracy, the rule of law becomes most valuable. In the following, these two concepts will be examined with reference to the political and legal context of Hong Kong.</p>
<sec id="section5-0306624X11405481">
<title>The Absence of Democracy</title>
<p>Hong Kong was a British colony between 1842 and 1997, governed by the British-appointed governor.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0306624X11405481">1</xref></sup> Britain handed Hong Kong back to China as a special administrative region on July 1, 1997. The Sino–British Joint Declaration guaranteed that Hong Kong would maintain high-level autonomy and retain its capitalist system for 50 years under the model of “one country, two systems.” Under the Basic Law, the miniconstitution of Hong Kong, the governor was replaced by a locally elected but Beijing-appointed chief executive, and the criminal justice system continued, together with the political, legal, economic, and social systems.</p>
<p>After the close of the negotiations with China over Hong Kong’s future, when Britain knew it would no longer keep Hong Kong as a colony after 1997, the British colonial administration surprisingly introduced direct election to 24 of the 57 seats in the Legislative Council in 1985 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0306624X11405481">Miners, 1986</xref>). However, this move was described as a democratic trick played by the British, in that it was actually handing over power to Hong Kong citizens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0306624X11405481">Hicks, 1987</xref>). Immediately after the crackdown on the democratic movement in Beijing in 1989, symbolized by the events in Tiananmen Square, the colonial administration tried to speed up the process and widen the scope of political reform in Hong Kong. However, there were warnings and refusals by the Chinese government against any hurried moves toward democratic reforms before 1997. In fact, China opposed any reforms that would establish a democratic government emphasizing representation, human rights, and freedoms, even though China had promised a high degree of autonomy for Hong Kong. To China, the problem of Hong Kong was mainly one of sovereignty and not human rights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0306624X11405481">Lee, 1987</xref>), and thus, its old colonial political system was ideal because of the great concentration of power in the hands of the chief executive and the civil service, with few checks and balances.</p>
<p>Against this backdrop, it is not surprising to see that political development was restrained when Hong Kong returned to China in 1997. According to the Basic Law, the chief executive is selected by a 400-member selection committee drawn from broad social, political, and business groupings, but the majority are pro-Beijing organizations. The number of legislators elected by universal suffrage was limited to 20, or one third of the total of 60 legislators, by the time British rule ended, with the rest of the 40 legislators elected by functional constituencies or an election committee.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0306624X11405481">2</xref></sup> This structure guarantees that Beijing’s influence is dominant and the government line is followed in major political decisions. China can easily influence affairs in Hong Kong under the pretext or mirage of high-level autonomy. Without direct election of the chief executive and the majority of the legislators, Hong Kong’s basic right to representative government has been dismissed. The political reforms China promised to Britain made no provision at all for the monopoly of executive power to be shared with a representative legislature, which Hong Kong citizens thought would help to check the abuse of power by an oppressive and tyrannical communist regime after the bloodshed of Tiananmen. Thus, the citizens could vote anyway they wished, but the outcome was irrelevant because China was going to be in charge.</p>
<p>Since the transfer of sovereignty, Hong Kong’s political development has not been progressive. The calls for universal suffrage by the citizens have not been addressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0306624X11405481">Ma, 2007</xref>). They remain worried that Beijing will interfere with the internal affairs of Hong Kong and tighten its control over political activities.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0306624X11405481">
<title>Mainlandization of Hong Kong’s Legal System</title>
<p>In recent years, Hong Kong has experienced a process of mainlandization of its political, economic, and legal systems. In this article, mainlandization is defined as follows:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>[The] policy of making Hong Kong politically more dependent on Beijing, economically more reliant on the Mainland’s support, socially more patriotic toward the motherland, and legally more reliant on the interpretation of the Basic Law by the PRC National People’s Congress. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0306624X11405481">Lo, 2007</xref>, p. 186)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The Hong Kong legal system is closely modeled on the English common law system, modified slightly by traditional Chinese laws and customs. One important feature of the common law system is its stress on the rule of law and the existence of a judiciary free from executive influences and other political and/or personal pressures. Although both the Sino–British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law assure that there shall be an independent judiciary in Hong Kong after 1997, Article 160 of the Basic Law confers on the standing committee of China’s National People’s Congress (NPC) the power to decide whether any existing law in Hong Kong contravenes the Basic Law. This was criticized as compromising the authority and independence of the Hong Kong courts after the transfer of sovereignty. A survey of senior barristers in the early 1990s found that very few of them aspired to join the judiciary, mainly because of their concern over judicial independence after 1997 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0306624X11405481">Amnesty International, 1994</xref>). Subsequently, it has occasionally appeared that the rule of law has been fiercely challenged. The following two examples illustrate the reasons behind the concern of Hong Kong citizens.</p>
<sec id="section7-0306624X11405481">
<title>Example 1: Who is the boss—Hong Kong’s Court of Final Appeal or Beijing’s NPC?</title>
<p>As the power of interpretation of the Basic Law rests with the NPC, China’s lawmaking body, members of prodemocratic groups and legal community believe that the independence of Hong Kong’s judiciary and common law system has been under threat. The legal profession, in particular, has reacted strongly to any move by the governments in Hong Kong or Beijing to dilute judicial autonomy of Hong Kong (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0306624X11405481">Lo, 2007</xref>). Since 1997, there have been three cases in which the NPC interpreted the Basic Law. The first and most-controversial case occurred in mid-1999. The Court of Final Appeal of Hong Kong, which replaced the Privy Council in London after the change of sovereignty, determined that mainland-born children with Hong Kong parents who arrived in Hong Kong without proper documents should have the right of abode in Hong Kong. The Court of Final Appeal further ruled that</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Hong Kong courts can interfere with acts of the NPC if they breach the Basic Law. Interpretation of the Basic Law is to be carried out by the Court of Final Appeal, not the NPC, if the main issue in the case is within Hong Kong’s autonomy. The Court of Final Appeal, not the NPC, will decide whether a case should be referred to the NPC. Courts should be reluctant to allow restrictions to be imposed on human rights enshrined in the Basic Law. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0306624X11405481">Buddle, 1999</xref>, p. 1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The Beijing government was angry over the verdict because it challenged the NPC’s powers and supreme status. Consequently, the Hong Kong government requested the NPC to interpret the Basic Law concerning the right of abode of this group and the NPC’s ruling was in favor of the government. This served as a serious blow to the legal community of Hong Kong because the Court’s finality was overridden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0306624X11405481">Lo, 2007</xref>) and Hong Kong citizens began to worry about the courts’ reluctance to rule against the Hong Kong government.</p>
<p>In the second case, the NPC interpreted the Basic Law regarding the direct elections of the chief executive and the legislative council in 2004. The third case concerned whether the successor to the first chief executive, Tung Chee-hwa, who resigned due to ill health in 2005, would serve the remainder of his period in office or a full 5-year term. Hong Kong citizens in general felt unease about the NPC’s interpretation of the Basic Law in these two cases. The decision in the third case prompted about 900 members of the legal profession to protest against the NPC’s move to interpret the Basic Law, and they reiterated that the Court of Final Appeal should not be deprived of the right to interpret the Basic Law (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0306624X11405481">Lo, 2007</xref>), indicating another clash between Beijing officials and Hong Kong’s defenders of the rule of law, who have tried to minimize Hong Kong’s legal convergence with mainland China.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0306624X11405481">
<title>Example 2: Article 23—The National Security Law</title>
<p>Patriotism is well advocated and upheld in communist China. To support patriotic values, the government takes action along two lines. The first is the education of officials and students. The second is through the criminal law. China’s criminal law stipulates clearly the kinds of crime that endanger national security, known as counterrevolutionary crimes in the old version of the law. All Chinese people, especially members of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and government cadres, are required to stand in line with the CCP and fight against any counterrevolutionary crimes to safeguard territorial integrity, national union, and independence under a one-party socialist state controlled by the CCP. Thus, “toeing the party line” in response to crimes against the state or counterrevolutionary crimes is one of the working principles in China’s criminal justice system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0306624X11405481">Davidson &amp; Wang, 2000</xref>). This led Hong Kong citizens to be concerned with how national security would be interpreted and applied in the city.</p>
<p>Incidentally, there was a need to enact a national security law in Hong Kong, laid down in Article 23 of the Basic Law, to outlaw treason, secession, sedition, and subversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0306624X11405481">Lo, 2007</xref>). Its citizens expressed grave concerns that their civil liberties would continue to be mainlandized, and this aroused public mistrust of Beijing’s increasing influence on Hong Kong’s legal system and the expansion of police power associated with the new law.</p>
<p>Treasuring the British rule-of-law tradition, the citizens have been confronted by tightening political and legal forces since 1997. Coupled with other social issues, such as high unemployment, conflict of interest by officials, and public demands for democracy and human rights, the proposed enactment of Article 23 of the Basic Law triggered public outcry and resulted in a demonstration by half a million people who marched on the streets on July 1, 2003. The mass demonstration caused the resignation of a member of the executive council and the secretary for security, and the National Security (Legislative Provisions) Bill was indefinitely postponed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0306624X11405481">Cheng, 2005</xref>). Hong Kong citizens had won the battle if not the war, temporarily protecting the existing rule of law from being mainlandized.</p>

<p>Hong Kong citizens have been worrying that some of the Chinese criminal justice concepts would seep into their legal system through the process of mainlandization, such as “rule by the people,” “toeing the party line,” “leniency for self-confession and severity for resistance,” and “the absence of the presumption of innocence” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0306624X11405481">Davidson &amp; Wang, 2000</xref>). At the same time, over the last decade numerous critics have questioned whether human rights can be protected in RJ processes (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0306624X11405481">von Hirsch, Roberts, Bottoms, Roach, &amp; Schiff, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0306624X11405481">Ward &amp; Langlands, 2008</xref>). Critics suggest that the just deserts principle conflicts with RJ values of participation, involvement, and empowerment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0306624X11405481">Ashworth, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0306624X11405481">von Hirsch, Ashworth, &amp; Shearing, 2003</xref>). To examine Hong Kong citizens’ concern about the fading rule of law, the following discussion will address some of the criticisms of RJ and its vulnerability to Chinese criminal justice practices.</p>
<sec id="section10-0306624X11405481">
<title>Conflict Between Offenders’ Rights and Collective Interests—Rule by the People and Toeing the Party Line</title>
<p>The Constitution of the People’s Republic of China adopted a system of the people’s democratic dictatorship. China is ruled by the people, and all organs are titled with “People’s,” such as the People’s National Congress, the People’s Public Security, the People’s Procuratorate, and the People’s Court. However, as the CCP is the representative of the people, all the people’s machineries, or state machineries, including the judiciary, are actually controlled by the CCP. Rule by the people is in fact “rule by the CCP.” Thus, the judiciary is not absolutely independent and its decisions are always shaped by political considerations. Although China’s Constitution ensures the independence of the court, in practice, the court is a “people’s court,” and thus, it has to literally toe the party line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0306624X11405481">Davidson &amp; Wang, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Criminal justice in China today has departed from mass-line justice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0306624X11405481">Lo, 1993</xref>) and is run through a well-defined bureaucratic process, including investigation by the public security authorities, prosecution by the procurator, and the trial and sentencing of cases by the courts. Mass education and mass mobilization are still in place, but it is now the criminal justice officials “who finally define what the masses want in the field of public security” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0306624X11405481">Wang, 2000</xref>, p. 179). In addition, communities in China have changed from traditional, informal social control to semiformal social control. The two types of control are intertwined together and are hard to distinguish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0306624X11405481">Klein &amp; Gatz, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0306624X11405481">Zhong &amp; Grabosky, 2009</xref>). However, the tradition of maintaining a network of social control comprising various types of neighborhood committees and mediation committees still exists. As social-control agents, these committees are often involved in making decisions about youth offending.</p>
<p>Restorative practice, in the name of mediation, has always been the main method to resolve disputes and conflicts in the neighborhoods of China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0306624X11405481">Di, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0306624X11405481">Lo, Maxwell, &amp; Wong, 2006</xref>). However, there is no one-size-fits-all restorative model. The Chinese model is regarded as a control-restorative model because the Chinese practice does not include fully restorative elements and the restorative outcomes are always shaped by the authority (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0306624X11405481">Lo, Wong, &amp; Maxwell, 2005</xref>). Unlike restorative models in other countries, the committees are not mandated under legislation or potentially accountable to the courts for their decisions. Thus, under the dual influences of rule by the people and toeing the party line, impartiality is difficult to maintain and the restorative ways to handle youth offending could breach the important principles of proportionality, consistency, and due process.</p>
<p>In multiethnic communities, members with multiple allegiances may have conflicted loyalties and confusion in problem resolution. Offenders could experience discrimination in restorative processes because of the special characteristics of the communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0306624X11405481">Pavlich, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0306624X11405481">Warner, 1994</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0306624X11405481">Ward and Langlands (2008)</xref> warned that relying on the community to determine the kind of reparation for offenders can violate their rights to elemental equality, social recognition, and personal security. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0306624X11405481">Dignan (2005b)</xref> further observed that many communities</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Engage in socially exclusionary practices and espouse a form of communitarianism that is not at all individual centered but authoritarian and repressive. . . . [T]he demands of the community may ride roughshod over the rights and interests of individual offenders or victims. (pp. 101-102)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This situation happens exactly in China. Due to the dominance of the people’s or the party’s interest, the protection of the public interest, rather than the defendant’s interest, is paramount (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0306624X11405481">Davidson &amp; Wang, 2000</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0306624X11405481">Di (2009)</xref> argued that</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Based on collective interests, the mediators always take advantage of all kinds of resources such as law, power, social relationships, and reputation to convince the parties, regardless of the conversation and negotiation between the parties themselves, and sometimes the mediators even overbear the parties to accept the result. (p. 2)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Thus, restorative practices may be biased because of their overemphasis on collective interest and social control. Offenders can be subject to overly harsh or inappropriately lenient treatment, and the treatment may not be proportional to the offense committed.</p>
<p>Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0306624X11405481">Di (2009)</xref> contends that “the characteristics of power are becoming more and more obvious during the continuing systematization of Chinese mediation” (p. 1). The personal social network (guanxi) is so rampant in China that penal decisions are often affected by personal relations rather than the nature of the offense. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0306624X11405481">Zhang and Liu (2004)</xref> found that the official status of individual offenders had a negative effect on the swiftness of arrest. Di argued that “the self-governing mediation organizations are powerless in face of the disputes involving government” (p. 2). Criminal justice in China is always related to power, ideology, and conflict within society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0306624X11405481">Lo, 1993</xref>). Restorative practices, because of their informality and flexibility, are particularly susceptible to the influence of personal power and persuasion, and outcomes may favor those who have close affiliations with those in power.</p>

<title>Insufficient Protection of Offenders’ Rights to Due Process—Leniency for Self-Confession and Severity for Resistance, and Absence of the Presumption of Innocence</title>
<p>China’s criminal law emphasizes the approach of leniency for self-confession and severity for resistance, which is a very popular slogan in public security departments, detention centers, and prisons. The main purpose is to terrify suspects into confessing and thus, bring about prompt termination of a criminal case. This reflects the emphasis of Chinese criminal justice on expediency and the swift capture and punishment of offenders as a means of crime control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0306624X11405481">Davidson &amp; Wang, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0306624X11405481">Trevaskes, 2010</xref>). There are provisions in the criminal law that allow for less severe charges or sentences in return for “contributions,” including initial confession, snitching, and serving as tainted witnesses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0306624X11405481">Felkenes, 1989</xref>). The problem in the Chinese criminal justice system is its emphasis on confession as superior to any other kind of evidence. Therefore, leniency for self-confession and severity for resistance works as both propaganda and a real criminal justice practice, but a practice that is likely to endanger the fairness of a trial.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0306624X11405481">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>In RJ processes, there is a possibility that youth offenders are not fully informed and thus, their freedom and autonomy to make decisions is compromised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0306624X11405481">Ward &amp; Langlands, 2008</xref>). Young people may not have the mental ability to differentiate between the kind of justice rendered in a restorative conference and in a juvenile court. Similarly, it is also difficult for them to understand their rights to due process, such as proportionality and equality before the law. Under the practice of leniency for self-confession and severity for resistance, youth offenders may be coerced to participate in restorative conferences. They may be easily persuaded because they want to avoid a court appearance, or they believe that they will receive more lenient treatment, or that they would be discriminated against or receive more serious court sanctions if they do not participate.</p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0306624X11405481">Ward and Langlands (2008)</xref> contend,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The flexibility and informality prized within the RJ system can violate offenders’ due process rights, primarily through privileging stakeholder participation and neglecting to ensure that offenders possess the basic capabilities required to make reasoned decisions concerning their lives and futures. (p. 364)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Because of the informal nature of restorative processes, there may not be sufficient opportunities for the offenders to challenge the information presented or appeal against restorative decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0306624X11405481">Skelton &amp; Sekhonyane, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0306624X11405481">Warner, 1994</xref>). There are also concerns about insufficient protection of the rights of young offenders in terms of whether they would be subject to overly harsh reparations beyond “circumscribed proportionality limits” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0306624X11405481">Ashworth, 2002</xref>, p. 591). As offenders can be driven to avoid court appearance and facing their victims to achieve restitution, they may be happy to come to certain forms of agreement that do not necessarily respect their rights. There is also the possibility that repentant offenders will agree to harsh reparations, whereas the most hard-core offenders may negotiate lighter reparations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0306624X11405481">Radzik, 2007</xref>). The proponents’ enthusiasm or overconfidence in RJ may cause them to overlook the need for safeguards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0306624X11405481">Ashworth, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0306624X11405481">Roche, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The involvement of victims in making decisions could also contravene the principle of proportionality because of the variations in victims’ views toward conference decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0306624X11405481">Ashworth, 2002</xref>) and because of the specificity of the “people involved” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0306624X11405481">Maxwell, 2007</xref>, p. 22). Such involvement could result in vengeful and disproportionate punishments due to the conflict between the empowerment of victims and the respect for offenders’ rights to autonomy or freedom. Coercion may also derive from the difficulties in reaching a solution that would satisfy the competing interests of victims and offenders, or from the power imbalances between adult victims and young offenders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0306624X11405481">Becroft &amp; Thompson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0306624X11405481">Haines, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0306624X11405481">Ward &amp; Langlands, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is observed that the presumption of innocence is a hidden concept in the criminal justice system of China because it</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Has been regarded as a manifestation of idealism and metaphysics and has been rejected in favor of a more practical or pragmatic approach, for two reasons. First, China does not wish criminals to escape penalty under a presumption of innocence. Second, China has its own guideline, the principle of “seeking truth from facts.” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0306624X11405481">Davidson &amp; Wang, 2000</xref>, p. 213)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The prevailing principle in China is “when there is a borderline case with a choice to arrest an individual or not, always choose to arrest and if there is a choice to prosecute or not, always choose to prosecute” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0306624X11405481">Trevaskes, 2010</xref>, p. 349). Thus, although China’s criminal law presumes the innocence of suspects, in actual practice, judicial personnel are inclined to presume them guilty. Suspects have to prove that they are not guilty with strong evidence. As the presumption of innocence is not fully recognized, suspects’ legal rights are often ignored and the powerless may be urged to confess to resolve the incident quickly. In this respect, the Chinese model of RJ would carry the danger of offering insufficient protection to individuals against the most powerful and the organs of government. Although Hong Kong has an independent judiciary, the above discussion reveals that the legal system of Hong Kong is increasingly influenced by mainland China, and thus, the western RJ concept is less likely to exist in any judicial model to be foisted on Hong Kong.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This article reveals the conflict between the ideals of an interesting trinity of influences all ostensibly seeking justice: British common law, Western due process, and Chinese culture. The protection of offenders’ rights to due process and the balance between offenders’ rights and collective interests might be jeopardized in mainland China and in mainlandizing Hong Kong and any societies that have not yet established the rule of law. Thus, the significance of this examination is not just to Hong Kong society but to the whole field of RJ.</p>
<p>RJ is blamed for a large number of problems that would occur completely independent of its existence and implementation. Critics are essentially concerned with creeping informalism in the context of a general erosion of legal protections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0306624X11405481">Ashworth, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0306624X11405481">von Hirsch, Ashworth, et al., 2003</xref>). However, they pay little attention to similar problems that occur in other legitimated versions or more perverse forms of informality that have existed since before RJ was even operational, such as the informalism of backroom plea bargains between prosecutor and defense attorney. Moreover, there are other programs, such as teen courts or peer courts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0306624X11405481">Butts, Buck, &amp; Coggeshall, 2002</xref>), in which decisions about diversion versus probation or detention are made on a whim with few, if any, protections of due process and many gross abuses of other human rights. At worst, RJ processes could replicate such currently existing informal processes. Nonetheless, there is no reliable evidence to show that RJ is able to wreak more havoc on human rights and due process than those other truly abusive processes that go on within and outside the criminal justice system.</p>
<p>On the contrary, experience and research confirms the value of RJ in engaging young people in acknowledging their offending, in showing remorse to their victims, and in taking action to repair the harm done. Simultaneously, families also become engaged in supporting their children. Appropriate community services are also enlisted in supporting the families and young people in ways that are likely to meet their needs and prevent reoffending. Generally, experience shows that RJ has brought benefits in repairing harm done by offending behavior, preventing reoffending, and reconstructing a harmonious community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0306624X11405481">Johnstone &amp; Van Ness, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0306624X11405481">Latimer, Dowden, &amp; Muise, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0306624X11405481">Maxwell, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0306624X11405481">McCold, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0306624X11405481">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0306624X11405481">Sherman &amp; Strang, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0306624X11405481">Sullivan &amp; Tifft, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0306624X11405481">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0306624X11405481">Umbreit, Vos, &amp; Coates, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0306624X11405481">Zehr &amp; Toews, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Taking into account the inherited weaknesses of informal justice and the effectiveness of RJ, the issue we are examining is actually not just about the problems of RJ but about the existence of a mirror effect in Hong Kong. This effect involves those living under one country, two systems, indicating that Hong Kong citizens have perceived through a mirror some Chinese criminal justice concepts or approaches that have been conveyed to them through the process of mainlandization.</p>
<p>In the absence of a well-established legal or administrative code to guide them, criminal justice decisions in China can be made and “ruled” by the people, and restorative practices would appear to vary enormously from place to place and case to case. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0306624X11405481">Trevaskes (2009)</xref> has voiced the criticism that in the recent penal reform of China, the practice of paying compensation to victims in return for a reduced sentence is a form of McDonaldization of criminal justice with Chinese characteristics, rather than a step toward achieving RJ. In toeing the party line, the Chinese criminal justice system leaves considerable room for abuse of human rights. Some of those in power can be above the law, or “more equal” before the law than others. It is difficult for ordinary people to resist the arbitrary interference by the powerful in judicial or restorative decisions, and the rights of the innocent are not always protected. The existential function of the mirror enables Hong Kong citizens to see the management of criminal justice relations in the shadow of mainland China, thus, provoking them into defending their last asset, the rule of law, which they have possessed for decades under the British administration.</p>
<p>A former chief secretary of Hong Kong, Sir David <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0306624X11405481">Akers-Jones (2004)</xref>, interpreted one country, two systems as the “superiority of our system and its proud possession of the rule of law, our freedom, our administration, our simple tax structure and our economic well-being” (p. 268). However, in recent years, the economic bargaining power of Hong Kong vis-à-vis mainland China has been rapidly losing ground, and this special administrative region of China is now “simply a Mainland Chinese city with the exception of possessing the rule of law” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0306624X11405481">Lo, 2007</xref>, pp. 221-222). Although China has been quite successful in speeding up the processes of political and economic convergence between Hong Kong and the mainland, there is strong resistance to any attempt of mainlandization of Hong Kong’s legal and judicial system. In the continued contestation by liberal groups and human rights advocates, the rule of law is amplified as a shield against any attempt to mainlandize its legal system. This has inhibited the development of RJ in the criminal justice system of Hong Kong, because its citizens suspect that any changes would leave room for manipulation of human rights under the pretext of RJ.</p>
<p>With the threat of diminishing civil liberties and judicial independence, the rule of law has been treasured in Hong Kong. Its citizens want democracy and other basic human rights to be respected and safeguarded so as to ward off dictatorial control and interference from the communist regime. Reliance on the goodwill of rulers always falls far short of a legally entrenched political system, the realization of human rights and the rule of law. Without a representative government, the rule of law would therefore provide a better bulwark against communist oppression than other alternatives. Without the rule of law, it will be impossible to sustain for long the freedoms and human rights which are now enjoyed by Hong Kong citizens and maintained by the existing status quo.</p>
<p>It is against this background that the existing legal system in Hong Kong is expected to be preserved intact and restorative practices will not be introduced in the near future. Even if additional protections against potential abuse were included in the proposals, such as the use of a Youth Court to ensure that the interests of justice are served (as in New Zealand and Australia), or to name RJ practices “restorative courts,” RJ would continue to be seen as problematic as long as mainlandization is still perceived as a threat. Because it could admit the potentially harmful Chinese criminal justice concepts of rule by the people, absence of the presumption of innocence, leniency for self-confession and severity for resistance, and toeing the party line, RJ would be devoid of any restorative substance. Thus, it is not surprising that any change in Hong Kong’s legal system can produce a real impact on civil liberties. The vibrant civil society is likely to deter any further attempt at diluting the rule of law in Hong Kong, but consequently, it will also bar the introduction of RJ.</p>

There were two advisory bodies, the Executive and Legislative Councils, comprising official and appointed unofficial members. The Executive Council functioned as the cabinet of the governor. The Legislative Council was similar to a parliament, responsible for lawmaking, scrutinizing public income and expenditure, and monitoring the work of the government.
