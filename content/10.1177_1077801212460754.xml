<abstract>
<p>Claims that violence is gender-neutral are increasingly becoming “common sense” in Canada. Antifeminist groups assert that the high rates of woman abuse uncovered by major Canadian national surveys conducted in the early 1990s are greatly exaggerated and that women are as violent as men. The production of degendered rhetoric about “intimate partner violence” contributes to claims that women’s and men’s violence is symmetrical and mutual. This article critically evaluates common claims about Canadian women’s use of nonlethal force in heterosexual intimate relationships in the context of the political struggle over the hegemonic frame for violence and abuse. The extant Canadian research documenting significant sex differences in violence and abuse against adult intimate partners is reviewed.</p>

<p>Claims that violence is gender-neutral are increasingly becoming “common sense” in Canada (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1077801212460754">Minaker &amp; Snider, 2006</xref>, p. 755). Antifeminist groups assert that the high rates of woman abuse uncovered by major Canadian national surveys conducted in the early 1990s<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1077801212460754">1</xref></sup> are greatly exaggerated and that women are as violent as men. The production of degendered rhetoric about “intimate partner violence” (IPV) contributes to claims that women’s and men’s violence is symmetrical and mutual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1077801212460754">DeKeseredy, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1077801212460754">Sinclair, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>In Canada, social problems such as violence and abuse are subject to the “politics of need interpretation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1077801212460754">Fraser, 1989</xref>, p. 292), wherein social issues are hotly contested in public discourse. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1077801212460754">Nancy Fraser (1989)</xref> argues that in late-capitalist welfare state societies, discursive struggles over social resources and power are often framed in terms of competing needs. Power struggles are played out in debates over which social issues should be framed as legitimate political concerns and which should be enclaved as nonpolitical matters. Discourses on women, men, and violence are one location where such struggles are highly visible in Canada. The objective of this article is to review some common claims about Canadian women’s use of nonlethal force in heterosexual intimate relationships in the context of the political struggle over the hegemonic frame for violence and abuse.</p>

<title>Changes in Canadian Discourses on Abuse Over Time</title>
<p>Although there has been episodic concern with violence against women throughout Canadian history, men’s physical abuse of female intimate partners has only recently become a matter of general interest. In the 1970s, an exhaustive bibliography on wife beating could be written on an index card (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1077801212460754">DeKeseredy &amp; Schwartz, 2002</xref>). Feminists in Canada worked to establish a public discourse that not only communicated the profound impact of men’s violence on individual women, but also explicitly framed woman abuse as “part of a larger problem of social inequality between men and women” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1077801212460754">Randall, 1989</xref>, p. 1).</p>
<p>Since then, scholars and advocates have produced an extensive research literature on woman abuse. One of the key outcomes of this work has been a monumental change in public discourses about woman abuse, shifting it from a private, personal issue to a political and social problem that foregrounds the experiences of abused women. What <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1077801212460754">Martin D. Schwartz and Walter DeKeseredy (1993)</xref> stated 17 years ago still holds true today: “Right now, there is an important battle being waged over the nature of women’s behavior and its role in woman abuse” (p. 249). Although many people continue to use terms such as “woman abuse,” there are also many who fervently contend that we should use degendered terms like “family violence” or IPV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1077801212460754">DeKeseredy &amp; Schwartz, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1077801212460754">H. Johnson &amp; Dawson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1077801212460754">Sinclair, 2003</xref>). Their rationale is heavily based on some Canadian national survey data, which, at first glance, show that violence in intimate, heterosexual relationships is sex-symmetrical. Others claim degendered terms are more inclusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1077801212460754">Denham &amp; Gillespie, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1077801212460754">Sinclair, 2003</xref>). Regardless of the reasons people use degendered language, it suggests that women and men are similarly affected by violence and similarly responsible for it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1077801212460754">DeKeseredy, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1077801212460754">Ellis &amp; DeKeseredy, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1077801212460754">Kurz, 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>Prior to 1970, there was no name for violence against women by intimate partners in Canada. In the mid-1970s, feminists began to talk about violence against women, created the first emergency shelters, and pushed for legal reform. In this period, antiviolence activists used the terms “wife beating” and “wife battering” to evoke the severity of the problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1077801212460754">DeKeseredy &amp; MacLeod, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1077801212460754">Walker, 1990</xref>). Feminists later adopted the term “woman abuse” to more accurately reflect the variety of behaviors that comprise abuse, and the fact that abuse extends to intimate relationships beyond marriage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077801212460754">Adams, Sullivan, Bybee, &amp; Greeson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077801212460754">DeKeseredy &amp; Schwartz, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1077801212460754">Randall, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1077801212460754">Sinclair, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1077801212460754">Stark, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Although feminists succeeded in moving the normative response to woman abuse from silence to condemnation, feminist efforts to frame men’s violence against women as a social problem in the context of patriarchy have consistently met with resistance. As early as 1977, the United Way funded a symposium on “family violence” in British Columbia. The federal government established a National Clearinghouse on Family Violence (NCFV) in 1982, and Health and Welfare Canada created the Family Violence Prevention Division in 1986. A number of Canadian researchers and commentators continue to insist upon the use of such gender-blind terms.</p>

<title>Claims About Women’s Violence Against Intimates in Canada</title>
<p>On June 26, 2002, the <italic>Globe and Mail</italic>’s web site announced: “Men as Likely to Suffer Spousal Abuse, Statscan Says” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1077801212460754">Lawlor, 2002</xref>, p. 1). The story described a study that used telephone interviews to ask a national sample of Canadians slightly modified versions of items included in the Conflict Tactics Scales (CTS). The study, Canada’s 1999 General Social Survey on Victimization (GSS), found that 8% of 14,269 women and 7% of 11,607 men reported at least one incident of intimate partner violence committed by a current or ex-spouse between 1994 and 1999 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1077801212460754">Statistics Canada, 2002</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1077801212460754">2</xref></sup> As was the case with some earlier studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1077801212460754">Jiwani, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1077801212460754">Schwartz &amp; DeKeseredy, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1077801212460754">Steinmetz, 1977-78</xref>), these results were seized upon by some journalists and antifeminist groups to support claims about an invisible epidemic of husband battering. For example, Earl Silverman from the Family of Men Support Society told the <italic>Globe and Mail</italic> that Statistics Canada’s findings show “that there has been a severe bias against men in the past not considering them as victims” and “[t]o try to deny the other side of the coin reduces the credibility of the first side” (quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1077801212460754">Foss, 2002</xref>, p. 8).</p>
<p>Statistics Canada’s 2004 GSS produced similar findings for 1999-2004, with 6% of men and 7% of women reporting being victimized by a spouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1077801212460754">Statistics Canada, 2005</xref>). This study is also used to support claims about the bidirectionality or gender-neutrality of abuse. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1077801212460754">DeKeseredy and Schwartz (2003)</xref> found that regardless of its attempt to remain relatively autonomous, Statistics Canada has indirectly contributed to making terms like spousal violence a central “part of our everyday popular lexicon.” Statscan’s recent surveys have been “appropriated and exploited by a variety of antifeminist pundits and organizations” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1077801212460754">Hammer, 2002</xref>, p. 111). For example, Donald Dutton states that, “in Canada and the United States, women use violence in intimate relationships to the same extent as men, for the same reasons, and with largely the same results” (2006, p. ix).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1077801212460754">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>In a more recent example, the NCFV’s January <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1077801212460754">2009</xref> E-Bulletin “focuses on intimate partner abuse against men, one of the least understood issues in the field of family violence.” The newsletter highlights NCFV’s report, <italic>Intimate Partner Abuse Against Men</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1077801212460754">(2004)</xref>, which emphasizes GSS data showing that:<disp-quote>
<p>[A]lmost equal proportions of men and women (7% and 8%, respectively) had been the victims of intimate partner physical and psychological abuse (18% and 19%, respectively). These findings were consistent with several earlier studies which reported equal rates of abuse by women and men in intimate relationships. (p. 1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p><italic>Intimate Partner Abuse Against Men</italic> dismisses women’s greater injuries and studies documenting other sex differences, including research distinguishing offensive and defensive violence. For example, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1077801212460754">NCFV (2004)</xref> states, “[s]ome scholars suggest that the motives for intimate partner abuse against men by women may differ from those for abuse against women by men, and that women suffer more severe injuries than men” (p. 1).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1077801212460754">4</xref></sup> Despite extensive documentation of such differences, the report characterizes women’s and men’s violence as “comparable,” and asserts that “[i]t is also important for the perpetrators of intimate partner abuse—men or women—to recognize that violence in any form is both morally and legally wrong” (p. 1).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1077801212460754">5</xref></sup> Many people would agree with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1077801212460754">Minaker and Snider (2006)</xref> who argue that:<disp-quote>
<p>[F]ocusing on “female aggressors” ignores the damaging violence men inflict on other men and on women, obscures who is doing what to whom, and undermines the ideological climate feminists struggle(d) to create, wherein instances of male domination, gender inequality, and systemic violence are called into question. (p. 756)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>NCFV’s report and the E-Bulletin on intimate partner abuse against men are contemporary examples of this dynamic. Most readers who are unfamiliar with the research on woman abuse would probably not realize that respondents were not asked questions about the context of the incidents, including whether these acts were defensive or offensive. Nor would many readers likely detect that the types of acts and outcomes reported by men and women are significantly different, or that the similar prevalence numbers are generated only when serious forms of violence, such as sexual assault and homicide, are omitted. Thus, the bar for alleged comparability is very low.</p>
<p>Definitions of violence in intimate relationships are important and warrant considerable scrutiny because of the power conveyed by scientific and political authority (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1077801212460754">Muehlenhard, Powch, Phelps, &amp; Giusti, 1992</xref>). Certainly, the ways definitions are crafted have major effects on research techniques, policies, and ultimately, the lives of many people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1077801212460754">DeKeseredy &amp; Schwartz, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1077801212460754">Ellis, 1987</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1077801212460754">Demi Kurz (1989)</xref> argues that:<disp-quote>
<p>Researchers, by providing statistical evidence documenting the extent of wife abuse, have played a critical role in making it a social issue. Social scientists have been particularly important in surveying this problem. Their statistics on the extent of battering are cited to legitimate concern in books, professional journals, and the popular press. (p. 489)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although feminists struggled to establish woman abuse as a political concern demanding public action, the contemporary use of gender-neutral language has the potential to reverse these changes by again obscuring women’s particular needs, interests, and experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1077801212460754">H. Johnson &amp; Dawson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1077801212460754">Sinclair, 2003</xref>).</p>

<title>Critiques of Research Cited to Promote Degendered Perspectives</title>
<p>In Canada, proponents of degendered conceptualizations of violence typically cite recent national government survey data generated using renditions of the CTS. Murray <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1077801212460754">Straus (1979)</xref> developed the CTS to study violence within families. Applied to violence in intimate relationships, this measure and the more recent CTS-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1077801212460754">Straus, Hamby, Boney-McCoy, &amp; Sugarman, 1996</xref>) solicit information from men and women about the various tactics they used to resolve conflicts in their relationships. Most versions of the CTS consist of at least 18 items that measure at least three different ways of handling interpersonal conflict in relationships: reasoning, verbal aggression (referred to by some researchers as psychological abuse), and violence. Although widely used, the CTS is a highly controversial measure and must be administered with caution.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1077801212460754">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Claims of sex symmetry are deceptive for several reasons. First, the 1999 and 2004 GSS conducted by Statistics Canada provide only raw counts of violent acts and thus miss the fact that much male and female violence is used for different reasons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077801212460754">DeKeseredy, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1077801212460754">Jiwani, 2000</xref>). As demonstrated by studies that add context, meaning, and motive measures to the CTS, a common cause of women’s violence is self-defense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1077801212460754">DeKeseredy, 2007</xref>), whereas men more typically use violence to control their partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1077801212460754">DeKeseredy &amp; Dragiewicz, 2007</xref>). Therefore, York University sociologist Desmond Ellis reminds us that, “[i]gnoring context, meaning and motive is misinforming … [a]nd not separating different types of violence is misleading” (quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1077801212460754">Foss, 2002</xref>, p. 2).</p>
<p>Of course, some women strike some men, sometimes with the intent to injure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1077801212460754">National Clearinghouse on Family Violence, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1077801212460754">Tutty, 1999</xref>).

<p>In addition to using GSS data and similar findings to support the claim of the bidirectionality of violence,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1077801212460754">7</xref></sup> proponents of sex symmetry artificially narrow the definition of violence between intimates to obscure injurious behaviors that display marked sex asymmetry, such as sexual assault, strangulation, separation/divorce assault, stalking, and homicide. Rather than an unacceptable or hysterical broadening of the definition of violence, these behaviors are commonly part of abused women’s experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1077801212460754">DeKeseredy &amp; Dragiewicz, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077801212460754">DeKeseredy &amp; Schwartz, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Criticisms of the CTS and data on forms of woman abuse that it does not measure are typically not recognized by supporters of gender-blind definitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1077801212460754">DeKeseredy, 2011</xref>), including Canadian politicians who were members of the 1998 Special Joint Committee on Child Custody and Access (SJC). For example, the SJC concluded that, “because of the existence of violence against men, the Committee would not recommend that family law or divorce legislation employ a gender-specific definition of family violence” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1077801212460754">Pearson &amp; Gallaway, 1998</xref>, p. 81). Prior to coming to this conclusion, the SJC had access to Canadian national survey data showing that only a distinct minority of female undergraduates reported that they had initiated a physical attack since leaving high school and that much of the violence reported by women was in self-defense or fighting back (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077801212460754">DeKeseredy &amp; Schwartz, 1998b</xref>). Walter DeKeseredy publicly presented these findings to the SJC, but they and similar results uncovered by other researchers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1077801212460754">Saunders, 1986</xref>) were not included in the SJC’s final report and they are ignored by prominent critics of feminist research on intimate violence (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077801212460754">Dutton, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1077801212460754">Mills, 2003</xref>). The marginalization of research findings documenting the differential impact of women’s and men’s violence against intimates by the SJC is one illustration of how the use of gender-neutral terms does not translate into policies that accurately reflect the research.</p>

<title>Misuse and Misinterpretation of Research</title>
<p>As Holly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1077801212460754">Johnson (2006)</xref> argues in Statistics Canada’s report, <italic>Measuring Violence Against Women: Statistical Trends 2006</italic>, “Decision-makers require a clear understanding of the nature and severity of social problems to develop effective responses” (p. 7). The preceding sections indicate that even studies cited to support symmetry claims do not find that women and men are equally victimized. Given, then, that Statistics Canada’s own research finds significant and substantive differences between women’s and men’s experiences of violence, it is necessary to ask why gender-blind discourses have been so readily adopted in Canada.</p>
<p>There are two primary contexts for the increasing use of bidirectional terms. The first is efforts to render discourses on woman abuse “gender-neutral” so that they will ostensibly be more inclusive of same-sex violence and violence against men. Although there is undoubtedly a need for more services, including those specifically targeting the different populations at risk for abuse,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1077801212460754">8</xref></sup> simply excluding gender does not make services more inclusive. For example, lesbian survivors of violence criticize the ways that some existing services for heterosexual women fail to meet their needs, advocating for materials and programs that explicitly and specifically target lesbian women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1077801212460754">Girshick, 2002</xref>). NCFV’s own discussion paper on gay men and abuse indicates that patriarchal gender norms are key impediments to effectively addressing the violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1077801212460754">Kirkland, 2004</xref>). Hence, there are calls for language and resources based on the specific needs of particular communities. Scholars and advocates working on same-sex intimate partner violence explicitly reject a generic model that obscures patriarchal and heterosexist gender norms. Instead, they most often call for an intersectional understanding of violence which recognizes “the multiple nature of identity, and the interlocking nature of systems of privilege and oppression to show how the categories of race, class, sex, gender, and sexuality rely on each other to function within systems of domination” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1077801212460754">Ristock, 2005</xref>, pp. 9-10).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1077801212460754">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Antifeminist groups claim that men’s low rate of reporting victimization to police, service providers, and medical personnel is due to the stigma of being unable to control their female partners and therefore being perceived as effeminate or gay (e.g., too similar to women). The assertion that men are less likely to report violence or abuse perpetrated by an intimate is unsupported by research. Although some studies find that men are less likely to report violence to police, this is as likely due to differences in the severity and nature of the violence, as to gendered reporting patterns. One early Ontario study found that men were more likely than women to press charges against intimates and less likely to drop charges once filed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1077801212460754">Kincaid, 1982</xref>). In the study sample, there were 17 times as many female victims as male victims. Twenty-two percent of the female victims laid charges and nearly 40% of the men did. Of those who filed charges, men were less likely to drop them than women, with 2.8% of men and 5% of women dropping the charges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1077801212460754">Kincaid, 1982</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1077801212460754">Dobash, Dobash, Wilson, and Daly (1992)</xref> note that claims that men underreport violent victimization relative to women are largely undocumented, but multiple studies have documented women’s low reporting rates and the reasons for them. Even if the research did support the notion that men underreport victimization relative to women, the use of gender-blind terms cannot solve this alleged problem. The above examples point to the need for discourses and policies that explicitly challenge patriarchal, heterosexist norms for gender and sexuality rather than simply ignoring them.</p>
<p>Efforts to repudiate feminism are the second context of the push for language that ignores gender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1077801212460754">Minaker &amp; Snider, 2006</xref>). Since woman abuse is one of the most graphic manifestations of gender inequality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1077801212460754">General Assembly, 2006</xref>), it is one area where women’s perspectives are widely acknowledged in public policy and scholarship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1077801212460754">Dragiewicz, 2008</xref>). Antifeminists resent linking woman abuse to patriarchy and seek to separate discussions of violence from analyses of gender inequality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1077801212460754">Lupri, 2005</xref>). Some scholars object to studies of violence and abuse that emphasize the importance of gender, power, and context, claiming feminists have “created a climate of fear that inhibits research” for those who continue to do decontextualized counts of behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1077801212460754">Munro, 2008</xref>, p. 35). The antipathy for gender-conscious research is evident in the explicit attacks against feminism by antifeminist scholars and activists. They do not just advocate more attention to male victims (they usually ignore same-sex victims after claiming that abuse in lesbian couples proves women are just as violent as men), they demand the renunciation of feminism and the research, laws, and programs they deem feminist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077801212460754">Dutton, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1077801212460754">Girard, 2009</xref>). The research in this vein is frequently used by antifeminist groups to attack funding for services and programs that acknowledge the gendered realities of violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1077801212460754">Dragiewicz, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1077801212460754">2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Use of gender-blind terms frequently occurs alongside the characterization of “spousal violence” as typically mutual, minor, infrequent, and not resulting in injuries. Some antifeminist scholars argue that, “intimate violence is a two-way street” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1077801212460754">Lupri, 2005</xref>), best addressed privately and without criminal consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077801212460754">Dutton, 2006</xref>). However, this view does not accurately reflect the phenomenon of ongoing coercive control, battering, or abuse that public policy and programs were created to prevent and control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1077801212460754">Stark, 2007</xref>). The idea of violence as mutual and minor mirrors the conceptualization of violence that preceded and necessitated the creation of special laws, policies, and services targeting woman abuse.</p>

<title>Typologies of Intimate Partner Violence and Abuse</title>
<p>Some scholars attempt to bridge or explain the gap between gendered and gender-blind theories of violence by offering typologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1077801212460754">Eckhardt, Holtzworth-Munroe, Norlander, Sibley, &amp; Cahill, 2008</xref>: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1077801212460754">M. P. wJohnson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1077801212460754">M. P. Johnson &amp; Ferraro, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1077801212460754">Pence &amp; Dasgupta, 2006</xref>). It may be useful to observe that the types of violence labeled as intimate terrorism, violent resistance, and situational couple violence are qualitatively different from infrequent, noninjurious acts that invoke no fear or coercion. The CTS is not the only means of operationalizing typologies such as Michael <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1077801212460754">Johnson’s (2008)</xref>, but studies based mainly on the CTS or other decontextualized measures provide no information that can be used to characterize incidents as representative of one type of violence or another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1077801212460754">DeKeseredy, 2011</xref>). It is impossible to make accurate claims about the motives of violence based on numbers of acts, as DeKeseredy pointed out in his critique of Michael Johnson’s typology of violence at the National Institute of Justice’s Gender Symmetry of Violence Workshop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1077801212460754">National Institute of Justice, 2000</xref>). Certainly, motivations for violent and controlling behavior vary and even Michael Johnson acknowledged, “qualitative research and rich interview data would be necessary to thoroughly understand the meaning and social context” (quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1077801212460754">National Institute of Justice, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Another problem with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1077801212460754">Michael Johnson’s (2008)</xref> typology is that he claims to identify a very small number of cases that to him exemplify “mutual violent control.” In such cases, he contends:<disp-quote>
<p>Both members of the couple are violent and controlling, each behaving in a manner that would identify him or her as an intimate terrorist if it weren’t for the fact that their partner also seems to be engaged in the same sort of violent attempt to control the relationship. (p. 12)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>What makes this assertion highly problematic is that, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1077801212460754">Evan Stark (2006)</xref> reminds us, although there is evidence that <italic>some</italic> women use force to control their male partners, “they typically lack the social facility to impose the comprehensive levels of deprivation, exploitation, and dominance found in coercive control. I have never encountered a case of coercive control with a female perpetrator and male victim” (p. 1024).</p>
<p>There is, indeed, empirical support for typologies such as those developed by Michael Johnson, and Amy Holtzworth-Munroe, and their colleagues (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1077801212460754">Holtzworth-Munroe, Meehan, Herron, Rehman, &amp; Stuart, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1077801212460754">M. P. Johnson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1077801212460754">Leone, Johnson, &amp; Cohan, 2007</xref>). Still, some critics like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1077801212460754">Pence and Dasgupta (2006)</xref> caution that typologies are likely to be misused. They note that it is all too easy for abusers and their allies to paint individual incidents as “situational” or aberrant violence even when they are not, and that this can have life and death consequences. Although shelter staff and scholars recognize that not all violence is the same, and not all violence that takes place in the home is necessarily battering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1077801212460754">Dasgupta, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1077801212460754">Osthoff, 2002</xref>), there is no tool that can discern whether an individual act is part of a broader pattern of coercive control. Accordingly, antiviolence advocates continue to call for assessments that place violence and abuse in the context of the relationship, family, community, culture, and history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077801212460754">Bonisteel &amp; Green, 2005</xref>).</p>

<title>Research Findings on Sex Differences in Violence and Abuse Against Intimates and Former Intimates</title>
<p>Policymakers, scholars, practitioners, and others seeking to better understand violence and abuse and to improve prevention and control strategies should be aware of critiques of the research used to support claims of sex symmetry.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1077801212460754">10</xref></sup> However, these critiques comprise only a small portion of the research landscape. Although some media reports focus on the alleged symmetry documented in recent Canadian surveys, Statistics Canada’s own official reports also document substantial differences in the amount and impact of violence experienced by women and men. The GSS and other incident-based measures of violence will never be able to discern the nature or meaning of individual acts in the absence of questions about meaning, motive, and context. Nonetheless, official Canadian government sources do find significant sex differences that should not be ignored.</p>

<p><italic>Family Violence in Canada: A Statistical Profile 2011</italic> reports similar, if slightly lower numbers:<disp-quote>
<p>Of the 19 million Canadians who had a current or former spouse in 2009, 6% reported being physically or sexually victimized by their partner or spouse in the preceding five years… .

<p>Although the latest report includes little data disaggregated by sex, it notes that:<disp-quote>

<title>Crime Data Documenting Sex Differences</title>
<p>Crime data are widely recognized as underreporting violence and abuse by intimates. This is because crime data derived from police reports or other official sources (e.g., court records) describe only the minority of incidents that come to the attention of the criminal justice system. Mainstream crime and victimization surveys document a larger number of incidents, but consistently garner much lower reporting rates than studies specifically designed to measure sensitive issues like woman abuse and sexual assault (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1077801212460754">DeKeseredy, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1077801212460754">H.

<p>Although each of these sources has limitations, the numbers underscore the profound effect of research methods on study findings. Statistics are never self-explanatory, and require contextualization to facilitate proper interpretation. Unfortunately, decontextualized government survey data are often used to the exclusion of other data in misleading ways. Although police reports and GSS data greatly underestimate the incidence and prevalence of violence and abuse, they provide some information about the types of violence most likely to come to the attention of police, the courts, and service providers. Numerous additional charts illustrating marked sex differences in intimate partner violence can be found in <italic>Family Violence in Canada: A Statistical Profile 2008</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1077801212460754">Bressan, 2008</xref>), and <italic>Family Violence in Canada: A Statistical Profile 2000</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1077801212460754">Pottie Bunge, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1077801212460754">Pottie Bunge &amp; Locke, 2000</xref>).</p>

In addition, many of the items that showed significant sex differences in earlier versions are not included in the most recent report; are reported aggregated by sex; or are aggregated across multiple items (e.g., “physically or sexually victimized”).

<title>Sexual Assault</title>
<p>Sexual assault is also left out of discussions about sex symmetry, even though large- and small-scale Canadian surveys show that many women are hurt by a myriad of sexually abusive behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1077801212460754">DeKeseredy, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1077801212460754">H.

Note, too, that Statistics Canada’s recent publications devote minimal attention to this form of violence, and only one question about spousal sexual assault was included in the 1999 GSS. Still, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1077801212460754">Table 4</xref> shows that this rudimentary measure uncovered striking sex differences in sexual assault in both current and former relationships.</p>

<p>Since sexual assault is frequently part of woman abuse, ignoring this type of violence to make claims about sex symmetry seriously distorts both women’s and men’s experiences in a way that obfuscates rather than illustrates the realities of violence and abuse.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>As this article documents, gender-blind discourses misrepresent the research on women’s use of violence in intimate relationships, impeding the development of useful empirical work, policies, and programs. Instead of making the discourse more inclusive, gender-blind language promotes understandings of woman abuse as mutual, reciprocal, or bidirectional, recalling the days before battered women’s advocates created shelters and fought for legal reforms, and scholars conducted hundreds of studies documenting battered women’s experiences. Gender-blind discourse obscures the numerous well-documented sex differences in violence and abuse as well as the dearth of well-designed research on women’s violence against men and same-sex violence and abuse in Canada.</p>
<p>Proponents of gender-blind language equate woman abuse with women’s violence against men by obscuring significant sex differences in violence against intimates such as injury, outcomes, and sexual assault. The characterization of violence as sex-symmetrical is unwarranted because of the magnitude of men’s violence against intimates and the gendered cultural environment that propagates violence against women and men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1077801212460754">DeKeseredy, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1077801212460754">General Assembly, 2006</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section11-1077801212460754">
<title>Directions for Future Research</title>
<p>There is certainly a need for more research on violence and abuse in Canada. National studies specifically designed to study the nature and dynamics of abuse have been few and far between. It is imperative that future Canadian research uses best practices for studying violence and abuse to yield results that can inform effective policies and programs. Studies should include information on context, meaning, and motive so that results are interpretable. Research on violence and abuse in same-sex relationships and women’s violence against male intimates should be broadly contextualized so that risks and contributing factors can be prioritized. Rather than depoliticizing violence, scholars should pay attention to the structural factors that contribute to violence so that we may address primary prevention. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1077801212460754">Janice Ristock (2005)</xref> argued,<disp-quote>
<p>In focusing on the differing contexts that surround people’s experiences of relationship violence we can move away from tendencies to homogenize understandings of relationship violence. Carefully examining differing contexts means recognizing the diversity of spaces in which violence occurs and the way violence is linked to hierarchies of inequality. (p. 9)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Population-specific and qualitative studies will be necessary where the numbers of survivor respondents are too small to yield good statistical data, such as with male survivors of sexual assault and abuse in same-sex couples. In addition to research on the incidence, prevalence, and dynamics of violence and abuse, antiviolence research needs to address the social context that produces high levels of violence against women and men. If we want to prevent or intervene in violence, we also need to understand the structural factors that entrap survivors in abusive relationships. More Canadian research is also needed on violence and abuse following separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1077801212460754">Hotton, 2001</xref>), which is a major problem for many women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1077801212460754">DeKeseredy, 2011</xref>). Ultimately, we concur with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1077801212460754">Brownridge and colleagues (2008)</xref> that it is only by fully understanding the dynamics and contexts of violence that stakeholders will be in the most advantageous position to prevent it.</p>
