<abstract>
<p>A new system design and information modelling method based on a classification of comprehensive information models called four primitives is presented for the design and development of new generation of space launch vehicles, taking advantages of the latest technologies of information modelling of systems. Through an extensive investigation of vast amount of information generated during the design processes of launch vehicles in this research, the information of a design system is classified into four-primitive model or information domains, namely, product information, design process, simulation models and design problems. Based on this classification, a new design method based on four-primitive models is proposed, by which a launch vehicle system design process consists of two phases: meta-design phase and design phase. Furthermore, five steps are generated as a generic procedure to tackle the whole design process, and these include requirement decomposition and mapping, design information modelling, structuring of design pattern, execution of design pattern and utilization of design results. The proposed design method has been validated by applying the method in a design and comparing its key design performance measurement including launch capacity as case study validation examples of the research work.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Launch vehicle system design is a typical multistage and complex design process, which can be divided into four stages: that is, overall scheme design, initial prototype design, test prototype design and product finalizing design. At each of these stages, the design is also concerned about and involves multidisciplinary technologies from disciplines such as trajectory, aerodynamic, structure and mass.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0959651812456333">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Following the development of theory and practice for launch vehicle system design, a method of combining theoretical analyses and experimental studies is widely used, which plays an active role in design improvement and performance enhancement through iterations of both theoretical and experimental studies. By adopting this method, key design parameters can be identified, and the internal relationships between them and overall performance can be obtained. A solution for a launch vehicle can be derived and built by solving the system analysis model after adjusting design parameters and constraint conditions, and this solution can then be validated by experiments. Although a design optimization method has been deployed at this stage, system optimization effect is not effective in terms of time saving in the whole design process because of the limitation of number of experiments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0959651812456333">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>In launch vehicle system design, simulation methods play a greater role and progressively supersede empirical methods due to their increasing reliability, thus achieving saving time and project cost and in-depth support for analyses. Launch vehicle designers spend more and more time for applying computational tools in validating their design than conducting physical experiments. For instance, control of a spacecraft has been extensively studied from control point of view, and the orbital control for low-earth orbit spacecraft control research work was presented, where extensive computational modelling was studied and implemented to achieve robust control of such a spacecraft control system only.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0959651812456333">3</xref></sup> Further work was presented in tracking control of hypersonic vehicles using fuzzy modelling techniques<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959651812456333">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959651812456333">5</xref></sup> and adaptive sliding controller.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0959651812456333">6</xref></sup> Simulation tools such as holistic flight modelling and simulation, fault diagnosis simulation and so forth of an entire launch vehicle system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0959651812456333">7</xref></sup> have been widely used to support the designers. With the application of high-performance computing, especially after the appearing of simulation component technology, the simulation models can be created as components from each disciplinary view and then be assembled as holistic systematic model, which can be used to run the operational behaviour of a launch vehicle under different environmental conditions. By this way, the analysis, synthesis and preference evaluation of launch vehicle system are carried out based on systematic simulation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0959651812456333">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Through simulation-based design processes, computer-based simulation models are able to generate design information that is used for design problem solving. Recently, efforts to improve the design processes of a complex system are focused on two aspects. One is performing activities in a concurrent fashion by which maximum possible amount of information is available for designing,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0959651812456333">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0959651812456333"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0959651812456333">11</xref></sup> and the other is taking complete life cycle considerations during the design phase. A lot of benefits of taking life cycle considerations have been shown in terms of reduction in costly design iterations. Approaches to design incorporating life cycle considerations include concurrent engineering,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0959651812456333">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0959651812456333">13</xref></sup> simultaneous engineering,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959651812456333">14</xref></sup> life cycle engineering<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959651812456333">15</xref></sup> and integrated product and process design (IPPD).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0959651812456333">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0959651812456333">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>The current methods in simulation-based design do not encompass the full set of performance perspectives and criteria for evaluation to produce better designs considering the multistage and complexity in launch vehicle system design process. Couplings between multidisciplinary models induce complexity in the associated design processes, which is further prolonged because of the multistage design process. The design processes involve different domain experts with distributed simulation models. All these factors further complicate the design processes. In order to reduce the complexity of design processes, it is important that only the couplings that are most important for design problem be considered in the design process. Hence, the designers are not only faced with the design related to the product but also faced with the design related to the design processes. These design activities constitute the meta-level design and modelling about how to design and model a launch vehicle system and are hence called meta-design. The meta-designs are concerned with the trade-offs between the complexity of design processes and the satisfaction of design objectives. The design processes that are appropriately designed and constructed can lead to better design solutions faster.</p>
<p>The motivation for this research is to address the increasingly demanding need for systematic and holistic simulation-based design methods suitable for integrated design of complex systems involving multistage processes with potential applications to other complex systems. The principal approach is to facilitate effective and efficient utilization of information and computational resources to construct system models that are multidisciplinary in nature and to integrate these models derived from mathematics, computational science and specific engineering domains (such as aerospace science, material science and environmental science). The ultimate goal of the research is to provide a comprehensive, robust and efficient design support capability for complex system design.</p>
<p>This article focuses on a new design of more streamlined design processes (meta-design) for the simulation-based design of launch vehicle systems. A comprehensive and holistic design method consisting of two phases and streamlined five steps for designing complex products such as launch vehicles and associated design processes for these systems was developed. By considering the systems themselves and design processes for them concurrently, it is possible to tackle the complexity and trade-offs of design activities of these large and complex systems in a more integrated fashion. The method is based on the principles for systems approach for meta-design and stepwise refinement of multistage design. In addition, an approach for modelling design information to support meta-design was put forward, which is based on the principle of modularity of design information and separation of product, problem and process-related information.</p>

<sec id="section2-0959651812456333">
<title>The proposed design method</title>
<p>The proposed design method consists of two phases: meta-design phase and embodiment design phase. In the meta-design phase, the information models are designed, and in the design phase, the process is executed to design a simpler product or a complex system. The two phases are carried out in a cyclic fashion with successive refinement of the design processes along with the refinement of the associated product solution.</p>
<p>These two phases are further decomposed into and completed in the following five steps: (a) requirement decomposition and mapping, (b) design information modelling, (c) structuring of design pattern, (d) execution of design pattern and (e) utilization of design results. The first two steps constitute the meta-design phase, whereas the subsequent three steps constitute the embodiment design phase, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0959651812456333">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Requirement decomposition and mapping</title>
<p>The design requirements analysis is intended to address all of the necessary design tasks by which the major system functions, and technical index should be identified and planned to be satisfied. To this end, there are a number of methods and tools that have been researched and developed, and the commonly used methods of requirements analysis are Delphi, Quality function deployment (QFD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0959651812456333">18</xref></sup> and DeConSolver.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0959651812456333">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0959651812456333">20</xref></sup> The obtained requirements are decomposed into a set of requirement specifications for design problems, product data and simulation models, in order to complete the mapping between the design requirements and information models.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0959651812456333">
<title>Design information modelling</title>
<p>In order to meet the demands of information modelling and applying modular information encapsulation principles widely applied in object-oriented programming paradigm, we propose a strategy that the information of design can be divided into four categories of primitives: product information, design process, simulation models and design problems. The information models are discussed in section ‘4-P information modelling’. By design information modelling, the four-primitive (4-P) models are established, which form the perfect information basis for design task executions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0959651812456333">
<title>Structuring of design pattern</title>
<p>Design pattern is defined to provide computer support for performing integrated design with information models. Some simulation-based design frameworks such as Federated Intelligent Product EnviRonment (FIPER),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0959651812456333">21</xref></sup> ModelCenter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0959651812456333">22</xref></sup> and iSIGHT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0959651812456333">23</xref></sup> adopt a tool-centric design pattern, according to which a design process, a network comprising software tools, is employed for processing information. At the same time, a model-centric design pattern<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0959651812456333">24</xref></sup> is also important for realizing the seamless integration of information models associated with different aspects of product design and is useful for guiding the development of computer-aided engineering (CAE) and product life cycle management (PLM) frameworks to support fine-grained interoperability.</p>
<p>However, the assertion in this article is that neither the tool-centric nor model-centric design patterns are adequate for effectively supporting simulation-based design. In real-design scenarios, design action in essence is a problem-solving process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0959651812456333">25</xref></sup> But both of the stated design patterns do not capture what the design problem is, how the designer partitions the problem or how different problems are related. To address these deficiencies faced by the designers using these approaches, a problem-centric design pattern is developed and presented in this article. Using this approach, each of the concrete design problems as well as their relationships with other information models can be described in an integrated way.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0959651812456333">
<title>Execution of design pattern</title>
<p>The design patterns structured in the preceding step are associated with simulation models and design processes that represent solution schemes for corresponding problems. These simulation models and design processes may either be composed of other complex models and processes or may consist of elementary ones. These design patterns can be executed by different types of algorithms such as exhaustive search, gradient based methods and genetic algorithms. Each of these is associated with an elementary process that is followed and is embedded in the algorithm for executing the simulation models.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0959651812456333">
<title>Utilization of design results</title>
<p>After execution of design patterns, the data about the design problems are fully obtained, including design parameters, design variables and response variables, and at the same time the product information is also updated. These data and information represent design results, which are generated by simulation models, and are utilized for satisfying design objectives through analysis, synthesis and evaluation. By these five steps the solution scheme on current stage has been obtained, based on it, the design task on next stages can be carried out.</p>
<p>In comparison with the work reported and described in the literature review section, the important differentiating features and advantages of this new proposed method are that it enables the designers to tackle a complex system holistically and standardizes the design process of complex systems by allowing the designers to meta-design in the context of designers’ preferences. Hence, the design processes are standardized yet designed and customized specifically for the system under consideration. The method allows the designers to consider multiple objectives in meta-design. This is an enhancement over existing design methods that either do not consider the design of design processes at all or only consider the configuration of processes only based on streamlining information flow.</p>

<sec id="section8-0959651812456333">
<title>4-P information modelling</title>
<p>The information modelling strategy proposed in this article is called as the 4-P model, which is embodied as an information model that describes design-related information. The four key primitives of the 4-P model are product information models, design problems, design process and simulation models, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0959651812456333">Figure 2</xref>. This modelling strategy is based on the separation of information related to products, processes, simulation models and design problems. Such a separation of information allows utilization of same simulation models for solving different problems, which facilitate meta-design. The 4-P strategy also supports utilization of the same design process for designing different products. The separation of information is a better solution in terms of improving reusability, customizability and expansibility.</p>

<sec id="section9-0959651812456333">
<title>Product information model</title>
<p>In order to model the product information in a computer-interpretable manner, an object-oriented schema is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0959651812456333">Figure 2(a)</xref>. The key part of this information model is the extraction of an entity, which is used to describe any element within a product development. A product model is defined by and composed of many such entities. Each entity, in turn, is composed of various sub-entities, and its behaviour is defined by a number of attributes. Each attribute can be either of type form or behaviour. Form attributes are a collection of attributes that can be controlled directly by the designer, whereas behavioural attributes combined together represent the behaviour of that entity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0959651812456333">
<title>Design problem model</title>
<p>The schema for design problems is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0959651812456333">Figure 2(b)</xref>. The topmost entity is a DesignProblem. This design problem contains all the declarative information related to a design problem. The design problem consists of four important elements – design space, response space, problem constraints and preferences. Design space is defined by all the design variables that can be controlled by the designers. Design variables can be either real or discrete. Real-design variables have a continuous range of values, which they can assume. Response space is defined by all the parameters that constitute the behaviour space. The parameters in the response space have targets associated with them. These targets are derived from the customer requirements through the mapping transformation. For example, launch capacity is one of the most important performance parameters of launch vehicle, which directly reflects the user requirement. This parameter can also be found in the response space and should be treated as an optimization target.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0959651812456333">
<title>Design process model</title>
<p>The information model used for capturing process information is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0959651812456333">Figure 2(c)</xref>. The highest level element in the information model is a DesignProcess. The process is composed of two types of elements: basic and composite process elements. The basic process element can be directly executed on the computer, whereas composite process element is a composition of other process elements. A composite process element has an execution sequence associated with it. Two process elements with information flow between them are associated with an interface. The interface defines the outputs of one process element and the inputs of other process element and also defines how they are mapped to each other in the mapping object.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0959651812456333">
<title>Simulation models system</title>
<p>The design structure matrix (DSM) is used to model the simulation models system by describing the operative sequence of simulation models and coupling relationships between the simulation models. With DSM, we can also represent hierarchical structures of simulation models. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0959651812456333">Figure 2(d)</xref>, the highest level element in the model is a DesignSimulation, which is composed of SimulationDSM and Interface elements. SimulationDSM presents the simulation models system in terms of DSM style. The interface defines the inputs and outputs, and mapping defines how they are mapped to each other.</p>
<p>The key advantages of 4-P models include first the enabling support for comprehensive modelling of a complex system such as launch vehicle system, which is enabled by the fact that information related to Problems, Products, Processes and Simulation Models is separated and captured via design patterns. Second, 4-P models provide greater flexibility in dealing with complex design information as different combinations of Problem, Product, Process and Simulation Models declarations can be made to generate specific computationally executable design patterns for different design and analysis purposes. Finally, 4-P models facilitate greater reuse of design work as design knowledge can be captured and reused across different design stages.</p>

<title>Application to launch vehicle system design</title>
<p>Taking a launch vehicle system design as a case study, the proposed design method has been used and compared with a traditional method. This section describes in detail a case study of applying the proposed new method to standardize the design process and improve the design efficiency in designing such a system.</p>
<p>During the process of system design and calculation, a variety of professional design activities were required in order to achieve the overall objectives, such as system structure design, engine system design, dynamics parameter design and system reliability design, and the case study scope is detailed and shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0959651812456333">Figure 3</xref>.</p>

<list-item>
<p>Through analysing the design resources of existing launch vehicles including design documents, data files and simulation models, all resources suitable for the new type of launch vehicle were selected and wrapped in a generic format, so that a set of interface rules can be applied to interact with these resources models.

<p>A software platform developed based on the findings of this research is entitled MDO platform for launch vehicle system, which provides an integrated support for space system designers to manage and configure various partial computer models of a launch vehicle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0959651812456333">26</xref></sup> Under the support of the above software platform, the designer can configure and execute the design pattern using wizards implemented within the software platform. Following the wizards, configuration and execution steps for launch capability design pattern are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0959651812456333">Figure 5</xref>.</p>

<title>Evaluation of the approach and results comparison</title>
<p>As the overall design process is a time-consuming process and involves many designers and engineers, a quantitative evaluation of the effectiveness would be ideal but is difficult to achieve. This research, however, has done a reflective evaluation of the approach in comparison with the current method, and the following gives key points identified from the feedback of the designers and engineers involved in the process. Using the current traditional design method, the calculation programmes and analysis tools that involve various subjects and disciplines were basically independent of each other and became the ‘islands of automation’. Design results and processes were mainly coordinated manually based on and using design reports and data files, which required designers to spend a great deal of time in the process of parameter conversion, the translation and transmission of data files. What is more, this kind of manual activities were usually prone to error, which often reduced the design efficiency and increased design rework considerably.</p>
<p>On the contrary, the preliminary evaluation result using the proposed design method shows that the reusability, customizability and automation of the design process have been improved highly compared with the traditional method. In this case study, more than 80% of models in the 4-P models library that was built in the current design stage can be reused in the next system design. In addition, all models and design patterns can be executed by computer with automatic parameter data transmission and file format conversion between different disciplines. It is clear from the above that the new methodology represents a significant increase in model reuse and reduction of design time by an estimated time saving of 45%, which is an estimated figure from the designers who used the above new approach.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This article has demonstrated a new method for multistage and complex products design based on intensive launch vehicle models and their simulation, which consists of two phases and five concrete steps. The 4-P approach for modelling design information has been developed to support the design method. As the beneficial attempt for validation, the system overall design for a new type launch vehicle was carried out by adopting this new design method.</p>
<p>The contributions made from this research presented in this article can be categorized into three research domains: a theoretical system design methodology, a practical application of the methodology in launch vehicle system design and a theoretical computational approach to computer support for simulation-based design. In the domain of design methodology, a new method is proposed and developed for integrating the design of complex products and multistage design processes. The method is applied successfully through a case study in a launch vehicle system design to develop design processes and specifications for multidisciplinary collaborative optimization. In the domain of simulation-based design, a 4-P modelling strategy has been proposed and has been developed to provide a comprehensive computational support for meta-design.</p>
<p>Although the design methods and information modelling have been the focus in this article, we believe that this is a small but sure step towards the fulfilment of the vision, which is to design a platform using modelling and simulation extensively in order to provide a powerful and flexible support for system engineering of launch vehicles in future. This research result shows initial effects in addressing especially the launch vehicle system design, where there are many limitations to the breadth and extent of the present approaches because of the complexity of the system design, modelling and overall workload. These further extension of the simulation approach to an even wider scope remains to be a key topic for future research work.</p>
