<abstract>
<p>Despite gender similarities in math and science achievement, women continue to be underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education and careers. Increasingly, researchers are looking to gender differences in STEM attitudes as the root of this disparity. Theoretical support for the importance of STEM attitudes comes from several theories within educational, social, and vocational psychology, including Eccles’ expectancy-value theory, which maintains that education-related choices are shaped by attitudes—namely, expectations of success and task value as well as self-concept. Yet, the studies testing this model generally have not taken into account the intersection of gender and ethnicity. The current study addresses this gap in the literature by describing gender differences in math and science attitudes and achievement among 367 White, African American, Latino/Latina, and Asian American 10th grade students in neighborhood public high schools from a large northeastern city. Male and female adolescents earned similar end-of-year grades in math and science, whereas Asian American students outperformed students from the other ethnic groups in math and science. Self-report data from paper-and-pencil surveys indicate significant gender differences in that male adolescents reported greater math self-concept and expectations of success and female adolescents reported more science value; gender differences did not vary across ethnic groups. Attitudes were strong predictors of achievement, consistent with hypotheses. To our knowledge, ours is the first study to examine math and science attitudes and achievement at the intersection of gender and ethnicity across four major ethnic groups. We discuss implications for efforts aimed at improving the representation of women in STEM.</p>

<p>American women continue to be underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) careers (National Science Foundation [NSF], <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0361684313480694">Division of Science Resources Statistics, 2012</xref>), which are a critical component of the U.S. economy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0361684313480694">Romer, 1990</xref>). Moreover, only 8% of STEM jobs in the United States are held by women who are also ethnic minorities (NSF, Division of Science Resources Statistics, 2012). In light of evidence that gender differences in STEM ability are minimal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0361684313480694">Else-Quest, Hyde, &amp; Linn, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0361684313480694">Hyde, Lindberg, Linn, Ellis, &amp; Williams, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0361684313480694">Lindberg, Hyde, Petersen, &amp; Linn, 2010</xref>; Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0361684313480694">[OECD], 2009</xref>), theoretical and empirical research has begun to focus on the importance of STEM <italic>attitudes</italic> in the decision to pursue such careers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0361684313480694">Halpern et al., 2007</xref>). Yet, despite the underrepresentation of ethnic minorities—notably, African Americans, Latinos, and Southeast Asians—in STEM participation (NSF, Division of Science Resources Statistics, 2012), research on gender differences in STEM attitudes has generally not employed ethnically diverse samples or has not taken into account the intersection of gender and ethnicity. In the interest of understanding better why many girls and women do not pursue STEM careers, our study examines how gender differences in math and science attitudes vary across four major ethnic groups in a sample of urban public high school students.</p>

<title>Attitudes, not Aptitude</title>
<p>Neither gender differences in mean ability nor variability on math and science achievement tests account for gender differences in high school students’ interest in or intention to major in STEM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0361684313480694">Xie &amp; Shauman, 2003</xref>). Evidence generally shows a pattern of gender similarities in math and science achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0361684313480694">Else-Quest et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0361684313480694">Hedges &amp; Nowell, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0361684313480694">Hyde et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0361684313480694">Lindberg et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0361684313480694">OECD, 2009</xref>), consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0361684313480694">Hyde’s (2005)</xref> gender similarities hypothesis. Although boys outperform girls slightly on tests of science and mathematics on the National Assessment of Education Progress (NAEP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0361684313480694">Coley, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0361684313480694">McGraw, Lubienski, &amp; Strutchens, 2006</xref>), girls earn better grades in mathematics courses through the end of high school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0361684313480694">Dwyer &amp; Johnson, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0361684313480694">Kenney-Benson, Pomerantz, Ryan, &amp; Patrick, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0361684313480694">Kimball, 1989</xref>). Thus, there is increasing support for the contention that the underrepresentation of girls and women in STEM is due to factors other than differences in basic ability or aptitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0361684313480694">Ceci &amp; Williams, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0361684313480694">Halpern et al., 2007</xref>; Hyde &amp; Linn, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0361684313480694">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0361684313480694">Spelke, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0361684313480694">Xie &amp; Shauman, 2003</xref>). For example, evidence indicates that the “digital divide” results not from gender differences in skill or experience with computers but from gender differences in attitudes such as perceived technological competence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0361684313480694">Cooper &amp; Weaver, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Attitudes about math and science may be critical to women’s underrepresentation in STEM careers. With regard to math, girls tend to hold more negative attitudes relative to boys. That is, girls report more math anxiety, less confidence and self-efficacy about math, lower internal and external motivation in math, and poorer math self-concept (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0361684313480694">Else-Quest et al., 2010</xref>; Fredricks &amp; Eccles, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0361684313480694">2002</xref>; Ganley &amp; Vasilyeva, 2011; Jacobs, Lanza, Osgood, Eccles, &amp; Wigfield, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0361684313480694">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0361684313480694">McGraw et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0361684313480694">Miller &amp; Bichsel, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0361684313480694">Pomerantz, Altermatt, &amp; Saxon, 2002</xref>). These effects tend to be small or medium in magnitude.</p>
<p>Gender differences in science attitudes appear to be somewhat smaller than gender differences in math attitudes. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0361684313480694">Weinburgh’s (1995)</xref> meta-analysis of gender differences in attitudes toward science found that boys reported more positive attitudes about science than girls did, although the gender difference was very small. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0361684313480694">Pomerantz, Altermatt, and Saxon (2002</xref>) reported small gender differences in elementary school students’ self-perceptions of science ability, with girls rating themselves more negatively despite better performance. Data from international science assessments indicate that, despite similar achievement, female adolescents report lower self-concept in science compared to male adolescents (with small to medium effect sizes; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0361684313480694">OECD, 2009</xref>). Yet, these same assessments found that male and female adolescents do not appear to differ in terms of their self-efficacy, enjoyment, or value of science (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0361684313480694">OECD, 2007</xref>).</p>

<title>Theoretical Perspectives</title>
<p>In sum, gender similarities in math and science achievement contrast with patterns of gender differences in attitudes about math and, to some extent, science. Increasingly, evidence suggests that gender differences in these attitudes, not aptitude or ability, are responsible for gender disparities in STEM participation. Several theoretical perspectives are informative in describing how these attitudes might shape STEM participation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0361684313480694">Hackett and Betz (1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0361684313480694">Betz &amp; Hackett, 1981</xref>) applied <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0361684313480694">Bandura’s (1977)</xref> self-efficacy theory to the question of women’s underrepresentation in STEM fields. That is, individuals choose to undertake activities or tasks in which they believe they will be successful.</p>
<p>Similarly, social cognitive career theory (SCCT; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0361684313480694">Lent, Brown, &amp; Hackett, 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0361684313480694">2000</xref>), which also is rooted in Bandura’s (1986) social cognitive theory, emphasizes self-efficacy as well as its links to outcome expectations (i.e., beliefs about the likely outcomes of choosing a particular path), interests (i.e., liking the activity or task), and goals (i.e., intending to choose or persist in a particular path), and the interaction of these attitudes with relevant contextual variables (e.g., the perception of social barriers) and individual differences. SCCT maintains that individuals’ choices about whether to pursue an STEM career depend on their STEM self-efficacy and the perceived outcomes of pursuing such a career, which interact with contextual variables such as gender, ethnicity, and socialization. Empirical evidence has generally supported the assertions of SCCT; for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0361684313480694">Lent et al. (2008</xref>) reported that self-efficacy in engineering was linked to later outcome expectations, interest, and goals in a longitudinal study with undergraduate engineering students. Moreover, confirming the causal pathway predicted by SCCT, experimental methods to manipulate STEM self-efficacy have been shown to significantly improve STEM interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0361684313480694">Luzzo, Hasper, Albert, Bibby, &amp; Martinelli, 1999</xref>). With regard to contextual barriers, several studies are of particular import for the problem of gender differences in the pursuit of STEM careers. For example, the perception of social barriers in computer science careers is linked to less positive attitudes about computer science among undergraduate majors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0361684313480694">Lent, Lopez, Sheu, &amp; Lopez, 2011</xref>), and evidence indicates that male and female adolescents report greater interest in and have higher self-efficacy for careers that they perceive as employing more members of their own gender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0361684313480694">Ji, Lapan, &amp; Tate, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Other theoretical approaches have also linked attitudes about one’s ability to interests, goals, and outcomes in academic and vocational pursuits. For instance, Eccles’ expectancy-value theory maintains that achievement behaviors (e.g., taking advanced math courses or majoring in chemistry) are the product of an individual’s expectations for success and the perceived value or importance of the behavior (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0361684313480694">Eccles, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0361684313480694">Frome &amp; Eccles, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0361684313480694">Jacobs, Davis-Kean, Bleeker, Eccles, &amp; Malanchuk, 2005</xref>). For example, if a student believes that she can succeed in a math course and also believes that the course is valuable (e.g., the knowledge will be useful), she will choose to enroll in the course. Moreover, perceptions of the value of the task and expectations of success at the task are shaped by the individual’s self-concept of her ability (e.g., the perception that one is good at math). Thus, the current study focuses on attitudes about the self—including self-concept, task value, and expectations of success—which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0361684313480694">Eccles (1994)</xref> specified as the most proximal influences on achievement behaviors.</p>
<p>If attitudes are so critical, what factors contribute to gender differences in those attitudes? According to Eccles’ model, the cultural milieu plays a role in the development of each of these attitudes; here, gender stereotypes are particularly relevant. The stereotype that math is a male domain is persistent and pervasive in North American culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0361684313480694">Benbow &amp; Stanley, 1980</xref>; Fennema, Peterson, Carpenter, &amp; Lubinski, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0361684313480694">1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0361684313480694">Hyde, Fennema, Ryan, Frost, &amp; Hopp, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0361684313480694">Nosek &amp; Smyth, 2011</xref>). Moreover, gender stereotypes about math are evident as early as second grade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0361684313480694">Cvencek, Meltzoff, &amp; Greenwald, 2011</xref>). In adolescence, girls report hearing sexist comments about STEM abilities from peers as well as from teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0361684313480694">Brown &amp; Leaper, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0361684313480694">Leaper &amp; Brown, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Ethnic stereotypes also abound: Whites and Asian Americans are stereotyped as having high STEM abilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0361684313480694">Sinclair, Hardin, &amp; Lowery, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0361684313480694">Wenner, 2003</xref>), whereas Latino and African American boys are stereotyped as lacking in intelligence and achievement motivation and as being academically unengaged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0361684313480694">Hudley &amp; Graham, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0361684313480694">Steele, 1997</xref>). Demonstrating both the sexist and racist nature of these stereotypes in contemporary U.S. culture, data indicate that children tend to perceive scientists as White and male (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0361684313480694">Barman, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0361684313480694">Wenner, 2003</xref>). In sum, evidence is clear that the current cultural milieu embraces both gender and ethnic stereotypes about STEM ability.</p>
<p>Given this milieu in which girls and boys develop their STEM attitudes and abilities, it follows from Eccles’ (1994) framework that girls, Latinos/Latinas, and African Americans should hold the most negative STEM attitudes. Moreover, one’s awareness of relevant gender and ethnic stereotypes is linked to one’s STEM self-concept and attitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0361684313480694">Aronson &amp; McGlone, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0361684313480694">Cvencek et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0361684313480694">Pinel, 1999</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0361684313480694">Diekman and Eagly’s (2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0361684313480694">Evans &amp; Diekman, 2009</xref>) role congruity theory maintains that, when we internalize gender stereotypes (e.g., in the form of gendered self-concept), we endorse goals that are congruent with our gender roles and we prefer careers that are believed to help achieve those goals. Consistent with this perspective, evidence indicates that STEM careers are perceived as being inconsistent with communal goals, which involve caretaking roles and which women tend to endorse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0361684313480694">Diekman, Brown, Johnston, &amp; Clark, 2010</xref>). Individuals tend to value tasks that are compatible with their gender roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0361684313480694">Eccles, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0361684313480694">Eccles, Barber, Jozefowicz, Malanchuk, &amp; Vida, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0361684313480694">Wigfield &amp; Eccles, 1992</xref>). This finding is consistent with the models of Eccles as well as Diekman and Eagly, in that both models articulate a process whereby stereotypes can shape STEM educational or career choices via attitudes about the self and the suitability of tasks based on those attitudes. Yet, it remains unclear the extent to which gender and ethnic stereotypes about STEM are mirrored in STEM attitudes among male and female adolescents within various ethnic groups, or how gender stereotypes about STEM are endorsed or communicated differently across different ethnic groups.</p>
<p>Emphasizing the importance of the cultural milieu, the gender stratification hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0361684313480694">Else-Quest &amp; Grabe, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0361684313480694">Else-Quest et al., 2010</xref>) maintains that gendered opportunity structures (such as improved access to educational opportunities and the perception of gendered careers) contribute to more negative STEM attitudes and poorer STEM achievement among female adolescents. In support of this assertion, data indicate that gender differences in math attitudes (as well as achievement) appear to be rooted in cultural variables indexing macro-level gender equity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0361684313480694">Else-Quest et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0361684313480694">Kane &amp; Mertz, 2012</xref>). In situating STEM attitudes in the cultural milieu and linking broader sociocultural factors to individual psychology, this perspective is consistent with Eccles’ (1994) theoretical model.</p>
<p>In sum, multiple theoretical perspectives point to gender differences in STEM attitudes—including self-efficacy and self-concept, expectations, task value, gender stereotypes and implicit biases, and goals—as critical factors in the underrepresentation of women in STEM fields. In the current study, we use Eccles’ (1994) expectancy-value model to guide our measurement of STEM attitudes, including self-concept, expectations of success, and task value. We use this model to examine the intersection of gender and ethnicity to ascertain how gender differences in STEM attitudes might vary across ethnic groups in the United States.</p>

<title>The Intersection of Gender and Ethnicity</title>
<p>In order to address gender differences comprehensively as well as to accurately characterize STEM attitudes among students in the United States, it is crucial to examine STEM attitudes at the intersection of gender and ethnicity. An intersectional approach in psychology considers how the experience and meaning of one social identity (e.g., being a girl) is contingent on the experience and meaning of (at least) another social identity (e.g., being Asian American) within a broader social and historical context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0361684313480694">Cole, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0361684313480694">Shields, 2008</xref>). That is, the experience of gender is not identical for African American, Asian American, Latina, and White girls and women. Although there are a number of methodologies used to apply this approach, we examine the problem of women’s underrepresentation in STEM with quantitative methods. Using these methods to examine the intersection of gender and ethnicity, we ask the question, how do gender differences in math and science attitudes vary across ethnic groups?</p>
<p>A handful of studies have examined STEM <italic>attitudes</italic> at the intersection of gender and ethnicity. For example, in analyses of the National Educational Longitudinal Study (NELS) of 1988 data on math and science attitudes among Black, White, and Latino/Latina students, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0361684313480694">Catsambis (1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0361684313480694">1995</xref>) found slight variability in gender differences across ethnic groups, although males tended to report more positive attitudes overall. Moreover, gender differences in math attitudes were largest among Latinos, whereas gender differences in science attitudes were largest among White students. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0361684313480694">Zarrett, Malanchuk, Davis-Kean, and Eccles (2006</xref>) measured math and technology attitudes among White and African American young adults. They found small gender differences in math self-concept and value within both ethnic groups, such that men reported more positive attitudes compared to women—regardless of ethnicity. Regarding computer self-concept, gender differences were medium among Whites and small among African Americans but only in “hard” technology jobs (e.g., programming, developing software). In contrast, gender differences in “soft” technology jobs (e.g., word processing, accounting) were negligible among Whites and very small (although favoring women) among African Americans. Other data indicate that the gender gap in the intention to major in computer science is largest among White students (where women are outnumbered by 9:1), but similar among Latino, African American, and Asian American students (a 4.5:1 gender gap; NSF, Division of Science Resources Statistics, 2012). These reports suggest a pattern in which gender gaps in STEM attitudes are larger among White students than among African American students.</p>
<p>Regarding STEM <italic>achievement</italic> at the intersection of gender and ethnicity, data have generally pointed to a pattern in which gender differences in math and science achievement are largest among White and Latino/Latina samples and smallest among Asian American and African American samples. For example, based on NAEP data, the gender difference in mathematics achievement is consistently significant only among White samples, although Latino/Latina samples show a few gender differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0361684313480694">Coley, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0361684313480694">McGraw et al., 2006</xref>). On the NAEP test of science achievement, boys tend to consistently outperform girls among White, Asian American, and Latino/Latina students, but findings of gender differences are more equivocal among African American students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0361684313480694">Coley, 2001</xref>). Using data on math and science achievement from the NELS:88, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0361684313480694">Catsambis (1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0361684313480694">1995</xref>) found that boys outperformed girls among White and Latino/Latina students, but not among African American students, despite female advantages in grades across ethnic groups (Asian Americans were not included). Thus, gender gaps in math and science achievement appear largest and most consistent among White and Latino/Latina students.</p>
<p>Yet, most studies investigating expectancy-value theory have used predominantly White samples, have used a limited approach to ethnicity by sampling only White and African American students, or have not considered gender and ethnicity simultaneously. A basic premise of psychological science is that research samples must be representative in order to produce generalizable and valid findings. Although non-White ethnic groups are frequently lumped together as “people of color,” ethnic groups differ from one another on many relevant dimensions (e.g., socioeconomic status [SES], family structure, immigration, acculturation, and stereotyping). Thus, African Americans, Asian Americans, and Latinos/Latinas should be studied as distinct populations rather than as a highly heterogeneous “non-White” population.</p>
<p>The limited coverage of ethnic variations in STEM attitudes is an important limitation, particularly in light of ethnic achievement gaps. For example, African American and Latino/Latina youth remain less likely to attend college than White and Asian American youth (NSF, Division of Science Resources Statistics, 2012), and Asian American students are more likely to enroll in advanced high school science and math courses than are other students (NSF, Division of Science Resources Statistics, 2012). On the 2005 NAEP mathematics assessment, Asian American high school students scored highest, followed closely by White students; Black and Latino/Latina students scored lowest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0361684313480694">Grigg, Donahue, &amp; Dion, 2007</xref>). Yet, some researchers have found that the math achievement gap between Whites and ethnic minorities can be explained, at least in part, by SES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0361684313480694">Byrnes, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0361684313480694">Stevenson, Chen, &amp; Uttal, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite this generally consistent trend in ethnic differences—such that Asian American and White students tend to outperform African American and Latino/Latina students—findings of ethnic differences in STEM attitudes are mixed. For example, some researchers have found that White elementary school students tend to hold more positive attitudes toward science than do their African American classmates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0361684313480694">Slate &amp; Jones, 1998</xref>); others have found that students at historically Black universities report more positive STEM attitudes than students at predominantly White universities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0361684313480694">Lent et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0361684313480694">2011</xref>); and still others have reported equivocal findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0361684313480694">Stevensonet al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0361684313480694">Zarrett, Malanchuk, Davis-Kean, &amp; Eccles, 2006</xref>). Additionally, several reports indicate that Asian American students report more positive attitudes than White or Latino/Latina students (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0361684313480694">Chen &amp; Stevenson, 1995</xref>). Thus, it is difficult to make strong predictions about ethnic differences in attitudes, and it is imperative to pursue this topic of research further.</p>

<title>The Current Study</title>
<p>Broadly, we sought to describe math and science attitudes and achievement at the intersection of gender and ethnicity among urban adolescents who identified as White, African American, Latino/Latina, or Asian American and attended diverse public high schools. In light of the aforementioned findings, we expected to find (a) ethnic differences in attitudes and achievement, such that White and Asian American adolescents will report more positive math and science attitudes and earn higher grades than Latino/Latina and African American adolescents; (b) gender differences in attitudes—such that male adolescents will report more positive math and science attitudes than female adolescents—despite gender similarities in achievement (in that male and female adolescents will earn similar end-of-year grades in math and science); and (c) Gender × Ethnicity interactions in attitudes and achievement, such that gender differences in math and science attitudes and achievement will be largest among White and Latino/Latina students and smallest among African American students, consistent with previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0361684313480694">Catsambis, 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0361684313480694">1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0361684313480694">Coley, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0361684313480694">McGraw et al., 2006</xref>). In addition, we assessed the link between attitudes and achievement (i.e., that self-concept, task value, and expectations of success predict later achievement) and how it was moderated by gender and ethnicity. We predicted that (d) attitudes will positively predict achievement; however, given the lack of existing research on this question, (e) we made no a priori predictions as to how gender and ethnicity might moderate this link.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>The participants in our study were 367 adolescents (<italic>M</italic>
<sub>age</sub> = 16.19, range = 15.00–18.83) who compose the Philadelphia Adolescent Life Study (PALS). Participants self-identified as belonging to one of the four major ethnic groups: 102 (48 female and 54 male) identified themselves as White, 96 (41 female and 55 male) as African American, 84 (45 female and 39 male) as Latino/Latina, and 85 (50 female and 35 male) as Asian American. Power analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0361684313480694">Cohen, 1988</xref>) indicate that this sample size can detect significant small-to-medium differences (<italic>f</italic> = .20) between the eight groups with minimum statistical power of .70 and α = .05.</p>
<p>As can be seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0361684313480694">Table 1</xref>, most (80.8%) reported that they were born in the United States, and 72.3% reported English as their native language. Of those who were born outside the United States, the range of time that students reported living in the United States was 4 months to 15 years (<italic>M</italic> = 6.60, <italic>SD</italic> = 4.32). Analyses of socioeconomic variables (collected from parents/guardians) indicate that the PALS sample is, in general, economically disadvantaged (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0361684313480694">Table 1</xref>). For example, 63.2% of the parents of the adolescents reported being employed (27.5% reported not working and 9.3% refused to answer). In terms of annual household income, 24.8% of parents reported income less than $20,000 per year; 36.0%, between $20,000 and 50,000 per year; 19.9%, greater than $50,000 per year; and 19.3% refused to answer. Regarding education, 4.4% of parents reported their highest level of education as 8th grade or below; 10.1%, from 9th to 11th grade; 29.2%, graduated high school (or general equivalency diploma); 26.7%, attended college; 14.4%, graduated college; 4.9%, attended graduate school; and 10.4% refused to answer. In terms of number of books in the home, 5.4% reported 0–10; 34.6%, 10–50; 22.6%, 50–100; 30.5%, at least 100; and 6.8% refused to answer.</p>

<p>Demographic variables for the PALS sample, disaggregated by ethnicity, appear in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0361684313480694">Table 1</xref>. Despite living in the same neighborhoods and attending the same schools as their African American, Latino/Latina, and Asian American classmates, White adolescents came from homes with significantly higher income, greater parental education, and more books. Thus, in all analyses, an SES composite variable—the mean of standardized values (<italic>z</italic> scores) for these variables (income, parental education, and books in the home)—served as a covariate. The internal consistency for this composite variable is rather poor (α = .50). Yet, we use this composite variable, rather than all three of the variables, to maintain statistical power and to index SES for as many participants as possible (i.e., some participants chose not to answer all 3 items).</p>

<title>Procedures</title>
<p>We recruited 10th grade students from across five ethnically diverse urban public neighborhood high schools (i.e., schools that included ≥10% of each of the four major ethnic groups in the student population, were not selective/magnet, and were default schools for children in a given geographical area) in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, during the spring semester of the 2009–2010 school year. We mailed letters to the students’ parents/guardians, inviting them and their 10th graders to participate in a study of student academic and social development. Parents/guardians (<italic>n</italic> = 318, 91.9% of whom were biological or adoptive parents) provided informed consent and permission for their and their child’s participation as well as permission to obtain student grades from the school district. Surveys and student assent forms were mailed to students’ homes and students returned these materials by mail. Students received $100 for completing their surveys, which included demographics items and measures of academic attitudes as well as other scales related to adolescent social development. Full participation was achieved by 89.5% of the families who consented to participate in PALS.</p>

<p>In sum, findings do not support our first hypothesis that Asian American and White students would report more positive math and science attitudes than their peers. Results support our predictions about gender differences in attitudes somewhat in that male adolescents reported higher math self-concept and expectations of success; yet, in contrast to our predictions, female adolescents reported higher science value. Gender differences in math and science attitudes did not vary across ethnic group, contrary to our third hypothesis.</p>

<title>Attitudes Predict Achievement</title>
<p>To assess the strength of the predictive relationship between math attitudes and achievement, and how that relationship is moderated by gender and ethnicity, three multiple regression analyses were conducted. The criterion variable in each model was weighted end-of-year math grades. In each model, Step 1 included the SES composite and years living in the United States as predictors; Step 2 included ethnicity (as three dummy-coded variables, with African American ethnicity coded as 0 in each), gender (<italic>coded as female</italic> = 0, <italic>male</italic> = 1) and one of the three math attitudes scales (i.e., math self-concept, expectations of success, or task value); Step 3 included the Gender × Math attitudes interaction, Gender × Ethnicity interactions, and Ethnicity × Attitudes interactions; and Step 4 included the three-way interaction terms for Gender × Ethnicity × Attitudes. Results for these analyses appear in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0361684313480694">Table 6</xref>.</p>

<p>Similarities, as well as differences, are evident across the three models. In each model, Steps 1 (SES and years lived in the United States) and 2 (attitudes, gender, and ethnicity) produced significant change in <italic>R</italic>
<sup>2</sup>, but Steps 3 and 4 (which included the two-way and three-way interaction terms, respectively) did not. In no model was gender a significant predictor of math grades; this nonfinding was expected, given the aforementioned ANCOVA results. In all three models, math attitudes, White ethnicity, and Asian ethnicity were significant and positive predictors of math achievement. In the model including expectations of success, the Gender × Attitude interaction term significantly predicted math grades, such that expectations of success was a better predictor of math grades for female adolescents than for male adolescents; the interaction of math self-concept and gender approached significance (<italic>p</italic> = .051) and followed the same pattern. None of the other interactions was significant, indicating that the positive relationship between math attitudes and achievement is generally similar across ethnic groups for both male and female adolescents. With regard to variance explained by the full models, the model including math self-concept explained 40.2% of the variance in math grades; math expectations of success, 28.7%; and math task value, 18.8%.</p>
<p>We followed similar analytic procedures for science attitudes (i.e., math self-concept, expectations of success, or task value) and achievement. Results for these three regression analyses appear in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0361684313480694">Table 7</xref>. In each of the three models, the first and second steps produced significant change in <italic>R</italic>
<sup>2</sup>, which is explained by the effects of attitudes (particularly in the case of self-concept) and White (except in the case of task value) or Asian ethnicity. Gender predicted science achievement, such that being female was associated with higher weighted year-end grades, but only in the model that included science self-concept. None of the interactions was significant, indicating that the effects of science attitudes on achievement did not depend on gender or ethnicity. In sum, results strongly support our fourth hypothesis that attitudes would predict achievement in math and science. In regard to our final exploratory test, gender and ethnicity did not moderate this effect.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>How do patterns of gender differences and similarities in STEM attitudes and achievement vary across four ethnic groups of urban U.S. adolescents? Our data indicate that male adolescents continue to report higher self-concept and greater expectations for success in math and science than female adolescents do, as predicted by the theoretical models described earlier, whereas female adolescents report greater science value than male adolescents do. Although we predicted that gender and ethnicity would interact, such that gender differences would differ across the four ethnic groups we studied, our evidence suggests that such effects, if present, are subtle and characterized by slight variations in the magnitude (but not direction) of effect sizes across ethnic groups. Patterns of gender differences in attitudes are a departure from patterns of gender similarities in achievement; consistent with our hypotheses, male and female adolescents earned similar end-of-year grades in math and science. The juxtaposition of these findings echoes previous reports in the literature that gender differences in math attitudes contrast with gender similarities in achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0361684313480694">Casey, Nuttall, &amp; Pezaris, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0361684313480694">Else-Quest et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0361684313480694">Ganley &amp; Vasilyeva, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0361684313480694">Pomerantz et al., 2002</xref>). Given the correlational nature of these and our data, claims about the causes of these gender differences are unwarranted. Nonetheless, we point to the theoretical models described at the start of our article for speculation about the origins of gender differences in math and science attitudes.</p>
<p>We hypothesized that ethnic groups would differ in attitudes and achievement, such that White and Asian American youth would report more positive attitudes and achieve higher end-of-year grades. Indeed, the highest achieving youth in our study were Asian Americans, and the lowest achieving youth were Latino and African American male adolescents, consistent with ethnic stereotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0361684313480694">Hudley &amp; Graham, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0361684313480694">Sinclair et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0361684313480694">Steele, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0361684313480694">Wenner, 2003</xref>). Asian American male adolescents consistently demonstrated the highest achievement compared to other adolescents, mirroring the “model minority” stereotype. In contrast, the underachievement of Latino and African American males is a persistent and troubling trend that is found in children as young as 4 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0361684313480694">American Psychological Association [APA] Presidential Task Force on Educational Disparities, 2012</xref>). Nonetheless, our results indicated a pattern of ethnic similarities in math and science attitudes (with the exception of greater math value among African Americans). These similarities appear to be rooted in the effects of SES and immigration, such that significant ethnic group differences emerge only when SES and years living in the United States were not included as covariates. This finding is consistent with previous reports in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0361684313480694">Byrnes, 2003</xref>; Stevenson et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0361684313480694">1990</xref>) and highlights the importance of socioeconomic and immigration variables with regard to educational disparities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0361684313480694">APA Presidential Task Force on Educational Disparities, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0361684313480694">APA Presidential Task Force on Immigration, 2012</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section18-0361684313480694">
<title>Differences in Attitudes and Achievement</title>
<p>In light of discrepant findings on attitudes and achievement, researchers might consider asking not only why attitudes do not always reflect actual achievement but also which of these attitudes is most critical in future achievements or academic choices. Our findings indicate that self-concept, task value, and expectations of success are all predictive of achievement, although to somewhat varied degrees. That is, self-concept was the best predictor of math and science achievement, followed by expectations of success and task value. We propose that this line of research should do more to incorporate affective variables such as anxiety, boredom or apathy, enjoyment, and pride into explanatory models, given the findings of the importance of these emotions in academic achievement contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0361684313480694">Else-Quest et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0361684313480694">Else-Quest, Hyde, &amp; Hejmadi, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0361684313480694">Pekrun, Elliot, &amp; Maier, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0361684313480694">2009</xref>).</p>
<p>A surprising pattern that emerged from our data was that female adolescents tended to perceive greater task value in science than male adolescents. That is, in light of women’s underrepresentation in science, we expected to find more negative attitudes about science among female adolescents. From the perspective of expectancy-value theory, this pattern is difficult to explain at first glance. One possibility is that female adolescents’ more negative expectations for success mitigate the effects of their greater perceived science task value, such that they decide not to pursue science despite believing that it is valuable. An alternative interpretation is that this pattern reflects the specific science courses in which students were enrolled at the time of survey completion. That is, participants were not reporting on their attitudes about science generally but about the specific field of science they were learning at school. Almost 60% of the students were enrolled in a biology course when they reported their science attitudes, whereas the remainder were enrolled in physical science or chemistry courses. Given that girls and women tend to prefer biology to other science disciplines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0361684313480694">Miller, Blessing, &amp; Schwartz, 2006</xref>; NSF, Division of Science Resources Statistics, 2012; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0361684313480694">Prokop, Prokop, &amp; Tunnicliffe, 2007</xref>), this pattern of greater science value among female adolescents is consistent with our theoretical perspective. Continued follow-up with this sample will help to uncover how these attitudes shape academic behaviors, further testing Eccles’ (1994) expectancy-value model.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0361684313480694">
<title>Still, Attitudes Predict Achievement</title>
<p>Despite our findings of ethnic and gender differences in math and science attitudes, attitudes helped to explain a great deal of variance in math and science achievement. There was limited evidence that these effects differed between genders or ethnic groups, such that expectations of success predicted end-of-year grades in math better for female than for male adolescents. This finding, which suggests that female adolescents made more accurate assessments of their performance than male adolescents did, is somewhat consistent with the literature that boys overestimate whereas girls underestimate their performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0361684313480694">Cole, Martin, Peeke, Seroczynski, &amp; Fier, 1999</xref>). Moreover, in light of the nonsignificant Gender × Attitudes interactions in the other regression models, we are cautious about interpreting this finding.</p>
<p>Given the developmental stage of our sample, it is not yet possible to examine how the role of attitudes in predicting STEM <italic>choices</italic> (e.g., whether to pursue a career in technology) varies across gender and ethnicity; assessing this link is an important aim for future research and follow-up with our sample. To our knowledge, our study is the first to examine the components of Eccles’ (1994) expectancy-value model in four major ethnic groups.</p>
<p>The strong link between attitudes and achievement reported here is consistent with the other theoretical perspectives described in our Introduction as well, and these data are informative for future investigations of those perspectives. For example, future research on the gender stratification hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0361684313480694">Else-Quest &amp; Grabe, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0361684313480694">Else-Quest et al., 2010</xref>) might point to classroom mechanisms such as gender differences in being called on by the teacher in physics class, national trends in occupational segregation, and cultural beliefs (e.g., the perception that scientists are White men).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-0361684313480694">
<title>Intersectionality Remains Relevant</title>
<p>Our data contribute to the literature by examining math and science attitudes and achievement at the intersection of gender and ethnicity in a sample of urban youth. We expected to find ethnic variations in gender differences, yet gender differences and similarities were not significantly different across ethnic groups. Just as a finding of gender similarities does not imply that the investigation into gender differences is obsolete or unimportant, our findings of nonsignificant Gender × Ethnicity interactions do not negate the relevance of an intersectional approach. That is, an intersectional approach incorporating gender and ethnicity remains critical to the psychology of women. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0361684313480694">Cole (2009</xref>, p. 179) maintained that, “Asking where there are similarities encourages researchers to reassess any presumption that categories of identity, difference, and disadvantage define homogeneous groups as they look for similarities that cut across categories.” In other words, in identifying commonalities among women of different groups (e.g., different ethnicities), we can achieve a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of those groups. The current study demonstrates that examining these social identities simultaneously remains important to understanding the underrepresentation of women and ethnic minorities in STEM.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding potential similarities among women of different ethnicities, research must still employ diverse samples and confirm the applicability and generalizability of psychological theories to women of different ethnic groups. To this end, the current study validates the applicability of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0361684313480694">Eccles’ (1994)</xref> model—which heretofore had been examined primarily with regard to gender and in less ethnically diverse samples—at the intersection of gender and ethnicity. We reiterate Cole’s (2009) recommendations that an intersectional approach is an “antidote” to research based primarily on samples of Whites and that future research should use an intersectional approach to validate (or revise) theoretical models that have been developed or tested with unrepresentative samples. With regard to the ethical imperative for an intersectional approach, a psychology of women must examine Gender × Ethnicity interactions whenever possible to avoid reproducing societal inequalities based on ethnicity.</p>
<p>With regard to methods of investigation, there is much debate about how best to study intersectionality in psychology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0361684313480694">Cole, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0361684313480694">Shields, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0361684313480694">Warner, 2008</xref>). We chose to examine the intersection of gender and ethnicity with quantitative methodologies, which permitted us to study a reasonably large sample of youth from the community and collect data on a variety of constructs. However, this methodological choice limited our ability to obtain richer or deeper knowledge of how adolescents understand their intersecting identities in the context of STEM. Although our data examine how the experience of female gender varies across ethnic groups in urban America, quantitative methods limit our ability to explore the processes that shape these differing experiences. Quantitative and qualitative methods should play complementary roles to provide a better understanding of the intersection of gender and ethnicity; thus, we urge qualitative researchers to explore the issue of STEM attitudes and achievement and quantitative researchers to incorporate intersectionality into their research.</p>
<p>To the extent possible, intersectional approaches also should take into account diversity within a social identity, such as the subcultural variations within a major ethnic group. For example, consider our sample of Asian American adolescents: 48.2% further identified themselves as Chinese, Laotian, Cambodian, Bengali, Filipino, Indian, Vietnamese, Korean, or Pakistani. It is likely that these youth experience gender and Asian American identity in varied ways stemming from their diverse ethnic, cultural, and religious backgrounds and acculturative status. Although it is beyond the scope of the current study to examine these subcultural variations further, it is important to acknowledge that each of the four broad ethnic groups studied here represent diverse subgroups of individuals. Moreover, these subcultural variations are relevant within the current line of research on achievement, insofar as southeast Asians tend to perform less well than other Asian American ethnic groups (APA Presidential Task Force on Educational Disparities, 2012; APA Presidential Task Force on Immigration, 2012).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-0361684313480694">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Eighteen percent of the youth in our sample were born abroad—primarily in China, Vietnam, India, former Soviet Republics, or the Caribbean. This proportion is somewhat smaller than what is seen at the national level, where approximately 23% of the youth in the United States are foreign born. The importance of country of birth, or immigrant status, is relevant to academic attitudes and achievement. Previous research indicates that immigrant youth both report more positive academic attitudes and demonstrate higher academic achievement (APA Presidential Task Force on Immigration, 2012) compared to their U.S.-born peers. Yet, the research also suggests that these effects are attenuated over time, likely reflecting the influence of acculturation. Indeed, our data echo this trend, such that years living in the United States was inversely correlated with math and science attitudes. Given that a substantial proportion of White and Asian American students in our sample reported being born outside the United States, there is a potential confounding between ethnic group and immigration status. Although it was beyond the scope of our report to more comprehensively address the role of immigrant status, we included the number of years students reported living in the United States as a covariate in our analyses to address the potential influences of being born abroad and living in the United States. Future research on the intersection of gender and ethnicity should consider immigrant identity with a more fine-tuned approach.</p>
<p>Whereas our sample is exceptionally diverse with regard to ethnicity, the majority of participants came from economically disadvantaged homes. Thus, we cannot assume that our findings generalize to middle-class families. Students from households with higher SES, regardless of ethnicity, have improved access to educational opportunities and have more high-achieving role models within their families and social networks. These socioeconomic factors can shape STEM attitudes as well as achievement, and they likely interact with gender and ethnicity. Thus, future research on the intersection of gender and ethnicity should attempt to incorporate socioeconomic diversity in sample recruitment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-0361684313480694">
<title>Practice Implications</title>
<p>One of the implications of an intersectional approach in this line of research is that past findings of gender differences in STEM attitudes are oversimplified. That is, because previous studies on gender and STEM attitudes have either not included ethnically diverse samples or not analyzed the interactional effects of gender and ethnicity, our knowledge of gender and STEM lacks the depth required to make meaningful conclusions or recommendations for policy, particularly regarding students of color.</p>
<p>Thus, current educational policy initiatives aimed at improving the representation of women and ethnic minorities in STEM fields must be informed by research on the intersection of gender and ethnicity. One path to improving the representation of women and ethnic minorities in STEM is anchored in the influence of role models and mentors. In particular, role models have greater potential to recruit students into particular academic majors when they convey a sense of belonging in those fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0361684313480694">Cheryan, Drury, &amp; Vichayapai, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0361684313480694">Walton &amp; Cohen, 2007</xref>), and they may be a critical factor in students’ decisions about which fields are suitable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0361684313480694">Cheryan, 2012</xref>). Consistent with several of the theoretical approaches discussed earlier—including expectancy-value theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0361684313480694">Eccles, 1994</xref>), social cognitive theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0361684313480694">Bandura, 1986</xref>), and the gender-stratification hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0361684313480694">Else-Quest et al., 2010</xref>)—role models can shape attitudes and beliefs about STEM abilities and outcomes.</p>
<p>For example, in an intervention that emphasized identification with an STEM field and the importance of leadership and mentors on the persistence of gifted girls in STEM, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0361684313480694">Kerr and Robinson Kurpius (2004</xref>) reported improvements in STEM attitudes. After exposure to the full-day intervention program, girls’ self-esteem, school self-efficacy, and future-related self-efficacy as well as interest in pursuing nontraditional career choices were significantly higher at a 3- to 4-month follow-up. Although the study lacked a control group and thus cannot demonstrate causality, these findings suggest that, not only can we improve girls’ STEM attitudes by emphasizing identity and the importance of leadership and mentors, but we also can do so with relatively long-lasting effects.</p>
<p>Moreover, evidence from experimental research indicates that animated, computer-based, female social models can improve STEM attitudes and beliefs—including engineering interest, utility beliefs, and self-efficacy—and, in turn, math performance in middle-school students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0361684313480694">Plant, Baylor, Doerr, &amp; Rosenberg-Kima, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0361684313480694">Rosenberg-Kima, Baylor, Plant, &amp; Doerr, 2008</xref>). Moreover, given that these results point to the effectiveness of socially similar role models—such that younger, female models were most effective with girls—the visibility of such models and the opportunity for mentorship by them should be incorporated into STEM education at all levels. Similarly, this line of research should be expanded to include the intersecting identities of gender and ethnicity.</p>
<p>Although math and science are frequently discussed under the umbrella of STEM, it is important to distinguish attitudes and achievement in math from those in science. The magnitude of effects found here and the variance explained by the models indicate that, although there are some similarities between the two disciplines, they are not identical. Thus, it is important for researchers, educators, and policy makers to disaggregate these disciplines as they examine disparities in STEM participation. In particular, research on science attitudes should further specify which science fields are being referenced or assessed.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Women continue to be underrepresented in STEM education and careers, with only 8% of STEM jobs in the United States being held by ethnic minority women (NSF, Division of Science Resources Statistics, 2012). Understanding and addressing the roots of this underrepresentation is critical to combating the overrepresentation of women and ethnic minorities among the poor and to rebuilding the U.S. economy as a whole. Insofar as STEM attitudes shape our persistence and success in STEM fields, research on STEM attitudes at the intersection of gender and ethnicity remains essential. The current study contributes to this research literature by describing variability in attitudes and achievement at the intersection of gender and ethnicity, such that we found that male adolescents reported more positive math attitudes and female adolescents reported more positive science attitudes, but that gender differences tended to vary only slightly across ethnic groups. Despite ethnic similarities in attitudes, ethnic differences in achievement persist, even after controlling for socioeconomic differences. Critically, attitudes were good predictors of achievement. Overall, these findings should be used to inform programs designed to improve the educational outcomes among women and ethnic minorities.</p>
