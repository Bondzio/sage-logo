<abstract>
<p>There is compelling evidence that many youth exposed to community violence manage to adapt successfully over time. Developmental assets have been deemed salient for positive youth development, though limited longitudinal studies have examined their relevance for high-risk youth. Using the Developmental Assets framework, the authors test whether supportive relationships, high expectations, and opportunities build emotional resilience directly or indirectly via interaction with risk. Further, the authors examine the effect of neighborhood collective efficacy on resilience. The authors use multiwave data from 1,166 youth aged 11–16 years and data about their neighborhoods from the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods (PHDCN). Generalized estimating equations (GEE) were used to examine whether baseline protective factors in subjects’ home, peer, and neighborhood environments predicted log odds of emotional resilience at Waves 2 and 3 among youth ETV. Over 7 years, 60–85% were emotionally resilient. Positive peers and supportive relationships with parents and other adults had significant main effects. Positive peers and family support were particularly protective for witnesses and victims. Structured activities and collective efficacy influenced change in resilience differentially among ETV groups. Strengths-based policies and systems should focus on building developmental assets within the family, peer, and community environments for high-risk youth who have been exposed to violence (ETV).</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Over the last three decades, a substantial body of research has focused on the increased risk of psychosocial problems or deviant behaviors among youth who grow up in violent communities. Indeed, exposure to community violence (ETV) increases one’s risk of psychosocial, behavioral, and academic problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1541204011424735">Kliewer, Lepore, Oskin, &amp; Johnson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1541204011424735">Osofsky, 1995</xref>); however, it is not deterministic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1541204011424735">Gorman-Smith &amp; Tolan, 2003</xref>). In fact, the majority of youth witnesses and victims of violence subsequently develop into healthy, caring, and confident adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1541204011424735">Benard, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-1541204011424735">Werner &amp; Smith, 2001</xref>). The impetus of this multidisciplinary study was that there must be developmentally appropriate protective factors that youth are able to tap into, to tip the balance from vulnerability in favor of resilience. Few longitudinal studies have empirically examined the significance of developmental assets, that is, stage-salient protective factors that have shown to be fundamental for positive youth development, in building resilience among at or high-risk youth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1541204011424735">Taylor et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1541204011424735">Werner, 2005</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section2-1541204011424735">
<title>Need for a “Resilience” Perspective to Combat Community Violence</title>
<p>Psychological health outcomes have been the most common sequelae of violence exposure observed, that is, posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, or anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1541204011424735">Gorman-Smith &amp; Tolan, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1541204011424735">Lynch, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1541204011424735">Overstreet &amp; Braun, 1999</xref>). A resilience perspective suggests that being resilient does not mean a person is invulnerable to stress, but rather that youth may bounce back, cope, and recover constructively toward “normal” health in a few years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1541204011424735">Luthar, 1993</xref>). Resilience researchers have consistently shown that 50–70% of children under adverse conditions generally fare well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1541204011424735">Benard, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1541204011424735">Rhodes &amp; Brown, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1541204011424735">Vigil, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-1541204011424735">Werner &amp; Smith, 2001</xref>). Traditional deficit-focused research tends to focus on predicting negative outcomes, revealing that approximately 30% (20–49%) of the youth do not fare well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1541204011424735">Rutter, 1987</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1541204011424735">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-1541204011424735">Werner &amp; Smith, 2001</xref>), rather than predicting positive outcomes among a greater percentage of youth who are “successful” (40–80%, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1541204011424735">Benard, 2004</xref>) within the same environment. A resilience perspective suggests a shift in perspective of the researcher to hone in on elements of positive development that also occurs over time among youth who may have been ETV. In fact, researchers have hypothesized that protective factors are more predictive of positive development than risks are to negative outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1541204011424735">Rutter, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-1541204011424735">Werner &amp; Smith, 2001</xref>). And the ecologically-based protective factors are equally amenable to intervention, as risk is, and may contribute to reducing risk exposure as well.</p>

<title>Selection of Protective Factors: Theoretical and Empirical Considerations</title>
<p>Since resilience researchers have generally been critiqued for testing a sundry list of protective factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1541204011424735">Luthar &amp; Zelano, 2003</xref>), we explicitly identified the most robust factors that have been conceptually and empirically shown to be robust across disciplines for resilient and nonresilient youth. Also, we found that few studies have explored protective factors relevant to late adolescent through early adulthood years; hence, we also relied on developmental theory and youth development literature to guide our selection. Further, we focused on extrapolating factors at the ecological levels that are amenable to change.</p>
<p>
<italic>Previous studies</italic>. Resilience research within the context of community violence is in its beginning stages. Although numerous longitudinal studies have been undertaken in the last 30 years to better understand resilient trajectories of children exposed to chronic poverty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1541204011424735">Garmezy, 1985</xref>), parental psychopathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1541204011424735">Rutter, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-1541204011424735">Werner &amp; Smith, 1992</xref>), and child abuse and neglect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1541204011424735">Garbarino, Dubrow, Kostelny, &amp; Pardo, 1992</xref>), little has been done to document resilience in the face of community violence—despite its high prevalence, persistence, and magnitude.</p>
<p>Recently, several investigators have examined protective factors relevant for emotional and behavioral health in the face of community violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1541204011424735">Bowen &amp; Chapman, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1541204011424735">Gorman-Smith, Henry, &amp; Tolan, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1541204011424735">Hammack, Richards, Luo, Edlynn, &amp; Roy, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1541204011424735">Kliewer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1541204011424735">Lynch &amp; Cicchetti, 1998</xref>). The majority have focused on different dimensions of family structure and functioning, finding that parental support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1541204011424735">Bowen &amp; Chapman, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1541204011424735">Kliewer et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1541204011424735">Kuther &amp; Fisher, 1998</xref>), family cohesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1541204011424735">Gorman-Smith &amp; Tolan, 1998</xref>; 2003), parental attachment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1541204011424735">Lynch &amp; Cicchetti, 1998</xref>), or simply presence of a parent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1541204011424735">Fitzpatrick &amp; Boldizar, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1541204011424735">Overstreet &amp; Braun, 1999</xref>) are protective against adverse outcomes—suggesting that resilience-based interventions should focus on improving quality of parent–child relationships and other family-level factors.</p>
<p>However, growing evidence suggests that parents may not be able to compensate for the negative effects of ETV beyond a certain threshold level of risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1541204011424735">Hammack et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1541204011424735">Kliewer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1541204011424735">Luthar &amp; Goldstein, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1541204011424735">Sullivan, Kung, &amp; Farrell, 2004</xref>), partly because family functioning may also be compromised in most dangerous neighborhoods or those exposed to high rates of community violence over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1541204011424735">Krenichyn, Saegert, &amp; Evans, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1541204011424735">Osofsky, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1541204011424735">Richters &amp; Martinez, 1993</xref>). Others have suggested that parent–adolescent relationships are generally at their worst during teen years and that families become of lesser importance as children develop into adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1541204011424735">O’Donnell, Schwab-Stone, &amp; Muyeed, 2002</xref>). This suggests that other external sources of support and resources such as in schools, peer groups, and neighborhoods in parallel deserve greater consideration. However, scarce evidence exists documenting the salience of community, schools, and peers to mitigate the effects of violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1541204011424735">Schwartz &amp; Proctor, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Studies that have examined protective factors for ETV have (a) lacked a clear conceptual framework to guide their selection of protective factors. For example, taking an ecological perspective, a focus solely on relationships would miss resources and opportunities in the schools and/or communities that may be equally relevant to overcome obstacles for at-risk youth; (b) focused largely on earlier development years absent consideration of expanding exposures postadolescence; (c) relied on cross-sectional or short longitudinal data, not measuring long-term impacts of protective factors; and (d) have not accounted for neighborhood-level differences in crime to explicitly account for the individual risk of ETV.</p>

<sec id="section4-1541204011424735">
<title>The Developmental Assets and Ecological Framework</title>
<p>This strengths-based study is guided by several interdisciplinary individual and ecological level frameworks. Many researchers concur that to fully examine the issues related to youth ETV, an ecological–transactional framework is required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1541204011424735">Cicchetti &amp; Lynch, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1541204011424735">Dawes &amp; Donald, 2000</xref>), which places the developing child within the dynamic distal context of their families, communities, and societies at large. The Developmental Assets framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1541204011424735">Lerner, Taylor, &amp; von Eye, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1541204011424735">Benson, Leffert, Scales, &amp; Blyth, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1541204011424735">Leffert et al., 1998</xref>) from the youth development literature offers a promising conceptual model for the study of resilience. Going beyond the prevention of high-risk behaviors and into enhancement of resilience, assets reflect core developmental processes operating at multiple levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1541204011424735">Scales &amp; Leffert, 1999</xref>). Search Institute highlights four external developmental assets including supportive relationships, empowerment, boundaries and expectations, and constructive use of time. They suggest that by means of positive experiences that meaningful opportunities and relationships with adults offer, reinforced by systems and policies, has tremendous benefits to protect youth from high-risk behaviors, and enhance positive developmental outcomes. The developmental assets framework is in sync with the ecological–transactional framework and has tremendous potential to complement, strengthen, and expand existing resilience research and practice.</p>
<p>Moreover, the growing youth development and positive psychology movement contends that there are external factors fundamental for positive development of all adolescents into adulthood, including for at-risk youth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1541204011424735">Luthar &amp; Zelano, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1541204011424735">Masten, 2001</xref>). Focused on youth as assets who develop within the context of their families, school, and communities simultaneously, the youth development perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1541204011424735">Lerner &amp; Galambos, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1541204011424735">Pittman, Wilson-Ahlstrom, &amp; Yohalem, 2003</xref>) offers great insight for the study of resilience. At-risk youth themselves have voiced the importance of having positive forces such as educational and job opportunities, connection with adults, and meaningful uses of their time as key for countering “the draw of the streets” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1541204011424735">Ginburg, Alexander, Hunt, Sullivan, &amp; Cnaan, 2002</xref>), and not just the absence of risk factors in their lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1541204011424735">Lerner, Taylor, &amp; von Eye, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1541204011424735">Ungar, 2004</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1541204011424735">
<title>Protective Factors and Resilience</title>
<p>Literature documenting the salience of developmental assets for an array of developmental outcomes is slowly accumulating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1541204011424735">Benard, 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1541204011424735">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1541204011424735">Lerner, Taylor, &amp; von Eye, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1541204011424735">Benson et al., 1998</xref>). Presence of one caring adult whether in the community, home, or school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1541204011424735">Luthar &amp; Zelano, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-1541204011424735">Werner &amp; Smith, 2001</xref>) structured opportunities to participate in meaningful activities that provide leadership, sense of responsibility, and decision making, as well as high expectations from parents or other adults have shown to improve mental health for all youth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1541204011424735">Benard, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1541204011424735">Larson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1541204011424735">Resnick et al., 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>However, the relevance of developmental assets for high-risk youth has been rarely tested. Only one exploratory study to our knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1541204011424735">Taylor et al., 2002</xref>) has found a positive association between the number of assets and competencies among gang members. Considering only the numbers of assets (0–10, 11–20) however, and not specific association of each asset to an outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1541204011424735">Price, Dake, &amp; Ruthie, 2001</xref>), undermines the importance of the few assets available to the highest risk individuals. Moreover, asset studies have not methodologically accounted for the context of violence or other risks that assets inevitably interact with. Low reliability and validity of the Search Institute assets instrument among ethnically diverse inner-city youth has also hindered such investigations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1541204011424735">Price et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1541204011424735">Price, Spence, Sheffield, &amp; Donovan, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Simply having a set of protective factors does not ensure resilience over time particularly among youth disproportionately exposed to violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1541204011424735">Mazza &amp; Overstreet, 2000</xref>). Youth exposed to violence may display average or better-than-expected functioning as a result of variation in “actual” risk exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1541204011424735">Luthar, Cicchetti, &amp; Becker, 2000</xref>), differences in individual characteristics including genetic variability, or differential exposure to assets in the environment. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1541204011424735">Benson (2002)</xref> found that youth under adversity who had higher numbers of assets were 7 times less likely to have high-risk behavior (33%) compared to those with an average number of assets (5%). They found that 40 assets explained 47–54% of the variance in thriving for all youth, over and above demographics; however, among youth with one or more risk factors, only 10% of “thriving” was explained.</p>

<p>In a review, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1541204011424735">Wandersman and Nation (1998)</xref> noted that, “research associating resilience to neighborhood factors is sparse.” Growing evidence suggests that neighborhoods matter for adolescent development, though most have focused on examining negative effects of living in poor neighborhoods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1541204011424735">Leventhal &amp; Brooks-Gunn, 2000</xref>). Few studies have explored how communities may come together to build resilience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1541204011424735">Garbarino, 1995</xref>). If neighborhoods, via institutional and social conditions, have the power to affect development negatively, similarly, they may have the power to influence positive development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1541204011424735">Connell &amp; Aber, 1995</xref>). This is in sync with others who recognize the importance of positive social processes within disordered neighborhoods such as collective efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1541204011424735">Jain, Buka, Subramanian, &amp; Molnar, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1541204011424735">Molnar, Cerda, Roberts, &amp; Buka, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1541204011424735">Molnar, Miller, Azrael, &amp; Buka, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1541204011424735">Sampson, Morenoff, &amp; Gannon-Rowley, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1541204011424735">Sampson, Raudenbush, &amp; Earls, 1997</xref>) and social networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1541204011424735">Garbarino et al., 1992</xref>) in preventing peer or parent-to-child violence.</p>

<title>The Present Study</title>
<p>The present strengths-based study enhances prior knowledge across disciplines by testing the relevance of theoretically and empirically based developmental assets for high-risk youth into early adulthood, controlling for individual and neighborhood-level risks. This study aims to (a) understand the main effects of protective factors on emotional resilience longitudinally, controlling for individual and neighborhood-level covariates; (b) determine whether protective factors moderate the association between exposure to violence and emotional resilience; and (c) examine whether neighborhood-level collective efficacy is associated with emotional resilience and whether it modifies the effect of assets on building resilience among youth exposed to violence.</p>

<title>Study Design and the Sample</title>
<p>Data for this study come from the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods (PHDCN), a community-based multilevel longitudinal study conducted in 1994–2002 of adolescents, their caregivers, and their neighborhoods. Sampling began by defining 343 neighborhood clusters (NCs) based on aggregated census tracts, representing every dwelling unit within the city. NCs were geographically sensible and homogenous in terms of race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, family structure, and housing density. In 1994–1995, a community survey was conducted in which an independent sample of 8,872 residents (&gt;18 years) were randomly sampled from the 343 NCs with a 75% response rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1541204011424735">PHDCN, 1998</xref>). A random sample of 6,226 children and youth within 6 months of ages 0 (in utero), 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 were also selected from a random sample of 80 NCs at baseline using a multistage probability design, for the Longitudinal Cohort Study (LCS). About 25 youth per NC were interviewed three times. A detailed description of the sampling procedures used in the PHDCN has been reported elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1541204011424735">Earls &amp; Buka, 1997</xref>). For the present study, the community survey, 1990 U.S. Census, and the LCS served as the primary data sources.</p>
<p>The final sample included subjects with nonmissing data at baseline, and assuming data were missing at random, the longitudinal models estimated values for the missing responses in subsequent waves. Values were imputed only if one wave was missing data. If more than one wave was missing data, then no imputation was done. Of the total 1,517 youth who participated in Cohorts 12 and 15 at Wave 1, 1,238 had complete data on ETV at Wave 2, 47 had missing data on outcome at either Wave 2 or 3, and 25 were missing data on at least one covariate. Thus, the final sample included 1,166 youth in 78 neighborhoods for analysis. Subjects dropped from the analysis (<italic>n</italic> = 351) were more likely to be Black, from single-parent families, and have fewer assets (family boundaries, collective efficacy, other adult support) but similar internalizing scores and ETV compared to the other respondents.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section12-1541204011424735">
<title>Primary dependent variable</title>
<p>Using a reduced 28-item versions of the Youth Self Report and Young Adult Self Report scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1541204011424735">Achenbach, 1991</xref>), a continuous internalizing problem score (0–53) was calculated. The scale included 15 items on <italic>anxiety/depressive</italic> symptoms that captured feelings of loneliness, worthlessness, unhappiness, or whether the subject cries or worries a lot; 9 items on <italic>somatic</italic> symptoms on feelings of dizziness/being overtired or having physical problems such as headache or nausea; and 4 items on <italic>withdrawal symptoms</italic> that captured whether the subject rather be alone, is shy or secretive, or refuses to talk. If fewer than 6 items were missing, then 0, 1, 2 responses were averaged to create the three subscales that were then summed to create an internalizing scale. Coefficient αs ranged from .86 to .89 at each wave.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this study, we categorized the number of youth who met the criteria for <italic>emotional resilience</italic> versus not, as adequate positive adaptation in the context of risk. We considered positive adaptation to be better than or average mental health functioning but not exceptional functioning, since we are considering exposure to significant adversity, that is, witness or victim to violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1541204011424735">Luthar &amp; Zelano, 2003</xref>). Hence, the internalizing scale score was dichotomized into 1 = <italic>resilient youth with scores 0.50 standard deviation below the sample median</italic> and 0 = <italic>nonresilient youth with scores 0.50 standard deviation above the median</italic>. We used gender-specific medians for all youth as the cutoffs versus <italic>T-</italic>scores to better classify emotional “well-being” as typically found in a nonclinical setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1541204011424735">Tedeschi &amp; Kilmer, 2005</xref>).</p>

<title>Primary independent variables</title>
<p>
<italic>Exposure to community violence</italic>. Subject’s exposure to 18 different violent events in the community in the past year was measured using the My ETV scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1541204011424735">Buka, Selner-O’Hagan, Kindlon, &amp; Earls, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1541204011424735">Kindlon, Wright, Raudenbush, &amp; Earls, 1996</xref>; Selner-O’Hagan, Buka, Kindlon, Raudenbush, &amp; Earls, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1541204011424735">1998</xref>) at Wave 2. This did not account for any violence the adolescent might be experiencing at home. Three subscales of (a) <italic>witnessing</italic> (7 items; α = .74), (b) <italic>victimization</italic> (7 items; α = .57), and (c) <italic>heard of</italic> (3 items, α = .37) were developed, as a sum of yes/no responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1541204011424735">Brennan, Molnar, &amp; Earls, 2007</xref>). The psychometric properties of these scales have been tested in diverse populations using item-response theory and Rasch modeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1541204011424735">Brennan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1541204011424735">Selner-O’Hagan et al., 1998</xref>). Based on the continuous scales, a categorical <italic>ETV group</italic> variable was also created to allow group-specific comparisons with 0 = <italic>nonexposed</italic> group who scored 0 on witnessing and victimization scale but may have heard of violence (1 or more acts); a = <italic>witness</italic> group had witnessed at least one act of violence in the past year, b = <italic>victim</italic> group that had been a victim of at least one act of violence and had witnessed one act or not. The size of the “heard of” group was too small (<italic>n</italic> &lt; 20) to stratify separately so they were grouped with the unexposed youth. Both continuous and categorical variables were tested, to account for the frequency and severity of violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1541204011424735">Buka, Stitchick, Birdthistle, &amp; Earls, 2001</xref>).</p>

<title>Protective factors</title>
<p>Items from the PHDCN that corroborated with Search Institute external assets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1541204011424735">Benson &amp; Leffert, 1999</xref>), that is, support, opportunities, boundaries and expectations, and empowerment, and the California Healthy Kids Survey Resilience module (WestEd) were identified at all waves. Since only parts of reliable scales were available at Waves 2 and 3, baseline data were used. Under support, <italic>family support</italic> (6 items; α = .73), <italic>friend support</italic> (8 items; α = .71), and <italic>other adult support</italic> (4 items, α = .53) emerged from the Provision of Social Relations instrument (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1541204011424735">Turner, Frankel, &amp; Levin, 1983</xref>) per factor analysis and item deletion reliability tests. If more than half the items were not missing, then an average score was calculated based on very/somewhat/not true responses. Note, previously validated and reliable scales were used as much as possible and placed within the developmental assets theoretical domains. For measures where new scales were developed, extensive exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, item deletion reliability tests, other psychometric analyses, and theory were used (unpublished to date). Under expectations and boundaries, <italic>positive peer influence</italic> (10 items from Deviance of Peers; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1541204011424735">Huizinga, Esbenson, &amp; Weihar, 1991</xref>; α = .62) captured whether friends model responsible behavior, for example, the number involved in sports/community/religious/family/after-school activities, considered good students or good citizens. <italic>Family boundaries and expectations scale</italic> (13 items from Home; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1541204011424735">Caldwell &amp; Bradley, 1984</xref>; α = .63) captured items on parental monitoring, and having clear rules and consequences at home. Under opportunities, sum of <italic>time spent in structured activities</italic> per week in school or after-school was calculated based on 2 items from the school questionnaire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1541204011424735">Furstenburg, 1990</xref>).

<sec id="section18-1541204011424735">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>All analyses were done using SAS version 8.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1541204011424735">SAS Institute, 1999</xref>). First, among the final sample of 1,166 youth, differences in protective factors, individual, and neighborhood level characteristics were examined by ETV group. Chi-square tests and <italic>t</italic> tests were used to assess whether differences in categorical and continuous covariates between groups were significant. Bivariate Pearson correlations were examined to assess the magnitude and significance of the correlations between the primary outcome, risk of ETV, and protective factors. Systematic differences between respondents and nonrespondents were also examined.</p>
<p>Next, Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) with a logit function were estimated regressing intercept at Wave 2 and change in log odds of emotional resilience between Waves 2 and 3 onto individual and neighborhood-level predictors at baseline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1541204011424735">Bryk &amp; Raudenbush, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1541204011424735">Liang &amp; Zeger, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1541204011424735">Subramanian, Jones, &amp; Duncan, 2003</xref>). Unstructured within-subject correlations of binary response between Waves 2 and 3 were modeled, partly to account for the temporal association between predictors and outcome, and to adjust for clustering. GEE was the preferred method of analysis as this technique provides a statistically robust model that adequately accounts for variation in the outcome that exists at multiple levels, as well as adjustments for expected autocorrelation across time (within-subjects) and space (between subjects within neighborhoods; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1541204011424735">Fitzmaurice, Laird, &amp; James, 2004</xref>). GEE further (a) accommodates missing data at various time points, (b) does not assume comparable growth across all subjects, (c) allows for inconsistent timing of data collection, and (d) in comparison to nlmixed, estimates group-specific parameters, not subject-specific parameters in relation to prototypical neighborhoods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1541204011424735">Hanley, Negassa, Edwardes, &amp; Forrester, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1541204011424735">SAS Institute, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-1541204011424735">Wolfinger &amp; Chang, 1998</xref>). First, a person-period data set was created in which each person had three records, one for each wave (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1541204011424735">Singer &amp; Willett, 2003</xref>). Next, data were structured with 2,332 repeated observations at Level 1 nested within 1,166 individuals at Level 2, nested within 78 neighborhoods at Level 3. Depending on the covariates included in the model, the analytic sample varied.</p>
<p>To test specific hypotheses, multilevel models were sequentially built starting with the null model with no predictors, adding time (age), primary risk variable (ETV group), Level 2 controls (sex, race, socio-economic position [SEP], family structure), and Level 3 controls (neighborhood perceived violence and concentrated poverty). Victimization (continuous) was also kept in the models since it changed the coefficient of ETV group significantly, and remained significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) even after inclusion of assets. To test for the main effects of assets on the log odds of emotional resilience at Wave 2 (intercept; Aim 1), individual assets were added to the fully conditional model; for the main effect of an asset on the rate of change between Waves 2 and 3 (slope), a two-way interaction asset × age was included in the above model. To test for the interactive effect of each asset with ETV (Aim 2), a two-way interaction term between an asset and ETV was included in the intercept model above, and a three-way interaction term was included in the slope model above to assess the differential effects of assets on slopes by ETV groups. Interactive slope models also controlled for age × ETV term but not age × sex as slope did not vary by sex (<italic>p</italic> &gt; .05). Note ETV was kept as two dummy variables with witness versus not and victim versus not to allow for comparisons across groups; and separate models were run for each asset. Age was centered at Wave 2 thus the intercept terms in the models estimated the log odds of emotional resilience at Wave 2 associated with a one standard deviation increase in the asset, controlling for covariates. Slope terms estimated the change in the log odds of emotional resilience between Waves 2 and 3 for each <italic>SD</italic> increase in an asset, controlling for covariates. Finally, the main and interactive effects of neighborhood-level collective efficacy and organizational services, separately with ETV and each asset, on emotional resilience were tested.</p>

<p>The percentage of youth who met the criteria for emotional resilience varied by the level of risk (ETV), ranging from 60% to 85% at any time point (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1541204011424735">Table 2</xref>). Across time, 59% of all youth were resilient at both waves, 11% nonresilient at either wave, and 30% crossed-over, that is, nonresilient became resilient or resilient became nonresilient. Victims were least likely to be emotionally resilient at both waves (50%), followed by witnesses (62%). Emotional resilience dropped among the unexposed over time, whereas it increased among the witnesses and victims emulating the unexposed by Wave 3.</p>

Collective efficacy was positively correlated with hours in activities, friend support, positive peers, and organizational services, but not with internalizing scores.</p>

<p>Next, Tables 4 and 5 display the final conditional models of GEEs, showing the association between assets at baseline and the odds of emotional resilience at Wave 2 (intercept) and over time from Waves 2 to 3 (slope), controlling for individual and neighborhood-level confounders. Note, only the fixed effects are shown, as random effects are not estimated per marginal linear models. The unexposed group had the highest odds of emotional resilience at Wave 2, that is, 3.10 (95% CI [2.25, 4.26]), compared to 2.25 (95% CI [1.22, 4.15]) for witnesses, and 1.64 (95% CI [0.79, 3.41]) for victims, conditional on individual characteristics and perceived violence in the neighborhood and poverty. Hence, witnesses (OR = 0.70, 95% CI [0.54, 0.97]) and victims (OR = 0.55, 95% CI [0.35, 0.80]) had 30% and 45% lower odds of being emotionally resilient compared to the unexposed group (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). Males had higher odds of emotional resilience, though sex did not interact with any of the assets; suggesting that all youth regardless of gender benefited similarly from access to assets.</p>
<p>
<italic>Main effects of assets on emotional resilience at Wave 2</italic>. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1541204011424735">Table 4</xref>, four developmental assets had positive main effects on odds of emotional resilience, that is, they were protective for all youth regardless of violence exposure. Friend support, family support, other adult support, and positive peers increased the odds of emotional resilience significantly (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), above and beyond individual and neighborhood-level confounders. For instance, an increase of 1 <italic>SD</italic> in positive peer influence increased the odds of emotional resilience by 22% (OR = 1.22, 95% CI [1.10, 1.36], <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) for the reference group. The intercept term remained significant even after inclusion of all assets, thus additional factors not considered in the study are likely contributing to emotional resilience.</p>

<title>Interactive effects of assets with exposure to violence</title>
<p>Positive peers and family support had borderline interactive effects (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .10) with being a victim (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1541204011424735">Table 4</xref>). More positive peers resulted in 21% lower odds of emotional resilience for victims (OR = 0.79, 95% CI [0.60, 1.04]) compared to the unexposed. Family support was also marginally <italic>less</italic> protective for victims compared to the unexposed group (OR = 0.77, 95% CI [0.57, 1.03]). Notably though, when we look at significance of assets <italic>within</italic> each ETV group: for witnesses for instance, each unit increase in positive peers (OR = 1.21, 95% CI [1.02, 1.43]) and other adult support (OR = 1.15, 95% CI [0.98, 1.36]) significantly increased the odds of resilience. The nonsignificant interaction terms imply that these supports were equally likely to increase resilience for victims and witnesses compared to the unexposed group. Friend support was more beneficial for witnesses and victims, resulting in 30% higher odds of resilience with each unit increase in asset, compared to an 18% increase among the unexposed.</p>

<title>Main and interactive effect on rate of change in resilience</title>
<p>Besides examining the effect of assets on likelihood of resilience at a single time point, we further assessed whether assets predicted the rate of change in emotional resilience across time, as displayed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1541204011424735">Table 5</xref>. Conditional on all covariates, emotional resilience increased marginally by Wave 3 in the base model (OR = 1.06, 95% CI [0.92, 1.13]). By Wave 3, emotional resilience decreased by 28% within the unexposed and 1% for witnesses yet increased by 27% among the victims. Thus, emotional resilience changed differentially by ETV group (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), that is, compared to the unexposed group, emotional resilience increased significantly for witnesses (OR = 1.21, 95% CI [1.01, 1.46]) and victims (OR = 1.55, 95% CI [1.29, 1.86]).</p>

<p>Greater friend support, positive peers, and hours in structured activities alter the slope marginally differentially for ETV groups. For instance, friend support at baseline inversely affected the slope for witnesses versus unexposed (OR = 0.84, 95% CI [0.73, 0.99]), that is, each unit increase in friend support increased resilience 7% among the unexposed; yet, decreased the rate of resilience among witnesses by 8%.</p>
<p>Within the witness and victim groups, the level of family support, neighborhood cohesion, and control also changed the odds of resilience from Waves 2 to 3, similar to unexposed groups. Thus victims with greater family support had less of an increase in resilience from Waves 2 to 3 (OR = .91, 95% CI [0.83, 0.99]), compared to victims with no family support. Similarly, for witnesses, each unit increase in baseline neighborhood-level protective factors was associated with 15% lower emotional resilience by Wave 3 suggesting that lower ETV group may benefit more initially from higher neighborhood cohesion and control, but the protective effects do not last.</p>

<title>Main and interactive effects</title>
<p>Neighborhood collective efficacy at baseline did not influence the odds of emotional resilience at Waves 2 or 3, above and beyond inclusion of all individual and neighborhood-level confounders including ETV and individual-level assets (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1541204011424735">Table 4</xref>). Collective efficacy however was a significant predictor of the rate of change in emotional resilience for witnesses; the effect of collective efficacy on the slope was robust and significant even after inclusion of individual assets and ETV group; though the effect on rate of change was not significantly different by ETV groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1541204011424735">Table 5</xref>). The decrease in emotional resilience was greater for the unexposed (OR = 0.95 (95% CI [0.81, 1.11]) and witnesses (OR = 0.86 (95% CI [0.77, 0.95]) who had higher levels of collective efficacy at baseline, whereas the increase in resilience among victims (OR = 1.03 (95% CI [0.93, 1.12]) did not vary by collective efficacy.</p>
<p>None of the cross-level interactions between individual-level assets and collective efficacy were significant; in fact, the more proximal assets (those with main effects originally), remained significant in most cases above and beyond inclusion of collective efficacy and the neighborhood-level confounders. Organizations and services had no main or interactive effects.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This longitudinal, strengths-based study explored whether multilevel protective factors build emotional resilience among an ethnically diverse sample of at-risk youth. Specifically, we examined whether developmental assets deemed salient for all adolescents, were protective for adolescents exposed to violence above and beyond individual and neighborhood confounders. Reliable and valid measures of assets tested among an ethnically diverse sample were used.</p>
<sec id="section29-1541204011424735">
<title>Supportive Relationships</title>
<p>Indeed, the role of supportive relationships in the positive development of children is well documented for health and mental health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-1541204011424735">Wight, Botticello, &amp; Aneshenel, 2006</xref>) though for youth exposed to violence, evidence is limited. While family support was protective against Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) in one study, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1541204011424735">Ozer &amp; Weinstein, 2004</xref>), the impact of support by friends was not in another and needs to be further examined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1541204011424735">O’Donnell et al., 2002</xref>). In our sample, supportive relationships were particularly strong predictors of emotional resilience for all youth including witnesses and victims across time, beyond individual and neighborhood confounders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1541204011424735">Gorman-Smith, Tolan, &amp; Henry, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1541204011424735">Hammack et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1541204011424735">Kliewer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1541204011424735">Krenichyn et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1541204011424735">O’Donnell et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Family support remained highly protective for all ETV groups at Wave 2 though less so for victims, as has been suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1541204011424735">Kliewer et al., 2004</xref>). It remained equally protective over time for the lowest and highest ETV groups. Among victims for instance, family support seemed to stabilize emotional resilience, not enhance it, as has been suggested previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1541204011424735">Hammack et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1541204011424735">Ozer &amp; Weinstein, 2004</xref>). This implies that support from family has strong and stable effects on emotional well-being even for victims, as has been documented for victims of physical abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1541204011424735">Lansford et al., 2006</xref>). This contradicts with others who have found limited protective effects of family cohesion or caring relationships with a parent on internalizing symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1541204011424735">Kliewer et al., 2004</xref>). Although we accounted for both family structure and function and controlled for perceived violence in the neighborhood, it is possible that family and friends functioning is also compromised due to exposure to community violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1541204011424735">Lynch &amp; Cicchetti, 2002</xref>). How violence impacts family functioning and peer interactions needs to be better understood.</p>
<p>As suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1541204011424735">Bronfenbrenner (1979)</xref>, the family and peer microsystems serve as highly influential factors for youth development. And per <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1541204011424735">Cauce, Felner, and Primavera (1982)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1541204011424735">O’Donnell, Schwab-Stone, and Muyeed (2002)</xref>, the impact of support varies by the source of social support—so we looked at friend versus family versus other adult support separately. In our study, friend support was more protective for witnesses and victims than the unexposed group initially; though, positive effects of friends did not last across time for witnesses or victims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1541204011424735">Schwartz &amp; Proctor, 2000</xref>). In fact, having friend support at baseline, and becoming a witness to violence, seemed to have a negative effect on the mental health of the witness group. Interestingly, having “other” adult support and neighborhood support/cohesion at baseline did not influence emotional resilience in later years.</p>

<sec id="section30-1541204011424735">
<title>Opportunities for Meaningful Participation</title>
<p>Numerous investigators have noted the benefits of participating in meaningful activities such as sports, drama, arts on mental health and related outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1541204011424735">Bell &amp; Suggs, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1541204011424735">McNeal, 1998</xref>); however, few have explored the benefits for at-risk youth longitudinally. We found that hours spent in structured activities during early adolescent years had a significant effect on building emotional resilience among the unexposed group only. Structured activities did not buffer the effects of being a witness or victim at Wave 2; but they did influence the rate of change in development of resilience differentially by ETV groups. Thus, victims who spent more hours per week in school-based or after-school activities at baseline had a slower increase in emotional resilience after Wave 2 and unexposed had a slower decrease. Since the unexposed group had significantly higher odds of resilience at Wave 2, some tendency toward the “mean” is expected. However, it also suggests that having participated in structured activities at baseline does not buffer the effects of subsequently becoming a witness or a victim to violence. Future studies should consider the benefits of participation in activities after exposure to violence, accounting for the decrease in opportunities for 18- to 24-year-olds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1541204011424735">Pittman et al., 2003</xref>), and cover a broader range of outcomes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section31-1541204011424735">
<title>Boundaries and Expectations</title>
<p>Research shows that high expectations and boundaries set by parents, teachers, and peers can have both positive and negative effects on the child (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1541204011424735">Crosnoe, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1541204011424735">Leffert et al., 1998</xref>). In this study, we found that having positive peers increased the odds of emotional resilience for all youth, beyond individual and neighborhood risks. This finding is consistent with others that have shown the importance of having positive friends particularly during adolescent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1541204011424735">Crosnoe, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1541204011424735">Leffert et al., 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>The effects of positive peers on both emotional resilience at Wave 2 or across time varied by the ETV group such that victims with positive peers benefited less at baseline than the unexposed group. In terms of the rate of change, resilience dropped further for witnesses with each unit increase in positive peers, whereas the unexposed group had slower decline longitudinally. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1541204011424735">O’Donnell et al. (2002)</xref> also found that peer support surprisingly increased the odds of depression among witnesses. Indeed, it is possible that having positive peers who are good students, good citizens, and honest individuals, could have a negative psychological effect on youth who become witnesses to violence as they might feel relatively more anxiety and distress while trying to meet the expectations of “well-functioning” peers, especially in the context of a school and community which they now perceive to be violent. Another explanation may be that deviant friends (who may also have been exposed to violence) may provide more positive emotional support for at-risk youth.</p>
<p>We also found that victims benefited the most from having assets in their lives, for example, friend support. Given that youth with highest ETV (and generally other risks) also have the lowest average number of assets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1541204011424735">Lerner, Taylor, &amp; von Eye, 2002</xref>), it would be particularly useful to build external assets in families and peers for the highest risk youth as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1541204011424735">O’Donnell (2002)</xref> notes that “they not only need these services the most but also will benefit the most from them.”</p>
<p>There may be a number of mechanisms by which assets might translate into emotional resilience within the context of community violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1541204011424735">Rutter, 1987</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1541204011424735">1995</xref>). For instance, assets might (a) reduce actual exposure to violence, for example, participating in sports would prevent ETV during after-school hours; (b) reduce the impact or trauma associated with violence or enhance coping, for example, talking to caring adults may provide a venue to disclose distress; (c) reduce the negative chain of events from ETV, for example, youth who have witnessed violence may not associate with deviant peers; or (d) enhance self-esteem via positive peer relations or access to meaningful opportunities, due to involvement in extracurricular activities or volunteer work.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section32-1541204011424735">
<title>Neighborhood-Level Collective Efficacy</title>
<p>Finally, neighborhood-level cohesion and control, individually or as a composite of collective efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1541204011424735">Sampson et al., 1997</xref>), did not influence emotional resilience at any single time point but increased resilience over time, especially for victims. Other longitudinal studies have found that neighborhood cohesion or quality does not protect against the effects of violence to influence adjustment among at-risk youth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1541204011424735">Furstenburg &amp; Hughes, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1541204011424735">Kliewer et al., 2004</xref>). Though slightly protective (2–8%) for all groups at Wave 2, by Wave 3 odds of emotional resilience dropped significantly among witnesses and unexposed living in a cohesive community; whereas victims in a cohesive community continued to have increased odds of emotional resilience. This suggests that living in a caring community improves emotional well-being of a lower risk group initially, whereas trust and cohesion in a community protects victims against increase in vulnerability or embodiment of stress over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1541204011424735">Luthar et al., 2000</xref>). Given that limited factors have been found to be protective for the highest risk individuals, this study suggests that community capacity building efforts may be particularly useful interventions in sustaining emotional resilience for victims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1541204011424735">Wolkow &amp; Ferguson, 2001</xref>). This study furthers the robustness of the collective efficacy construct toward building resilience, an unexplored area of research deserving greater attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1541204011424735">Wandersman &amp; Nation, 1998</xref>). Future neighborhood inquiries on resilience would benefit from capturing changes in collective efficacy at subsequent time points, and assessing positive developmental trajectories over a longer life span.</p>
<p>Moreover, despite widespread recognition that direct neighborhood effects are rather small and that they largely operate through proximal forces, little is known about the specific ways by which neighborhoods influence resilience. Many communities throughout the United States, in an attempt to combat violence, are turning to organizing residents and building cohesion, yet how a distal community process translates into resilience among its youth is largely unknown. Understanding how collective efficacy works through proximal forces would further the salience of this powerful construct.</p>
<p>Our study findings suggest that as youth in urban neighborhoods negotiate healthy development, within the context of violence and other risks, there are factors in the expanding social spheres such as support from family, friends, or other adults, having positive peers, neighborhood control, cohesion, and time spent in structured activities that may buffer the effects of violence and subsequently build emotional resilience. Peers and communities may become more important as youth age past adolescence. Family support also carries potential to protect against the effects of witnessing greater acts of violence longitudinally. Identifying interactive processes by which schools, families, and community together influence positive development also deserves greater attention.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section33-1541204011424735">
<title>Limitations and Strengths</title>
<p>This study has several limitations. First, protective factors were measured at baseline only, thus they do not account for changes in the neighborhoods, friends, or family over the length of the observation period. Future studies should consider additive effects of protective factors over time, and measuring all theoretically relevant assets if possible. Also, school-level factors were not considered partly due to limited availability of data. Next, ETV was measured comprehensively at Wave 2 only, limiting our ability to measure the benefits of protective factors after a youth was exposed to violence. An ideal study design would capture time-varying ETV and exclude abuse in the family. Third, all data regarding individuals, peers, and families were based on youth self-reports that may be subject to recall bias or social desirability (neighborhood measures came from an independent sample of adults). Future studies may consider triangulating the measures of protective factors with secondary sources of data from schools, and/or parental, peer, and teacher assessments. Next, the results are limited to urban youth in one city, thus may not be generalizable nationally or to suburban or rural areas.</p>
<p>The study’s strengths include its multilevel design that allowed an ecological–developmental theory analysis. The use of longitudinal data allowed for accounting of some of the temporal ambiguity between exposure and outcomes. In most cases, standardized, conceptually relevant measures were used. Covariates were used at each level, including neighborhood-level risk.</p>

<sec id="section34-1541204011424735">
<title>Implications for Practice and Research</title>
<p>This prospective study identified multiple environmental factors associated with positive development for at-risk youth. Future studies should continue to combine knowledge from multiple disciplines to better conceptualize and test multidimensional competence particularly among victims, using a broader array of protective factors at multiple levels. Researchers should follow youth into adulthood, accounting for the dynamic changes in risk, protection, and resilient functioning over a longer life span. Modeling trajectories or person-focused analysis will possibly capture the process of recovery and adaptation from violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1541204011424735">Crockett, Moilanen, Raffaelli, &amp; Randall, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1541204011424735">Masten, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1541204011424735">Obradovic, Burt, &amp; Masten, 2006</xref>). Use of rigorous qualitative and quantitative methods to operationalize and measure positive stage-salient outcomes should be employed, and analyses should be stratified by race and gender to better represent population-specific exposures and outcomes.</p>
<p>In sum, researchers, practitioners, and society as a whole need to acknowledge the achievements and successes attained by most youth in urban neighborhoods who despite overwhelming adversities manage to develop into “caring, confident, and contributing adults” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-1541204011424735">Werner &amp; Smith, 2001</xref>). There are indeed events, characteristics, and environments that can protect youth from harm and guide them toward positive development. In addition to prevention of underlying root causes of violence, public health interventions should focus on building assets in the schools, families, and communities in urban neighborhoods.</p>
