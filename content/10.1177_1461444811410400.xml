<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Mobile-to-mobile text messaging, known as short message services (SMS), was the gateway technology that began the transformation of the cellular phone from a device providing the single, though radical, function of mobile telephony into a multimodal information and communication technology (ICT) offering users a wide array of media consumption, production, and publication; information/media delivery; and interpersonal communication options. Although the popularity of texting, which spread from Scandinavia to the rest of the world in less than a decade, caught phone manufacturers and service providers somewhat off guard, they were already working on a second wave of services. A few companies, including Nokia, saw huge potential for a whole new category of products and services around the concept of mobile phones embedded with cameras. Nokia unveiled its first camera phone equipped with picture-messaging capabilities, known as multimedia messaging services (MMS), for the general market in 2002. Only five years later, the number of camera phones sold surpassed the one billion mark in 2007 and will likely be in the hands of one-third of the world population in 2011. So far the ability to take, store, view, and post (online) digital images has been the main ‘killer app,’ as opposed to the ability to send photos mobile-to-mobile. Unlike SMS, the main use envisioned for MMS, phone-to-phone picture messaging, failed to garner much interest from users in its first half decade on the commercial market. ‘MMS has not really found its place in the market,’ said analyst Dave McQueen in a 2006 industry report on mobile phone sales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1461444811410400">BBC News, 2006</xref>). ‘People may be happy to use the camera but not know how to send a picture message. In some cases you may have to push up to 12 buttons to send something, so the pressure is on software developers to make it easy to navigate.’</p>
<p>Even though MMS has not been adopted in the specific way manufacturers initially envisioned and hoped, picture taking and messaging via camera phones has undoubtedly become an integral aspect of contemporary culture in a relatively short timeframe. In his discussion of the role that camera phones have assumed in society, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1461444811410400">David (2010)</xref> makes an observation often noted elsewhere in the popular and academic press in recent years that ‘Thanks to camera phones, we can share images of our lives more frequently and more quickly, sometimes even instantly: life streamed … Nowadays, when we witness an unexpected event, chances are it will be our camera phone that we will use to document it’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1461444811410400">2010</xref>: 89). David and others (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1461444811410400">Allan, 2007</xref>) have studied the impact of camera phone use on news reporting, while others have observed how women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1461444811410400">Lee, 2006</xref>), teens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1461444811410400">Scifo, 2005</xref>), and artists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1461444811410400">Nightingale, 2007</xref>) use MMS. This article attempts to tell the story of MMS from its initial development up to the present day. It focuses on Nokia’s role in bringing this technology to market vis-a-vis how people have adopted it for a variety of uses over the past eight years. Nokia’s early investment and marketing of person-to-person picture messaging is juxtaposed to actual trends in user adoption and cultural appropriation, which in turn encouraged the company to deploy narrative practices based on perceived user needs and later to focus more on internet-based services, such as online image sharing. This study is modeled in part on Paul du Gay, Stuart Hall and their co-authors’ analysis (1997: 3) of the Sony Walkman as a commercial ICT whose cultural significance they argue should be assessed by exploring ‘how it is represented, what social identities are associated with it, how it is produced and consumed, and what mechanisms regulate its distribution and use.’ Similar to the Walkman study, the goal of this article is to highlight the complex contested ground onto which new media technologies are said to ‘emerge,’ while offering a partial, yet multilayered, snapshot of the first several years of a still relatively new, but already pervasive, personal media technology.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1461444811410400">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>The authors of the Walkman study argue that large transnational corporations like Sony and Nokia deserve to be singled out for critical scrutiny, because these companies create media products and ICTs that people all over the world use everyday to mediate and understand their culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1461444811410400">Du Gay et al., 1997</xref>: 2). In refutation of popular origin myths of technology, their study demonstrates that corporations do not accidentally discover or stumble on new technologies, which are then altruistically offered up to the public. In actuality corporations spend many years and millions of dollars in research and development (R&amp;D), including thorough studies of early users’ attitudes of new products in test markets, which inform savvy advertising campaigns that are tailored to the perceived wants and needs of targeted consumer markets. All of this effort toward product development and marketing obviously has some impact, though certainly not total control, over how people use, identify, and make meaning of, and with, new commercial ICTs.</p>
<p>The social constructivist approach of scholars such as David Nye and Carolyn Marvin points out that the combined processes of innovation, design, use, narrativization, and signification do have important social effects. Nye argues that, ‘because no single individual or institution wills certain [technology] changes, they are often mistaken for attributes of the machine itself. And once machines are perceived as active forces in their own right, they become part of the narrative’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1461444811410400">1997</xref>: 2). For Marvin, the history of electric media is not so much about the technical evolution of ‘efficiencies in communication than a series of arenas for negotiating issues crucial to the conduct of social life; among them, who is inside and outside, who may speak, who may not, and who has authority and may be believed’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1461444811410400">1988</xref>: 4).</p>
<p>The work of Marvin, Nye and the Walkman study illustrate how the cultural life of a media object, whether it is a mobile phone or an advertisement about a mobile phone, traverses a complex web of individual identities and appropriations, social meanings, institutional discourses, and corporate design rooms. To address such complexity, a common methodology for cultural studies researchers is to triangulate by examining the texts, contexts, and readers/users of a particular phenomenon within an appropriate synthesis of theoretical tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1461444811410400">Lehtonen, 2000</xref>). Following this approach, this article first reviews Nokia’s emergence as a global telecommunications giant and its early role in championing and marketing person-to-person picture messaging. Nokia’s efforts are considered in the context of some of the first user studies conducted during the early phases of MMS rollout from 2002 to 2005. Next Nokia’s marketing representations advertising some of its first camera phones are analyzed in terms of several of the discursive strategies and cultural narratives of picture messaging that they articulate.</p>
<p>The user-lead convergence of MMS with web-based applications of picture messaging has since developed into a number of diverse cultural practices. The goal of this article is not to privilege theory, advertising texts, user experiences, or industry initiatives, but rather to consider all of these to better understand the camera phone and picture messaging as an information and communication technology (ICT) that is also, always, a cultural object and phenomenon influenced by human and non-human factors. While it is the non-human capabilities of technology that garner our fascination – such as the ability to quickly transmit over large distances a visual snapshot of one’s existence – it is humans who engineer these capabilities and humans who figure out different ways to use technology to communicate.</p>

<sec id="section2-1461444811410400">
<title>Nokia</title>
<p>Nokia has consistently been the dominant manufacturer of camera phones and continues to be the largest seller of mobile phones in general. However, for most of its existence, the company produced non-communication goods for national and regional markets. It began as a paper mill in the 1860s as part of Finland’s forestry industry, but by the 1960s the company had diversified by acquiring electronics firms and had begun to research and design ‘radiophones.’ Focusing its efforts on the production of cellular hardware, the company emerged as a global telecommunications conglomerate in the 1980s. Nokia’s networks were extremely successful in the regional (Nordic) first-generation cellular market, as were its mobile automobile units. The company introduced the first portable model, the highly profitable <italic>Talkman</italic>, in 1984.</p>
<p>In 1982, 26 European telecommunication companies began collaborating to develop the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM), a regional second-generation (2G) cellular standard with higher usage capacity and more advanced digital services. Nokia invested heavily in GSM technology, knowing that this would be the standard for all of Europe in the 1990s. Nokia engineers worked for years debugging many of the critical services promised by the standard, specifically call forwarding and SMS. In 1991, the first-ever GSM call was made in Finland on a Nokia phone and a Nokia network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1461444811410400">Steinbock, 2001</xref>: 110). The same year, Finland elected its first non-socialist government in decades, and with it came an export-oriented economic strategy designed to revitalize the national economy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1461444811410400">Steinbock, 2001</xref>: 107). Just three years later, Finland joined the European Union (EU). These factors – favorable economic, political, and regional-trade climates, combined with Nokia’s preparation for GSM’s 2G rollout and the company’s long history of operating in competitive markets – positioned it to become the global leader in cellular technologies. In the 1990s Nokia was an early innovator and investor in third-generation (3G) technology, working closely with the EU’s technical policy-makers. 3G was designed as a global standard, which Nokia hoped would help to increase its share of markets in Asia and the Americas.</p>
<p>Nokia’s emergence as the world’s leading cell phone manufacturer was not only due to its work on 2G/3G services and standards, but also its focus on product and marketing innovation. Nokia had focused many of its R&amp;D efforts on products and services for the business world, but in the early 1990s the company began to adapt Geoffrey Moore’s theories of technology-adoption lifecycles to carefully research downstream innovations such as product designs and marketing campaigns aimed toward specific groups of non-business users, deviating from the strategy of upstream product homogenization favored by some of its competitors. Some of the company’s downstream innovations included heavy lifestyle marketing campaigns, artistic removable faceplates available for many models, nearly monthly rollouts of new models, and several new multi-model product categories with a focus on breakthrough models touting advanced features and ‘sleek looks.’ Nokia unveiled its first camera phone in 1999, which was a high-end model designed for business users. Over the next several years the company helped to develop the MMS technical standard and released its first camera phones for mid-range markets.</p>
<p>It is impossible to tell the story of MMS, and Nokia’s efforts to market it, without first understanding the development and popularity of its predecessor, SMS. In her excellent account of the evolution of SMS, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1461444811410400">Snowden (2006)</xref> debunks the inaccurate origin myth of SMS that this texting technology was an accidental success arising out of Europe’s conversion to the 2G cellular standard, GSM. As noted above, texting via SMS was actually one of the main features that GSM was specifically designed to accommodate. The surprise element of SMS was not the technology itself, she argues, but how people used it and how popular it became, especially among teens. She notes that although the industry failed to project youth as a significant market segment, it quickly adjusted its marketing and pricing strategies to profit from this unexpected phenomenon. Industry’s quick response to user innovation is equally as apparent looking at the history of MMS where the success of this new commercial service again came in ways not anticipated by Nokia and other companies, who nonetheless sought to capitalize on people’s creative and eventually popular uses of this technology.</p>
<sec id="section3-1461444811410400">
<title>MMS: The early years</title>
<p>As with SMS, Nokia was one of the first companies to heavily invest in and promote MMS. In the 1990s, the company’s R&amp;D expenditures went from under FIM (Finnish marrka) 2b a year in 1990 to over FIM 10b (approx. €1.7b) in 1999 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1461444811410400">Steinbock, 2001</xref>: 200), with the main R&amp;D focus on developing 2G and 3G mobile services such as MMS and WAP, the Wireless Access Protocol designed to connect mobiles to internet services. However, the initial commercial launch of MMS came at a time when the industry was lukewarm for new innovations after the first commercial application of WAP, to allow users to browse webpages on their phones, failed to come close to revenue projections. The head of mobile phone products at Motorola, Ronald Garriques, voiced the industry’s cautious approach to MMS in 2002 and its surprise over Nokia’s proactive stance. ‘The last thing we want to do is have [multimedia] phones but services not ready. We do not know why Nokia is hyping [MMS],’ he said (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1461444811410400">Poropudas, 2002</xref>). Nokia was the only company to focus on MMS in March at the industry’s CeBIT conference in Cannes, France. Several top-level managers attended to present the company’s plans for the platform, which included launching its first commercial MMS phone with a built-in camera by mid-year, before rivals Sony Ericsson and Motorola.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1461444811410400">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Nokia bet that users would see MMS as a natural progression of SMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1461444811410400">Loubser, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1461444811410400">Pohjola and Kilkki, 2005</xref>), one that they would be willing to pay more for due to the extra value of sending and receiving multimedia content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1461444811410400">Nokia, 1999</xref>). The company thought that users would eventually favor MMS over SMS, since the newer standard offered everything SMS had with the addition of a higher character limit for text and multimedia attachments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1461444811410400">Ahonen, 2010</xref>). Early market studies by Nokia focused in on person-to-person and person-to-multiperson picture messaging, since these services were most like SMS and hence most likely to be attractive to potential early adopters of MMS who were assumed to be heavy SMS users (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1461444811410400">Nokia, 1999</xref>). Nokia’s Director for Mobile Internet Solutions, Pekka Pohjakallio, claimed in March 2003 that, ‘Consumers really want MMS and, as operators are already discovering, people are as intrigued by and eager to use MMS as SMS’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1461444811410400">Poropudas, 2002</xref>). Although Pohjakallio seems to paint MMS services as driven by consumer demand, actual consumers were not as hyped for the new technology. Only 27 percent of UK camera phone users in 2003 had ever used MMS according to one study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1461444811410400">Continental Research, 2004</xref>). Users in the USA were actually less interested in MMS in 2004 than in 2003 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1461444811410400">Zelos Group, 2004</xref>). ‘Apparently, usage has not emerged from merely experimenting with multimedia messages to every day usage, as has happened with SMS,’ suggested one Nokia research paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1461444811410400">Pohjola and Kilkki, 2005</xref>: 1). Ironically, the lack of early success for MMS was probably due in part to users’ fascination with SMS, which they were so happy with that they did not have much incentive to figure out how and why to use MMS.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1461444811410400">
<title>Early user studies</title>
<p>Similar to the literature on mobile phones in general much of the published research on camera phones, especially in early years, has been based on user studies. These early studies confirmed some of Nokia’s thinking about how MMS might be used, but did not offer much evidence that the technology would become popular. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1461444811410400">Scifo (2005)</xref> deployed focus groups and in-depth interviews to study the social uses of camera phones by teenagers and young adults in Italy. ‘The camera-phone represents a new form of extension of one’s experience and memory,’ she writes. ‘On the socialization level, it represents a new communication resource that can be invested in one’s peer group and in one’s relationships’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1461444811410400">2005</xref>: 3). The study found that social uses of camera phones could be placed in two categories. The first category involves face-to-face social interaction where the quick viewing of saved photos adds to conversation and the sharing of personal experience. The second involves the use of MMS. Scifo concludes that ‘notwithstanding the [low] number of MMS messages that are being exchanged at present between those starting to use this new process of communication, there are already clear signals concerning the spread of a precise culture of communication and the birth of a new language’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1461444811410400">2005</xref>: 5). The researchers distinguish three functional types of picture messaging. The first type includes MMS messages employed to induce an act, such as sending a photo of oneself at a local café to a friend as an invitation to join. Informative messages, on the other hand, might show where a person is on vacation or the score of a sporting match. The last type, problem-solving MMS messages, are used to reduce effort, costs, or solve immediate problems, such as taking a picture of jewelry to be sold online or of a street sign to remember an address. The study showed that at the time MMS messages were mostly limited to communication among friends and family, which was also supported by research sponsored by industry leaders such as Hewlett-Packard and Nokia studying how participants sent images ‘to increase or maintain group cohesion, express affection, support conversation, and tell stories’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1461444811410400">Kindberg et al., 2004</xref>: 1).</p>
<p>The findings of the early MMS research were similar to the findings of studies of SMS use at the time, which prompted Nokia and others to believe MMS would soon follow its path toward success. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1461444811410400">Caronia and Caron (2007)</xref> note that their ‘ethnography of a secret language’ of teen texting confirms other SMS research in showing that texting had become an integral aspect of everyday interpersonal communication among teens by the early 2000s. In 2004 these authors observed how teen users performed their individual and group identities through public performances of camera phone use and texting. However, although user innovation and performances are important in such creative interpersonal communication, another study of early MMS adoption argued that the designs of handsets/services can be key to deciding how, and whether or not, people choose to use them. ‘Technology enables these experiences, it defines what can and cannot be done,’ the authors conclude. ‘It determines how simple and easy it is for people to co-presently collaborate in its use, and how in new situations, users negotiate new uses and meanings’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1461444811410400">Battarbee and Kurvinen, 2003</xref>: 4).</p>
<p>Lacking the ability to quickly fix problems such as handset usability, cellular coverage, or MMS message interoperability,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1461444811410400">3</xref></sup> Nokia addressed the lack of user interest in person-to-person picture messaging in 2003/4 by trying to better understand user experiences of MMS and then using this knowledge to design new marketing campaigns for its latest camera phone models. One of Nokia’s studies during this period was aptly titled, ‘What is wrong with Multimedia Messaging?’ The study provides an end-user cost–benefit analysis based on the behavioralist assumption that, ‘End-users have various needs and wants that they can fulfill using an MMS service’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1461444811410400">Pohjola and Kilkki, 2005</xref>: 1). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1461444811410400">Figure 1</xref> offers the study’s conceptual model of how user experiences (white boxes) influence behaviors (grey boxes) involved in a person-to-person MMS. The paper isolates user needs and wants into three categories: ‘Flow. MMS satisfies some of my daily needs better than other alternatives;’ ‘Wow. It’s exciting to send an MMS;’ and ‘Show. My friends are using MMS. I must also’ (2005: 2).</p>

<p>The report notes that advertising can demonstrate the ideal user experience, but as the model illustrates negative experiences of bad coverage or confusing handset interfaces will unravel any gains made through marketing. The advertisement for Nokia’s 7650 handset, which is analyzed in the section below, applies the model for how people learn about and experience MMS and how this experience can satisfy their needs. The movie engages the proposed user needs for ‘Wow’ and ‘Show’ by demonstrating how two people have fun learning how to use MMS for the first time. ‘Flow’ is conveyed through the humorous conversation the two characters have using the combination of words and pictures made possible with MMS.</p>

<title><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Nokia.com">Nokia.com</ext-link>’s ads for everyday MMS</title>
<p>Advertisements are one of the primary materials that individuals and groups utilize to negotiate what mobile technologies mean to them, before, during, and after they use these devices. Since the 1980s, one of the most popular formats for conveying such meanings has been the lifestyle ad, which deploys codes of the everyday (typically leisure) tastes, activities, and consumer choices of a targeted lifestyle group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1461444811410400">Leiss et al., 1990</xref>). Nokia’s advertising campaigns from 2002 to 2004 for MMS-enabled camera phones focused heavily on constructing experience frames – ‘meaning structures that evoke, and allow reproduction of, experiences’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1461444811410400">Aguado and Martinez, 2007</xref>: 139) – informed by the company’s studies of end-user needs and wants. Nokia was one of the first companies to use interactive multimedia on its websites to offer audiences rich marketing experiences of new product categories, such as camera phones. As discussed above, the wide gamut of Nokia handset models available corresponds with the company’s detailed strategies for niche marketing, and in the early 2000s this strategy was played out on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Nokia.com">Nokia.com</ext-link> with each handset model having its own sub-site featuring interactive multimedia lauding the ‘Spotlight’ features of each phone. For example, Nokia’s 6650 model was marketed on its homepage foremost for its ability to record and send short video clips: ‘The Nokia 6650 phone makes mobile moviemaking easier than ever. With a built-in camera and MMS capability for sending and receiving clips, you can spontaneously share your world like never before.’ This movie offers a twist to Nokia’s typical lifestyle ads by highlighting the 6650 within a ‘lighthearted look at the evolution of imaging.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1461444811410400">4</xref></sup> The movie consists of four short animated scenes each depicting a historical era of moving-image reproduction from the 1920s to the present day. For example the ‘1980s’ skit shows a cameraperson holding a large VHS video recorder filming a woman playing a Rubik’s Cube, a popular handheld puzzle at the time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1461444811410400">Figure 2</xref>). The last scene shows a woman recording a video of her robot dog using a 6650 handset and then MMSing the video to a friend (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1461444811410400">Figure 2</xref>). The concluding phrase of the 6650 Spotlight, ‘YOUR LIFE IS A MOVIE,’ marks the last scene of this representation as having a similar function to many of the multimedia texts on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Nokia.com">Nokia.com</ext-link>: to connect Nokia phones to specific mobile lifestyles and their promised postmodern subjectivities enabled through the power of new technology.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1461444811410400">5</xref></sup></p>

<p>By limiting its depictions of historical eras of photography to the amateur as opposed to the professional arena, the 6650 Spotlight maintains the focus on everyday life found in most of the other multimedia texts on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Nokia.com">Nokia.com</ext-link>. Mobile imaging and messaging is presented as the latest groundbreaking technology, resting at the current stage of a progressive evolution of imaging that includes such well-known technologies as the first handheld 8mm and hand-cranked moving image cameras, which could be extended farther back to plate cameras and the <italic>camera obscura</italic>. Although each of these technologies assisted in turn the development of newer visual media, both in innovation and cultural form, each also must be understood in its own historical moment, which the movie reduces to nostalgia for 1960s clothes and 1980s hairstyles. In its day, the <italic>camera obscura</italic>, for example, signified emerging ideas about individual agency during the European Enlightenment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1461444811410400">Hillis, 1999</xref>). Hillis notes that by the 18th century the <italic>camera obscura</italic> ‘[had] been repositioned to confirm the superiority of an interiorized individual producing meaning on ‘his’ own, fully in concordance with the Enlightenment’s ‘discovery’ that a light within the modern individual can be cultivated through reason, taste, and hard work’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1461444811410400">Hillis, 1999</xref>: 47). For its part, the camera phone can be understood as a signifier for the postmodern individual who has at her command a host of ICTs enabling enhanced social and cultural experiences within the domain of her everyday life. The 6650 Spotlight movie realizes that camera phones seem to fit perfectly in an era of proliferating visual media. This narrative appropriates tendencies toward evolutionism in popular technology discourses to prop up the 6650 not only as the next big thing but indeed the heir to a long line of technologies that have progressively enhanced people’s everyday lives through personal visual media production. In fact as far back as the early 20th century camera manufacturers like Eastman Kodak have marketed these technologies as offering the common people control over their visual memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1461444811410400">Gye, 2007</xref>: 280). The Spotlight multimedia features on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Nokia.com">Nokia.com</ext-link> for the 7210 and 7250 handsets also focused on themes of amateur photography, this time appealing to the lifestyles of young, artistic, European urbanites.</p>
<p>Another multimedia ad on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Nokia.com">Nokia.com</ext-link> in 2003 told a different story of technology-enhanced communicative agency by showing how the 7650 handset, Nokia’s first camera phone with MMS, can be used for interpersonal communication using person-to-person picture messaging. The 7650 movie deploys what Aguado and Martinez call an experiential frame based on biographic assimilation where a demonstration of how a handset is used is performed within a life episode that fuses ‘social rituals and consumption rituals, merging the emotional and interactional consequences of both’ (2007: 142). The movie loads to display a yellow flower, with several of the petals detached, foreshadowing the romantic theme of the narrative. The text below the flower reads: ‘Kathy and Tom are discovering how the Nokia 7650 with MMS can change the way they communicate – especially during those important moments.’ When the play button is clicked, the movie progresses through a series of four frames, each partitioned into three sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1461444811410400">Figure 3</xref>). The narrative plays out a romantic comedy sketch where the two characters’ relationship seems at first to be in the balance, but in the end the only thing at stake was Kathy’s decision of which rub-on tattoo to put on her arm.</p>

<p>Although image and the text work together in the MMS messages narrated within the 7650 Spotlight, they are coded as conveying qualitatively different meanings. The functionality of a digital camera when combined with text and multimedia messaging is narrativized as enabling a whole new form of instant interpersonal visual communication: the transmission of a glimpse of reality-at-a-distance – a theme that was carried on in several of <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Nokia.com">Nokia.com</ext-link>’s marketing representations from 2002 to 2004. Although the focus in the Spotlight 7650 narrative is on the pictoral, meaning is conveyed and contextualized to a large degree through the words included in the MMS. The text words are complementary, not redundant, with regard to the images and allow for an even greater play of signs. As shown here interpersonal communication as mediated through mobiles can be very expressive, which ties into <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1461444811410400">Scifo’s (2005)</xref> finding that some small groups were creating their own visual language via picture messaging. Studies that observed the integration of users’ identities with camera phone use also seem to be acknowledged by the way the characters in the movie perform this messaging scenario. Considering that Nokia hoped MMS uptake would mirror the popularity of SMS, it is not surprising that the movie references the creative uses of SMS texting that were already well established in youth cultures in the early 2000s (i.e. the winking emoticon).</p>
<p>The movie’s introductory sentence not only sets up the story’s joke but also invokes the colloquialism: ‘It’s the little things in life that matter.’ Tom and Kathy are having a tongue-in-cheek conversation about a minor event in terms of an individual’s daily life, putting on a temporary tattoo. The act of getting a tattoo, which in many subcultures holds a variety of important political and religious meanings, is limited to a performance of identification with pop culture. The tattoo here is just a temporary fashion accessory. Its cultural significance as a powerful, permanent, political symbol and practice has been co-opted into an exchange value so that it is now accessible for the work of cultural consumption. Daily decisions, conversations, and signification make up the spice and substance of everyday life, something that popular culture constantly reminds us through forms such as lifestyle advertisements, television sitcoms, reality shows and soap operas. The 7650 Spotlight offers a vision of how this specific handset with person-to-person MMS can become a vital tool in the moment-to-moment adventure of daily existence and commodity consumption in postmodernity.</p>
<p>In recent years many contemporary scholars have been influenced by the work of Lefebvre, de Certeau, Foucault and other 20th-century critical thinkers to better understand everyday life as the essential domain where people encounter and live social discourses. One of these scholars, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1461444811410400">Larry Grossberg (1992)</xref>, argues that ‘the mobile terms of everyday experience’ dominate almost every moment of individuals’ lives in today’s society. He proposes the concept of <italic>disciplined mobilization</italic> to articulate how social discourses such as the constant call to consume help to regulate life throughout one’s everyday movements in contemporary culture. Thus, he argues that our collective condition of disciplined mobilization erases ‘the very possibility of the political as a domain, which both exceeds and transcends the everyday …. There seems to be no way out of everyday life, as if maintaining a life-style was a full time job which absorbed people’s energy and time’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1461444811410400">Grossberg, 1992</xref>: 300–303). Camera phones and image messaging have quickly merged into the fabric of many people’s lives, helping them to make meaning of the world through mobiles, but such integration might not equate to new levels of radical individual agency as Nokia’s advertisements suggest. While marketing campaigns for mobile lifestyles promise technology-enhanced agency in everyday life, these devices might ironically serve as facilitators of disciplined mobilization by mediating and typically intensifying rather than granting total control over the almost constant demands of work, play, and consumption.</p>

<title>MMS and the web converge</title>
<p>Although the 7650 movie’s romantic interpersonal-communication narrative portrays the potential ease and ‘fun’ of MMS, its vision of the possibilities for picture messaging still seems to be fairly limited compared to the explosion of creative personal media gone public in the social networking world of Web 2.0. Loubser argued in 2005 that MMS is well suited for users to upload creative content from mobiles to websites, since MMS media are already stored on a web server while they wait to be downloaded to receivers’ phones (2005: 4). It was around 2005 that the use of MMS to upload content to image-sharing websites began to garner more attention from users, service providers, and cultural critics.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1461444811410400">6</xref></sup> Moblogging (updating web logs, ‘blogs,’ with text, images, and videos using mobile devices) was just beginning to emerge as amateur innovators experimented with SMS, WAP, and later MMS to post messages and eventually photos to their blogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1461444811410400">Goggin, 2005</xref>: 5). Gerald <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1461444811410400">Goggin (2005)</xref>, one of the first researchers to study mobile blogs, notes that these early innovators seemed divided in their motivations for posting pictures to their blogs. Some were happy to develop a new way to talk about and share aspects of their daily lives with friends, while others hoped this new web-publishing innovation could offer more political agency. Goggin credits ‘Nokia’s creative seizing of moblogging with their LifeBlog product’ (2005: 1) as one of the first efforts from industry to commercialize moblogging as a way to encourage user practices that utilize MMS. Taking advantage of the way MMS already worked, any picture that had been sent phone-to-phone could be selected by the user for display on her LifeBlog webpage. Nokia’s advertising for LifeBlog focused on family-centered themes of sharing precious moments in life, carefully avoiding reference to moblogs and digital culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1461444811410400">Gye, 2007</xref>). LifeBlog was short lived however, when in August 2007 the company announced its Ovi Portal, which grants access to the Nokia Music Store, Nokia Maps, mobile games, and social networks from compatible handsets with MMS. Users can also set up moblogs for online photo sharing. Today Nokia hopes to cash in on the US $30b global MMS market (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1461444811410400">Ahonen, 2010</xref>) by promoting web application-to-person MMSing as a powerful multimedia delivery platform for accessing free and for-pay video and audio,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1461444811410400">7</xref></sup> mobile advertising, and location-based services for smart phones with GPS locators.</p>
<p>Moblogging was one of the first applications of MMS to spark user interests, but the technology has also started to have social and political impact in other arenas and industries. For example, picture messaging and posting has already had a significant effect on news gathering and reporting according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1461444811410400">David (2010)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1461444811410400">Allan (2007)</xref>. As evidence David cites six important news events from 2005 to 2009 where reporting was greatly enhanced by photos taken and disseminated (often via MMS) using camera phones: the 7 July 2005 London Underground bombing attacks; the execution of Saddam Hussain on 30 December 2006; the Virginia Tech University (USA) shootings on 16 April 2007; the 12 May 2007 Sichuan, China earthquake; the 16 January 2009 emergency jetliner landing on the Hudson River in New York City; and the June 2009 riots in Iran. David notes that private citizens’ use of camera phone technology to participate in the reporting of big news events paradoxically both reinforces and threatens the news industry’s gate-keeping role. In these historic examples, the camera phone users on the scene trusted the press by MMSing and emailing their photos and videos to news organizations, which in turn usually filtered through the submissions and published those deemed to possess the most news value. However many of these photos and videos were later posted to social media sites by the photographer herself or by others ripping and sharing it from the news site where it first appeared. Despite the copyright concerns of corporate media, the imagery of important global events is quickly spread throughout the internet. The user-led convergence of camera phone and web-based cultural practices is thus part of the larger emergence of a social media phenomenon becoming increasingly ubiquitous through user interests and the enhanced capabilities of mobile technologies. ‘It is in this fashion that objects or products that are a priori individual documents enter into the consciousness of the collective,’ writes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1461444811410400">David (2010</xref>: 93). And it is in this respect that picture messaging can perhaps have the greatest socio-political impact, where this ICT that normally functions within the disciplined mobilization of everyday life can on occasion be used to witness and make public important events, or to chronicle the everyday in a public forum to pull cultural and political significance from the seemingly mundane. In an analysis of the 2005 London Underground bombings as a pivotal event in the emergence of citizen journalism, enabled in part by camera phones with MMS, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1461444811410400">Allan (2007)</xref> notes that communicative agency is being transferred in part from news organizations to citizens within the emerging realm of <italic>mass self-communication</italic>. ‘Online news is an increasingly collaborative endeavor, engendering a heightened sense of locality, yet one that is relayed around the globe in a near-instant,’ he writes. ‘The boundaries between ‘local’ communities and ‘virtual’ ones are increasingly blurred,’ (2007: 19) with implications not just for journalism, but also for local, regional, and global politics, as well as the everyday lives of many people. Although news corporations are actively seeking to use MMS as a revenue-generating news delivery platform, many editors and publishers have realized that readers are just as vital to the industry as producers of the news, or at least as technology-equipped witnesses, as they are as news consumers.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1461444811410400">Goggin (2005)</xref> credits computer engineering guru Steve Mann as the father, or perhaps grandfather, of moblogging and internet picture posting due to his early experiments and advocacy of wearable camera-enabled computers in the 1980s and 1990s. Years before the first experiments with moblogs, Mann proposed merging imaging devices such as webcams and cameras with wireless network adaptors to allow humanitarian workers to document and instantly publish the experiences of oppressed peoples across the globe. Goggin helps to remind us that there are many narratives and many actors, human and non-human, that influence how technologies emerge in the world, in our culture and lives. The mostly linear and certainly partial history of MMS presented in this article suggests that the future of multimedia messaging and sharing as cultural technologies will continue to be realized through the complex negotiation between users (the active, innovative, and passive), the corporate sector, state policy makers and the cultures of these actors. It almost goes without saying that the day-to-day and year-to-year outcomes of these negotiations will have many important cultural and political effects. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1461444811410400">Nightingale (2007)</xref> uses the term <italic>mobilism</italic> to describe instances of ‘activism’ where people use camera phones to put personal creative and political messages into the public realm through moblogs. It might be very difficult to achieve temporary breaches of an overdetermined, disciplined mobilization of everyday life through the use of technologies that seem to engender a fascination with cultural objects, lifestyle performance, and daily happenings. However, it seems likely that the speed and public reach of a picture or video taken and instantly posted on a public website can possibly go beyond the creative visual communication currently taking place in some venues, and can in fact penetrate and help expand the diminished domain of the political and civic. One project promoting more socially proactive use of camera phones and MMS is HollabackNYC (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Hollabacknyc.blogspot.com">Hollabacknyc.blogspot.com</ext-link>, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1461444811410400">Figure 4</xref>). Hollaback encourages women to shoot MMS photos, which are then posted on the group’s website, of men catcalling and leering at women on the streets of New York. The goal of the project is ‘to raise awareness [of harassment] and empower women,’ according to one of the project’s co-founders, Emily May, who notes that HollabackNYC and its sister websites in Europe, India, and Australia would not have been technologically possible before camera phones and picture messaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1461444811410400">Corbett, 2006</xref>).</p>

<p>The proliferation of camera phones and similar networked mobile devices might suggest a balancing, or democratizing, of visual cultural vis-à-vis the corporate dominance of media. ‘To photograph is to collect the world,’ writes cultural critic Susan Sontag. ‘It means putting oneself into a certain relation to the world that feels like knowledge – and, therefore, like power’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1461444811410400">1977</xref>: 3–4). Yet although picture taking is an increasingly common aspect of daily life, a way of rearticulating personal experiences and worldviews, as a cultural practice amateur photography has until recently rarely breached the public–private divide. However these boundaries are being shifted through web-based visual practices like Flickr, YouTube and blogging, sometimes with overt socio-political implications as with the Hollaback websites. Cell phones breach these divides as quickly and often as the bodies to which they are attached, but the agency that this provides may oftentimes be more like Nokia’s version – centered around everyday remediation of one’s identity and lifestyle – as opposed to Hollaback’s version.</p>
<sec id="section8-1461444811410400">
<title>Final thoughts on technology, culture, and further research</title>
<p>The way Nokia hoped to steer MMS use, which was informed by the early MMS and SMS user studies, neatly fits into the discipline mobilization of everyday life. Nokia was well aware that this type of use – the integration of mobile-to-mobile picture messaging as a routine behavior of everyday interpersonal communication – would generate a lot of revenue for network and service providers. As outlined above, Nokia’s preoccupation with everyday use was not unique to its vision for MMS, but was rather at the core of the company’s entire downstreaming strategy geared around perceived lifestyle groups. Nokia was not overly rattled when MMS did not immediately take off. Instead, it tried in earnest to ‘wake up end-user needs’ with marketing campaigns that applied the early research on users at the time, while pushing hard to develop protocol for other services that might prove more popular. When a user-initiated cultural trend came along – moblogging and online picture sharing – the company jumped on it. As it did when MMS was in its infancy, Nokia continued to perform the mission it adopted in its 1999 annual report to aggressively pursue, ‘a leading, brand-recognized role in … stimulating the creation of new services.’ Still, as Goggin notes, that leadership role has moved to, and perhaps always was in, the hands of user cultures. ‘While MMS is akin to the planned if not ordained direction of development in which telecommunications companies would wish camera phones to go,’ he writes, ‘The intensive activity and cultural ferment is coming from the direction of Internet cultures’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1461444811410400">Goggin, 2006</xref>: 151). As shown in this article, companies work hard to dictate how people use new ICTs, but some like Nokia are also willing to cater to new user innovations if and when they become popular and profitable. From a critical standpoint, the danger in this cultural cycle of innovation is the missed or late opportunities that cannot foment, especially those that might do so in forms that could improve on the human condition as opposed to enhancing our already proficient abilities to consume. Snowden warned in 2006 that the ‘rapacious desire to manage and control SMS’ by corporations such as Nokia, ‘is now limiting the degree of responsiveness, or interactivity, of consumers’ (2006: 120), which may also now be true of MMS. For most corporations and many users, ‘interactivity’ has come to mean selecting a video clip to be downloaded and watched on a phone, and ‘user creativity’ is MMSing a self-portrait to an advertised number to have the photo momentarily displayed on a ballpark billboard.</p>
<p>One of the greatest ironies of the story of MMS is that despite all of the effort that Nokia put into designing technologies such as 2G/3G networks and MMS, the company seemed to get caught up in and believe the deterministic technology narratives that its marketing campaigns propagated: that technology itself (with a little help from advertising) would change the way people communicate – as if the use of the technology is built into the design as opposed to being decided by users. What is in the balance for society in this belief is to what extent it can influence <italic>how</italic> people use technologies to communicate. As Caronia and Caron write, ‘at the very heart of everyday life, individuals, particularly younger people, are not only the subjects but also and above all the co-creators of both technological challenges and related social stakes’ (2007: 31). And with an estimated 1.7b potential MMS users (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1461444811410400">Ahonen, 2010</xref>) in 2010, there certainly is a lot at stake for both corporations and uses. Users can adopt innovative applications of MMS that may augment their local civic engagement or enhance their understanding and commitment to geo-political issues. Users can also can accept, reject, or in some way negotiate the potential upcoming barrage of MMS advertisements sent to their handsets or the high prices sometimes demanded for video downloads, though they will often have to resist the heavy hand of technological design and marketing campaigns to do so.</p>
<p>As observed with the literature on mobile phone use, the study of how people use new media technologies has developed into a strong research tradition in the social sciences. Similarly, the study of the social construction of technology has a theory-rich and decades-old tradition in the humanities. However, the role of industry in developing new media is often left to journalists publishing in the popular press. There are far too few examples of individuals or research teams who attempt to take up all three traditions of new media research to better understand the cultural cycle of these technologies in the way that Du Gay et al. did in the Walkman study. There are of course limitations to this approach, as exhibited in this article, such as the fact that in the attempt to grasp a wider view of events there are many details left out. However this wider view is necessary to be able to connect the dots of the different players involved, and to connect the major players, issues, and events that occurred over years/decades through the explanatory lens of cultural theory. The development and use of many technologies, such as Digital Rights Management (DRM) and Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID), must be studied from each tradition, but also by researchers who draw a little from all three (and others) to account for the roles that corporations and user cultures have in negotiating the social and cultural uses of new ICTs.</p>

<p>When a user sends a picture using MMS, the image is first uploaded to a storage server using WAP technology, and a text message is sent to the receiver’s phone via SMS. When the receiver opens the text message, the picture is then downloaded from the server to her phone. This is a very simplistic description of how MMS works.

<p>In 2005/6 image services started to move beyond simple image archiving to offer, ‘more playful community activities, involving guessing and mocking games, and the introduction of tagging’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1461444811410400">Nightingale, 2007</xref>: 290). To encourage users to upload images and engage in various web-based services and communities, manufacturers like Nokia began introducing handsets with non-removable image memory to replace early models that featured removable memory cards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1461444811410400">Nightingale, 2007</xref>: 291).</p>

<p>Since 2002 Nokia has worked hard with the Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) to develop technical policies for DRM (digital rights management) to govern commercial internet download services using MMS as the mobile delivery system. DRM allows digital content venders to regulate, among other things, how many times a media object can be used and whether or not it can be shared among users and if so how many times.</p>
