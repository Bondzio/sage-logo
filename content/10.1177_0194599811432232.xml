<body>
<p>Pneumoceles of the frontal sinus are rare conditions, characterized by abnormal expansion of an air-containing sinus, together with either focal or generalized thinning of the bony walls.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599811432232">1</xref></sup> It is thought to result from increased intrasinusal pressure resulting from a 1-way valve between the nasal cavity and affected sinus. A respiratory epithelial adenomatoid hamartoma (REAH) is a tumor originating from the surface epithelium, with proliferation of glandular elements from this epithelium and not from seromucous glands.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599811432232">2</xref></sup> A REAH is a rare lesion that occurs in the nasal cavity, paranasal sinuses, or nasopharynx. A REAH located in the olfactory clefts bilaterally is very rare. A REAH is thought to result from an inflammatory process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599811432232">3</xref></sup> Here, we present the first case of a frontal sinus pneumocele associated with a REAH located in the olfactory clefts bilaterally and nasal polyps. It was treated with endoscopic sinus surgery. Before the study, informed consent was obtained from the patient, and the study was approved by the ethics committee of Shengjing Hospital, affiliated with China Medical University.</p>

<title>Case Report</title>
<p>A 32-year-old man presented to our hospital with a 14-year history of headache, hyposmia with progressive frontal bossing, and a 3-month history of bilateral nasal obstruction. The physical examination showed obvious bilateral frontal bossing and soft gray translucent polypoid masses in the middle meatus bilaterally. Sinus computed tomography (CT) showed soft tissue masses in the right frontal sinus, bilateral maxillary sinuses, ethmoid sinus, bilateral middle meatus, bilateral olfactory clefts, and bilateral frontal sinus cavities, with severe enlargement and sclerotin thinning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0194599811432232"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>).</p>

<p>The patient underwent endoscopic sinus surgery. Polyps were present in the middle meatus bilaterally. The mucosa of the nasal septum in the olfactory cleft area bilaterally was obviously swollen and rough with an indurated texture. The frontal recess mucus membrane was swollen, forming mucosal flaps.</p>
<p>Histopathological examination of the lesion revealed that the olfactory clefts bilaterally were covered with ciliated columnar epithelium, and the subepithelial glands had proliferated. The glands were lined by ciliated respiratory epithelium, forming circles or ovals of various sizes, and were separated by stromal tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0194599811432232"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref>). A frontal sinus pneumocele-associated REAH and nasal polyps were diagnosed. The postoperative recovery was uneventful.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We report the first case of a frontal sinus pneumocele associated with REAH and nasal polyps. We postulate that a minor inflammatory process created 1-way valve obstruction of the fontal sinus. The 1-way valve allowed air to enter into the sinus, such as while sneezing, but prevented its return. The positive pressure within the cavity led to headache, bony expansion, necrotic thinning of the sinus walls, and pneumocele formation. Once the inflammation had decreased and the high-pressure air had been discharged, the pressure within the cavity decreased and the headache was relieved.</p>
<p>Although REAH and nasal polyps may not play a direct role in the formation of a pneumocele, their presence can cause chronic nasal inflammation. The use of drugs can reduce the inflammation in the nasal cavity, but their effect is limited. With obstruction of the outlet of the frontal sinus and poor drainage of sinus secretions, obstructive inflammation can develop. This would give rise not only to a cycle of high pressure and obstructive inflammation but also to the development of a pneumocele. This situation differs from that of typical pneumocele patients.</p>
<p>Surgically decompressing the sinus should overcome this “valve” mechanism and eliminate the symptoms of pneumocele.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599811432232">1</xref></sup> We performed surgical frontal sinus windowing. At surgery, the frontal recess mucus membrane was swollen, giving rise to mucosal flaps. The patient’s headache disappeared postoperatively.</p>
<p>Because REAH does not have malignant potential, complete removal via conservative surgery is curative. With an intranasal endoscopic approach, it is necessary to explore the basement of the mass to ensure en bloc resection.</p>
<p>We report the first case of a pneumocele associated with REAH and nasal polyps. We found that the frontal recess mucus membrane was swollen, forming mucosal flaps. Our case supports the theory that a valve mechanism produces air trapping and progressive sinus enlargement.</p>
