<abstract>
<p>Objective: To describe the implementation and evaluation of a pilot multidisciplinary disease state management (DSM) program for diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia at a private, self-insured university (over 900 covered lives). Methods: Enrollees met with a pharmacist, nurse, exercise physiologist, and students in these disciplines to improve clinical outcomes and fitness parameters. Clinical values, quality of life, patient knowledge of disease states, and patient satisfaction were assessed. Results: Of the 20 patients in the pilot program, 17 completed 1 nursing and 2 pharmacist visits; 8 completed exercise physiology visits. At baseline, elevated blood pressure readings were observed in 64.7% (11 of 17) of patients, 20% of those with diabetes (1 of 5) had an elevated hemoglobin A1c value (HbA1c), and 82.4% (14 of 17) had a cholesterol value that was not at goal. At least 1 medication-related problem was observed in 16 patients (94.1%). At 3 months, all patients with diabetes achieved HbA1c levels at or below 7%, 4 patients attained blood pressure control, and 1 achieved normal cholesterol readings. Patients characterized participation in the program as valuable and convenient. Conclusions: Patients involved in the multidisciplinary DSM showed improved clinical outcomes after 3 months. Ongoing analysis of patient outcomes will determine the long-term effectiveness of the DSM.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Worksite-based programs focused on preventative care, wellness, and chronic disease state management (DSM) have gained attention in recent years as several large studies have shown improved employee health, reduced health-related expenditures, improved job satisfaction, and enhanced overall productivity after the implementation of such programs.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190011420725">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0897190011420725"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0897190011420725"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0897190011420725"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0897190011420725"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0897190011420725"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0897190011420725">7</xref>
</sup> Although data from these programs have shown a short-term increase in costs due to better patient adherence, this is offset in the long term by an overall decrease in direct medical costs including fewer complications of the disease state and fewer hospitalizations and emergency room visits.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190011420725">1</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The Asheville Project, which began in the late 1990s, was among the first pharmacist-directed DSM programs to show positive economic and clinical outcomes. Pharmacists and nurses worked with approximately 1400 City of Asheville employees to improve health outcomes and health care spending by providing health education, medication counseling, and adherence plans during outpatient visits. Although the Asheville Project showed an initial increase in health care spending (attributed to an increase in adherence to prescription medications), long-term decreases in direct medical costs (ie, fewer disease complications, hospital visits) were observed with a 4:1 return on investment (for each dollar spent, a long-term cost savings of $4 was observed). Diseases targeted during the Asheville Project included diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia (HL), and asthma.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190011420725">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0897190011420725"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0897190011420725"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0897190011420725">4</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Several colleges and universities across the United States have begun to create similar programs on their campuses as a benefit for their employees. One example is Diabetes CARE, a university-based DSM focusing on diabetes management by pharmacists at the University of Kentucky (UK). A self-insured entity, UK implemented the DSM program with approximately 200 patients. In a similar fashion to the Asheville project, patients perceived an improved quality of care and experienced improved clinical outcomes.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0897190011420725">7</xref>
</sup> Additionally, pharmacists and student pharmacists from other universities including the University of Minnesota and North Dakota State University offer medication therapy management (MTM) services to university employees.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0897190011420725">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0897190011420725">9</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>At the Ohio Northern University (ONU), the unique opportunity to provide a multidisciplinary DSM and wellness program for employees, retirees, and dependents utilizing faculty expertise not only in pharmacy but also in nursing and exercise physiology was recognized. As ONU is self-insured (over 900 covered lives), the University leadership had identified a need to increase wellness services, improve members' health, and reduce health care costs. The multidisciplinary approach envisioned for the DSM would provide enrollees with comprehensive means to manage their disease states. This rationale, along with the possibility to create valuable learning environments for students, spurred the creation of a DSM and wellness program on campus. The purpose of this article is to describe the implementation and evaluation of a DSM and wellness program (ONU HealthWise) at ONU.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0897190011420725">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>In the fall of 2008, a focus group of faculty was convened to identify the feasibility of a DSM program focused on HTN, HL, and DM. Faculty from pharmacy, nursing, and exercise physiology would collaborate to provide a DSM for individuals covered by the university’s health insurance (faculty, staff, dependant, or retiree). These 3 disciplines represent the courses of study currently offered at the University that prepare students to provide direct patient care, and each was charged to fulfill specific parts of the DSM: nursing faculty would be responsible for completing the initial intake visit and providing basic information about the program to participants; exercise physiology faculty would give expert coaching for improving physical fitness; and pharmacy faculty would provide additional patient counseling, covering topics such as education regarding disease state management (including necessary dietary considerations) and prescription and nonprescription medications. It was intended for the program to supplement and support the efforts of the community-based primary care and specialist physicians already providing care to program participants. The goals of the ONU HealthWise DSM program were to (1) improve employee health, (2) improve employee job satisfaction, (3) decrease health care expenditures, and (4) provide a unique educational experience for ONU’s students enrolled in pharmacy, nursing, and exercise physiology.</p>
<p>Once the framework of the program was established and presented to ONU faculty and administration, a pilot program enrolling 20 participants was initiated in February 2010. The intent of the pilot was to collect data with a goal of determining potential benefits and feasibility of the program. Enrollment announcements were made by the university president and ONU HealthWise program director during the university president’s annual health care forum held on 2 consecutive days in early December 2009. Additional announcements were made via campus mail and university e-mail. Patients were eligible for participation if they were university employees, dependants, or retirees covered by the university’s health insurance program. In order to enroll, patients were asked to self-identify as having (1) HTN plus HL or (2) DM.</p>
<p>Enrollees contacted the program director and were notified of their acceptance into the program by early February 2010 and scheduled for an intake visit with a member of the nursing faculty. Information obtained during the intake visit included the patient’s medical history, blood pressure, pulse, and weight. General information about the program was discussed and informed consent, a medical waiver, and an authorization for student involvement were obtained. Participation in ONU HealthWise did not require that patients release their results for data analysis or consent to student involvement. Multiple-choice surveys to assess patient’s knowledge of his/her disease states as well as quality-of-life issues such as absenteeism and presenteeism were given to patients before the first pharmacist visit and after the last pharmacist visit. Surveys were developed using (1) validated questions available for use from the Michigan Diabetes Research and Training Center of the University of Michigan Health System and (2) a published cross-sectional survey developed by pharmacists to assess knowledge of cardiovascular disease among community residents.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0897190011420725">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0897190011420725">11</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Pharmacist visits were held from February 10 to April 6, 2010. If the patient had not contacted the pharmacist by mid-March, the patient was contacted by the pharmacist to set up the initial appointment. Follow-up pharmacist appointments were scheduled 6 to 12 weeks after the initial appointment. At each visit, the pharmacist reviewed medications and provided medication-specific education and obtained specific laboratory parameters through the use of point-of-care testing devices including fasting blood glucose and a fasting lipid panel (total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein, and triglycerides). If the patient had DM, a hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) test was also performed to measure glucose control over the past 3 months. Blood pressure and pulse were measured at each visit, and weight was measured at the second pharmacist visit to identify changes from the intake visit. Education regarding each disease state, prescription and over-the-counter medication, and laboratory values was provided by the pharmacist.</p>
<p>Each patient who contacted the exercise physiologist for exercise counseling was required to obtain clearance from the patient’s physician. Clearance forms were sent to the patient’s physician by the practitioners involved. Patients were excluded from participation in the exercise program if they did not contact the exercise physiologist and receive physician clearance before March 10, 2010, at which point time and resource constraints no longer allowed for complete program involvement. The first 3 exercise visits took place with an exercise physiologist with student-led exercise sessions occurring on a biweekly basis after the first 3 visits. Visit 1 measured weight, height, 9-site girth, and body composition via Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis and 3-site skinfold. Fitness parameters such as upper and lower body muscle strength and endurance, flexibility, and submaximal aerobic capability were also measured. Visits 2 and 3 occurred within approximately 1 week after the initial visit and educated patients on proper cardiovascular, strength and flexibility exercise programming. The cardiovascular program included 20 to 30 minutes of treadmill walking at a prescribed pace and grade. Exercising blood pressure, ending heart rates, pace, and grade were recorded. The strength training program followed the cardiovascular component, and patients were instructed on a prescribed load of 2 sets of 8 to 12 repetitions targeting chest, back, shoulders, triceps, biceps, quadriceps, hamstrings, and calf muscles. Total body flexibility stretches were included at the end of the exercise session. A fourth and fifth visit occurred with the exercise physiologist to conduct posttesting, instruct patients regarding the take-home program exercises, and follow-up with the patient at the conclusion of the intervention period.</p>
<p>Participants who completed the program were provided patient satisfaction surveys at the final pharmacist visit. Surveys were completed by the patients in the absence of a health care provider after the visit and returned either in person or via secure campus mail or secure fax to the program director. Each component of the program (nursing, pharmacy, and exercise physiology) was individually assessed; participants were also asked to rate experiences with the program as a whole.</p>
<p>Students that had enrolled in an independent study or advanced practice pharmacy experience (APPE) with one of the faculty members involved were allowed to be with the nursing and pharmacy faculty members during their respective visits. Student participation included students from the third through sixth years of a direct-entry (0-6) doctor of pharmacy (PharmD) curriculum. All students involved received Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) training and basic education about the program. Third year pharmacy students shadowed the clinicians providing direct patient care and assisted with needed record keeping. Pharmacy students in their fourth, fifth, or sixth year were assigned patient assessment responsibilities and assisted with patient counseling under the supervision of a registered pharmacist. Additionally, exercise physiology students as part of their senior exercise physiology practicum requirement worked directly with participants who sought monitored exercise opportunities throughout the program. The Ohio Northern University Institutional Review Board approved the study. Descriptive statistics were analyzed using Microsoft Excel 2007 for Windows.</p>

<sec id="section3-0897190011420725">
<title>Results</title>
<p>During the enrollment period, 42 prospective patients expressed interest either verbally or in writing to the program director. Prospective patients were enrolled on a first-come, first-served basis; unless the patient specifically mentioned that they would like to defer to a more interested candidate, should interest exceed 20 prospective participants. Baseline demographics and characteristics of the 17 participants who completed at least 2 total pharmacist visits and consented to study involvement are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0897190011420725">Table 1</xref>
. Participation in the exercise component of the program was encouraged but considered optional as there would be a significant time commitment to exercise (minimum 60 minutes per session, 2 sessions per week for 8-10 weeks). As the majority of disease state education and counseling occurred in the pharmacy component of the program, participation in the pharmacy component of the program was considered mandatory. Three patients did not contact the pharmacist for follow-up by April 16, 2010, or elected to discontinue participation in the program, each citing time constraints as the major determinant for withdrawal.</p>

<p>Patients were asked at baseline to self-report goals for enrollment in the program, which tended to reflect a desire for exercise involvement and/or weight loss (n = 13). All patients had at least 1 abnormal laboratory value indicating that a disease state (HTN, HL, and/or DM) may not be at goal. An abnormal blood pressure reading was observed in 64.7% (11 of 17) of patients, 20% (1of 5) of patients with diabetes had an abnormal HbA1c value indicating that diabetes was not at goal, and 82.4% (14 of 17) of patients had a cholesterol value that was not at goal.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0897190011420725">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0897190011420725"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0897190011420725"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0897190011420725">15</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Sixteen patients (94.1%) had at least 1 medication-related problem as identified by the pharmacist (27 total problems observed). Medication-related problems were noted if a patient’s laboratory values and/or history indicated a potential undiagnosed disease state requiring treatment (n = 3, 11.1%), a disease state not treated (n = 8, 29.6%), a disease state not at goal (n = 14, 51.9%), or if a less expensive alternate medication was available (n = 2, 7.4%). Additionally, all patients received lifestyle counseling from the pharmacist and/or exercise physiologist regarding management of their potential or diagnosed disease states.</p>
<p>Upon completion of the second pharmacist visit, all patients with diabetes were below the 7% HbA1c goal set by the American Diabetes Association.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0897190011420725">15</xref>
</sup> Additionally, 4 patients who had an abnormal blood pressure reading were controlled by the second pharmacist visit. Similarly, 1 person who had at least 1 abnormal cholesterol value was later controlled by the second pharmacist visit, occurring 6 to 12 weeks following the initial pharmacist visit. Of the 7 patients who listed weight loss as a goal upon enrollment, 5 (71.4%) lost weight, with an average weight loss of 6.7 pounds.</p>
<p>In all, 8 patients received 3 visits with the exercise physiologist faculty member. Of these 8 patients, 5 completed student-led exercise sessions twice a week for 8 to 10 weeks. The 3 patients not receiving student-led exercise sessions were encouraged to exercise independently on a biweekly basis and pursue posttesting with the exercise physiologist at the end of the intervention period.</p>
<p>Upon completion of the exercise physiology posttesting, of the 5 patients who completed the student-led exercise sessions, 4 had reductions in total girth (average of −3.5 inches). One patient increased total body girth (+2.0 inches). Two of the 4 patients who had body composition assessments conducted showed reduced body composition (average −3.2%).</p>
<p>In all, 4 of 5 patients showed improvements in lower body muscle endurance (as measured in the sit-to-stand test); likewise, improvements in upper body muscle endurance (assessed by push-up test) were noted in 4 patients. Lower body flexibility assessment (measured by a sit-and-reach test) improved minimally in 3 of the 5 patients; no improvements in upper body flexibility were noted. Finally, improvements in cardiovascular fitness (measured by a 1 mile Rockport walking test) were noted in 4 of the 5 patients, with an average VO<sub>2</sub> improvement of 6.8 mL/kg per min.</p>
<p>A total of 12 participants (70.6%) completed both baseline and follow-up knowledge and quality-of-life surveys. Participants had generally good knowledge at baseline, and an appreciable difference in knowledge from baseline to program completion was not observed among patients as a group. However, for some patients, improvements in knowledge for certain questions (such as what values constitute a normal blood pressure and blood glucose values) was observed. Self-reported measures of absenteeism and presenteeism also did not substantially change in the study period as participants reported very low incidence of these issues at baseline.</p>
<p>Sixteen (94.1%) of the 17 participants completed the patient satisfaction survey. Participants were asked to rate ONU HealthWise program in general on attributes including convenience, communication, privacy and confidentiality, and student involvement (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0897190011420725">Table 2</xref>
). In addition, each of the areas of the program (nursing component, pharmacy component, and exercise physiology component) were assessed. On a scale of 1 (<italic>strongly disagree</italic>) to 5 (<italic>strongly agree</italic>), patients indicated overall satisfaction (mean ± standard deviation [SD]) with the nursing component of the program as 4.5 ± 0.8 (n = 16); overall satisfaction with the pharmacy component of the program as 4.7 ± 0.5 (n = 16); and overall satisfaction with the exercise physiology component of the program as 4.6 ± 0.5 (n = 8).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>ONU HealthWise is a DSM and wellness program at a private university that is self-insured and covers over 900 lives (faculty, staff, dependents, and retirees). ONU HealthWise utilizes a multidisciplinary approach to DSM, involving nursing, exercise physiology, and pharmacy faculty to coordinate the care of its patients; this represents a novel approach to university-based worksite wellness programs. Furthermore, students are involved in each facet of the process, allowing for experiential education opportunities across disciplines.</p>
<p>All patients enrolled in the study had at least 1 laboratory value that was not at goal at baseline. In all, 27 medication-related problems were observed, including laboratory values and history indicating 8 potential disease states that were not treated. Untreated disease states included HTN and HL, which are contributing factors to myocardial infarction and stroke. Medication interventions were made in many patients either through patient counseling or through physician contact, and 7 (41.2%) of 17 patients went from abnormal values to goal values in at least 1 area (DM, HTN, and HL). Although mild changes in anthropometric data were recorded in the patients involved in the supervised exercise program, all 5 patients recorded improvements in at least one of the 5 fitness parameters assessed (upper and lower body muscle endurance, upper and lower body flexibility, and cardiovascular fitness). Beyond clinical improvement, patient satisfaction surveys indicated that patients were very pleased with their experience in the ONU HealthWise program.</p>
<p>Despite a small sample size and short time frame, practitioners in the program witnessed powerful clinical change in some individuals. Providers within the study noted the professional satisfaction and development gained through participation in ONU HealthWise in the role of the health care practitioner. Additionally, opportunities for education and student participation were observed through shadowing opportunities and/or direct student–patient interaction. Employees appeared to generally approve of student involvement, as only 2 (12%) of 17 patients did not consent to student participation in their health management. Importantly, patients participating in ONU HealthWise reported that they thought their privacy and confidentiality were well maintained.</p>
<p>As was expected, challenges emerged as the pilot progressed. Communication between disciplines was difficult as departments were located in different buildings and physical travel was necessary to transport patient charts and other information. The future development and implementation of an electronic medical record is expected to alleviate many of the communication issues.</p>
<p>Limitations of this study are a result of its small sample size and limited time line of interventions. The small sample size was, in part, a function of limited availability of faculty practitioners. As this study was intended to be a pilot, outcomes had to be measured at a short time interval so as to assess whether the program should be expanded and continued in future years. Impact on humanistic outcomes was not expected to be drastically changed, given the limited time frame. Likewise, with the short time horizon, changes in cost associated with health care delivery for those patients enrolled in the pilot program were not assessed. Additionally, as enrollment in this study was voluntary, characteristics of the study population may not represent the overall population of ONU. Further research of similar programs with an expanded sample size and over a more extensive time line may be helpful to determine long-term costs and benefits.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>ONU HealthWise is a novel, multidisciplinary DSM and wellness program that has shown improved patient outcomes. Program participants showed improved clinical outcomes after 3 months and reported that they felt participation in ONU HealthWise provided a valuable service to the campus community. Faculty health care professionals also believe that ONU HealthWise provides a positive learning experience for students as well as an opportunity for professional development and growth. Due to the success of the pilot program, ONU HealthWise is currently being expanded with additional personnel and additional services such as nutrition counseling to allow for health improvement for more university employees, retirees, and their families.</p>
