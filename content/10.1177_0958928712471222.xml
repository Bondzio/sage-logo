<abstract>
<p>Are party preferences of atypical workers distinct from those in stable employment? The welfare state literature debates this question, but very few empirical studies have been conducted. We examine the German case, being an example of a welfare state with strong social insurance traditions where the rise of atypical employment has been conspicuous. In particular, we test the argument that preferences of labour market outsiders may not differ because outsiders share households with insiders. We find that labour market status significantly affects party preferences. Compared with standard employees, atypical workers have stronger preferences for small left-wing parties. Living together with a labour market insider neutralizes these party preferences, but this type of household is not very common. Moreover, atypical workers differ from the unemployed by not participating less in elections than insiders. Therefore, it is expedient to distinguish between different types of labour market outsiders.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The surge of atypical forms of employment has re-ignited the debate on labour market exclusion. In the 1980s and 1990s this debate was mainly concerned with the unemployed, even though atypical employment became more common in some countries as early as the 1980s. Since its beginning, this new labour market development was examined by national scholars in the countries concerned, but only more recently have comparative studies started to account for it. One important finding is that atypical workers often struggle to acquire full social insurance entitlements. Whether and how this gap in social protection will be addressed by policy-makers depends among other things on the political integration of atypical workers and on their party preferences. On the other hand, an alienation of this growing group from established political parties could have negative repercussions for democracies. Hence, comparative welfare state scholars should address the political effects of rising atypical employment. Do the political preferences of workers in atypical contracts differ from workers with better labour market integration? Do they support protest parties? Do they become alienated from the political process? What is their relation to traditional and new left-wing parties respectively?</p>
<p>In the field of comparative political economy the answers to these questions are contested. Some authors have maintained that labour market outsiders (unemployed or atypically employed) differ from labour market insiders (permanently and full-time employed) in their political preferences (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0958928712471222">Rueda, 2007</xref>). Others have questioned this claim. One important argument is that outsiders may live together with a labour market insider (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0958928712471222">Emmenegger, 2009</xref>). However, empirical studies on the party preferences of atypical workers are scarce and, to the best of our knowledge, nobody has yet tested the impact of household composition on the relation between labour market status and party preferences.</p>
<p>Our basic research question is whether and how labour market exclusion affects party preferences. We are interested not only in support for different parties, but also in the integration of labour market outsiders into the democratic process of party politics, that is, electoral participation and identification with any party at all. While our main interest is in the relatively new group of atypical workers, we also account for the party preferences of the unemployed. As is made abundantly clear by the current economic crisis, this old form of labour market exclusion should not be neglected in the stir regarding non-standard employment. In fact, it is interesting to compare different forms of labour market exclusion with regard to their political consequences. As the main argument against an influence of labour market exclusion on political preferences, we explore the role of household composition by considering the labour market status of the partner.</p>
<p>Given the dearth of research on labour market integration and party preferences, we have chosen to study one country in detail. Germany is a classic example of a Continental European welfare regime where the principle of social insurance has been deeply entrenched. After its initial de-regulation in the mid-1980s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0958928712471222">Bosch, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0958928712471222">Mückenberger, 1985</xref>), atypical work has been gradually liberalized in Germany (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0958928712471222">Eichhorst and Marx, 2011</xref>). This trajectory of labour market change is characteristic of Continental welfare states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0958928712471222">Palier, 2010</xref>). Moreover, atypical employment has particularly problematic consequences regarding coverage and eligibility in these countries due to the strong insurance principle. Analysing the German case is, therefore, a good starting point to learn about a phenomenon that affects other Continental welfare states in a similar way. At the same time, these states are not the only and not even the most extreme cases of labour market dualism in Europe. In most South European countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0958928712471222">Ferrera, 2010</xref>), and also, for instance, in Poland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0958928712471222">Baranowska et al., 2011</xref>), we observe larger and often more disadvantaged segments of atypical work. Hence, with Germany we study an intermediate case of labour market dualism. Any significant effects of atypical work on political behaviour in this context warrant further investigation, not only in other Continental welfare states, but also in those states with more extreme labour market divisions.</p>
<p>In the following section, we review the literature on labour market outsiders and specify our general hypotheses. Subsequently, we formulate expectations on outsiders’ party preferences in the German context based on parties’ positions on social policy issues. We then go on to analyse the effect of labour market status on party preferences in Germany by means of multinomial logistic regressions. In a final section we summarize our findings and indicate paths for further research.</p>

<title>The debate on labour market status and political preferences</title>
<p>Insider–outsider conflicts have become a major research issue in comparative political economy (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0958928712471222">Armingeon and Bonoli, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0958928712471222">Emmenegger et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0958928712471222">Esping-Andersen, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0958928712471222">King and Rueda, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0958928712471222">Rueda, 2007</xref>). Among other things, this research has highlighted the negative consequences of exclusion from stable employment in terms of social security. Workers with unstable employment careers are often not covered by social insurance or have insufficient contribution records to become entitled for benefits (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0958928712471222">Clasen and Clegg, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0958928712471222">Grimshaw and Rubery, 1997</xref>). Originally, comparative research on those excluded from the labour market tended to focus on the long-term unemployed and recipients of means-tested benefits (even though atypical employment has been studied in national contexts ever since it arose in the 1980s). More recently, the consistent rise of non-standard forms of employment in many European countries has drawn considerable attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0958928712471222">Davidsson and Naczyk, 2009</xref>). These types of employment include fixed-term contracts, part-time employment, temporary agency work, and quasi-dependent freelancing. However, many authors argue that part-time employment should not be considered as a problematic exclusion from standard work as long as it is voluntary, covered by social insurance, and above a certain minimum of hours and pay.</p>
<p>The political implications of the rise of atypical employment are widely discussed in the comparative social policy literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0958928712471222">Burgoon and Dekker, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0958928712471222">Emmenegger, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0958928712471222">Häusermann and Schwander, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0958928712471222">Lindvall and Rueda, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0958928712471222">Rueda, 2007</xref>). So far, however, there is no consensus as to whether this phenomenon has had an impact on party politics and, if so, of what kind. In fact, to the best of our knowledge, only <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0958928712471222">Emmenegger (2009)</xref> has empirically and specifically studied the party preferences of atypical workers. In the field of political behaviour, the low political participation of the unemployed has often been noted (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0958928712471222">Anderson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0958928712471222">Marshall et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0958928712471222">Rosenstone and Hansen, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0958928712471222">Schlozman and Verba, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0958928712471222">Verba et al., 2004</xref>). Yet, atypical work has scarcely been included in analyses of political behaviour (an exception is <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0958928712471222">Gallego, 2007</xref>) and, as far as we can see, not at all with regard to party preferences.</p>
<p>Some scholars argue that atypical employment influences political preferences (comprising party and policy preferences) because, similar to the unemployed, atypical workers are excluded from stable and/or gainful employment. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0958928712471222">Rueda (2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0958928712471222">2007</xref>) maintains that the core constituency of social democratic parties are labour market insiders (in permanent and full-time jobs). Consequently, these parties do not represent the interests of labour market outsiders (unemployed or atypically employed) whenever these are in conflict with the interests of labour market insiders – as, for example, in labour market policy. This perspective does not distinguish between atypically employed and unemployed workers. It implies that their labour market policy preferences incline both groups to support parties other than social democrats. We call this the exclusion hypothesis. A more differentiated version of this argument takes account of different strategies that the same party may pursue over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0958928712471222">Lindvall and Rueda, 2012</xref>). The view that atypical workers differ from labour market insiders in their policy preferences is supported empirically by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0958928712471222">Burgoon and Dekker (2010)</xref>. They show that atypical workers are significantly more likely to feel economically insecure and suggest that this perception underlies their significantly stronger backing of unemployment benefits.</p>
<p>Other researchers doubt that political preferences of atypical workers are clearly distinct from those of labour market insiders. This view we label the indistinctness hypothesis. There are basically three reasons for this scepticism. First, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0958928712471222">Emmenegger (2009)</xref> has pointed out that the different material interests of insiders and outsiders may be bridged by common household ties (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0958928712471222">Pierson, 2001</xref>: 448). This is an important argument since others have indeed demonstrated that the household context affects party preferences (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0958928712471222">Schmitt-Beck et al., 2006</xref>). Arguably, an atypical worker’s economic insecurity can be substantially mitigated by a spouse in stable and gainful employment. In such a constellation, the atypical worker may even take an active interest in ‘insider-friendly’ policies, such as contribution-based social security, because they benefit the partner. Second, an individual’s employment contract may be too transient to be a relevant indicator of labour market exclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0958928712471222">Emmenegger, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0958928712471222">Häusermann and Schwander, 2009</xref>). Some atypical workers expect to find a stable job in the future, the prospect of which might blur any outsider-specific political preferences. Third, a particular labour market status might conceal heterogeneity in other characteristics (such as age, gender, occupation or education), which makes it misleading to address the atypically employed as one group and makes consistent political preferences unlikely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0958928712471222">Häusermann and Schwander, 2009</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0958928712471222">Häusermann, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In this article, we examine in particular whether household composition prevents the formation of distinct preferences by workers in atypical contracts. We also address the issue of heterogeneity by controlling for a range of socio-structural variables. We do not deal with the potential volatility of labour market statuses. This is an important point, but a detailed analysis of panel data is beyond the scope of this paper. However, note that not controlling for the persistence of labour market status makes it less likely to find an effect on party preferences. Hence, any such effect that we find is a strong indicator that atypical employment actually matters for party preferences.</p>
<p>Evidence sustaining the indistinctness hypothesis is provided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0958928712471222">Emmenegger (2009)</xref> who does not find any significant differences between labour market insiders and outsiders in support for left-wing parties. However, he only tests preferences for social democratic parties and for all left-wing parties taken together (social democratic and radical left). This leaves open whether a more differentiated analysis of preferences for single parties would find differences. Moreover, due to restrictions in the dataset, he did not control for household composition or duration of labour market status, two potential reasons for lacking differences in partisanship. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0958928712471222">Burgoon and Dekker (2010)</xref> include having an employed partner as a control variable in their analysis, which indeed has a negative effect on preferences for unemployment protection. Yet, this effect (which is not at the core of their study) is a general one and it remains unclear to what extent it is driven by the unemployed, atypical workers or, say, well-off double income households. Hence, a closer examination of household effects on labour market outsiders is expedient. We will test the ‘household hypothesis’ more directly by distinguishing between outsiders with and without an insider partner.</p>
<p>Thus far we have discussed the opposing exclusion and indistinctness hypotheses from the perspective of <italic>whether</italic> atypical employment makes a difference. This leaves open the question of <italic>what</italic> difference it makes, if at all, for party preferences. As presented above, the exclusion hypothesis assumes that party choices are guided by economic interests and depend on the policy profiles of parties. As workers traditionally voted for social democratic parties the political behaviour of outsiders is assumed to depend primarily on the policy profile of those parties: ‘outsiders tend to abandon the political process or vote for more radical political parties when they perceive that Social Democratic parties or other mainstream left parties are not defending their interests’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0958928712471222">Lindvall and Rueda, 2012</xref>: 278). Since the exclusion hypothesis regards atypical workers as similar to the unemployed, alienation from party politics appears likely. After all, a large literature has shown that unemployment, similar to low socio-economic status more generally, tends to depress levels of participation. This low participation is mostly explained by everyday economic worries, which lead to a lack of interest in political solutions and imply limited resources for political action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0958928712471222">Faas, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0958928712471222">Marshall et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0958928712471222">Schlozman and Verba, 1979</xref>). Correspondingly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0958928712471222">Gallego (2007)</xref> finds that workers on fixed-term contracts are less likely to vote than workers in permanent employment, even if the effect is less pronounced than for the jobless.</p>
<p>Research on the German case has, to our knowledge, not looked specifically at party preferences of atypical workers. A large study on the electoral behaviour of the unemployed has been conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0958928712471222">Faas (2010)</xref>. In accordance with international research, he finds that the unemployed abstain from voting more often. Among those jobless who do vote, the Social Democrats (SPD) enjoy strong support when in opposition. In times of SPD government participation, however, unemployed voters turned from the SPD to the Green Party and, more recently, to the ‘Left Party’ (for more on this party, see below; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0958928712471222">Faas, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In sum, the debate on party preferences of atypical workers is inconclusive and the question has hardly been studied empirically. The picture is somewhat clearer for the unemployed who, in turn, serve some authors as a reference point for conjectures on atypical workers. The literature, hence, provides broadly two hypotheses: (1) the exclusion hypothesis, according to which party preferences of non-standard workers should be similar to those of the unemployed; (2) the indistinctness hypothesis, which predicts that no clear differences in party preferences can be found on the basis of labour market status. If the exclusion hypothesis holds, a further important question arises: Which parties do actually receive the support of outsiders? In the following, we develop party-specific hypotheses for the German case.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0958928712471222">
<title>German parties’ policy positions regarding labour market exclusion</title>
<p>In this section we briefly discuss for each German political party whether support by labour market outsiders would theoretically be expected. For this purpose and in line with the political-economy literature referred to above, we make the simplifying assumption of party support being significantly influenced by individuals’ material interests. These, in turn, depend on the degree of labour market inclusion and the associated social risks. Hence, we discuss which party in the German context supports policies best suited to improve the economic situation of outsiders. For the sake of simplicity we focus on social policies, in particular unemployment benefits and pensions. However, employment protection regulation may play a role too, which leads to diverging party-specific hypotheses.</p>
<p>As far as social policy is concerned, the literature expects outsiders to demand higher protection. Atypical employment constitutes a ‘new social risk’ as it is associated with a higher likelihood to become unemployed and, in Bismarckian systems such as Germany, may lead to insufficient welfare entitlements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0958928712471222">Clasen and Clegg, 2006</xref>). Based on this risk profile, atypical workers should show strong support for (a) generous social benefits and (b) universal access to benefits and services, that is, the decoupling of employment record and entitlements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0958928712471222">Häusermann, 2010</xref>). This should hold even more clearly for the unemployed as current benefit recipients.</p>
<p>Which parties in Germany accommodate these outsider interests? Most decidedly in favour of welfare state expansion is ‘The Left’ (<italic>Die Linke</italic>), a relatively new left-wing populist party that gained momentum through the protests against unemployment benefit retrenchment in the mid-2000s (‘Hartz-reforms’). While The Left tries to appeal to a broader pro-welfare constituency (including the traditional working class), its support for generous benefits can be seen also as a response to the employment risks of atypical workers. Specific proposals in the 2009 election manifesto (the time of our analysis) are: a massive expansion of the public service sector, increased unemployment benefit levels and a generous statutory minimum wage. The manifesto also includes measures directed at abolishing or containing atypical work: a ban of fixed-term contracts without valid reason, heavy re-regulation of temporary agency work (including equal pay and a risk premium paid to workers), and the complete inclusion of marginal part-time work into social insurance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0958928712471222">Die Linke, 2009</xref>). It can be debated whether these measures would actually serve the interest of atypical workers. Yet, it is plausible that these radical solutions to the problems of a dual labour market are appealing to some of them as well as to the unemployed.</p>
<p>A second likely candidate for outsider support is the Green Party (Bündnis 90/Die Grünen). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0958928712471222">Häusermann (2010)</xref> shows that for the field of pension reform the Greens are the one political party in Germany advocating a systemic change towards more universal benefits. This largely reflects the political goal to reduce women’s dependence on a working spouse, but it should also be beneficial to atypical workers who struggle to fulfil the eligibility criteria of social insurance. The most important proposal in this respect is an expanded basic income for the unemployed (‘<italic>soziale Grundsicherung’</italic>) with less strict activation and with means-testing of the individual rather than the household (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0958928712471222">Bündnis 90/Die Grünen, 2009</xref>). In addition, the Greens support a minimum wage (however, less generous than the one advocated by the Left), they propose a reform of marginal part-time work to improve the situation of working women, and demand an equal treatment principle for agency workers.</p>
<p>Of the remaining three parties in the German system, the SPD come closest to the position of the Greens, by sharing their position on minimum wages and agency work and intending to limit marginal part-time employment. However, the SPD moved to the right on welfare issues in the 2000s and lost many of its traditional supporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0958928712471222">Picot, 2009</xref>). In the same process it significantly deregulated atypical work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0958928712471222">Eichhorst and Marx, 2011</xref>), making it questionable whether workers in this segment would support the party. The Christian Democrats (CDU) had become relatively welfare-sceptical since the middle of the 1990s, but shifted back to a status-quo oriented approach in the second half of the 2000s. Thus, there was little to expect from the CDU in terms of innovative social policies or welfare state expansion. Moreover, in the coalition with the SPD prior to the 2009 general election, the CDU blocked proposals that would have made agency workers better off. Finally, the only party outright critical of the German welfare state are the Liberals (FDP), who are mostly perceived as an anti-tax party. Some scholars (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0958928712471222">Rueda, 2005</xref>), however, predict outsiders to be strongly against employment protection legislation, which may impede labour market entry. If this is the case (and if outsiders prefer employment protection deregulation over social policy expansion), the FDP would be the only party supplying this kind of solution.</p>
<p>To sum up, if atypical workers and the unemployed are interested in social policy expansion they should support either the populist agenda of the Left or the more moderate Greens. By contrast, both major parties were unlikely to implement significant changes in 2009, even if the SPD was probably somewhat closer to the interests of outsiders than the CDU. Finally, from a social policy point of view, outsiders should disapprove of the anti-redistributive FDP. Yet, according to a competing claim they would approve of the FDP’s ambition to reduce entry barriers to the labour market in the form of employment protection legislation.</p>
<p>Of course it may be that, rather than supporting a party based on material interests, labour market outsiders are alienated from electoral participation altogether. This argument has been made and confirmed empirically for the unemployed (see above), and it might apply to atypical workers as well. We therefore include non-participation as a dependent variable in our study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0958928712471222">
<title>Labour market status and party preferences in Germany</title>
<p>In this section we analyse empirically to what extent labour market exclusion influences party preferences and vote participation in Germany. We use data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP) for 2009, the year of the last federal election. The GSOEP has two major advantages: first, it contains sufficiently detailed questions on labour market status to distinguish standard and non-standard workers. Second, and what is most important for our purposes, the data contain information on other household members. Detailed information on the labour market situation of partners can be merged to the individual data. A drawback of the GSOEP is the limited number of variables measuring political preferences. In particular, it lacks the standard question for vote intentions (‘Which party would you vote for if next Sunday there was a general election?’). Instead, the survey inquires about party identification, that is, long-standing ties to a party.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0958928712471222">1</xref></sup> Like this, our dependent variable measures a more substantial and stable party preference than voting intention. This makes it even stronger a test for insider–outsider gaps: if labour market status matters on this level, this is a powerful indication that it shapes political attitudes.</p>
<p>We subdivide our explanatory variable, labour market status, into seven categories: standard employment (permanent and full-time), permanent part-time, self-employed with employees, freelancers (self-employed without employees), atypical workers (fixed-term contracts, agency work or marginal part-time<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0958928712471222">2</xref></sup>), unemployed and inactive.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0958928712471222">3</xref></sup> Therefore, to begin with, different forms of non-standard employment are aggregated into one group in order to obtain case numbers large enough for the further decomposition into household types. What they have in common is precisely their lacking integration into stable and gainful employment: either through limited employment periods (fixed-term contracts and agency work) or through their inherently marginal nature (marginal part-time). Later, we analyse these three types separately. Permanent part-time jobs, by contrast, are stable and above the minimum threshold, which distinguishes them from marginal part-time and fully integrates them into social insurance. To bring in the household level, we split up the outsider groups (atypical workers and unemployed) as well as part-timers into respondents with and without an insider partner.</p>
<sec id="section5-0958928712471222">
<title>Insiders, atypical workers, unemployed</title>
<p>After two decades of continuous growth, the segment of non-standard workers amounts to a considerable proportion of the German working-age population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0958928712471222">Eichhorst and Marx, 2011</xref>). In 2009, approximately 6 million people or 12 percent of the employment-age population fell into this category (4.6 percent fixed-term contracts, 1.9 percent agency workers and 5.5 percent marginal part-timers; see Descriptives in the <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0958928712471222">Appendix</xref>). The unemployed accounted for another 4 million persons (7.9 percent of the working-age population). With an overall share of 20 percent of the working-age population labour market outsiders are far from negligible for the political process.</p>
<p>Based on the working-age population (15–64 years), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0958928712471222">Figure 1</xref> presents the distribution of party preferences across three labour market statuses: permanent full-time employment (insiders), atypical employment and unemployment. There are two things to note in this figure. First, the overall share of respondents who identify at all with a political party declines with labour market exclusion. It is highest among standard employees (39 percent) and lowest among the unemployed (24 percent). This conforms to the literature on unemployment and political participation cited above. Second, there are some notable differences in preferences for specific parties. Support for the three oldest parties of the Federal Republic, CDU, SPD and FDP, tends to decrease with labour market exclusion (in the case of the SPD, however, the decrease is proportional to the decline in overall party identification). By contrast, preferences for the Greens are particularly strong among atypical workers (especially, considering the lower share of overall party identifiers), but drop markedly among the unemployed. The Left Party receives somewhat larger support among atypical workers than among labour market insiders and much stronger support among the jobless. The latter also have a higher inclination to support small protest parties (‘other’).</p>

<p>Therefore, the descriptive data suggest that labour market exclusion matters for party preferences. However, the relation may be driven by composition effects rather than labour market status itself. In order to control for this, we turn to multivariate analysis. We develop a multinomial logit model, using the same question as above as the dependent variable: whether respondents lean to a particular political party. Those who reply that they did not have a strong party preference can of course include individuals who actually vote for a party at the time of election but do not have a stable preference. Therefore, we distinguish between those who have no party preference but (‘definitely’) intend to vote (these may be regarded as potential swing voters) and those who are likely to abstain from voting.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0958928712471222">4</xref></sup> In sum, we obtain eight response categories: support for five political parties (CDU, SPD, FDP, Greens, Left), support for other parties, and two categories for those who do not support a specific party (‘swing voter’ and ‘non-voter’). Being interested in labour market exclusion, we set the arguably most integrated group, permanent full-time employees as the reference category.</p>
<p>As control variables, we deploy age, gender, income, education, and religiosity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0958928712471222">5</xref></sup> In addition, we account for residency in the <italic>Länder</italic> (states) that joined the Federal Republic at reunification in 1990. This variable has to be included due to persistent differences in political attitudes between East and West. The sample is again limited to the working-age population due to our focus on labour market groups. The variables and their frequencies are summarized in the <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0958928712471222">Appendix</xref>.</p>
<p>Since standard coefficients of logistic regressions cannot be interpreted in any straightforward way, we calculated average marginal effects. These show the average effect over all respondents of a discrete or marginal change in an independent variable on the probability of expressing a given party preference. For our main explanatory variable, labour market status, the effect therefore expresses the change in probability if a respondent is, for example, atypically employed rather than in permanent full-time employment.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0958928712471222">6</xref></sup> The results, reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0958928712471222">Table 1</xref>, confirm in important aspects the impressions from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0958928712471222">Figure 1</xref>. Atypical workers deviate significantly from insiders’ patterns of party support. They are more likely to lean towards the Greens and the Left Party and less likely to lean towards the CDU. Being in atypical as opposed to standard employment raises the probability of sustaining the Greens on average by 2.3 percentage points – no small difference given that 5 percent of the working-age population hold this preference (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0958928712471222">Figure 1</xref>). The unemployed show strong support for the Left Party as well. But, contrary to atypical workers, they are significantly less likely than labour market insiders to identify with the Greens. Moreover, unemployment negatively affects support for the FDP and it strongly increases the likelihood of being alienated from party politics overall (no party identification and vote abstention). The same does not hold for atypical workers. They are as likely as labour market insiders to participate in elections.</p>

<p>Therefore, our results confirm neither the indistinctness nor the exclusion hypothesis regarding the political preferences of atypical workers. Those in unstable and marginal employment are clearly distinguished from labour market insiders by their rejection of the CDU and their inclination towards the Greens and the Left. However, they differ also from the unemployed as the latter are clearly less likely to support the Greens and generally participate less in electoral politics.</p>
<p>Other notable results from our analysis are that workers in permanent part-time employment and freelancers display a pronounced tendency in favour of the Greens. Hence, also beyond the narrower group of atypical workers, the Greens seem to attract those groups with a somewhat weaker attachment to the labour market. The group of freelancers (that is, self-employed without employees) is of course very heterogeneous. Even stronger than to the Greens is their inclination towards the FDP. This is unsurprising as the FDP has always represented the so-called independent professions, such as medical doctors, lawyers or architects. Similarly, the identification of the self-employed (with employees) with the CDU conforms to well-known electoral patterns in Germany. Our control variables display expected effects as well.</p>
<p>We ran several robustness checks for this model. First, we checked whether we find the same results in previous years. This revealed that the inclination of atypical workers toward the Greens was consistent over time for one electoral cycle (since 2005). In addition, the high abstention rate among the jobless is confirmed for 2005 (this survey item is only included in election years). Hence, two core results, together disproving both indistinctness and exclusion hypothesis, have been stable over recent years. The same is not true for the inclination of outsiders to support the Left Party. This difference with respect to labour market insiders was not statistically significant in previous years. One main reason is presumably that identification with small and new parties is usually more volatile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0958928712471222">Schmitt-Beck et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Second, separate regional models for East and West Germany retained the most important results, but some coefficients fail to reach the conventional significance level, which may be caused by low case numbers. Third, we controlled for occupations (one-digit ISCO<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0958928712471222">7</xref></sup> codes) and economic sectors (one-digit NACE<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0958928712471222">8</xref></sup> codes). This is important, as both atypical employment and party preferences cannot be expected to be distributed randomly across these groups. Indeed, including dummies for occupations and sectors, respectively, affects our findings on support for the Greens (all other main findings remain). In the model with occupation dummies, the positive effect of atypical employment on support for the Greens remains significant, even if only at the 10 percent level. In the model with sector dummies, the effect becomes insignificant. This finding casts doubt on the causal underpinning of the relationship between atypical employment and support for the Greens. Both are in fact overrepresented in the sectors ‘Education’ and ‘Health and Social Services’. To make sure our initial finding for atypical work status is not driven by membership in these groups, we re-ran the model from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0958928712471222">Table 1</xref> excluding these two sectors, but controlling for the remaining sectors.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0958928712471222">9</xref></sup> The results confirm a strong and highly significant effect of atypical work on support for the Greens. This suggests that the political implications of non-standard employment differ in those groups, which lean in general strongly towards the Greens, but that the relationship between atypical work and support for the Greens is robust in the rest of the economy.</p>
<p>As a next step, we analyse which types of atypical employment underlie different partisan preferences (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0958928712471222">Table 2</xref>). The results show that support for the Greens stems mostly from employees in fixed-term contracts and temporary agency work whereas the inclination towards the Left Party and the relative reluctance regarding Christian Democrats is mostly driven by marginal part-timers. While our first main result showed that the atypically employed are distinct from both labour market insiders and the unemployed, this additional analysis indicates that further differentiation is warranted, because even between different categories of non-standard workers there are relevant differences in political behaviour. At the same time, none of the three categories is significantly more likely to abstain from electoral politics. Hence, each category continues to differ not only from labour market insiders (in terms of party preferences) but also from the unemployed (in terms of participation).</p>

<title>The impact of households</title>
<p>As discussed above, the main theoretical argument against outsiders having distinct political preferences is that they may share a household with insiders. The fact that we find significant differences between labour market outsiders and insiders already shows that household structures do not entirely eradicate the relevance of labour market status. Nevertheless, the matter is worth exploring further. Although we do not consider non-marginal part-timers (above €400 per month) in permanent contracts as an excluded labour market group, we test the household effect for this type of employment too. The reason is that a part-time position possibly provides insufficient resources if other sources of household income are lacking.</p>
<p>We use the same model as in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0958928712471222">Table 1</xref>, dividing each outsider group (atypical workers and unemployed) as well as part-timers into persons with and without an insider partner. Among the unemployed, the resulting subgroups are very unequal in size. Only about 13 percent of the unemployed had an insider partner in 2009 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0958928712471222">Appendix</xref>). An underlying reason could be that the unemployed with a fully employed partner are more likely to drop out of the labour market altogether. Among atypical workers, 29 percent have an insider partner. Therefore, the difference is not as big as in the case of the unemployed. However, most people in Germany who are not fully integrated into the labour market do not live in partnerships with a well integrated worker. This contrasts with part-timers, 55 percent of whom live with an insider partner.</p>
<p>Intriguingly, our findings show that household composition does indeed have an impact on the party preferences of atypical workers (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0958928712471222">Table 3</xref>). Only those non-standard employees who do not live together with an insider partner are significantly distinguished from labour market insiders by being more likely to support the Greens and the Left Party. By contrast, those who have atypical contracts while living together with someone in stable full-time employment do not significantly differ from labour market insiders regarding the parties they support. This corroborates the argument that atypical workers may be influenced by the interests of a partner with a more favourable labour market status. Somewhat surprisingly, however, atypical workers with insider partners are much more likely to have no party preference and to abstain from voting.</p>

<p>The impact of household structures is much less pronounced among the unemployed. Both the unemployed with and without an insider partner are clearly less inclined than insiders towards the Greens and the FDP and much more likely to abstain from voting. Yet, even here we find some differences. Only unemployed without an insider partner are significantly more likely to approve of the Left Party.</p>
<p>Finally, the relevance of the household context is supported by the results for permanent part-timers. Only those lacking an insider partner have a significantly higher tendency to lean towards the Greens. As already seen in the results from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0958928712471222">Table 1</xref>, part-timers differ from atypical workers and the unemployed by not supporting the Left Party more strongly than insiders. Accounting for household composition, we find that having an insider partner even has a significantly negative effect on support for this party among part-time workers.</p>
<p>Overall, this differentiated analysis of households shows that household composition does affect the political preferences of labour market outsiders, especially atypical workers. This conforms to the more general finding by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0958928712471222">Schmitt-Beck et al. (2006)</xref> that partners can influence party identification. However, as we have seen, not many labour market outsiders live together with a partner who has a stable full-time job. This explains why household structures do not substantially change the party preferences of labour market outsiders in the aggregate.</p>

<title>Conclusion and further research</title>
<p>The literature so far has discussed the political preferences of atypical workers in terms of two contrasting hypotheses: one considering atypical workers as similar to the unemployed (exclusion hypothesis), the other not expecting any clear effects of labour market status on party preferences (indistinctness hypothesis). We cannot confirm either of the two hypotheses for the German case. Rather, party preferences of non-standard workers appear to be distinct from both insiders and the unemployed. In contrast to workers in permanent full-time jobs, they are more likely to support the Greens and the Left Party, and less likely to favour the Christian Democrats. In contrast to the unemployed, atypical employees are not alienated from electoral politics. Though the unemployed are similar to atypical workers in their strong support for the Left Party, they display clearly less support for the Greens, they are less likely to identify with any party at all, and they abstain more often from voting. Therefore, contrary to the rigid alternatives of exclusion or indistinctness hypothesis, there seems to be a graduation in labour market exclusion and its political effects. The atypically employed can be clearly distinguished from labour market insiders by their political preferences left of the Social Democrats. They are, however, still more integrated into the political process than the unemployed. Consequently, our findings confirm the relevance of labour market divisions as highlighted in the literature on labour market dualization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0958928712471222">Emmenegger et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0958928712471222">Rueda, 2007</xref>), but our findings also suggest that research should go beyond simple notions of dualization.</p>
<p>Moreover, the results are in line with our expectations based on the policy positions of German parties. While our data only allow for tentative causal interpretations, the findings suggest that support by both groups of outsiders for Greens and Left Party is fostered by the policy positions of these parties, in particular better social security for unstable employment careers and expansionary social policy. By contrast, deregulation of employment protection seems less suitable for attracting support from labour market outsiders, as low preferences for the FDP indicate.</p>
<p>Our second major result is that household structures matter. The atypically employed only have strong preferences for the Greens and the Left if they do not have an insider partner. If, by contrast, they live together with a worker in permanent full-time employment these distinct preferences vanish. However, in Germany this blurring of preferences does not occur very often because only less than a third of non-standard workers have an insider partner. Hence, household has an effect on preferences but due to small numbers it does not play out at the aggregate level.</p>
<p>A third finding is that distinguishing between different types of atypical employment is warranted when examining political preferences. The over-proportional preferences among German atypical workers for the Greens are found mainly among fixed-term and temporary agency workers whereas support for the Left Party is particularly strong among marginal part-timers.</p>
<p>Overall, the German case shows that labour market exclusion has indeed consequences for party preferences and electoral participation. Household structures can blur distinct preferences, but the mixed outsider–insider household is not common enough to offset the relevance of labour market status at the aggregate level. Hence, our analysis suggests that research on the relation between labour market integration and political preferences should be extended to other countries. This certainly regards Continental and South-European welfare states, which have recorded similar or even more dramatic rises of atypical employment. Moreover, future research should study more specifically the causal pathways that explain the impact of atypical employment on party preferences.</p>
