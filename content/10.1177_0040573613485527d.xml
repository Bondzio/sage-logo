<p>I am grateful to the group, “Explorations in Christian Theology and Apocalyptic,” for selecting my book, <italic>The Cross and the Lynching Tree</italic>, for discussion. I want to thank the panelists for thoughtful and challenging responses to my book.</p>
<p>Since I was born and reared in Arkansas, a lynching state, it is not easy for me to talk about this subject with <italic>white</italic> theologians. Lynching was a black atrocity that defined, along with Jim Crow segregation, America’s race relations following the Civil War and throughout much of the twentieth century. Whites do not want to talk about lynching, because they would rather forget that part of their heritage. Blacks do not like to talk about lynching either, but no matter how hard we try to keep it buried deep in our consciousness, often something happens unexpectedly that reminds us that lynching is not a thing of the past, but is still present today in many different forms. Lynching is a flagrant example of the exercise of white supremacy, whether extra-legal or legal.</p>
<p>Although lynching is difficult to talk about, we blacks, whites, and other Americans need to talk about it if we expect to heal our deep racial wounds. I wrote <italic>The Cross and the Lynching Tree</italic> in order to start this difficult conversation. If we cannot talk together about this painful legacy, what we say about the Christian Gospel is a fraud—no matter how many books we write or sermons we preach, claiming that God was in Christ reconciling human beings to each other and to God.</p>
<p>To have a genuine conversation about lynching, however, we must speak truthfully, bluntly, and without compromise, but always with humility, respect and in solidarity with the most marginalized in society. We must “let suffering speak,” to use Cornel West’s phrase, that is, give voice to those who have been left out of American history and theology. My response to the panelists, therefore, will be informed by whether I symbolically hear and feel black victims of lynching speaking in their reflections.</p>
<p>Christopher Morse is right when he says that my theology cannot be boxed in by prior conventions of labeling and classification. I was not even thinking about the concept “apocalyptic” when I wrote <italic>The Cross and the Lynching Tree</italic>, and was surprised, but pleased, when I was asked to participate in a discussion of my book. It is always helpful for authors to talk with others about what they write. We learn from the critical reflections of others, because they can see limitations in our work that often escape us. “Blindness,” writes literary critic Horace A. Porter, “often emerges as the Siamese twin of extraordinary insight.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0040573613485527d">38</xref></sup> Throughout my four decades of writing theology, I have benefited from the critical insights of others.</p>
<p>My colleagues at Union Seminary have taught me much about European and American theology and biblical scholarship, especially Christopher Morse and J. Louis Martyn. Their writings remind me of the importance of intellectual discipline in doing theology and exegetical work. However, Morse is correct when he suggests that I do not think that he has learned as much from black religion and scholarship as I have learned from white theologians. That makes dialogue between us much more difficult. Creative dialogue depends on the participants’ mutual knowledge of each other’s history and culture. Blacks know a lot about whites, but most whites, especially scholars in religion, know very little about blacks. If Morse, for example, knew more about the black experience, he would know that Martyn’s reflections on Paul are not an adequate resource for addressing the issues I raise in <italic>The Cross and the Lynching Tree.</italic></p>
<p>Soon after I arrived at Union, Martyn and I taught a seminar on “Paul and Black Theology.” We co-taught only once because I found Martyn’s scholarship limited to a white academic world far removed from the concrete struggles of blacks confronting white supremacy. (It is revealing that Morse and I never taught a course jointly for similar reasons.) We cannot forget that whites used Paul to justify slavery, and biblical scholars have done little to heal racial wounds deep in black history. In their scholarship, they ignore black people, and do not talk about the influence of Pauline scholarship on white supremacy in America. What Morse calls “apocalyptic concreteness” looks to be abstract, especially in the context of the black freedom struggle and the story of Jesus’ Passion in the New Testament. That was why Howard Thurman’s grandmother, an ex-slave, would have nothing to do with Paul, since white ministers preached Paul’s doctrine “slaves, be obedient to your masters” (Eph 6:5; Col 3:22). Of course, Martyn reminded me that Paul did not say that, and I gladly take his word. I do not have a problem with Paul, since he affirmed that “we are all one in Christ Jesus” (Gal 3:28), and when saying that slavery didn’t matter (1Cor 7:20–21) he had in mind the coming end of time. But whatever Paul may have said, does not make much difference to me or to blacks who were enslaved and lynched in Paul’s name. What matters is that white theologians have done almost nothing to liberate him or themselves from white supremacy.</p>
<p>After reading Morse’s reflection on <italic>The Cross and the Lynching Tree</italic>, I do not think he <italic>really</italic> knows what I am writing about, because the cries and moans of lynched victims, which echo Jesus’ loud cry of God’s abandonment from the cross (Mk 15:34), are not heard in what he says. Morse definitely read my book with care and sensitivity to the apocalyptic significance of black people’s claim about God “making a way out of no way.” But instead of exploring that apocalyptic saying at a deeper level in order to discover what it might mean for black people on lynching trees and for white men who put them there, Morse turns to Martyn whose writings about Paul have nothing to do with what concerns me as a theologian, grappling with the theological meaning of the cross and the lynching tree.</p>
<p>Let me be clear. I am not saying that Morse and Martyn are not concerned about racial justice. Of course, they are. In fact, most whites in America today reject black slavery, segregation, and lynching and, looking back to the 1960s, support fully Martin Luther King Jr.’s non-violent fight for civil rights against the violent acts of white supremacists. That was why Martin Luther King Jr.’s birthday was made a national holiday, the only American with a holiday in his name alone. Yet neither of my colleagues has spoken about white supremacy. Neither has been willing to talk about how assumptions about white supremacy influence theology and biblical studies. For this reason, I find that what I said about Reinhold Niebuhr (chapter 2) applies to them as well. Suffering blacks hardly speak in their writings. I want to know what difference black resistance to white supremacy makes in their intellectual work. Since both Morse and Martyn are from the South where so much lynching occurred, they must have heard and read about the devastating impact these horrors had on black families. What impact did such suffering have on them as theologians? A theology that does not challenge white supremacy justifies it. The lynching atrocity demands a response from white theologians, because white Christians put blacks on those trees, as they sang, “Jesus Keep Me Near the Cross.” To remain silent in the face of such unspeakable crimes and blasphemy is nothing but complicity in the act itself.</p>
<p>I have often said that <italic>whites must become black</italic> if they expect to understand what the Gospel means in the fight against white supremacy. It is analogous to Jesus telling Nicodemus that he must be “born again” to “enter into the Kingdom of God” (John 3), Paul’s conversion on the Damascus road (Acts 9), and Bonhoeffer’s declaration that “when Christ calls a man, he bids him come and die.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0040573613485527d">39</xref></sup> Through radical solidarity with the most marginalized in the black community, whites can be born again into blackness, as seen in the lives of many white civil rights workers during the 1960s. A genuine spiritual conversion is always costly. If Morse and Martyn had been born <italic>black</italic> like me, they would be outraged by 250 years of slavery and another 100 years of Jim Crow segregation and lynching. They would write about the theology of the cross while looking at the lynching tree, with a focus on love and blackness—God’s refusal to let white supremacists have the last word on black humanity.</p>
<p>A few white theologians, however, have begun to break their silence on white supremacy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0040573613485527d">40</xref></sup> Nathan Kerr is one of them. In his “Standing Out into the Coming Reign of God,” he wrestled with the legacy of the lynching terror in the black community. He has begun to say what was missing in Morse’s reflection. Scholars have to find their own way into this very difficult subject. But it is important to let black sufferers speak in their writings. If poor blacks are not at the table of theological reflection, Jesus is not there either. Yet our theological responses to the lynching terror need not be the same, because our experiences are different. Theological outrage can be expressed in a variety of ways. But there must be outrage at the lynching atrocity. The Christian response to the lynching atrocity needs to come from deep within our common humanity as we express our solidarity with black victims.</p>
<p>Nathan Kerr’s reflection is an important beginning but <italic>only</italic> a beginning. Much more is needed. He emphasized the voices of incarcerated blacks with a focus on their music. When we ask where is lynching happening today, we only have to look at the criminal justice system where nearly one-half of the more than two million people in prison are blacks who only comprise 12 percent of the U.S. population. The so-called war on drugs is actually a war on young blacks, a “get tough policy,” which may be called legal lynching. If young whites were incarcerated at the rate of blacks, Americans would declare a state of emergency in the nation and demand action. Most whites are silent about the extremely high incarceration rate of blacks as they were during the lynching era. I hope my book will help wake-up white theologians just as Michelle Alexander’s <italic>The New Jim Crow</italic> (The New Press, 2012) has awakened many in the larger society. We cannot do anything about racial injustice unless we acknowledge that it exists.</p>
<p>Nathan Kerr’s essay makes an analogy between lynching and blacks in prisons. White theologians need to make a strong theological witness against racial injustice so loud that the voices of lynched blacks will be resurrected in their theologies. The Civil Rights Movement provided them an excellent opportunity to reflect on the cross and the lynching tree. More than 40 blacks and whites were murdered; the most famous were four girls in a Birmingham church (1963) and three civil rights workers in Mississippi (1964), the number one lynching State. White theologians said almost nothing about what those dead bodies meant for the theologies they were writing at the time. They were reflecting on the secular city, the death of God theology, and the theology of hope.</p>
<p>When writing a doctoral dissertation on Karl Barth, I searched desperately for my way forward in a theological discipline that ignored the black freedom movement. I turned to Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X, and James Baldwin, who became my intellectual trinity. They, along with Albert Camus, Dostoevsky, W.E.B. Du Bois, and other artists, showed me the way forward. It was not long before my voice burst forth in <italic>Black Theology and Black Power</italic> (1969). I vowed to myself, my parents, and to the God of the universe that, as long as I live, I would not stop exposing the lies of white theologians who mask evil in theological rhetoric. <italic>The Cross and the Lynching Tree</italic> is my most recent theological blast. After four decades of teaching and writing, I am pleased to see that a few white theologians, like Nathan Kerr, have begun to break silence.</p>
<p>J. Kameron Carter’s “Apocalyptic Blues” inspired me, reminding me of my black roots, in an intellectual and spiritual reflection that engages my heart and head. He is right that my text is just a beginning, a prolegomena to a much needed richer and deeper reflection that I hope he and others will undertake.</p>
<p>Carter’s “Apocalyptic Blues” reminds me of Ralph Ellison’s reflection on Richard Wright’s <italic>Black Boy</italic>, which he called “Richard Wright’s Blues.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0040573613485527d">41</xref></sup> As Albert Murray, Ellison’s friend, said, “He [Ellison] went beyond Richard Wright in the very process of commenting on <italic>Black Boy</italic>.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0040573613485527d">42</xref></sup> One could say something similar about Carter’s “Apocalyptic Blues.” Like a jazz musician responding to another, Carter plays his own tune, reflecting and moving to his own rhythm and beat. His theological dance is free and independent. He does not imitate. Rather, he builds on the written and oral sources of the black experience and Western theology and thereby points a way forward that engages both traditions. Carter knows both traditions, as he shows in his important text, <italic>Race: A Theological Account</italic> and in “Apocalyptic Blues.”</p>
<p>I do not have a critique of Carter’s reflection, only a few words of advice for him and other black theologians who are shaping our theological future. First, stay close to our black roots and let our ancestors speak, as we drink from the wellspring of the wisdom buried in African American history and religion. The black religious experience has a lot to teach America and the world about humanity and the Gospel of Jesus Christ. White theology is barren and will remain so as long as it keeps talking <italic>only</italic> to itself.</p>
<p>Second, continue to affirm and to criticize the Western theological tradition. This exhausted tradition is revived when black folk wrestle with it. And we must wrestle with it because it is our only language. James Baldwin is right: “You bring your experience to language and that changes the language.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0040573613485527d">43</xref></sup> Theology is a language game, which uses the imagination to grasp the transcendent.</p>
<p>Third, don’t stop with black and white traditions. Learn from the stories of all Americans, and from their heritages in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. If theologians begin to engage all the traditions that make up this land (including Native Americans, Asians, Hispanics, women, and LGBTQ traditions) we will develop theologies that are inclusive, liberating, and reconciling for America and the world. A deeper understanding of faith demands that.</p>
<p>Let me end this reflection with a comment on <italic>The Cross and the Lynching Tree</italic>. It was a deeply painful book to write. That was why it took nearly 10 years. It is not primarily an academic reflection, though not, I hope, anti-intellectual. This book is a witness to the black past in America, “my soul looking back,” reflecting on the meaning of the Christian Gospel, focusing on the cross and the lynching tree, two of the most powerful symbols in black history.</p>
<p>I wrestled with the cross and the lynching tree in this text somewhat like Jacob wrestled with “a man” “until daybreak” in Gen 32:22–32, like Martin Luther King Jr. wrestled with white ministers in his “Letter from a Birmingham Jail,” like Malcolm X wrestled with his meaning in his <italic>Autobiography</italic>, and like James Baldwin wrestled with America’s future in <italic>The Fire Next Time</italic>.</p>
<p>I wrestled with the question, How did African Americans <italic>survive</italic> and <italic>resist</italic> the lynching terror and keep enough of their sanity to love and marry each other, to raise their children, and teach them love and respect for each other? The answer is clear for many blacks: it was their faith in God and themselves that kept them emotionally and spiritually healthy enough to love not only themselves and each other, but even the whites who lynched them. What an amazing accomplishment! Whites used Christianity to lynch blacks, and blacks used it to survive and resist whites.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0040573613485527d">44</xref></sup></p>
<p>The more I reflected on the cross and the lynching tree, the more I understood why black Christians could not turn away from the cross, even though whites used it to enslave, segregate, and lynch them. As James Baldwin said, “[<italic>whites</italic>] <italic>discovered the Cross by way of the Bible, but</italic> [<italic>blacks</italic>] <italic>discovered the Bible by way of the Cross</italic>.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0040573613485527d">45</xref></sup> This is the great paradox in black life: finding God in suffering.</p>
<p>To live everyday under the terror of death was no easy matter. Growing up in Arkansas, with the Ku Klux Klan still on the prowl, I know from experience something about lynching. I watched my mother and father deal with it. But the moment I read about it, examining lynching historically, I could not stop asking, How in the world did blacks survive, how did they keep their composure in the midst of all that terror? Strange and paradoxical as it may appear, for many blacks, it was their faith in Jesus’ cross, believing that if God was with Jesus, God must be with us, because we, too, are up on the cross.</p>
<p>My other question was this: How could white Christians, who say they believe that Jesus died on the cross to save them, then turn around and hang blacks on trees and lynch them just as the Romans crucified Jesus? That also was an amazing paradox to me. Two communities. Both Christian. Embracing the same faith. Whites even did lynchings on church grounds, and ministers and seminary professors defended it. How could they do it? That’s where my passion comes from as I talk and write about the cross and the lynching tree. That’s the paradox that stimulates my theological imagination. That’s where my faith wrestling comes from, which keeps me writing theology.</p>
<p>Many Christians embrace the conviction that Jesus died on the cross to redeem humankind from sin. Taking our place, they say, Jesus suffered on the cross and gave his life as a ransom for many. The cross is the great symbol of the Christian narrative of salvation. Unfortunately, during the course of two thousand years of Christian history, the cross as a symbol of salvation has been detached from the ongoing suffering and oppression of human beings, the crucified people of history. The cross has been transformed into a harmless, intellectual idea about atonement for theologians and a non-offensive ornament that Christians wear around their necks. Rather than reminding us of the cost of discipleship, it has become a form of “cheap grace,” as Dietrich Bonhoeffer put it, an easy way to salvation that doesn’t force us to confront the power of Christ’s message and mission.</p>
<p>The best way to liberate the cross from desecration—or, worse triviality—is to place it alongside of the lynching tree. The cross is a scandal, a paradoxical religious symbol that <italic>inverts</italic> the world’s value system with the good news that hope comes by way of defeat, that suffering and death do not have the last word, that the last shall be first and the first last. Absurd as this idea is to the intellect, it is profoundly real in the spiritual life of black folk. For many of those who were lynched, the crucified Christ manifests God’s loving and liberating presence <italic>in</italic> the contradictions of black life. The cross of Jesus is that transcendent presence in the lives of black Christians which empowers them to believe that ultimately, in God’s eschatological future, they will not be defeated by the “troubles of the world,” no matter how great their suffering. Accepting this paradox, this absurd claim of faith was possible only when one was shorn of power, when one was unable to be proud and mighty, when one understood that people were not called by God to rule over others. The cross was God’s critique of power—<italic>white power</italic>—with powerless love, snatching victory out of defeat.</p>
<p>Although we cannot prove this claim of faith empirically or articulate it adequately, its truth is self-evident as we live it. I have seen the transforming power of this faith among many black Christians who struggle against white supremacy, especially among freedom fighters in the Civil Rights Movement. Many knew they could be killed. They knew they were not going to win in the world’s way of winning. But they had to do what they did because the transcendent reality encountered in their fight for justice was more powerful than the opposition, more meaningful than that which contradicted it.</p>
<p>How do people know that they are not what the world says when they have so few social and political resources to defend their humanity, so few economic resources to physically survive, and so few educational resources to express their dignity? For blacks in the U.S., it was their faith, inseparable from their culture. That is why I call the blues “secular spirituals.” The blues are spiritual resources, a cultural power that enables black people to express their humanity in the face of white terror. James Baldwin only finished high school. Richard Wright completed only the ninth grade. But they still had their say, and bore witness—in their novels, short stories, essays, and poetry—to a transcendence in blackness that no one could destroy.</p>
<p>Blackness is the image of God in black people. It is the light in the white darkness. B.B. King never got out of grade school. And Louis Armstrong hardly went to school at all. Now, I said to myself, if Louis Armstrong could blow a trumpet like that, I’m going to write theology the way Louis Armstrong blows his trumpet, the way B.B. King plays “Lucille” (his guitar), and the way Billie Holiday sings “Strange Fruit,” a song written by Abel Meeropol (Lewis Allen), a Jew, who hated lynching. In <italic>The Cross and the Lynching Tree</italic>, I reached way down deep in my black being for those cultural resources that enable African Americans to express themselves in the face of death.</p>
<p>I close with a word about my parents who did not have my opportunity; so, when I teach, write, and speak I remember them and try to do it for them. Since they never had a chance to stand before white people and tell them what they think, I have got to do it for them. No matter where I am in the world, I think of Lucy and Charlie Cone, and of all the other Lucy and Charlie Cones out there who cannot speak, for fear of losing life or job. I see their faces and feel their spirit flowing through my body, encouraging me to speak the truth. They deepen my spirituality and give me something to hold onto, something that I can feel in the depth of my being, giving me courage to write the truth so they can understand it. It’s a spiritual experience, because I am doing something for people I love who cannot speak to white people about the crimes committed against them. So, why do I need to speak for myself? I speak for people, as Martin Luther King Jr. said, “who have been left out of the sunlight of opportunity.” If there is passion in this text, that’s because I was thinking of Lucy and Charlie, without whose love I would not be able to make my theological stand in the face of so much white opposition. And as long as I do that, I’ll stay on the right theological track.</p>
