<abstract>
<p>This paper proposes a critical contribution to the contemporary debates around the ‘culture of fear’ in media and communication studies. It seeks to open up new lines of inquiry into the political significance of fear in the production of everyday life and subjectivity in the context of hyper-mediatized global modernity. Drawing on Jesús Martín-Barbero’s concept of ‘mediations’, the paper aims to contribute to the vital critical communication and media studies scholarship on the culture of fear by proposing the incorporation of analyses of the diverse and creative struggles of social movements working to subvert the political uses of fear in the dominant public sphere.</p>

<body>
<p>Over the last decade, the notion that societies contending with the instabilities of hyper-mediatized global modernity are gripped by pervasive fear has become increasingly resonant in scholarly, policy and media discourses (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1742766512463039">Bauman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1742766512463039">Castells, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1742766512463039">Massumi, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1742766512463039">Sarai Media Lab, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1742766512463039">Zizek, 2008</xref>). This diffuse body of work, broadly concerned with what has come to be known as ‘the culture of fear’, conceives of fear as a public, political emotion that is culturally and materially elaborated against a background of radically disparate experiences and geographies. In addition, through a critical analysis of the increasing significance of discourses and material referents of fear in contemporary lived experience, a growing body of literature has highlighted commercial media’s active role in creating climates of fear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1742766512463039">Altheide, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1742766512463039">Glassner, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1742766512463039">Hernández Navaro, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1742766512463039">Macek, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1742766512463039">Reguillo, 2002</xref>). One of this literature’s major contributions has been the analysis of the affective role of communication industry power as it touches down on the increasingly precarious terrain of everyday human experience.</p>
<p>The importance of such work cannot be overstated. It has been vital for understanding how the circulation of fear operates as a technology of power amidst the chaotic violence and radical uncertainties that characterize global modernity and the antagonistic dynamics of network capitalism. Documenting and critically analysing fear in the dominant public sphere has proved effective at unveiling certain dynamics of power formation in the network society. Somehow, however, the abundant counter-cultural production that aims to block and subvert the socialization of fear has remained all but absent from this literature. The purpose of this paper is to reconsider the disproportionate focus on dominant modes of cultural production and circulation in the culture of fear literature. Such a unidirectional view of what is fundamentally a communicative process, I shall argue, evicts the primary objects of political fear and, paradoxically, elides the experience of a great swath of the subjects of politics as producers of contemporary culture. As a result, the radical diversity of ways in which fear is understood and resisted becomes largely invisible. By ignoring the evidence and skirting analysis of actually existing resistance to the politics of fear, the actions and ideas of the fear-mongers become primary. The world is given a strangely seamless appearance, as if it were populated by only two kinds of social actors: those whose critical capacities are paralysed by fear and those who are busy promoting it.</p>
<p>To address this significant analytic absence, I propose a way of complicating and broadening the study of political fear by revisiting insights from the work of communication scholar Jesús Martín-Barbero. Two decades ago, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1742766512463039">Martín-Barbero (1993)</xref> called for a shift in communication studies from the traditional focus on <italic>media</italic> to a focus on sociocultural <italic>mediations</italic> in order to take into account the multi-directionality of communication processes while eschewing the field’s media-centric inclinations. Such a perspective helps deepen our understanding of how people, both in their everyday lives and in more organized forms of political protest, are not simply subject to the prevailing ‘contents’ of culture, but, instead, appropriate culture itself and transform its meanings. The importance of mass cultural forms comes to be perceived in terms of their role in the articulation of increasingly differentiated social classes together and in antagonistic tension. For these reasons, Martín-Barbero’s approach is useful for conceptualizing the culture of fear as a communicational relation and, hence, as a relation that is infused with contradiction, antagonism and inter-subjective dynamism – a human relation, in other words, that is subject to endless renovation and transformation. This paper, therefore, urges a move away from the exclusive emphasis on the <italic>reproduction</italic> of fear to an engagement with the notion of <italic>contradiction</italic> and existing processes of <italic>contestation</italic>, opening up new forms of thinking about fear as a technology of political discipline. Conceptualized in this way, we can re-imagine fear – like all technologies – as subject to breakdown, re-tooling and re-appropriation.</p>
<p>The first section of this paper critically engages with the interdisciplinary ‘culture of fear’ literature, focusing on the communication-inflected research of the last decade. In part, my intention here is to highlight the extent to which this discourse is enmeshed within the context of late capitalist globalization and its associated ‘communication revolution’, but also to identify the limitations with its overall treatment of questions about social agency. The second section introduces the perspective of mediations to argue for a research approach that takes into account the multi-directionality of the circulation of political fear. Finally, I point briefly to some examples of cultural dissidence against the force of political fear, based in particular on efforts to appropriate public spaces of urban communication. These movements and appropriations show not only that fear is actively resisted by social actors, but also that oppositional cultural appropriations create counter-public spheres. Martín-Barbero’s theory of sociocultural mediations, I argue, enables us to analyse and recognize the centrality of cultural and communicational resistances to fear in broader struggles for a democratic public sphere.</p>

<title>Cultures of fear in the global network society</title>
<p>Terror networks, roiling economic meltdowns, communication infrastructure failures, ecological catastrophes, swirling pandemics and crime waves – these are among the most prominent harbingers of fear flowing and converging with undulating intensity through the globalized media-space over the last decade. Debates around the social and political nature of fear have been raging for centuries, and legions of notable thinkers – from Thomas Hobbes to Hannah Arendt – have reflected on the uses and abuses of fear in the formal political arena. But at the turn of the millennium, attention turned to the manifestation of fear as a pervasive social mood pushed and carried along by the persuasion industries of mass culture. Attempts to apprehend this indeterminate sensibility have led philosophers, filmmakers, journalists and media scholars to the conclusion that the global social life of late modernity is riven by a corrosive ‘culture of fear’.</p>
<p>At the most general level, the notion of a ‘culture of fear’ refers to the ways in which fear and its corollaries seep into the social fabric through direct and indirect forms of violence, coercion, intimidation and seduction. Arguably, this process is inseparable from one of the signal characteristics of this period: the growing socioeconomic importance and global cultural diffusion of commercial media technologies, forms and aesthetics. In the context of the hyper-mediatized globalization, ideas about fear are manifested and circulated throughout the network society, enabling a direct and vicarious interconnection of peoples’ experience of fear and insecurity. The culture of fear is, in this sense, a concept that is useful for thinking through the connections and contradictions arising in the contemporary context of globalized communication and sprawling political instabilities. In the global network society, fear is a connective tissue, a common experience that is alternatively vicarious, virtual and sharply material. It is in such a context, according to a number of commentators, that the historical use of political fear has found its most effective terrain of cultural elaboration and global diffusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1742766512463039">Altheide, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1742766512463039">Castells, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1742766512463039">Hardt and Negri, 2000</xref>). And herein we can identify three of the major discourses on the culture of fear arising over the last decade.</p>
<p>In the early 1990s, social theorists such as Juan Corradi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1742766512463039">Corradi et al., 1992</xref>) critiqued the de-politicized, psychological approach that once prevailed in Anglo-American fear studies. But catapulted by the succession of globalized shocks delivered by terrorists, revanchist states, chaotic financial markets and planetary rumblings, a decisively politicized interpretation of fear has become increasingly resonant in social thought. A number of writers, including <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1742766512463039">Brian Massumi (1993)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1742766512463039">Mike Davis (1998)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1742766512463039">Barry Glassner (1999)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1742766512463039">Larry Elliot and Dan Atkinson (1999)</xref> took up a political interpretation of fear in the years leading up to the culminating panics of Y2K, 9/11 and the launching of the global ‘War on Terror’. This work laid the ground for what has become one of the prevailing critical discourses of the culture of fear, namely the conviction that fear provides an explanatory device for understanding the psycho-social implications of our era’s tumultuous interconnectedness.</p>
<p>Sociologist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1742766512463039">Immanuel Wallerstein (2010)</xref>, for example, writes in a commentary on the sweeping cultural effects of the current and unremitting global financial crisis that ‘fear is the most pervasive public emotion in most of the world today’. The Rome-based World Social Summit stated similarly in a report entitled <italic>Fear in the Mega-Cities</italic> that fear is ‘the most useful key to understanding today’s society’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1742766512463039">2008</xref>: 8). This assertion is drawn from the study’s finding that feelings of everyday anxiety and acute fear had grown significantly in many of the world’s population centres over the last decade. And cultural critic Mary Zournazi has argued that fear ‘may well come to define the modern era as a feeling and emotion that surrounds much of the social and political landscape’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1742766512463039">2007</xref>: 93).</p>
<p>Another example is the work of political theorist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1742766512463039">Corey Robin (2004)</xref> who, in his erudite analysis of fear, from the fretful writing of Thomas Hobbes to the normalized coercive practices of the contemporary US workplace, contends that fear has animated political thought throughout modernity; given this history, he argues, fear ought to be conceived not as a discrete, ‘subpolitical’ emotion – as it has since come to be understood – but as a political idea residing at the centre of modern statecraft. Historian Joanna Bourke, in turn, opens her study of the cultural history of fear (published at a highpoint of public anxiety about terrorism, global war <italic>and</italic> the political uses and abuses of fear) with the claim that fear is ‘the most pervasive emotion of modern society’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1742766512463039">2005</xref>: ix). In much the same spirit, sociologist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1742766512463039">Zygmunt Bauman (2006)</xref> has elaborated his analytic of ‘liquid modernity’ to apprehend this collective state, which he characterizes as rife with surplus uncertainty, insecurity and fear. In this trembling liquid world, Bauman argues, traditional claims to representation have all but collapsed and fear has become an effective mobilizing emotion deployed by political entrepreneurs who claim to be guardians of security in its increasingly apparent absence. In the theatre of liquid modernity, Bauman contends, there are three roles to play, ‘perpetrators, victims and “collateral casualties”’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1742766512463039">2006</xref>: 98). In this view, we are all vulnerable, all in danger and all dangerous to one another.</p>
<p>A second major culture of fear discourse in contemporary literature turns around the media-fuelled proliferation of irrational fears, which is seen as a powerful force undermining people’s capacity to grasp the difference between imagined fears and genuine threats. Cultural critic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1742766512463039">Sandhya Devesan Nambiar (2010)</xref> argues that the increasingly competitive and capitalized world of television is the most important domain of today’s cultural over-production of surplus fear. Writing about the Indian culture industry, Nambiar says:<disp-quote>
<p>The media creates new monsters for us everyday, and serves them up in a news-mix related to fears of death, global warming, resource limitations, Red Terror, terror across the border, love jihad, the oil crisis, the food crisis, the water crisis, etc. It seems that every day is a battle fought over minor and major crises without end or resolution but within the ambit of the world that the media creates for us and cocoons us in, cut off from actual blood and gore. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1742766512463039">2010</xref>: 184)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>She argues that in this fear-media nexus, consumers of television experience fear voyeuristically, which desensitizes them to the actual violence and injustice that is taking place in the world outside the screen – with both a disorienting and dehumanizing effect.</p>
<p>The hit television programme, <italic>Cops</italic>, one of the longest running and most globally circulated reality shows in the history of television – broke into the market in 1989, depicting a world of random, inexplicable chaos and nihilistic violence unfolding in the geographic and social margins of various US cities. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1742766512463039">Elaine Rapping (2003)</xref> argues, this world is as instantly recognizable as it is incomprehensible – a somewhere ‘out there’ that appears both sinister and disorienting. A similar double logic overflows in another version of the post-Cold War reality television genre, Britain’s hit series, <italic>Big Brother</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1742766512463039">Bauman (2006)</xref> regards the programme’s eviction narrative as quintessential to the liquid modern context of ambient fear. While <italic>Cops</italic> featured mobile surveillance in the abject spaces of the anonymous American ‘no-go zones’, <italic>Big Brother</italic> represented another iteration of late modern insecurity: the hunger for fame as the antidote to the ever-present threat of abjection in neoliberalism’s increasingly Darwinian social order. While the show’s appreciation of pervasive, normalized surveillance betrayed a strangely celebratory appropriation of Cold-War fears, Bauman is more concerned with its underlying logic of generalized social insecurity. For Bauman, <italic>Big Brother’s</italic> chronicle of inevitable, public banishment inadvertently turned the show into a vehicle for the display of fears about social superfluousness. In the programme’s neoliberal cultural microcosm, punishment is the normal state of things and insecurity – both physical and existential – is the propellant of personal ambition. The winners being those who are exempted from eviction, a paradoxical version of liberalism’s negative conception of freedom (as freedom <italic>from</italic> fear) provides the show’s overarching rationality. Meanwhile, <italic>Big Brother</italic> projects the specificity of contemporary insecurity, where the relationship between reward and punishment are made to appear chaotic, haphazard and generally dependent on the individual’s talent for self-promotion.</p>
<p>An increasingly sensational commercial media and the mendacity of political entrepreneurs have, in turn, been regarded as fostering a cultural hegemony of fears that are disproportionate to actual threats. Sociologists <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1742766512463039">Barry Glassner (1999)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1742766512463039">Frank Furedi (2002)</xref>, two influential proponents of the ‘real threats versus imagined fears’ discourse, argue that a pandemic of irrational fears is sweeping across the cultural environments of advanced capitalist societies to disastrous effect. In his bestselling study, <italic>The Culture of Fear: Why Americans are Afraid of the Wrong Things</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1742766512463039">1999</xref>), Glassner sees the commercial imperative of the mainstream media as absolutely central to the socialization of fear, arguing that the profits of fear generated by the commercial media and by political entrepreneurs are largely responsible for the percolating fear that seems to define turn-of-the-century American culture. Yet, he puzzles, ‘Americans live in perhaps the safest time in human history, so how has it come about that there are so many fears and scares in the air, and so many of them are unfounded?’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1742766512463039">2004</xref>: 819). Among Glassner’s core concerns is the profitable disjuncture between fact and reality in which the commercial media trades. His studies cite a large quantity of facts about crime, illness and violence, tracking their unbridled misrepresentation in the commercial media.</p>
<p>In a typical example, Glassner points out that between 1990 and 1998, the US murder rate declined by 20 per cent. During the same period, network news stories featuring murder rose by 600 per cent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1742766512463039">Glassner, 2004</xref>). By scrutinizing reams of survey data, his studies reveal the serious implications of this kind of misreporting. He tracks the correspondingly steady climb of revanchist public attitudes about crime and punishment: the more stories are told – and, most importantly, the more specific and isolated incidents are generalized as social trends – through the commercial media’s lens, the more punitive and mercenary social attitudes become; the more insecure people are made to believe their immediate world is, the more they are willing to sacrifice others in the name of greater security. Most dangerously, Glassner contends, misplaced irrational fears have become the animating principle in public policy, from criminal justice to environmental regulation.</p>
<p>A third discourse in the contemporary culture of fear literature is concerned with the ways in which the mediatization of fear operates as a strategy of power. According to this discourse, the narration of contemporary fears – whether experienced directly by its very real dangers or vicariously through our increasingly sensational media environment – is central to the pursuit and maintenance of political power. In his meditation on the contours of modern violence, Slavoj Zizek argues that fear is ‘a basic constituent of today’s subjectivity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1742766512463039">2008</xref>: 40). Fear, he proposes, provides an affective means of political rationality in societies increasingly characterized by widespread cultural disorientation and alienation from political life. ‘In societies where everything is managed technocratically’, he contends, ‘the only way to mobilize people is on the basis of fear’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1742766512463039">2008</xref>: 273). For Zizek, the commercial media’s singular attention to subjective violence (that which is carried out by an identifiable antagonist) directs any political understanding of fear away from the more appropriate structural critique of society. Such an emphasis on the individual hero, victim or villain, Zizek contends, masks the systemic violence that permeates late capitalist society, including its mass mediated representation and symbolic reproduction. It effectively conceals, he might say, the myriad ways in which violence is exacted through the symbolic and structural systems of global network culture.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1742766512463039">David Altheide (2006)</xref> makes an analogous point in his major study of the US commercial media’s role in promoting war as the necessary response to the outrage of 9/11. He argues that we ought to recognize that the politics of fear that are circulated by the culture industries are inseparable from a generalized culture of fear flowing through the deep crevices of contemporary US society. Fear, he contends, is one of the few unifying affects in the polity, and this accounts for its enormous existential force in times of crisis. Altheide draws on years of empirical research and reflection on the relationship between media power and fear as both a way of life and a political technology deployed to secure an increasingly asymmetrical, insecure social order. As one of the few domains for the articulation of some form of public speech, he contends, the mechanisms of the commercial mass media are instrumental in this regard. Writing shortly after the re-election of George W Bush, Altheide argued that the war in Iraq was<disp-quote>
<p>part of an expanding politics of fear, or decision makers’ promotion and use of audience beliefs and assumptions about danger, risk and fear in order to achieve certain goals … The mass media are the most important source of information and social control because they have helped make fear a part of our life, our language, and our point of view. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1742766512463039">2006</xref>: 1–2)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Media scholar <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1742766512463039">Steve Macek (2006)</xref> similarly grapples with this media-fuelled infusion of fear into the fabric of everyday US life. In his study on the relationship between the dominant media portrayal of the city as a war zone and the growing resonance of revanchist right-wing urban politics over the last four decades, he argues that representations of the city as scary, wretched and degraded have effectively marshalled historic anti-urban anxieties and funnelled them towards bolstering the power of conservative political entrepreneurs who have been effective at constructing the city itself as a threat to property, family and order.</p>
<p>This intimate relationship between fear and the proliferating insecurities of mediatized society seems to have inspired <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1742766512463039">Manuel Castells (2009)</xref> to conclude his volume on communication and power in the global network society with a foray into the culture of fear. The kinds of violence, fear and intimidation that hail from all corners today are, according to Castells, meaning-making processes that also produce concrete power relations. Fear, he maintains, is a communicational relation and its mediatized socialization is a signal problematic of contemporary communication-driven globalization. ‘Violence, broadcast over the communication networks’, he suggests, ‘becomes the medium for the culture of fear’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1742766512463039">2009</xref>: 417). Drawing on extensive empirical analysis, his study mines the intersection between power and meaning-making processes, concluding that the proliferation of micro-media publics in the Internet age has not undermined the accumulated politico-cultural power of the mass media industries. In today’s global network society, he believes, the individual and the collective mind conjoin in new ways; it is there, he argues, that fearful worlds are constituted.</p>
<p>I believe what ties these three discourses together is an underlying concern with the powerful social agency of fear-circulating political entrepreneurs and the global communication industries. Their overwhelming power to shape culture as a culture of fear adds urgency to the arguments made by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1742766512463039">Bauman (2006)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1742766512463039">Macek (2006)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1742766512463039">Glassner (1999)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1742766512463039">Zizek (2008)</xref> and others about the incompatibility of democracy and a culture of fear.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1742766512463039">
<title>A critique</title>
<p>For all its important insights, this proliferating literature on the culture of fear raises a number of conceptual and political problems. One of them is the extent to which its major discourses render invisible the experiences, perspectives and actions of the very subjects of the culture of fear. This is a puzzling omission for researchers concerned with the corrosive reverberations of fear as it circulates, touches down and weaves into the fabric of today’s sociality. If we agree that a culture of fear is entirely incompatible with even the weakest understanding of democracy, it should then be more than appropriate to study the problem politically – that is, through an analysis of the lived antagonisms confronting the problem of fear.</p>
<p>The problem lies in part with the conceptual framework of much of the recent literature, which suggests that the pervasive <italic>representation</italic> and <italic>reception</italic> of fear narratives are constitutive of an entire social experience. Culture, in other words, is seen through the homogenizing lens of reproduction, and with little attention to questions of contestation and contradiction. Scholars have been right in paying attention to the politics of representation, for these are obviously central to the socialization of fear. As Gramsci perceptively warned, however, when culture is treated as an autonomous realm, conceptually detached from its materiality, this mode of critique loses its demystifying power. The culturalization of politics that the culture of fear discourses have understandably targeted paradoxically evicts politics from the analytic framework. The notion that fear, understood as a pervasive representation, can be constitutive of a culture (as the term suggests) implies a reductive sense of enveloping fear, one that turns the emotion into a generic experience that people absorb passively.</p>
<p>In contrast, a grounded investigation into the cultural politics of fear that goes beyond the representation of fear in the commercial media and in political discourse evokes a much more complex and contested situation. There is much to gain from developing an understanding of the socialization of fear, not as the mediatized reflection of a fear-subsumed society, but as a process of refraction through the media matrix, if only because such an understanding helps bring to light a series of conflicts, tensions and perceptual hierarchies. That sensational news coverage can appear persuasive in its propagation of a culture of fear should alert us to the workings of the symbolic system in which it is enmeshed. An interpretation of cultural mediation confined to questions of representation and reception is disproportionately focused on the powerful. Those who own and control the means of representation become the protagonists of culture writ large. From this largely unidirectional perspective, only those who produce content from above are able to produce social meaning, while the objects of their messaging passively absorb the copiously apportioned fear.</p>
<p>It could also be argued that the prevailing unidirectional approach to analysing fear as a technology of politics neglects the ways in which both fear narratives and actually existing fear are <italic>differentially</italic> experienced. While the content of surveys and ascendant media genres may suggest pervasive social fear, the ways in which our fears are experienced and socially valorized reflect the organization of social power more broadly. In other words, fear as a natural human emotion may be ubiquitous and indiscriminate, but its social and cultural significance lies in its productive character and its affective power on the level of human experience. Fear, like hurricanes, earthquakes and floods, refracts larger structural asymmetries. The homogenization of experience that results from the predominant top-down methodological focus of contemporary critical narratives about the culture of fear inadvertently reproduces the disproportionate emphasis on the fears of the politically empowered members of society, a priority that is characteristic of the dominant symbolic order they critique. As a result, the perspectives and actions of the very subjects that constitute the primary objects of political fear remain largely invisible. Fears of crime reported on by the media, for example, may propel the middle class into gated communities. But as Rachel Pain and Susan Smith (2009) have argued, the people that are most systematically branded as members of groups ‘to be feared’ – migrants, youth, the poor, those who are socially and spatially designated as ‘outside’ – are also those who are made to experience fear and danger by this demonization. The enveloping terminology of culture erases the highly differentiated experience of fear, even while growing differentiation – particularly in the form of economic, gender, racialized and geographical asymmetries – is precisely that which is identified as the primary source of today’s fears and insecurities.</p>
<p>The political implications of this problem become apparent in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1742766512463039">World Social Summit’s (2008)</xref> study on contemporary urban fears. The study found that its respondents’ most wrenching fears were attributed to the socioeconomic and cultural shifts associated with the destabilizing effects of neoliberal globalization. The disintegrating social safety net, spiralling violence and growing despair over a sense of lost community were all identified as causes of increased fear. Yet, for most mega-city dwellers, the fears that ranked the highest were expressed in subjective terms: fear of sickness, losing a loved one, downward social mobility and violent attack. In separating personal experience and politics, by de-linking fear of interpersonal violence from the neoliberal retrenchment of the social wage, for example, these findings suggest something important about the way in which fear is conventionally analysed as a political problem, namely by having recourse to an analytical process that naturalizes fear and, for this very reason, also exteriorizes it from politics (despite the emphasis on regarding its propagation as politically significant).</p>
<p>This contradiction – the paradoxical de-politicization of fear associated with a top-down abstracted view of its politics – deserves greater attention. All of the writers I have discussed here are keenly interested in unveiling the myriad manipulations, coercions and overt and concealed violence that provide the scaffolding for fear as a technology of power. Focusing on the manner in which fear is circulated through the global communications infrastructure has been extremely useful in such analyses of the circulation of fear, especially in the context of hyper-mediatized modernity. Yet, the prevailing methodological emphasis on commercial media and its reception contains an apparent bias: it unwittingly reproduces the untenable assumption that only the powerful produce culture and that the only public sphere that is politically significant is that of the dominant symbolic order.</p>
<p>One unfortunate implication of this unchecked slant in the critical culture of fear literature is that the emphasis it places on the activities, aspirations and discourses of the powerful inadvertently masks the cultural agency and capacity of the less powerful to resist these. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1742766512463039">Castells (2009)</xref>, for example, poses a tripartite vision of the culture of fear, one that is populated by terrorists, terror fighting states and civilian victims. Similarly, Glassner’s study carves the world into three distinct camps: the fearful, the feared and the fear mongers. And as we have already seen, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1742766512463039">Bauman’s (2006)</xref> world of liquid fear is inhabited by effective manipulators or willing dupes. Such descriptions leave no conceptual space for research and analysis of the myriad acts of individual or collective resistance that do consistently appear, however marginally, wherever fear-as-power touches down.</p>
<p>One final critique can be made here of the culture of fear literature, and it relates to the applicability of the rationality-versus-irrationality binary (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1742766512463039">Furedi, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1742766512463039">Glassner, 1999</xref>). Fear, like all concepts that try to capture or explain human experience, is very difficult to define categorically. One of the main problems that emerge in any attempt to define fear is that the very act of definition implies an authoritative appraisal of some kind, a delineation of worthy and unworthy fears, or of rational and irrational ones. This Manichean framework reveals very little about the deeply uneven and socially complex processes involved in the cultural production of fear. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1742766512463039">John Gold and David Revill (2003)</xref> argue, the cleaving of fears into categories of rationality and irrationality allows for the rejection of any argument framed in terms of fear by labelling it as irrational, and, therefore, outside of legitimate political debate. Furthermore, this binary does not provide an apparatus for a sustained examination of how the experience of fear works politically in society, nor does it allow us to conceptualize this experience as a dynamic and contradictory practice, rather than as an inert object. In brief, this definitional framework is conspicuously inadequate for the task of accounting for the inevitable cracks and fissures in the social production and circulation of fear.</p>
<p>One way to sum up these series of problems with the critical discourses of the culture of fear is to signal their obfuscation of questions about social agency. The omission of research on resistance to the cultural politics of fear not only neglects its empirical existence, it also leaves out a vital source of knowledge about alternative socialities to those of fear as a way of life. As historians of social movements show, political moments and movements produce knowledge about the world they are acting to change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1742766512463039">Briggs, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1742766512463039">Kelley, 2002</xref>). Similarly, in showing that global network culture is characterized by abundance as well as scarcity, by sudden openings as well as new enclosures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1742766512463039">Terranova, 2004</xref>), media and communication scholars have drawn our attention to the ways in which new forms of creativity and knowledge emerge from this contradictory and dynamic context. Drawing on these insights to grapple with the dissemination and socialization of fear as a feature of everyday life opens up a new set of epistemological possibilities for thinking about and acting in a globalizing network society reportedly awash in fear.</p>

<title>Mediations: Bringing in the view ‘from below’</title>
<p>The location of human agency amidst the world’s enormous communication industries has been a persistent controversy in critical communication scholarship, coming into sharpest focus in the media imperialism and active audience debates and, more recently, in feminist media studies. In the early 1990s, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1742766512463039">Martín-Barbero (1993)</xref> intervened productively in this debate by posing a renovation to the uses of Gramsci’s elaboration of hegemony. His proposals sought to move attention away from instrumental conceptions of communication as reproduction and towards an approach that emphasized appropriation and social practice. Drawing on the varied and complex adaptations of Gramsci’s work in Latin American communication studies, Martín-Barbero argued for the study of communication from the perspective of (popular) culture, which, he contended, challenges the prevailing media-centric and technological approaches to communication.</p>
<p>Forsaking the effacement of human agency produced by the media-centric view of communication, Martín-Barbero’s concept of <italic>mediations</italic> brought to light the dynamic, contradictory and deeply contested production of culture and society by people in action in their lives. It sought to renovate distorted conceptualizations of hegemony, which betrayed, he argued, ‘a class ethnocentrism in which the dominated classes have no ideas and are not capable of producing ideas’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1742766512463039">1993</xref>: 69). His approach to mediations marked a move away from a theory of cultural reproduction towards a theory of cultural protagonism, locating the media not as central, but as one among many entities within the broad cultural field of communication <italic>processes –</italic> themselves a rich, ambiguous and contradictory space of cultural and social transformation. To a large extent, what made this critique of media-centric analyses so valuable was that it endeavoured to populate communication studies while highlighting the distinction between communication and the circulation of information.</p>
<p>Martín-Barbero’s intervention sought to bring attention to the social agency of ordinary people, opening international communication studies to new pathways that diverge from both the functionalism of the ‘uses and gratifications’ thread in communication research and a version of postmodern approaches that offer boundless appreciation of audiences’ diverse interpretations as constitutive of the limits of politics. By turning towards a recognition of the everyday appropriations and social uses of communication practices, Martín-Barbero’s concept of mediations signalled a move away from an emphasis on representation and reproduction to an appreciation of contestation and contradiction. His approach, therefore, entailed ‘moving the communicative process to the dense and ambiguous space occupied by subjective experience placed in certain socio-historical contexts’ (Martín-Barbero, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1742766512463039">Beasley-Murray, 2001</xref>). By situating media within its broader context, highlighting the importance of place and spatialities, this notion of mediations posed a radical critique of unidirectional approaches to the relationship between communication and culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1742766512463039">Couldry, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1742766512463039">Escosteguy, 2001</xref>). Elaborating upon his approach, for example, Martín-Barbero (in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1742766512463039">Beasley-Murray, 2001</xref>: 225) has argued that:<disp-quote>
<p>[the] process of reception only illuminates the apparatus and the child watching the apparatus, whilst the social use of the media, their appropriation, relates to the rest of life, not only to the moment in which we watch television or listen to the radio, but rather to the spaces and times of the production and circulation of the meaning of what is seen and/or read.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This re-conceptualization of circulation as a halting, contradictory process in which re-signification by way of appropriation is made visible aimed to dispense with an ossified idea of meaning-circulation, one that more often seemed to conceive a crushing deluge rather than a dynamic mesh of multi-directional currents where the reverberations from below are as culturally significant as the impositions from above.</p>
<p>Lasswellian-inspired transmission models now reside at the margins of communication theory, and so in the context of the hyper-mediatization of everyday life, the resonance of Martín-Barbero’s concept of mediations may seem to have followed. But a close look at the critical fear studies literature reveals a persistent residue of the unidirectional conception of hegemony that Martín-Barbero sought to overcome. His emphasis on acts of social use versus reproduction raises the all-important questions: What do people do with what they encounter? How do they appropriate messages and how do they create alternate meanings? Given the extent to which the hegemonic communication of fear in the literature is still a decisively top-down process, it seems more than appropriate to revisit these elaborations on the concept of mediations. It is an approach that enables us to recognize a multitude of social movement critiques of the culture of fear, simultaneously revealing how the circulation of fear is never unidirectional.</p>

<sec id="section4-1742766512463039">
<title>Re-appropriating cultures of fear</title>
<p>Generally speaking, Martín-Barbero’s work explores the ways in which socialities are being re-organized amidst the fissures and disproportionalities of power that infuse late modernity’s hyper-mediated culture. Sociality refers to the practices of society-making, to the social elaboration of new ways of being together, the very practices that are inextricable from the social dynamics of communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1742766512463039">Beasley-Murray, 2001</xref>). ‘In the act of communicating’, Martín-Barbero maintains, ‘key dimensions of humans as social beings are mobilized and expressed: those that lead to the constitution and maintenance of collectivities … and also those that ignite the struggle for disrupting order’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1742766512463039">2006</xref>: 286). These can be the socialities of fear analysed by Altheide, Glassner, Bauman and others, or they can be dissenting socialities formed in opposition to cultures of fear. While the latter experience has been virtually invisible in the literature, a closer inspection reveals instances of social movements appropriating diverse spaces of communication in order to express an alternate sociality to that of pervasive, metastasizing fear.</p>
<p>These acts of appropriation may appear at moments when fear overflows its unsteady bounds, as was the case in Cochabamba during the violent, protracted battles around the corporate enclosure of the city’s water supply. While clashes between the residents and the Bolivian military raged on, an intriguing graffito appeared on a downtown wall: ‘A city that is no longer afraid is capable of the impossible’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1742766512463039">‘Notes from Nowhere’, 2003</xref>). The conflagration in Cochabamba drove this graffiti writer to identify fear as an object of dissent and to use the wall as a site for the articulation of alternative socialities to fear. More specifically, the message sought to invoke an open image of what could lie on the other side of fear, namely a city that is capable of the impossible. The graffiti writer’s attempt to conjure up a world that does not yet exist articulates a social imagination that engages with the problem of fear while seeking to appropriate its political power, intervening at the level of perception with an idea and a practice dedicated to the production of new socialities in spite of the escalation of fear as a way of life.</p>
<p>Such a sentiment is reiterated in different places and the world over. Just as the Cochabamba graffiti writer fought fear using the available media – the city’s walls – dissidents the world over have appropriated a variety of public media – from buses to streets to the Internet to radio and television stations – to directly pose an alternative sociality to the culture of fear. In 2005, for example, when the public transit authority in Vancouver announced its plans to launch Canada’s first armed transit police force (which it justified as a necessary measure to ease any public fears about dangerous criminals and terrorist attacks), the Vancouver Bus Riders Union (BRU) responded by launching a campaign entitled: ‘We won’t ride with fear!’ Organizers with this grass-roots transit justice group boarded buses, using them as a platform to contest the weaponization of public space. Drawing on the organizing innovations of the US civil rights movement, the BRU turned the transit infrastructure into a stage for the expression of public dissent, engaging in what they called ‘direct contact organizing’ with bus riders and drivers, drawing links between privatization by force and the political use of fear to criminalize and exclude. Through these actions, the BRU sought to pose an alternative sociality of mutual security by countering the prevailing negative definition of security based on fear (security <italic>from</italic> crime, terrorism, etc.) and articulating a positive conception of security based on the common good (in other words, one that could be discussed in terms of security <italic>of</italic> housing, mobility, health care, and so on).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1742766512463039">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another illustrative act of appropriation of spaces of communication as a means to articulate an alternative to the corrosive sociality of fear occurred in the Mexican city of Oaxaca the following year. During a mass demonstration denouncing violent police attacks on striking school teachers, a group of women entered the building of the state television station. Frustrated with what they considered to be the mainstream media’s perilously disproportionate depictions of the teachers, the women demanded that they be granted airtime to voice their side of the story. When the station refused, hundreds of women temporarily took over the station, as well as two adjacent state-run radio stations. Over the ensuing hours, days and weeks, these women learned how to use the equipment and immediately opened the space for the airing of previously invisible, inaudible grievances, stories, analyses and artistic expressions. As more demonstrations erupted, the radio station, which they renamed Radio Cacerola (Radio Saucepan), served as an emergency response system, requesting listener support in debates, protests and organizing barricades to block the army’s advance on the city. In this way, the women running Radio Cacerola sought to convert the apparatus that they determined to be a principle means of fear-mongering into a tool for democratic education, communication and direct participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1742766512463039">Stephen, 2007</xref>). According to anthropologist Lynn Stephen, ‘The women hit upon a key ingredient for supporting the movement as seen by both their success in mobilizing people quickly and by the level of repression aimed at their occupation of the media as confrontations heated up … ’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1742766512463039">2007</xref>: 38). Stephen discusses how the radio was appropriated to address people’s fear and to solicit active expressions of solidarity from dispersed listeners. She recounts how, at the height of the conflict, when tension and the threat of violence pervaded the city, the voice of a young woman implored listeners, ‘Don’t be afraid. We are not afraid … Do not be afraid to come down to help us to fight this intimidation. We are a pacific movement; we have so many people they cannot force us out’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1742766512463039">Stephen, 2007</xref>: 40).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1742766512463039">Clemencia Rodriguez’s (2011)</xref> study of citizens’ media initiatives in Colombia provides yet another example of grass-roots communication practices that endeavour to open spaces of communication heretofore enclosed by fear.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1742766512463039">2</xref></sup> Through a series of fascinating case studies, Rodriguez explores citizens’ media projects that aim to reclaim spaces for cultural resistance in communities struggling to survive amidst Colombia’s protracted low intensity war. The projects she examines seek to make visible aspects of life that continue to matter outside of the context of war. In so doing, these projects pose a stark contrast to the mainstream media’s inordinate focus on the spectacle of violence and the fear associated with the war. These grass-roots communicators are less concerned with countering the effects of mainstream media than they are determined to create alternative spaces of cultural production that provide people with spaces of encounter not mediated by war. ‘By triggering communication processes that draw people back into their local public spaces’, she argues, ‘citizens’ media can help communities re-appropriate their spaces from the logic of war’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1742766512463039">Rodriguez, 2011</xref>: 241). And like Martín-Barbero, upon whose work she draws, Rodriguez’s case studies provide the basis for a critique of a media-centric and informational approach to the study of communication. She shows how grass-roots radio, cinema and performance projects initiated in communities cornered in conflict zones have made significant contributions to combating the force of fear, not because the technology inclines users towards participatory democracy, nor because they have devised convincing messages; rather, she shows, a community’s ability to create spaces of solidarity in the face of extreme and terrifying violence is dependent on the extent to which grass-roots communication projects are embedded in a wider network of social justice movements. She cites a document produced by a coalition of community radio practitioners that clearly makes this point:<disp-quote>
<p>In a context in which war and armed groups impose a sense of harsh individuality and ‘survival of the fittest’, radio producers recognize the potential of a sense of collective: ‘In a region such as ours, where armed conflict has left deep scars like a lack of trust … you don’t know if the person you are talking to is a paramilitary, or who is it that you are talking with? … This provokes fear, suspicion, mistrust, so how can you build a common future? This makes collective work even more valuable. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1742766512463039">Rodriguez, 2011</xref>: 170–171)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>I use these all too brief examples to point to some of the many ways in which the circulation of fear is at times interrupted, appropriated, subverted and thereby mediated in the sense proposed by Martín-Barbero. Here we encounter three instances of social movements appropriating spaces of public communication in an effort to create alternative socialities to the pervasive culture of fear. While their actions and ideas may often be opaque to those outside of the immediate context in which they arise, such examples of fear dissidence pose concrete, living critiques of the prevailing conception of the culture of fear as an all-enveloping condition from which there is no escape.</p>
<p>To draw attention to such examples of the mediation of circulating political fear is not the same as suggesting that dispersed, often fleeting, acts of reinterpretation and re-appropriation constitute the limits of politics. For scholars of the culture of fear in the global network society, the study of its multiple forms of resistance introduces important new questions such as, if a culture of fear does indeed create subjects, then does it not also become the potential basis for politics? In other words, does the proliferating fear characteristic of hyper-mediatized global modernity open up new lines of connection as well as new enclosures? In turn, does forsaking a conceptual emphasis on cultural reproduction change the role of the global media system in this process? And what potentialities exist for the creation of alternative socialities to fear through the re-appropriation of mass mediated meanings?</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This paper has endeavoured to examine ways of understanding and critiquing the culture of fear. Through an exploration of the multi-directionality of communication and resistance, I have sought to open up new lines of inquiry into the political significance of fear in the production of everyday life and subjectivity in the context of hyper-mediatized global modernity. The paper proposes a way of analysing counter-cultural confrontations with political fear, enabling critical communication studies to incorporate into its analyses of contemporary cultural change the diverse and creative efforts to subvert the proliferation of fear discourses in the dominant public sphere.</p>
<p>To do this, I seek to elucidate an overlooked paradox that the culture of fear discourse can help to uncover. While the affective power of fear is arguably linked to the steady enclosures of the public sphere in neoliberal globalization, a closer look at the social practices of the subjects of fear suggests, as the political economist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1742766512463039">Massimo de Angelis (2007)</xref> points out, communication, or human sociality, is one thing that is virtually impossible to enclose. As oppositional media theorists and practitioners persistently remind us, in moments of political retrenchment, emancipatory communication practices have a vital role to play in opening spaces where alternative meanings and socialities can circulate. Taking this perspective, we find that the study of the circulation of fear can and needs to be extended beyond analyses of the reproduction of fear through an increasingly commercial, concentrated and fear-mongering global media system. Our attention must also be turned towards the diverse forms of social appropriation where the articulation of counter-narratives and practices meant to undermine the political salience of fear is made possible and rendered audible. I argue that Martín-Barbero’s concept of mediations opens up possibilities for reflection and analysis of the construction of alternatives to fear as a way of life and politics. This approach uncouples the study of fear from the top-down media-centric view that has dominated the critical study of its contemporary cultural elaboration. If facing up to the pervasive circulation of fear is a political and cultural aim, then an examination of the potentialities in emancipatory communication practices can help us to identify some of the possible openings in which to pose a democratic counter-politics.</p>
