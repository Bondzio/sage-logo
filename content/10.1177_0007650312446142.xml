<p>This June 2012 issue consists of two research articles, a dissertation abstract, and a special tribute to Professor Thomas M. Jones of the University of Washington. Dr. Jones was the first editor of this journal when under sponsorship by the International Association for Business and Society (IABS) in partnership with Roosevelt University and SAGE Publications. IABS and the discipline of business and society owe a considerable debt to Dr. Jones for his outstanding contributions.</p>
<p>The lead article, by Sefa Hayibor, concerns “Equity and Expectancy Considerations in Stakeholder Action.” The author argues that research typically assumes that stakeholders act against (i.e., sanction) an organization to safeguard or promote self-interest. This “interest-based” view of stakeholder action is in effect a mirror image of the basic self-interest assumption made in stockholder theory. The author inquires into the conditions under which stakeholders will take action against an organization, for the purpose of elaborating the interest-based view more explicitly. To develop propositions concerning such conditions, the author draws on equity theory and expectancy theory—which are approaches to motivational theorizing. In other words, he inquires into what motivates stakeholder action against an organization. Some conditions are more likely than other conditions to precipitate stakeholder action. As the author explains, equity theory incorporates the concept of discontent because of one’s interests not being met and expectancy theory addresses the perceived ability of the stakeholder to act against an organization. A calculus of action thus involves simultaneously a discontent (or inequity) and a prediction (or capability of useful action). A stakeholder may be discontented but relatively powerless (by self-perception); a stakeholder may be contented and thus unconcerned with power or influence. A stakeholder who is both discontented and perceives opportunity for useful action is thus more likely to act against an organization. The article provides a useful review of stakeholder, equity, and expectancy literatures. A set of nine propositions develops the author’s insights. The author develops a combined equity and expectancy framework for understanding conditions for stakeholder action.</p>
<p>The second research article, by Jay van Wyk, addresses “HIV/AIDS as Business Risk: A South African Case Study.” The author uses a political system framework to study the political sources of business risk in the context of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in South Africa. The article is interesting in discussing business risk formation and updating as a political process, one occurring in this instance in an institutional environment in South Africa in which the government had tended for some years toward an ambivalence concerning the HIV/AIDS situation. The author provides a valuable contribution to our understanding of the interaction among business strategy, institutional environment, governmental policy, and risks to people.</p>
<p>The reader may wish to consult the December 2011 issue (Volume 50, Issue 4) of this journal, which featured a special forum on reform in South Africa. The two articles published then were <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0007650312446142">Andreasson (2011)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0007650312446142">Arya and Bassi (2011)</xref>. The first concerns corporate governance reform, with emphasis on the King Reports and Anglo-American divergence in governance approaches. The second concerns broad-based Black economic empowerment legislation in South Africa and the implications of Codes of Good Practice for corporate social responsibility.</p>
<p>It is a privilege to have the opportunity to publish a moving tribute to Professor Thomas M. Jones organized by his former students and other colleagues. Dr. Jones is the Boeing Company Endowed Professor in Business Management at the University of Washington’s Foster School of Business. Receiving his PhD from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1977, he began his distinguished academic career at the University of Washington in 1978. Tom Jones is one of the outstanding scholars in business and society topics. Importantly to this journal, he was the first editor of <italic>BAS</italic> appointed when the International Association for Business and Society (IABS) became the sponsor in 1993. Founded in 1960, <italic>BAS</italic> had been edited at Roosevelt University until it became a SAGE Publications journal and received IABS sponsorship. This tribute was organized by Professors Paul C. Godfrey and Bradley R. Agle of Brigham Young University during a December 2010 biennial stakeholder conference. Both received their PhD degrees at the University of Washington.</p>
<p>The issue features a dissertation abstract by Dr. Haiying Lin on “Strategic Alliances for Environmental Improvements.” The author received the PhD degree at George Mason University and presently is an assistant professor of public policy and corporate sustainability at the School of Environment, Enterprise and Development, University of Waterloo, Canada. <italic>BAS</italic> helps to disseminate the work of young scholars by publishing dissertation abstracts. Interested authors should contact the editor. This dissertation seeks to integrate the resource-based view of the firm and institutional theory to examine the varied motivations of firms to form strategic alliances for environmental issues. The author proposes that such environmental alliances are typically either competency or legitimacy oriented. A conceptual framework is supported empirically by a sample of 74 firms that participated in 146 environmental alliances in the United States from 1991 to 2007. The dissertation combines conceptual development and empirical analysis in an important topic area.</p>
