<abstract>
<p>To provide cross-cultural empirical data for the advancement of supervisor competencies, we investigated differences in clinical supervision between South Korean and the United States from the supervisees’ perspective. Specifically, the comparative descriptive study had 191 South Korean and 187 U.S. supervisee participants receiving clinical supervision. Pursuing a hypothesis testing approach, comparative descriptive data across several variables suggested that there were more similarities than differences between supervision practices between the two cultures. Implications for theory, research, and practice were discussed.</p>

<body>
<p>A significant advancement in clinical supervision in the past decade was the paradigm shift to a focus on competencies. In the United States, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0011000012442650">Falender et al. (2004)</xref> defined competencies for psychology supervision. “Overall competence in supervision is the product of many component competencies that together and in combination determine a psychologist’s competence as a supervisor” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0011000012442650">Falender et al., 2004</xref>, p. 777). Although these authors framed the competencies through the lens of diversity and cultural competence, specific multicultural competences for clinical supervisors were not delineated. Using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0011000012442650">Rodolfa et al.’s (2005)</xref> cube model of the core competency areas in psychology, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0011000012442650">Fouad et al. (2009)</xref> explicated competency benchmarks for professional psychology, devoting a separate section to cultural diversity and to supervision.</p>
<p>Three competency benchmarks are relevant to the study presented herein. Specifically, competent supervisors demonstrate (D. Awareness of factors affecting quality):
<disp-quote>
<p><italic>Readiness for Practicum</italic>. Basic knowledge of and sensitivity to issues related to individual and cultural differences (i.e., the American Psychological Association [APA] definition) as they apply to the supervision process and relationships,</p>
<p><italic>Readiness for Internship</italic>. Knowledge about the impact of diversity on all professional settings and supervision participants including self as defined by APA policy; beginning knowledge of personal contribution to therapy and to supervision, and</p>
<p><italic>Entry to Practice</italic>. Understanding of other individuals and groups and intersection dimensions of diversity in the context of supervision practice, able to engage in reflection on the role of one’s self on therapy and in supervision. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0011000012442650">Fouad et al., 2009</xref>, p. S22)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In short, competent supervisors demonstrate and apply basic knowledge of and sensitivity to the scientific and theoretical literature on individual and cultural differences in clinical supervision. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0011000012442650">Falender et al. (2004)</xref> urged supervisors to employ multiple diversity variables when conceptualizing and working with supervisees from collectivist cultures. The problem, however, is that there is a dearth of empirical literature about supervision in specific cultures. How are supervisors to ascertain the multiple diversity variables to consider when working with supervisees of a different cultural background?</p>
<p>To meet the competency standards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0011000012442650">Fouad et al., 2009</xref>), it is desirable for supervisors to be well informed about specific ethnic and cultural groups (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0011000012442650">American Psychological Association, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0011000012442650">Fukuyama, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0011000012442650">Nilsson &amp; Anderson, 2004</xref>). In fact, some authors suggested that cultural issues should be systematically addressed when supervisors and supervisees come from different cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011000012442650">Bernard &amp; Goodyear, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0011000012442650">Nilsson &amp; Anderson, 2004</xref>), for instance, to avoid racial microaggressions in supervision (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0011000012442650">Sue, Capodilupo et al., 2007</xref>). Moreover, the lack of cultural knowledge, awareness, and responsiveness of supervisors can adversely affect supervisees, the supervision relationship, and supervision outcomes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0011000012442650">Burkard et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0011000012442650">Nilsson &amp; Anderson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0011000012442650">Utsey, Gernat, &amp; Hammar, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition, the applicability and suitability of Western counseling psychology to other countries has been an important research theme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0011000012442650">Cheung, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0011000012442650">Draguns, 2004</xref>), as counseling psychology has become more globalized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0011000012442650">Adair, Coelho, &amp; Luna, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0011000012442650">Leong &amp; Blustein, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0011000012442650">Pettifor, 2007</xref>). Because the profession of counseling psychology is regulated in most countries, colleagues in different parts of the world are striving to develop competency-based standards for training and supervision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0011000012442650">Cheung, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0011000012442650">Joo, 2009</xref>). Supervisors need to know the unique aspects of their own country and culture to achieve competence both as a therapist and as a supervisor and to provide effective clinical supervision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0011000012442650">Draguns, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0011000012442650">Pettifor, 2007</xref>). To deliver culturally sensitive therapy and supervision, supervisors also need to be aware of the similarities of their native culture to Western cultures.</p>
<p>A growing proportion of U.S. graduate students are from Asian cultures (e.g., Korea, China, Japan; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0011000012442650">Snyder, 2007</xref>). Recent trends suggest that Korean students constitute one of the largest of the Asian cultural subgroups in both undergraduate and graduate courses (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0011000012442650">Hsia &amp; O’Brien, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0011000012442650">Snyder, 2007</xref>). For this reason, it is important to understand how and to what extent clinical supervision differs between Western (e.g., United States, Canada, and Europe) and Asian cultures. Specifically, it seems critical not only to understand clinical supervision of Asian and Asian American supervisees but also to know how the characteristics of clinical supervision in individualistic, Western cultures differ from supervision in collectivist, Asian cultures.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the problem is that there is a scarcity of information, especially information based on methodologically rigorous studies, pertaining to cultural differences in clinical supervision with U.S. and Asian and Asian American supervisees (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0011000012442650">Bang &amp; Park, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0011000012442650">Seo, 2010</xref>) or within Asian cultures themselves. The lack of available information and theory leaves researchers and clinical supervisors without the guidance of cultural competency benchmarks to conduct cross-cultural supervision with Asian and Asian American supervisees. Cross-cultural clinical supervision (i.e., multicultural supervision; e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0011000012442650">Fukuyama, 1994</xref>) refers to contexts where the supervisor and supervisee come from substantively different cultural backgrounds. Hence, because understanding cross-cultural and cross-national differences between Asian and U.S. cultures in terms of clinical supervision is a major gap in the literature, we sought to address this deficiency by investigating differences in the practice of U.S. and South Korean clinical supervision. Specifically, the descriptive differences between these two countries need to be investigated to understand the basic context of clinical supervision in South Korea. Hence, the purpose of our study was to provide descriptive, comparative information about clinical supervision in South Korea relative to the United States.</p>
<sec id="section1-0011000012442650">
<title>The Counseling Field and Cultural Background in South Korea</title>
<p>Although counseling and counseling psychology from Western cultures was first introduced to South Korea in the 1930s, it was not implemented until the 1970s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0011000012442650">Bae, Joo, &amp; Orlinsky, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0011000012442650">Joo, 2009</xref>). Despite the short history, interest and involvement has grown rapidly in South Korea in recent decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0011000012442650">Joo, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0011000012442650">Seo, Kim, &amp; Kim, 2007</xref>). Because most concepts and systems of counseling psychology in South Korea were adapted from Western culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0011000012442650">Kim, 2006</xref>), graduate requirements for entering the counseling program are similar to the United States (e.g., 2 or 3 years for a master’s degree, 5 or 6 years for the doctoral degree). One of the strengths of South Korean counseling psychology is the rigorous certification system required for membership in the Korean Counseling Psychological Association (KCPA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0011000012442650">Bang &amp; Park, 2009</xref>). Applicants are required to submit records of over 200 counseling sessions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0011000012442650">Seo et al., 2007</xref>). Nevertheless, a formal academic training model and system has yet to be established in South Korea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0011000012442650">Bang &amp; Park, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0011000012442650">Seo et al., 2007</xref>). It is noteworthy that membership in the Korean Counseling Psychological Association is nearly three times greater than that of Korean Clinical Psychological Association.</p>
<p>There are differences in the cultural backgrounds as well as the histories and education systems of clinical supervision between the United States and South Korea. For example, individualism versus collectivism has been theorized and studied as a key cultural difference between Western and Asian cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0011000012442650">Seo, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0011000012442650">Sue, Bucceri, Lin, Nadal, &amp; Torino, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0011000012442650">Triandis, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0011000012442650">Triandis &amp; Gelfand, 1998</xref>). Specifically, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0011000012442650">Triandis (1995)</xref> conceptualized the differences as comprised of two dimensions or axes (collectivism–individualism; i.e., interpersonal interdependence versus interpersonal independence; and horizontal–vertical; i.e., the degree of hierarchy and power versus equality in the culture that produce four categories) that produce four categories. Asian countries, including South Korea, consistently evidenced vertical collectivism, whereas Western countries, including the United States, have shown horizontal individualism (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0011000012442650">Triandis &amp; Gelfand, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0011000012442650">Yoo, 2001</xref>). These fundamental differences are presumed to permeate both cultures.</p>
<p>Considering the differences in histories, education systems, and cultures between U.S. and South Korean counselors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0011000012442650">Bae et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0011000012442650">Seo, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0011000012442650">Seo et al., 2007</xref>), we reasoned that the professional characteristics and the practice of clinical supervision would also differ across the two countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0011000012442650">Joo, 2009</xref>). Only one study, however, has investigated the differences between counselors (i.e., counselor, psychologist, and social worker trainees and professionals) from the United States and South Korea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0011000012442650">Kim, 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0011000012442650">Kim (2006)</xref>, however, did not investigate differences in clinical supervision experiences or supervisor characteristics, thereby leaving a void in the literature. Thus, a study on the differences of professional characteristics and supervision experiences between South Korea and the United States is needed. In short, there is a paucity of descriptive information regarding differences between South Korean and U.S. counselors, supervisors, and the practice of clinical supervision. Therefore, the present study provided comparative descriptive information from South Korean and U.S. supervisees’ perspectives. Given previous research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011000012442650">Bernard &amp; Goodyear, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0011000012442650">Ellis &amp; Ladany, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0011000012442650">Kim, 2006</xref>), several factors seemed particularly important to study, including basic demographic data (e.g., age, gender, racial-ethnic background, degree level, field of study), amount and type of clinical and supervisory experiences, theoretical orientation, clinical setting, and supervisors’ professional characteristics.</p>
<p>Specifically, we proffered the following hypotheses with a condensed rationale for each. Given previous findings (i.e., South Korean mental health counselors had less counseling experience and fewer accumulated clients than U.S. counselors; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0011000012442650">Kim, 2006</xref>), we hypothesized that South Korean supervisees would have less counseling experiences (e.g., total months of counseling-therapy experience, total number of clients, and number of therapy hours per week) than U.S. supervisees. With the limited number of clinical supervisors and practicum placements for mental health providers in South Korea, especially at the PhD level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0011000012442650">Seo et al., 2007</xref>), we expected South Korean supervisees to have (a) less supervised clinical experience (e.g., total months of supervised clinical experience, number of supervision hours per week, number of hours supervised by current supervisor, and supervisor’s amount of supervisory experience) and (b) less diversity in degree programs (e.g., M.S., MSW, or PhD), fields of study, and clinical setting and (c) more master’s-level supervisors than U.S. supervisees. U.S. participants were expected to evidence a greater proportion of doctoral students, more months in their current degree program, and more male supervisors. We hypothesized the South Korean participants to have fewer individual clinical supervision sessions and more sessions of group supervision and that South Korean supervisees would expect to work longer with their current supervisor than their U.S. counterparts (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0011000012442650">Kim, 2006</xref>). Finally, we expected South Korean supervisees to be younger than U.S. supervisees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0011000012442650">Kim, 2006</xref>). Although this series of hypotheses may seem tedious, they are essential to advancing the conceptual-methodological rigor of cross-cultural supervision research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0011000012442650">Ellis &amp; Ladany, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0011000012442650">Wampold, Davis, &amp; Good, 1990</xref>).</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>To determine minimum sample sizes, we conducted an a priori power analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0011000012442650">Cohen, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0011000012442650">Haase, Ellis, &amp; Ladany, 1989</xref>). For the paired comparisons with a medium population effect size ρ<sup>2</sup> = .058 (i.e., explain at least 5.8% of the variance in the dependent variable) and per comparison alpha of .05, samples of 88 (<italic>N</italic> = 176) or greater were required to achieve statistical power of .90. To participate in the study, participants had to be at least 18 years of age, a mental health professional or counselor-in-training, and currently engaged in clinical supervision. Three hundred and eighty-three counselor supervisees from the United States (<italic>n</italic> = 188) and South Korea (<italic>n</italic> = 195) responded to the research materials. Of these, five had incomplete or spurious data and were dropped. Thus, the final sample consisted of 378 volunteer supervisees.</p>

According to the participants, their supervisors endorsed an eclectic (36.6%), psychodynamic (29.8%), humanistic-existential (14.7%), cognitive-behavioral (11.5%), or other (7.3%) theoretical orientation.</p>

<title>Demographic questionnaire</title>
<p>Participants completed a few supervision measures (not reported here) and a brief demographic questionnaire to gather descriptive information. The variables included age, gender, race, ethnicity, field of graduate study, year in graduate program, current degree program, clinical setting, months of supervised experience, months of counseling experience, hours per week of individual and group supervision, theoretical orientation, and the supervisor’s gender, race/ethnicity, degree, and theoretical orientation.</p>

<title>Translation to Korean</title>
<p>For South Korean participants, we translated the measures and demographic questionnaire developed in English in the United States into Korean using a countertranslation method. This method is effective in evaluation of the quality of translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0011000012442650">Ægisdóttir, Gerstein, &amp; Cinarbas, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0011000012442650">Hulin, Drasgow, &amp; Komocar, 1982</xref>) and tends to assure that the translated version is the most similar to the original scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0011000012442650">Werner &amp; Campbell, 1970</xref>). Specifically, a female Korean expert with a doctorate in counseling psychology translated English versions of the measures into Korean, and then, a bilingual Korean female enrolled in a doctoral reading program in the United States translated them back into English. A native U.S. Caucasian male student enrolled in a PhD counseling psychology program in the United States compared the retranslated English versions with the original English versions. Items were changed to represent faithfully the meanings of the original English versions. Finally, a Korean female associate professor of counseling psychology in South Korea examined the Korean versions of the measures for accuracy.</p>

<title>Procedures</title>
<p>For the U.S. sample, an email message describing the study was sent to graduate student subscribers of electronic mailing lists of relevant national organizations (e.g., Association of Counselor Education and Supervision, APA Division 17 Supervision and Training Section, The Council of Counseling Psychology Training Programs) as well as several graduate programs with both master’s and doctoral programs in counseling (e.g., Syracuse University) and clinical and counseling psychology. The email message provided a password and directed potential participants to an internet website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://psychdata.com">psychdata.com</ext-link>) for collection of data for the study. Once at the password protected website, supervisees were informed that their responses would be useful in the training of future students. Participation was anonymous and voluntary. Participants who visited the website (whether they completed the questionnaire or not) were eligible to partake in a random drawing for two $100 prizes. Prizes were awarded after the end of the study. We used electronic mailing lists to solicit U.S. participants; hence, we could not determine the response rate.</p>
<p>Because there were no electronic mailing lists to solicit participants in South Korea, consent was obtained from directors of the conference (e.g., monthly conferences held by the Korean Counseling Psychological Association) and the college counseling centers. We also contacted 350 clinical supervisors directly through the email addresses provided by the website of the Korean Counseling Psychological Association. Participants completed a paper-and-pencil version of the research materials and were given a gift (e.g., pen or mug cup) worth about $2 as is custom in South Korea. For the South Korean participants, 248 packets containing the research materials were given to potential participants during a conference or at college counseling centers. Of these, 198 packets were returned, yielding a response rate in South Korea of 77%, which differed from the general response rates reported in recent supervision research in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0011000012442650">Duan &amp; Roehlke, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0011000012442650">Fernando &amp; Hulse-Killacky, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0011000012442650">Ladany, Ellis, &amp; Friedlander, 1999</xref>).</p>

<title>Descriptive Comparisons of Cultural Differences</title>
<p>Comparing the South Korean sample to the U.S. sample provided a basis for interpreting the descriptive data (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0011000012442650">Kerlinger &amp; Lee, 2000</xref>). To accomplish this, we performed a series of 22 planned tests to determine if the hypothesized cultural differences were evidenced on the demographic variables. In instances where no cultural differences were hypothesized, we used a per comparison alpha of .05 to put our hypotheses of no differences at greater risk and to maximize statistical power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0011000012442650">Fagley, 1985</xref>). For other tests, we controlled studywise Type I and Type II error rates using a modified Bonferonni procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0011000012442650">Holland &amp; Copenhaver, 1988</xref>). When the data violated the homogeneity of variances assumption—assessed by Levene’s test—the degrees of freedom were adjusted to control for the violation. To be clinically meaningful, the observed shrunken effect size (i.e., shrunken eta squared) had to be statistically significant and greater than <inline-formula id="inline-formula1-0011000012442650">

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We initiated this study with the purpose of providing descriptive comparison data between an Asian culture (i.e., South Korea) and a Western culture (i.e., the United States) about clinical supervision from the supervisee’s perspective. To provide a context in which to interpret the results, we begin by identifying the most salient limitations and strengths of the study.</p>
<sec id="section13-0011000012442650">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Perhaps the most salient limitation is the representativeness of the two samples. Because U.S. participants were solicited by posting to numerous electronic mailing lists for students, supervisors, and professionals delivering mental health services, we do not know the response rate. Thus, the samples are likely biased, but the nature of the bias is unclear. For South Korea, although the participation criterion for this study was currently engaged in clinical supervision, many counselors do not receive regular supervision in their master’s or doctoral programs because the supervision system is not organized or systematized. Hence, the South Korean sample may not be representative of the population of South Korean psychology supervisees.</p>
<p>Despite concerns about sample bias, a close examination of the demographic and sample descriptive data suggested that the samples were fairly broad and appeared reasonably consistent with other South Korean or U.S. samples in recently published clinical supervision studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0011000012442650">Bang, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0011000012442650">Choi &amp; Kim, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0011000012442650">Kim, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0011000012442650">Ladany et al., 1999</xref>). Nevertheless, generalizing the present results to other supervisees in the United States or South Korea should be done cautiously.</p>
<p>Another limitation was that we used translated measures with the South Korean participants. Although we followed established procedures to maximize the cultural validity of the responses (i.e., translation and back-translation procedures), these were initial findings. Until replicated, the findings reported here should be used tentatively and with caution.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0011000012442650">
<title>Strengths</title>
<p>These limitations notwithstanding, this is one of the first studies to provide detailed comparative descriptive data about the practice of clinical supervision in South Korea. The conceptual-methodological advantages of employing a comparison group research design (versus using a single sample) are well known (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0011000012442650">Kerlinger &amp; Lee, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0011000012442650">Shadish, Cook, &amp; Campbell, 2002</xref>), and yet quite rare in supervision descriptive research, based on our review of the literature. By comparing the two cultures, we found similarities and differences that were both more evident and more trustworthy than if done without comparative data. Other major strengths were developing a reasoned argument for the directional and falsifiable hypotheses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0011000012442650">Wampold et al., 1990</xref>), using fairly large sample sizes, testing and controlling for the assumptions underlying the statistical procedures, managing systematically studywise Type I and II error rates, and complying with new standards for reporting effect size CIs. Finally, the data are directly relevant to the competency benchmarks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0011000012442650">Fouad et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0011000012442650">
<title>Descriptive Comparisons</title>
<p>We found a significant difference between U.S. and South Korea participants in the number of supervision hours per week in spite of no significant difference in total supervision hours. In contrast to the United States, few formal structured clinical supervision opportunities exist in South Korea, due to the shortage of available clinical supervisors and formal training institutions. Korean counselors seek supervision to fulfill licensure requirements (i.e., licensure for professional counselor). Because the counseling graduate programs in South Korea are not organized, to become a licensed counselor students have to seek out and arrange for clinical supervision personally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0011000012442650">Bang, 2006</xref>). As a result, counselors suffer from inconsistent and infrequent supervision—it takes longer to attain a similar amount of supervision hours as is typical for U.S. counselors. In addition, we found more U.S. participants enrolled in doctoral programs than South Korean participants, and the length of current degree program was longer for U.S. supervisees relative to South Koreans, as might be expected with doctoral study. One possible reason for this result is that few doctoral programs are offered in South Korea. Overall, the differences between the two countries verified the claims that formal academic training has not yet been systemized in South Korea in spite of rigorous qualification requirements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0011000012442650">Bang &amp; Park, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0011000012442650">Seo et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast, there were insignificant or trivial differences between supervision in South Korea and the United States on nearly two-thirds of the variables under investigation (e.g., total months of counseling-therapy experience, total months of supervised clinical experience, and weekly therapy contact hours). Given that the study meets criteria to interpret nonsignificant findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0011000012442650">Fagley, 1985</xref>), collectively the results suggest that there were more similarities than differences in the practice of clinical supervision in the two countries. Having data-based information about the practice of supervision in South Korea can help U.S. supervisors provide more competent cross-cultural clinical supervision with South Korean supervisees. In addition, these data provide some of the knowledge required by the competency benchmarks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0011000012442650">Fouad et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>One additional noticeable finding: South Korean supervisees more often subscribed to an eclectic theoretical orientation, corroborating <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0011000012442650">Joo’s (2009)</xref> qualitative study on South Korean counselors. As Joo discussed, because of the difficulties in applying Western theories to South Korea, supervisees are likely to combine different theories with Korean traditions such that they tend to be a generalist rather than espouse a particular theoretical orientation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0011000012442650">
<title>Future Directions</title>
<p>The findings of the current study suggest some directions for future research and practice on cross-cultural clinical supervision. We suggest <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0011000012442650">Triandis’s (1995)</xref> model of vertical collectivism versus horizontal individualism as the background of cultural differences between two countries. As such, it is possible to infer that the supervisory relationship in South Korea is more hierarchical than in the United States. Hence, we encourage future researchers to test empirically Triandis’s model of cultural variables, especially in terms of how they influence supervision process and supervisory relationships in the two cultures.</p>
<p>Moreover, future studies need to inquire about culturally specific supervision factors to enhance satisfaction and competency-based supervision, (e.g., taking into consideration the characteristics of the South Korean hierarchical supervisory relationship). Considering that supervision has not been systematized well in South Korea, the supervisory relationship is likely to be more inconsistent, infrequent, and didactic—other significant factors most likely exist (e.g., supervisor’s teaching skills and competency).</p>
<p>In terms of supervisory practice, our study found that the descriptive characteristics of clinical supervision were more similar cross-culturally. Thus, supervisors working with South Korean supervisees may want to tentatively keep in mind both the similarities and the differences reported here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0011000012442650">Fouad et al., 2009</xref>). Given that South Korean supervision tends to be more formal and hierarchical relative to the United States, supervisors are encouraged to provide South Korean supervisees with more feedback and advice than U.S. supervisees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0011000012442650">Bang, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0011000012442650">Bang &amp; Park, 2009</xref>). Supervisors may also want to adopt an eclectic theoretical orientation with South Korean supervisees. Doing so would be evidence of meeting the benchmark competencies for supervision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0011000012442650">Fouad et al., 2009</xref>). In addition, to meet the standards of competence for clinical supervision in South Korea, the curriculum for graduate degrees in counseling psychology needs to be upgraded.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>To practice culturally competent clinical supervision and meet the benchmark competencies, evidence-based knowledge about specific cultures is required. Without appropriate empirically based knowledge about specific cultural differences, microaggressions and negative effects on supervision outcome seem far more likely to occur (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0011000012442650">Burkard et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0011000012442650">Sue, Capodilupo et al., 2007</xref>), and supervisors of different countries may have difficulty in providing culturally sensitive supervision to supervisees from cultures that differ from their own (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0011000012442650">Draguns, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0011000012442650">Pettifor, 2007</xref>). The present study comparing supervision in South Korea and the United States may provide an initial and tentative knowledge base for supervisors working with South Korean supervisees (and by tentative inference to Asian supervisees) to be alert to and consider cultural values in cross-cultural supervision. We also hope that the current study inspires others to examine cross-cultural differences in the practice of clinical supervision with other racial-ethnic supervisee populations.</p>
