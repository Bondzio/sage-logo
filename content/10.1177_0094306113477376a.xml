<p>Eight selected English language monographs from the sociology of law, published after the year 2000, focus on three thematic areas: globalization of law, human rights law, and penal law. “Sociology of law” here means work that speaks to conditions and consequences of legal action, despite the authors’ disciplinary background or affiliation. Two books by political scientists (Meierhenrich, Sikkink) and one by an historian (Pendas) are included. Covering them may inspire sociologists to turn their attention to the promising fields on which this essay focuses. Too many have neglected, in line with sociology’s historic focus on the nation state, transnational aspects of law and human rights law that challenge the notion of state sovereignty. This effort simultaneously suggests what sociology proper may add to related work by scholars in neighboring disciplines. A 6,000 word review cannot do justice to these books in their entirety. I highlight those aspects that promise synergy.</p>
<sec id="section1-0094306113477376">
<title>A Global Justice Cascade – and a View of One International Court</title>
<p>Kathryn Sikkink’s <italic>The Justice Cascade</italic>, written for a broad audience and recipient of the 2012 Robert F. Kennedy Book Award, documents that prosecutions against individual human rights perpetrators in domestic, foreign, and international courts increased almost exponentially in the past three decades. Importantly, most international human rights law is being implemented by domestic courts. Further, the new International Criminal Court (ICC) is bound by the complementarity principle, meaning that domestic courts have primary jurisdiction as long as they are able and willing to pursue cases. Domestic courts, however, operate “in the shadow” of the ICC, and they apply international law. Sikkink poses three basic questions, and each is tackled in a separate part of this remarkable book: how to explain the origins of the use of criminal law for human rights perpetrators, especially the application of individual criminal accountability; how to explain the spread and diffusion of these new norms; and what about the consequences? Empirically the work is based on Sikkink’s intimate knowledge of cases and actors around the globe, resulting from decades of practical and scholarly involvement in the human rights field, and on a new Transitional Trial Data Set.</p>
<p>While not discounting Nuremberg and Tokyo, Sikkink sets the stage with more challenging cases that did not result from military defeat. Her detailed studies of Greece (1975), Portugal (1976), Spain (1975–78) and Argentina (1985) show that trials were most likely in cases of “ruptured” (Greece, Portugal, Argentina) as opposed to “pacted” (Spain) transitions; when regional opportunity structures were favorable (the European Court of Human Rights had been created and Amnesty International [AI] had been founded and was actively involved in Greece); and in the context of a supportive international legal environment (the 1975 “Torture Declaration” was adopted by the UN General Assembly just a few months after the Greek torture trials concluded). By the 1990s, conditions had changed. “Ruptured” transitions were no longer a prerequisite for criminal trials against human rights perpetrators (e.g., Guatemala, Chile, and Uruguay). The institutionalization of the human rights regime had progressed, and the fear of blowbacks had diminished in light of experiences from the 1970s.</p>
<p>The new penal model diffused through publications, the media and individuals, more precisely the networks in which they operate, and the “human chains” that link early national experiences (especially Argentina) with other parts of the world in later periods. The “justice cascade” eventually led to the emergence of a decentralized, interactive system of global accountability, challenging national sovereignty, when three streams merged: (1) international prosecutions, from Nuremberg and Tokyo via the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and its equivalent for Rwanda (ICTR) to the ICC with its jurisdiction over cases of aggression, war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide; and (2) domestic and foreign prosecutions such as the Greek, Portuguese, Argentinean cases of the mid-1970s and the Pinochet case (1998–99). In addition, a “hard law streambed” led from the Genocide (1948) and Geneva (1949) to the Apartheid (1980) and Torture (1987) conventions, then via the Inter-American Convention on Forced Disappearances (1996) to the Rome Statute (1998) that established the ICC. Sikkink shows how individuals, associations, trans-governmental networks, penetrated by an epistemic community of criminal law lawyers, and NGOs such as Human Rights Watch (HRW) and AI, achieved the progressive institutionalization of individual criminal liability, that is, <italic>criminalization</italic> and <italic>individualization</italic> of international law.</p>
<p>Sikkink finally addresses skeptics of international criminal justice. Statistical analysis of her Transitional Trial Data Set suggests that prosecutions of human rights perpetrators, including high-level actors, do not systematically produce counter-productive consequences. They may in fact advance later human rights and democracy records, especially where trials are accompanied by truth commissions. Sikkink argues that deterrence and cultural or socialization mechanisms, such as collective memories created by human rights trials, are likely to contribute to this effect. She admits to one weakness of the human rights movement: the relative (albeit not unchallenged) immunity of the United States to efforts at holding leading American actors criminally accountable for grave human rights violations.</p>
<p>John Hagan’s <italic>Justice in the Balkans</italic> zooms in the lens to examine the building of the ICTY, one crucial international institution that assigns individual criminal accountability. Based on survey data collected in the ICTY’s Office of the Prosecutor, 100 in-depth tape-recorded interviews, trial observation and analysis of trial transcripts, Hagan also finds that individuals matter, and the reader becomes closely acquainted with many central actors in The Hague. Not accidentally, some, such as Cherif Bassiouni and Aryeh Neier, fare prominently in both Hagan’s and Sikkink’s books. Hagan simultaneously places special emphasis on the charisma of these individuals, while recognizing that charisma results from collective action. This insight points toward networks in which actors are embedded, another similarity to Sikkink, and through which many are recruited. And individuals move through time, as Sikkink illustrates for Luis Moreno-Ocampo’s journey from the Argentinean trials to the ICC, and Hagan shows in a pre-ICTY excursus, for Ben Ferencz’s move from Nuremberg to later institutions concerned with the restitution of Jewish survivors. Hagan’s later work with Wenona Rymond-Richmond follows criminal investigators’ journeys from the ICTY to work on the Atrocities Documentation Survey in the Darfurian refugee camps in Chad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0094306113477376">Hagan and Rymond-Richmond 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Still, Hagan’s lens and theoretical angle differ from Sikkink’s. He cites earlier work by Yves <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0094306113477376">Dezalay and Bryant Garth (1996)</xref>, especially their identification of a newly autonomous “transnational legal field” that joins the “agency of human rights activism” with international humanitarian law. This Bourdieuian perspective provides readers with an appreciation of the conflicts between the new legal field and traditional foreign policy, marking the growing autonomy of the former, but also conflicts within the new legal field over media attention, funding and political influence.</p>
<p>Hagan develops these arguments through a series of chapters that tackle specific incidents in the Yugoslav wars, the siege of Sarajevo, the genocidal atrocities of Srebrenica and the rape campaigns in the town of Focca. These cases correspond with regimes of different chief prosecutors and other crucial actors, each of whom brought a distinct type of capital to the ICTY: from Cherif Bassiouni’s ties to the MacArthur and Soros foundations (the latter led by Aryeh Neier, the founder of HRW), convincing them to fund the building of an atrocities documentation center in Chicago; via Richard Goldstone, the first chief prosecutor, securing funding and evidence through his international connections (yet all but failing to secure the arrest of suspects and thus building a “virtual tribunal” with “in absentia” trials); on to Louise Arbour, the “entrepreneurial” and “charismatic” Canadian jurist, who brought prosecutorial expertise and creativity to the tribunal, using innovative methods such as “sealed indictments,” and thus securing numerous arrests. Her skills were decisive in creating structural linkages (formed with militaries to obtain arrests), cultural legitimation (mobilizing cultural schema via media to promote ideas of international criminal law against the notion of state sovereignty) and temporal control (through her attempted border crossing into Kosovo to observe fresh crime scenes, broadcast around the globe). Cultural schemas and resources reinforced each other, allowing charisma and agency to produce enforcement of norms in the framework of liberal legalism. Attributing individual criminal liability indeed succeeded. The central actors were indicted. Hagan’s study shows in great detail the social prerequisites of such success and one crucial mechanism underlying Sikkink’s justice cascade.</p>

<title>Cultural Consequences of Legal Interventions: Collective Memories of Evil</title>
<p>Legal interventions against gross human rights violators have thus shown impressive successes. But do these victories indeed secure human rights? Consider the two causal mechanisms Sikkink discusses: we know little about deterrent effects, but historians and sociologists have begun to explore cultural consequences of trials, especially for the construction of representations and collective memories. Devin Pendas takes a cautious view in his historical study <italic>The Frankfurt Auschwitz Trial</italic> (his subtitle refers to the limits of the law). This book provides the most fascinating detailed analysis to date of the most expansive German Holocaust trial. After introducing the basics of German substantive and procedural criminal law and the central actors, Pendas guides the reader from the indictment, via the opening moves, the taking of evidence, the closing arguments and the judgment to public reactions. The content is not accidentally organized along the trial’s procedural steps. Without losing sight of the political context and extrajudicial forces, Pendas reminds us that there is reason to take “law on the books” seriously even while studying “law in action,” as the former might directly or indirectly, by affecting the “social structure of the case” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0094306113477376">Black 1993</xref>), provide the strategic frame within which actors apply tactics to advance their goals.</p>
<p>A more precise sub-title, however, would have referred specifically to the limits of <italic>German</italic> criminal law. The German government had annulled the occupation (Control Council) law in 1956 with its criminal categories such as “crimes against humanity” and its sentencing guidelines, including the death penalty. The Basic Law, while acknowledging the supremacy of international law, prohibited ex post-facto prosecutions. “Genocide” could only be prosecuted for future cases. The Frankfurt court thus relied on standard German criminal law, created with crimes in mind that differed radically from those committed in the context of the organized annihilation machinery of Nazi Germany. This law was limited by its strict Kantian focus on subjective intent and its distinction between perpetrator and accomplice (the latter considered a tool rather than an autonomous actor in the execution of the crime). This type of law, Pendas shows, was ill-suited for covering the complex nature and the organizational context in which crimes were committed, especially the systematic annihilation of millions. Instead, prosecution was successful in particular cases of especially atrocious actions, such as brutal acts of torture during interrogations, in which malicious intent could be documented and where defendants could not present themselves as tools of the will of others. Historian <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0094306113477376">Michael Marrus (2008)</xref> actually shows similar limitations for the Nuremberg “Doctors’ Trial” conducted by American authorities under occupation law, indicating the validity of Pendas’ insights beyond German law.</p>
<p>Legal constraints thus limited the trial’s representational, and also its juridical functions, frustrating the pedagogical intent with which Fritz Bauer, Prosecutor General of the state of Hessen, had advanced these collective proceedings against 22 defendants. Inspired by the Eichmann trial in Jerusalem of 1961, he sought a large, historical trial that would stir the collective conscience, increase awareness and instill in the collective memory of Germans the horrific nature of the Nazi crimes. He partly succeeded, but only within the limits of the law that directed attention to those lone actors who had engaged in particularly excessive cruelty beyond the directives under which they worked in the Nazi extermination machine. While Nazi crimes thereby came to a public and terrifying display, the trial paradoxically helped Germans to distance themselves from these crimes. Perpetration appeared, in the logic of the Auschwitz trial, as either the outgrowth of sick minds or executed in the context of a machinery, set up by Nazi leadership, in which ordinary Germans acted without or even against their own will.</p>
<p>The German case thus illustrates with particular clarity what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0094306113477376">Bernhard Giesen (2004)</xref> elsewhere has called the “decoupling” function of criminal law. While his argument applies to criminal law generally, Pendas shows that and how the specifics of law matter. Comparative studies within the rich array of legal interventions included in Sikkink’s Transitional Justice Data Set, of cases of international criminal justice like the ICTY examined by Hagan on the one hand and national trials under common criminal law, such as the Frankfurt trials, on the other should yield future insights into the <italic>variable</italic> potential of criminal law to fulfill its juridical <italic>and</italic> representational functions.</p>
<p>Like Pendas’ book, Joachim Savelsberg and Ryan King’s <italic>American Memories: Atrocities and the Law</italic>, recipient of the 2012 Outstanding Book Award of the Society for the Study of Social Problems’ Theory Division, examines representations and collective memories created by legal proceedings. This book, however, does so with a focus on the United States, a powerful player in international relations that has kept cautious distance from Sikkink’s “Justice Cascade.” Content analysis of news media, history textbooks, and a comparative review of memorials and memorial days reveal distinct patterns: ICTY proceedings, heavily promoted by the United States, contributed to a representation of the Yugoslav wars in American media reporting in which Yugoslav government leaders are remembered as perpetrators and the acts of violence as grave violations of human rights, war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide.</p>
<p>Yet cases against American perpetrators are rare, and they focus on a few low-level actors. The My Lai massacre of the Vietnam War, for example, was culturally processed through famous journalistic work by Seymour Hersh, an Army commission, and a criminal trial. Despite high expectations, the case is represented only in forty percent of post-Vietnam era American history textbooks, and the dominant depictions reflect the institutional logic of the law in ways that de-dramatize. Only one relatively low-level perpetrator is named (the one convicted in trial); responsibility of higher ranks is rarely mentioned (against insights by the Army Commission); the number of victims is downplayed (in line with that listed in the indictment); and the attempted cover-up on which no conviction was achieved is generally omitted. Such selective memory plays, via analogical bridging, into later trials like those against U.S. perpetrators during the Iraq War. The book thus supports Pendas’ stress of “the limits of law” while further specifying their conditions and demonstrating that these limits are not specific to German law.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the focus on low-level actors causes legitimatory challenges and motivates movement organization against trials. Aggregating to the macro-level of collective representation and memory, American trials deposit guilt on the shoulders of a few, exculpate the majority, and promote Americans’ unparalleled pride in their military, with potentially problematic consequences for human rights. In addition, America’s resistance to liberal international justice and its bi-lateral immunity agreements, reflective of its power in international relations, set clear limits to the autonomy of the international legal field explored by Hagan.</p>
<p>Analyses of collective representations and memories produced in judicial proceedings still partially support the cultural pillar of Sikkink’s optimism. Rituals of law may cement atrocities in historic memory, possibly safeguarding against future human rights violations. Yet, memories produced by trials are filtered through the institutional logic of law (and the political constraints imposed on law), distorted thus from the perspective of other institutions. In addition, as Savelsberg/King show in a concluding comparative chapter, a country’s regime stability versus rupture and its position in the international community constrain law’s capacity to shape representations and memories so as to safeguard against future violations. This insight is not limited to the United States.</p>

<sec id="section3-0094306113477376">
<title>Trans-National and National Conditions of Transitions, Law, and Human Rights</title>
<p>Just like the nature of a nation’s legal codes and its standing in international relations matter for the chances that legal interventions produce preventive memories of grave human rights violations, as Pendas and Savelsberg/King show, so do other national features affect transitions to democracy and the promulgation and implementation of law generally and human rights regimes specifically.</p>
<p>Jens Meierhenrich powerfully tackles the case of transitions. <italic>The Legacies of Law</italic>, recipient of the Woodrow Wilson Foundation Award of the American Political Science Association, focuses on, as the subtitle explicates, <italic>Long-Run Consequences of Legal Development</italic>. It highlights one specific domestic condition, the history of legal rules and institutions and their path dependent impact on the democratization process that rid South Africa of apartheid rule. While Meierhenrich shares with Sikkink an interest in transitions that do not result from external defeat and a concern with actors driving the process, his domestic argument is diametrically opposed to her focus on international networks. Also, the world of human rights movements and transitional justice mechanisms plays little role in Meierhenrich’s argument.</p>
<p>Instead, in <italic>The Legacies of Law</italic> rational actors make strategic decisions in an uncertain environment, in which turmoil, massive bloodshed, loss of power, expatriation, and diverse political outcomes were at least as conceivable as the democratic rule that did in fact emerge. Meierhenrich puts to use the classic, albeit much neglected work on the “dual state” by Ernst Fraenkel, a prominent labor lawyer during the Weimar Republic, who experienced the rise of Nazim before his emigration to the United States. Dual state in South Africa means a state in which Max Weber’s “formally rational law” is applied in the world of the white oligarchy (normative state) and “substantively irrational law” in that of the disenfranchised majority (prerogative state). Central to the message of his book, Meierhenrich argues further that in “apartheid’s endgame, the memory of formally rational law—and agents’ confidence in its past and future utility…created the conditions for the emergence of trust between democracy-demanding and democracy-resisting elites” (p. 4). Representations and memory created by past legal action matter, even if the memory literature is not put to use here like in work by Pendas and Savelsberg/King.</p>
<p>Theoretical chapters are followed by the empirical core, rich with analytic narratives that tie together rational action with cultural arguments. Two chapters address the emergence of the apartheid state. A detailed analysis of jurisprudence suggests that “many trials and appeals exhibited fidelity to the law” (p. 167), but much of this fidelity was limited to white commercial activity, while the state was only “weakly constrained” (p. 171) by law. Yet, even substantively irrational law at times took rational forms, when it was <italic>systematically</italic> oriented toward the maintenance of extra-legal goals: racial discrimination and the apartheid state. Memory of law’s reliability then became crucial in apartheid’s endgame, addressed in the subsequent two chapters. The regime destabilized due to the breakdown of the Portuguese colonial empire (leading to a collapse of political and military support from surrounding countries), a severe economic downturn, mounting resistance and insurrection in the townships, and finally the transition of leadership from P.W. Botha to F.W. de Klerk and the accompanying transition within the National Party. Under resulting conditions of massive uncertainty, the legacies of law now instilled in actors, including Nelson Mandela, guarded confidence in the promises and actions of their opponents with whom they found themselves in intense and contentious negotiations over the transition to a new South Africa.</p>
<p>In the end, Meierherich opposes Sikkink in yet another and fundamental way: “The transition from retributive justice to restorative justice…cleared the way for iterated cooperation in the endgame. The absence of retribution created conditions for cooperation, and removed incentives for confrontation” (p. 268). Is the South African case unique? Clearly Meierhenrich’s is a single case study (despite a comparative excursus on Chile). While he claims broader validity for his central theoretical arguments, how does his argument stand up against the many successful transitions documented in Sikkink’s data set? Did the legacies of law always support all of them? Did other forces serve as functional equivalents? Many questions remain, and the juxtaposition of these two books produces potential for productive conflict in a field of study that is about as new as the phenomena it sets out to study.</p>
<p>Meierhenrich is not the only scholar, of course, who directs light on national conditions. Even work in the tradition of sociological neo-institutionalism, with its focus on global scripts, offers insights into national particularities that shape law and human rights.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Heger Boyle, in <italic>Female Genital Cutting</italic> (FGC), starts from a neo-institutional framework but incorporates nation-level, local and individual conditions. She examines not transitions but an agenda of legal change that many frame in human rights terms and its consequences. Her case is the global campaign against the practice to which her title alludes and its impact especially in several African countries—also in the global North.</p>
<p>Boyle’s book is organized by levels of analysis, beginning at the macro level of the international system, and then moving via the national to local and individual levels. To Boyle the world of institutions is conflicted, and conflict between institutionalized principles is a central driving force of change. The case of female genital cutting provides “a story of individual rights discourse conquering first national autonomy and then family inviolability” (p. 42). Individualization and diminishing state sovereignty are themes that this account shares with Sikkink’s. Individuals no longer exist to serve their nations and families. Instead the latter are seen as potential sites for the repression of individuals and the violation of human rights. The personal fulfillment of individuals trumps claims of collectivities in the international system.</p>
<p>These changes were driven by NGOs that aggressively pushed coercive reform, at least at the outset. They were also advanced by IOs, initially favoring assimilative reform. Their caution is not surprising as IOs are constituted by states that have their sovereignty to defend. Yet the United States, where a strong civil society guides the hand of the government, and where anti-FGC actions were primarily directed at targets outside the country, pursued a coercive path, tying international aid to FGC reform.</p>
<p>International organizing was followed by a diffusion process, in which Western nations acted first, especially former colonial powers. Their lead is not surprising as these countries engaged in symbolic politics with little cost or resistance at the domestic level but prospects to advance their position in the “hierarchy of lifestyles” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0094306113477376">Gusfield 1986</xref>). Countries in which FGC is in fact practiced followed growing pressure from the West, especially after the United States threatened sanctions. Where the practice is widespread and popular resistance to be expected, administrative decrees introduced restrictive policies. Egypt under the Mubarak regime is a prime example. (In 2012 the regime was ousted by the country’s populace, which its government had too often offended in order to please the international community—neo-institutionalists have yet to consider the lessons).</p>
<p>Acknowledging countries’ structural positions in diffusion processes is common in neo-institutional work. But Boyle goes further. She observes variation in the meaning of national policies even when they do adopt anti-FGC policies. Functionality (or relevance) of the practice and the country’s international standing are crucial. Egypt, characterized by high functionality of FGC and a position of relative power within the international community, experienced substantial contestation of initial steps toward regulation. Government responses were repeatedly modified. Legislation per decree was eventually required to satisfy Western donors and the international community. Implementation under these conditions is limited. Tanzania, on the other hand, with lower functionality and a weaker position in international relations, adopted the policy less hesitantly, but cautiously using relatively universalistic terms to justify it and avoid the impression of bias. Yet, anthropologists working in local settings report that here too the implementation of restrictions is lacking in those areas of the country where the practice is well established. Here too decoupling is clearly at work.</p>
<p>Adaptation of anti-FGC policies thus varies in timing, intensity, and quality. In addition, individual-level factors affect the degree to which policies influence the attitudes and practices of local women, as an analysis of Demographic and Health Survey data shows. Religion, college education, and exposure to mass media interact in fascinating ways to affect women’s willingness to change traditional practices.</p>
<p>While concerned neither with democratic transitions nor human rights issues, Terence Halliday and Bruce Carruthers also address legal change between the national and global. Their <italic>Bankrupt: Global Lawmaking and Systemic Financial Crisis</italic>, based on hundreds of interviews, conference observations, and analyses of changing drafts of policy statements over the course of several years, is a recipient of three ASA section awards (Economic, Global and Transnational, Law). It takes a more decisive step away from prioritizing global culture than does Boyle’s book. And yet, three chapters are dedicated to efforts by international actors such as clubs of nations, financial institutions, governance organizations, associations of professionals or core nations, to shape insolvency law after the 1997–98 Asian Financial Crisis. These efforts sought to establish a global institutional-legal foundation on which rational market participants can operate and global markets function (akin to the role of law for Meierhenrich’s participants in South Africa’s transformation). The authors take culture seriously, but they see limits in the world polity approach, criticizing its strong focus on global scripts and norms while highlighting the roles of power and inequality in the buildup of policy responses. They introduce and draw inspiration from three additional theory frames with greater empathy for the asymmetries of global lawmaking: world systems (stressing dominant economic actors), postcolonial globalism (focusing on dominant nations and institutions at the global center), and law and development. Yet, critical of these approaches’ “reified and unitary concept of the ‘global’” (p. 6), Halliday/Carruthers seek to open up the “black box in which global norms are debated and decided” (p. 7).</p>
<p>Halliday/Carruthers build an analytic field along two dimensions: balance of power and cultural and social “distance” between the global and the local. They explore this field through three in-depth case studies of Indonesia, South Korea, and China, dedicating a chapter to each. The imbalance of power was greatest in the case of Indonesia with its substantial economic vulnerability in 1997 and limited geopolitical significance. International pressure to bring its institutions in line with global norms was considerable. Yet after the 2011 terrorist attacks, the U.S. government relaxed pressure for commercial legal reform as it sought Indonesian collaboration in the fight against terrorism. Still substantial but much reduced power asymmetry and lesser cultural distance characterized the South Korean situation. Finally, China, in light of its geo-political weight and greater independence from global markets, had to be treated cautiously by global institutions. Simultaneously, cultural distance was greater than in the case of South Korea. Halliday/Carruthers show that these national particulars greatly affect how global and national forces meet: globalization does not unfold as a uniform process.</p>
<p>Three subsequent chapters analyze processes at work in the “black box” of globalization. As global and local forces seek mutual adjustment, albeit asymmetrically, intermediaries occupy the nodes of networks of communication, engaging in transplantation and translation work. Often they act as bricoleurs, mixing together elements of global and local scripts and practices. Intermediation is the first crucial process. The second is “foiling”: Local actors “develop repertoires of resistance, weapons of the weak, through which they manage to carve out zones of independence from external pressure. In these openings, they deviate and design, reject and adapt, conform and contest as their situations permit. These repertoires are artfully matched to the historical moment, sensitive to changes in geopolitical circumstances…[T]hey do reinforce our argument that globalization is contested and negotiated, not simply imposed or imprinted, even when the power differentials are pronounced” (pp. 29–30). A third process results: recursivity represents the reform cycle in which grand designs, meeting local resistance, warrant adjustment that provokes new local sensitivities. The implementation phase, often neglected in world polity research (but see Boyle), here proves central. It not only spoils the realization of grand designs but also induces their modifications.</p>
<p>Halliday/Carruthers provide highly useful conceptual and analytic tools that are waiting for an application to the area of human rights law generally and the notion of individual criminal accountability and Sikkink’s <italic>The Justice Cascade</italic> specifically. What is the impact of imbalances of power and cultural distance for the likelihood that global designs of human rights law will be adapted in different countries? What intermediaries are at work? How does foiling hamper grand designs, for example when countries stress the ICC’s complementarity principle, but do not really pursue justice domestically (or do so by means rejected by rule of law principles of international criminal law)? What about recursivity? How will global designs change in light of local resistance? The field of criminal law and its implementation in the human rights arena is new, and there will be much opportunity for careful empirical observation in decades to come.</p>

<title>Learning from Domestic Studies for International Law and Justice</title>
<p>Research on the punishment of grave human rights violations is new, and it fades in quantity against the massive literature on criminal punishment in domestic settings. Might the new field learn from this established body of literature? I will explore this question with just one outstanding example. David Garland’s <italic>Peculiar Institution</italic>, recipient of several prizes, including two ASA section awards (culture and historical-comparative) and subject of a detailed and praising review essay by former Supreme Court justice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0094306113477376">John Paul Stevens (2010)</xref>, is a powerful book on the history and present uses of the death penalty in the United States. Garland observes that capital punishment in today’s America is used only in selected jurisdictions, and hidden, with great complications, hesitation, delays, and apologies among those responsible for its execution. He rightly stresses that this hesitancy is partly explained by the same cultural forces that inspired anti-death penalty provisions in human rights conventions, transnational treaties, and international law. The same modern focus on individual dignity and human rights is intimated by Emile Durkheim in his comments on the Dreyfus affair (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0094306113477376">Smith 2008</xref>). Cultural forces that promote the “justice cascade,” the punishment of human rights violators, so eloquently depicted by Sikkink and explored for the ICTY by Hagan, simultaneously civilize and constrain punishment of those violators and the application of the death penalty in the United States. Yet, while America shows the same hesitancy about killing convicts that led other countries to abolish capital punishment, it does show particularities as well.</p>
<p>First, numerous American states still have the death penalty “on the books,” and several continue to practice it. And yet, some U.S. states were pioneers of abolition, even in international comparison. The explanation of this seeming paradox lies in a political system that places much authority at the local level and allows for popular participation through mechanisms such as the election of judicial personnel and the jury system. Second, local or situational conditions—highly variable as opposed to the unifying institutional frame—determine persistence <italic>and</italic> abolition. They include group relations, racial demographics, violence rates, and symbolic associations, promoting unhampered punishment in some and restraint in others. Much room is thus left for local forces and narratives, for emotion, irrationality, and symbolism, highlighted most effectively by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0094306113477376">Philip Smith (2008)</xref> in his revision of a late Durkheimian approach to punishment.</p>
<p>Garland’s analysis of the American story of capital punishment teaches lessons regarding the introduction of individual criminal liability into the global human rights regime. We learn that the shape of institutions of criminal justice matters. In the international realm this shape varies considerably: highly centralized (the ICC) and decentralized (domestic courts across the globe that apply international human rights law against domestic and, through universal jurisdiction, foreign perpetrators).</p>
<p>Centralization in the ICC corresponds with bureaucratization. Prosecutor and judges are elected for non-renewable nine-year terms by the Assembly of States, parties to the Rome Statute. This suggests independence from popular will and political pressure. Simultaneously however, the ICC’s environment consists of human rights NGOs, highlighted by Sikkink as a foundation for the new institution, and of powerful states. The latter may, through the UN Security Council, refer cases to the ICC and put prosecutions on hold for one year at a time (Article 17 of the Rome Statute, constituting a politicization of law). The future will show the outcome of this interaction of relative bureaucratic-legal independence and a highly politicized environment.</p>
<p>Yet, Sikkink simultaneously shows that international criminal law is most often implemented through domestic courts in a highly decentralized world. Countries across the globe differ with regard to all the situational factors Garland highlights: political structures and group and race relations, racial demographics, the orientation of local elites and their leadership capacities, homicide and violence levels, symbolic associations of the death penalty, and events and contingencies. They vary in yet more ways than American jurisdictions as their institutional systems also take distinct shapes, as does their power position in the international community. We should thus see great diversity in the application of individual criminal liability for grave human rights violations around the globe.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0094306113477376">Daniel Levy and Natan Sznaider (2010)</xref>, in a recent remarkable book, highlight the notion of cosmopolitan memories, and their potential effects on human rights regimes. They suggest a synthesis between local and global experiences. The human rights regime, with its abstract enlightenment principles of individual human dignity matters, but so do nation-specific factors. Boyle and Halliday/Carruthers explore both when they study the establishment and implementation of global legal regimes. Local conditions such as legacies of law dominate in Meierhenrich when he examines transitions and in Savelsberg/King as they consider consequences of regime continuity and power in the international sphere for law and memories. Limitations of domestic criminal law in the pursuit of human rights violators, highlighted by Pendas, are partly overcome in the new international model. Yet further local conditions, explored by Garland, only add complexity. Some countries will be forerunners and other will be laggards in the implementation of human rights law—just like jurisdictions within the United States have varied in their uses and abolitions of the death penalty over two centuries. Local conditions of violence, power balances, memories and legal traditions will interact with the global networks and regimes that Sikkink explores and international institutions that Hagan studied to shape the future of penal law and practice in transitions to democracy and in global human rights regimes.</p>
