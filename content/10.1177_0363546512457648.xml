<title>Background:</title>
<p>Techniques to improve and accelerate tendon-bone healing could be advantageous in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. Effects of demineralized bone matrix (DBM) on intra-articular tendon-bone healing have not been examined.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0363546512457648">
<title>Hypothesis:</title>
<p>Demineralized bone matrix has the potential to convey osteoinductive growth proteins to the site of healing at the tendon-bone interface. We hypothesized that the presence of DBM will result in more bone formation and hasten tendon-bone healing.</p>

<sec id="section4-0363546512457648">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>Fifty-six female athymic rnu/rnu (nude) rats were used. Rats were randomly allocated into 2 groups (control or treatment). The control group underwent an ACL reconstruction, while the treatment group had human DBM implanted in the tendon graft and bone tunnel before reconstruction. Rats were sacrificed at 2 (n = 8), 4 (n = 24), and 6 (n = 24) weeks for histological, and immunohistochemical (t = 2, 4, and 6 weeks), and biomechanical testing and micro–computed tomography (t = 4 and 6 weeks) end points.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0363546512457648">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Our findings suggest that in the presence of DBM, tendon-bone healing is augmented by increased woven bone formation and enhanced bone remodeling as indicated by histology and micro–computed tomography. This ultimately resulted in a statistically significant increase in peak load to failure of the tendon-bone interface at 4 weeks (DBM group: 5.96 ± 1.36 N; control group: 2.86 ± 0.7 N) and 6 weeks (DBM group: 9.13 ± 0.97 N; control group: 5.81 ± 1.1 N).</p>

<body>
<p>Clinical outcomes after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstructive surgeries that utilize soft tissue grafts are heavily reliant upon secure integration between the tendon and bone. The weakest link in the early postoperative time periods is the tendon-bone interface, which does not regenerate into fibrocartilaginous-type entheses seen in the native ACL insertion site. Research is ongoing on methods of enhancing and accelerating tendon-to-bone healing, which may reduce the time required before return to competitive sport, work, and other daily activities. Rodeo et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546512457648">22</xref></sup> demonstrated a correlation between tendon-bone interface strength and the degree of bone ingrowth, mineralization, and tissue maturation between the bone and tendon. A variety of biological factors (exogenous osteoinductive proteins) have been exploited, with varied amounts of success, to improve tendon-bone healing. We tested demineralized bone matrix (DBM) as one such osteoinductive agent. Demineralized bone matrix offers a theoretical advantage compared with isolated osteoinductive growth proteins, considering it contains the physiological amount and mixture of skeletally active proteins. Pietrzak et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546512457648">21</xref></sup> recently showed that bone morphogenic protein (BMP)–7 eludes from DBM at a sustained rate, and it is widely believed that in vivo growth proteins will be delivered to the healing site at a sustained rate. To test our hypothesis, we implanted human DBM, previously verified for osteoinductivity, into a healing tendon-bone insertion site. Demineralized bone matrix was previously examined in the context of tendon-bone healing, with varied success, by Jackson et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546512457648">12</xref></sup> and Sundar et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546512457648">28</xref></sup> in a goat ACL model and sheep patellar model, respectively. Jackson et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546512457648">12</xref></sup> utilized a demineralized strip of cortical bone, while Sunder et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546512457648">28</xref></sup> used a demineralized block of infraspinatus fossae. We augmented a soft tissue graft with DBM particulates for use in a nude rat ACL reconstruction model. We hypothesized that DBM, in the region of tendon-bone healing in a bone tunnel, will augment new bone formation and in turn improve the mechanical strength of the interface.</p>

<title>Study Design</title>
<p>Fifty-six female athymic rnu/rnu (nude) rats were randomly allocated to a control group (ACL reconstruction) or treatment group (DBM implanted in the tendon graft and bone tunnel). Four rats per group were prepared for histology and immunohistochemistry (t = 2, 4, and 6 weeks), while 8 rats were allocated for biomechanical testing and micro–computed tomography (micro-CT) analysis (t = 4 and 6 weeks).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0363546512457648">
<title>DBM Paste Preparation</title>
<p>The DBM paste was prepared by mixing 25% solution of Pluronic F127 (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, Missouri) with 125- to 850-μm human DBM particles (Berkeley Advanced Biomaterials Inc, Berkeley, California). Pluronic is an inert polymer that has been registered as an inactive ingredient by the United States Food and Drug Administration and is regularly combined with DBM to improve graft handling and moldability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546512457648">4</xref></sup> Pluronic F127 solution (25%) was mixed with sterile saline to provide a gel-like substance. The solution was mixed with DBM particles at a ratio of 3:1 to achieve a paste. The DBM paste was packaged into 1-mL syringes; 0.2 mL (~75 mg) of the DBM paste was utilized per rat.</p>

<sec id="section11-0363546512457648">
<title>Surgical Procedure</title>
<p>A unilateral rodent ACL reconstruction model was initially adopted from Kawamura et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512457648">15</xref></sup> and further modified as described previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546512457648">18</xref></sup> The surgical procedures were performed under sterile conditions under general anesthesia (1.5%-2% isoflurane and 100% oxygen inhalation [2 L/min]). A 1- to 2-cm skin incision was made starting proximal and posterior to the right medial malleolus, curving just posterior to the ankle and ending at the medial and palmar side of the first metatarsal. Deep fascia and the neurovascular bundle were retracted medially. The flexor digitorum longus tendon was identified and cut transversely at the midmetatarsal level. The full length of the tendon (2 cm) was stripped from the posterior tibia. Both tendon ends were reinforced with a “whip suture” using 4-0 Ethibond (Ethicon, Somerville, New Jersey) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546512457648">Figure 1A</xref>). A 2.5-cm longitudinal skin incision was made anterior to the knee joint. Dissection was performed between the vastus medialis and quadriceps tendon, and the capsule medial to the patellar and patellar tendon was incised. The patella was dislocated laterally and the ACL exposed and excised. A 1.1-mm-diameter Kirschner wire (K-wire; Zimmer, Warsaw, Indiana) was drilled from the anteromedial tibia, 4 mm distal to the knee joint, toward the posterior tibial insertion of the ACL. The K-wire was further advanced to the posterior portion of the ACL femoral insertion and drilled out at the lateral femoral condyle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546512457648">Figure 1C</xref>). Before passing the tendon graft through the bone tunnels to replace the native ACL, DBM was introduced into the tendon graft via artificially created gaps and into the bone tunnels in the experimental group. Gaps were created in the tendon using a 21-gauge needle (20 gaps along 2 parallel rows) along the entire length of the graft (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546512457648">Figure 1B</xref>). Creating gaps in the tendon does not compromise the mechanical integrity of the graft.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546512457648">18</xref></sup> Gaps were not created under tension to prevent damaging the collagen fascicles. The DBM paste was injected onto the graft (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546512457648">Figure 1B</xref>) and, using a thumb, gently placed into the gaps. The DBM paste was also injected into both ends of each of the bone tunnels (femoral and tibial) through a syringe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546512457648">Figure 1D</xref>). A “pusher,” a 1.1-mm stainless steel rod, was used to maneuver DBM into the trabeculae surrounding the bone tunnel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546512457648">Figure 1E</xref>). A transverse hole was drilled in the femur, 2 mm proximal to the femoral tunnel outlet, and another hole was made in the tibia, 2 mm distal to the tibial tunnel outlet. Whip sutures at both ends were tied through the bony holes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546512457648">Figure 1F</xref>). The stability and full range of motion of the knee joint were checked and ensured. Wounds were closed in a routine fashion. Animals were returned to their cages, and activity was allowed ad libitum.</p>

<title>Micro-CT</title>
<p>The femur–ACL graft–tibia complex was scanned using micro-CT (Siemens Inveon Micro-CT System, Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany). The resulting effective pixel size of the scan measured 29.26 μm. A calibration phantom was scanned to generate a calibration curve, which was used for conversion of Hounsfield units (HU) into bone mineral density (BMD) values. Image analysis software (Inveon Research Workplace [IRW], Siemens Medical Solutions, Knoxville, Tennessee) was used for visualization and analysis. A region of interest (ROI) was created to include clustered new bone immediately surrounding the graft within the bone tunnel. The ROIs were created for each specimen individually to ensure only new bone was selected. Bone morphometry and density calculations were performed within the ROIs by applying thresholds to distinguish new bone and bone marrow. Micro-CT parameter measurements revealed the BMD and microarchitecture of new bone formation. Bone mineral density is considered indicative of quality of healing between the tendon and bone.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0363546512457648">
<title>Histology</title>
<p>After the animal was sacrificed, the femur–ACL graft–tibia complex was harvested. Care was taken not to disturb the knee joint. The specimens were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for 48 hours. Tissues were decalcified in 10% formic acid–formalin. The femur–ACL graft–tibia complex was sectioned axially (perpendicular to bone tunnels) and paraffin embedded. Sections (5 μm) were cut from 5 thick serial sections (n = 5; 2 femoral and 3 tibial sections) and stained using Harris hematoxylin and eosin. Histology was qualitatively assessed for integrity, quality, graft viability, degree of tendon-bone integration, new bone formation, presence of fibrous tissue interface layer, cellular activity, and Sharpey fibers in a blinded fashion by 3 independent observers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0363546512457648">
<title>Immunohistochemistry</title>
<p>Immunohistochemistry was performed to determine the expression of BMP-2 and -7, Smad4, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and cathepsin K (CTSK).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0363546512457648">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0363546512457648">35</xref></sup> Deparaffinized slides were treated with a citrate-based (neutral pH) antigen retrieval solution (DAKO Pty Ltd, Glostrup, Denmark) at 95°C for 20 minutes. Endogenous peroxidase was quenched by 0.3% hydrogen peroxide in 50% methanol for 10 minutes. Slides were rinsed in distilled water and washed in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.2% Tween-20 (PBS-T). Primary mouse monoclonal antibodies against CTSK (sc-48353), Smad4 (sc-7966), BMP-2 (sc-57040), and VEGF (sc-7269) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc, Santa Cruz, California) and rabbit polyclonal antibodies against BMP-7 (ab56023) (Abcam PLC, Cambridge, United Kingdom) or nonimmunized mouse (DakoCytomation, Glostrup, Denmark) and rabbit (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) immunoglobulin, as negative controls, were applied to the sections (1 antibody per section) and left overnight at 4°C in humidity chambers. The concentrations of primary antibodies were 1 μg/mL for BMP-2, BMP-7, and VEGF; 1.5 μg/mL for Smad4; and 0.15 μg/mL for CTSK. The final concentration of negative controls was 1.5 μg/mL. Slides were washed 3 times in PBS-T, and the Envision<sup>+</sup> System-HPR labeled polymer (DakoCytomation) specific for the mouse (K4001) or rabbit (K4003) was applied at room temperature for 1 hour. Sections were washed in PBS-T 4 times before the application of a substrate-chromogen system, DAKO liquid diaminobenzidine (DAB; K3468, DakoCytomation). After 30 minutes, the reaction was terminated by immersing the slides in PBS. The sections were counterstained with Harris hematoxylin and eosin. Semiquantitative analysis was performed for BMP-2, BMP-7, Smad4, and VEGF. Quantitative analysis was performed for CTSK-stained sections.</p>
<p>Semiquantitative analysis was performed by 3 independent observers in a blinded fashion. Two sections were examined per specimen, and 1 slide was examined per section. Two separate ROI fields (original magnification ×10) were assessed for each slide and factor. Each ROI represented an interface area between the tendon and bone with equal amounts of each tissue. A 5-grade scaling system was adopted from Yu et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0363546512457648">34</xref></sup> and modified (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0363546512457648">Table 1</xref>). Sections were graded according to the proportion of cells that stained positively for the marker out of the entire cell population within the section. Once this value was obtained, a further subgrade was given according to the staining intensity of the positively stained cells with reference to background staining. A resultant grade (1-5) for each section was therefore a combination of the 2 dependent grading scales. Cell phenotypes assessed included osteoblast-like cells, osteoblast progenitor cells, proliferating fibroblasts, and endothelial cells at the tendon-bone interface.</p>

<p>CTSK expression was quantified using software (histomorph) written in Matlab 7.0 (The MathWorks, Natick, Massachusetts), designed to select ROIs based on color. The software processes images and converts the color space from red/green/blue to Commission Internationale d’Eclairage L*a*b (CIELAB).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546512457648">17</xref></sup> Quantitative assessment of CTSK was performed to provide a more thorough analysis of immunohistochemistry. Two axial sections from each tibial block, representative of the in vivo response, were examined. Two separate ROIs (magnification ×10), most representative of the entire sections, were assessed for each specimen. The proportion of stained areas as determined by histomorph was considered representative of osteoclastic activity (in the osteoclast and within its immediate surroundings).</p>

<sec id="section15-0363546512457648">
<title>Mechanical Testing</title>
<p>The femur–ACL graft–tibia constructs were stripped of all soft tissue before mechanical testing using surgical loupes. The specimens were embedded into custom-made jigs in 90° of flexion using a Mach-1 testing system (Biosyntech Inc, Montreal, Quebec, Canada). The constructs were loaded to failure at a rate of 0.5 mm/s. Failure mode of the specimens was recorded as the site of the graft failure: graft midsubstance, tibial tunnel, or femoral tunnel. Testing was performed at room temperature and the tendon kept hydrated with PBS throughout. Data were analyzed using Mach-1 analysis software (Biosyntech Inc).</p>

<sec id="section16-0363546512457648">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Quantitative data were analyzed using analysis of variance with post hoc pair-wise comparisons to determine any statistical differences between groups. <italic>t</italic> tests were performed for all semiquantitative data including histological grading of BMP-7, BMP-2, VEGF, and Smad4. A Levene test (<italic>P</italic> ≤ .05) was used to confirm variance of homogeneity of the populations. The normality of data was confirmed based on the 1-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test in SPSS (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois). Differences were considered significant at <italic>P</italic> ≤ .05.

<title>Histology</title>
<p>For histology and immunohistochemistry alike, only tibial and femoral slices that did not encompass the growth plate were examined. Moreover, because of the angle of drilling and thus tunnel placement within the femur, many femoral sections did contain growth plate regions. As this was not comparable with the rest of the cut sections, yet the tibial sections were found consistent across all specimens, only the tibial sections were used for histological and immunohistochemical analysis.</p>
<p>Both the treatment and the control groups showed a similar pattern of healing between the tendon and bone in terms of timing of events; however, noteworthy differences were observed in and around the regions of DBM particles. At 2 weeks after surgery, the fibrovascular interface layer was present in all specimens in both groups but was thicker and more prominent in the DBM-treated group. Regions of complete discontinuity and distinct boundaries between the tendon and bone or interface layer and bone were evident. There were no signs of fibrocartilage forming in any specimen. Poorly orientated, immature collagen was present throughout all groups and specimens. Cellularity and vascularity seemed relatively high at the outer tendon and the interface zone in both groups. Cellular composition consisted predominantly of fibroblasts with inflammatory cells also present. In the control group, graft necrosis was seen in 2 of 4 specimens within the bone tunnel. This was not observed in the DBM-treated group. Woven bone formed around the tendon graft in all samples in both groups but was significantly more abundant in the DBM-treated group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0363546512457648">Figure 4</xref>). Increased osteoblastic and osteoclastic activity concomitant with new bone formation in the regions of DBM was evident (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0363546512457648">Figure 5</xref>). At 4 weeks, an increased number of osteoblasts lining the bone tunnel were observed in both groups. This was coupled with an increased amount of new bone formation and maturation of woven bone into trabeculae. Again, this was more abundant in the DBM group. More direct bone ingrowth into the tendon was observed with fewer areas of distinct boundaries between the interface layer and bone. The width of the interface layer had decreased in both groups. Cellularity of the inner tendon returned to normal, and no graft necrosis was seen among the specimens. Newly formed blood vessels were found in the interface layer and in the outer tendon in the DBM-treated group and were not as profuse in the control group. This finding was only evident in some sections and was not consistent within groups; it is therefore considered inconclusive. In the region of DBM particles, there was evidence of collagen fiber continuity linking it to the interface layer between new bone and the tendon graft. Collagen fiber origin and insertion points and collagen fiber orientation were confirmed under polarized light. Osteoconduction was also noted in this region with some of the newly formed bone growing directly into the tendon or the interface layer.</p>

<title>Immunohistochemistry</title>
<p>Nonimmunized mouse and rabbit immunoglobulin were used as negative controls to confirm that the primary antibodies were specific. No staining was observed in the negative controls. Semiquantitative grading of immunohistochemical staining is summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0363546512457648">Table 3</xref>. Significant differences between the groups were seen in the expression of BMP-7 at all time points (<italic>P</italic> = .01, .05, and .05 for 2, 4, and 6 weeks, respectively). CTSK expressions significantly increased in the treatment group at 2 and 4 weeks (<italic>P</italic> = .03 and .02, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0363546512457648">Figure 7</xref>). Expression of BMP-2 and Smad4 increased in the treatment group at 2 weeks after surgery (<italic>P</italic> = .02 and .04, respectively). No clear differences were identified in the expression of VEGF at any time point. Each growth factor was specifically expressed by certain cells found within the ROI. Cell-specific staining for each factor is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0363546512457648">Figure 8</xref>. Briefly, BMP-7 and BMP-2 stained positively in osteoblasts and osteoprogenitor cells at the surface of the newly formed woven bone and also in some fibroblasts found at the interface region and throughout the ACL graft. Smad4 was found present in all cell types at the healing interface but was expressed strongest by osteoblasts and osteoprogenitor cells. VEGF stained positive within osteoblasts found in the newly formed bone, endothelial cells, and some fibroblasts at the interface and within the graft. CTSK was expressed by osteoclasts in regions of bone resorption. Strongest staining was seen intracellularly, with weaker staining also recorded extracellularly, in the bone resorption areas. It is important to note that the factors that were expressed significantly higher in the DBM group were not necessarily expressed within the allogenic DBM particles themselves but were concentrated in the areas of new bone formation, particularly areas where DBM osteoconduction transpired.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We hypothesized that incorporation of DBM into the graft could improve tendon-bone healing. To test our hypothesis, we implanted DBM into the ACL tendon graft and the bone tunnel prior to ACL reconstruction in a rodent model.</p>
<p>Our histological analysis of the tibial and femoral tunnels showed similar patterns of healing phases and timing of events between groups. This was synonymous with previous reports studying tendon-bone healing in a bone tunnel in rats,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546512457648">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512457648">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512457648">15</xref></sup> rabbits,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546512457648">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546512457648">24</xref></sup> dogs,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546512457648">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546512457648">25</xref></sup> and sheep.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546512457648">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0363546512457648">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0363546512457648">33</xref></sup> We observed notable differences between groups in woven bone formation and maturation of bone surrounding the grafted tendon as shown by qualitative histological analysis and micro-CT data. Increased osteoblastic and osteoclastic activity in the regions of DBM particles manifested into significantly more newly formed bone in the DBM-treated group at 2, 4, and 6 weeks after surgery as indicated by micro-CT data. This appeared to be the major feature of DBM-enhanced tendon-bone healing in this animal model. No reconstitution of the fibrocartilage layer was observed in either group.</p>
<p>It has been suggested that the tendon-bone interface develops by endochondral ossification.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546512457648">29</xref></sup> Demineralized bone matrix induces new bone formation via the same method.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0363546512457648">30</xref></sup> Endochondral ossification is characterized by 3 distinct stages: the early inflammatory stage, typified by initial hematoma and release of growth factors and cytokines followed by inflammation; the repair stage, which is marked by the secretion of a cartilaginous matrix that is subsequently mineralized as woven bone is formed; and the remodeling stage, which is characterized by bone resorption, remodeling, and formation of lamellar bone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546512457648">13</xref></sup> Fibrocartilage formation was not noted at any stage of healing in the current study. Furthermore, no cartilaginous matrix was observed at the sites of new bone induction by DBM. We speculate that we did not see this stage of the endochondral ossification because earlier time points were not examined. Further study is required to characterize DBM bone induction pathways particularly during the early repair stage.</p>
<p>Our findings suggest that in the presence of DBM, tendon-bone healing is augmented by increased woven bone formation and enhanced bone remodeling, resulting in improved mechanical strength of the tendon-bone interface. Immunohistochemical analysis of various growth factors at 2, 4, and 6 weeks after surgery was performed to examine the mechanisms that produce these biological effects in response to DBM. Smad4 is a common component essential to all signaling pathways.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546512457648">6</xref></sup> BMP-2 and BMP-7 have been shown to specifically participate in bone formation and remodeling, leading to bone ingrowth and osseous integration between the tendon and bone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546512457648">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546512457648">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546512457648">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0363546512457648">34</xref></sup> VEGF is known to stimulate the differentiation of osteoblasts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512457648">5</xref></sup> and to play a critical role in angiogenesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512457648">8</xref></sup> Furthermore, adequate blood supply has been shown as a prerequisite for the endochondral process of new bone formation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546512457648">26</xref></sup> and it is a popular belief that increased vascularity at the healing entheses could augment tendon-to-bone healing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546512457648">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>VEGF expression in the DBM group was elevated at all time points, but statistical significance was not found. This finding was in agreement with histological observations with newly formed blood vessels found in the DBM group. These observations were not seen consistently within groups and were therefore deemed inconclusive. Nonetheless, it is possible that the amount of woven bone formation and subsequent remodeling can be augmented by an increase in vascularity.</p>
<p>We speculate that the more woven bone formation and earlier remodeling arose from increased amounts of osteoinductive growth factors such as BMPs, which is supported by immunohistochemical analysis of BMP-2 and BMP-7. A statistically significant increase in BMP-7 expression was observed in the DBM group at all time points. Higher levels of BMP-2 and Smad4 were also recorded for all time periods, but the differences between groups were only found to be statistically significant at 2 weeks. Generally, more growth factor expression and activity were seen in the DBM group, which was confirmed by increased levels of Smad4. This supports the notion that Smad4 is a common component essential to all signaling pathways.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546512457648">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0363546512457648">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is feasible that higher growth factor expression observed in this study is a result of increased osteoclastic activity, likely instigated by the presence of DBM particles. The increased release of growth factors during bone resorption consequently incited more bone formation.</p>
<p>Osteoclasts are key cells involved in bone resorption. Their unique feature is the capacity to dissolve bone mineral, and currently, there are no conclusive data to suggest that other cells can perform this function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0363546512457648">31</xref></sup> CTSK is a key proteolytic enzyme in the degradation of organic bone matrix.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512457648">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0363546512457648">31</xref></sup> CTSK is very highly expressed in osteoclasts and is secreted into the resorption lacuna during bone resorption.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512457648">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0363546512457648">36</xref></sup> Other than bone resorption, it has been suggested that osteoclasts may be involved in paracrine regulation of osteoblast precursors and consequently play a role in bone formation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546512457648">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Quantification of CTSK expression in this study was used as an indicator of osteoclastic bone activity. A statistically significant increase in CTSK activity was noted in the DBM group at 2 and 4 weeks after surgery, postulating an increase in bone resorption. This coincided with increased new bone formation as observed histologically and quantitatively with micro-CT. This relationship between increased bone resorption and bone formation was previously reported in the context of tendon-bone healing by Rodeo et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546512457648">25</xref></sup> who used a dog model to study the effects of BMP-2 in a bone tunnel. They reported the resorption of host bone, which surrounded the grafted tendon coupled with vigorous new bone formation in the early healing period in specimens treated with a high dose of BMP-2. They elucidated the results to the increased dose of BMP-2, which stimulates osteoclast formation as well as activates mature osteoclasts in vitro.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512457648">14</xref></sup> These results are in agreement with our semiquantitative grading of BMP-2 expression. Further studies are required to determine how osteoclast cells are stimulated during DBM resorption in vivo.</p>
<p>Micro-CT was performed to quantify bone volume, BMD, and trabecular bone architecture within the bone tunnel, immediately surrounding the tendon graft (ie, the tendon-bone interface). Typically, BMD or the degree of mineralization of bone has been shown to be indicative of quality and degree of healing between the tendon and bone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546512457648">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546512457648">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512457648">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546512457648">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546512457648">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0363546512457648">37</xref></sup> Similarly, new bone formation at the tendon-bone interface is considered to play an important role in improving tendon-bone healing within a bone tunnel. The degree of mineralization is indicative of maturation level of newly formed bone. A statistically significant increase in bone volume surrounding the graft was found at 4 and 6 weeks in the DBM group. Trabecular thickness was significantly higher in the DBM group at both time periods, indicating larger trabeculae of newly formed woven bone. A similar pattern was noted in trabecular number, although the difference was not significant. The BMD was greater in the DBM group at both time points.</p>
<p>This study is limited considering only the early phases of healing as well as the small sample size. The use of rodents makes rendering of results into humans difficult. It is likely that the type of graft fixation used in this study is more elastic than the rigid fixation commonly utilized for human patients. This might be associated with increased levels of micromotion between the tendon graft and the surrounding bone, and one should be vigilant when extrapolating these results to human patients. Nonetheless, the rodent ACL reconstruction model has been previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546512457648">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512457648">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512457648">15</xref></sup> and is accepted as a suitable model for studying intra-articular tendon-bone healing. We used DBM particulates that had previously been tested for osteoinductivity. As this material is of different xenogeneic origin to a rat, we used immunodeficient animals.</p>
<p>It has been proposed that superior clinical outcome of surgical procedures involving the reattachment of the tendon to bone lies in successful re-creation of the fibrocartilage layer typically seen in direct-type entheses. Thus far, this has proven difficult, and only limited success has been reported. Interestingly, despite the lack of fibrocartilage formation observed at the healing entheses in our study, specimens from the DBM group demonstrated an improved tendon-bone interface as indicated by histological observations, micro-CT parameters, and superior mechanical properties. We used DBM particles, which were dispersed throughout bone tunnels and the grafted tendon. Osteoinductive and osteoconductive properties of DBM were evident. New bone formation was seen locally surrounding DBM and forming in continuation with bone and DBM. Further, some DBM particles extended into and were continuous with the interface layer and the tendon graft. It is feasible that improved mechanical strength was achieved by having an abundant number of these “anchorage points” where the DBM particles were attaching to the tendon, bone, or both.</p>
<p>A biological solution to the challenging problem of tendon-to-bone healing remains elusive. This study shows that the potential for DBM to be used in a clinical setting to augment tendon-bone healing exists. Further study is required to characterize and examine the exact mechanisms involved in DBM-augmented tendon-bone healing.</p>
