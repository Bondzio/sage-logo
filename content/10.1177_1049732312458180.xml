<abstract>
<p>Implementations of patient centeredness can vary tremendously across settings, yet we know little about how clinicians experience local interpretations of patient centeredness. In this article, we investigate nurses’ experiences in a hospital designed to be patient centered in its emphasis on patient amenities and customer service. This environment altered nurses’ articulation work by shifting the visibility of a number of nursing tasks; customer service tasks became more visible whereas many medical and caring tasks were obscured. We found that these changes in nursing work challenged nurses’ professional roles, and the informants reported that the changes disrupted their relationships with patients and with one another. This implementation of patient centeredness resulted in a view of nursing that conflicted with many nurses’ implicit and explicit understanding of their work. Our findings suggest that the adoption of some versions of patient centeredness might obscure substantial and substantive nursing work and might undermine nurses’ concepts of caregiving.</p>

<p>Much of the extensive literature on nursing presents a dismal picture of nurses’ experiences. Nurses face a range of challenges, including dissatisfaction with the workplace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732312458180">Black, Spetz, &amp; Harrington, 2008</xref>), pay inequity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1049732312458180">Schreiber, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1049732312458180">1994</xref>), staff shortages, heavy workloads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1049732312458180">Steinbrook, 2002</xref>), burnout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049732312458180">Dolan, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1049732312458180">Schaufeli &amp; Janczur, 1994</xref>), a dearth of recognition, and modest professional status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049732312458180">Ceci, 2004</xref>). Nurses’ difficulties are especially pronounced in the aftermath of hospital restructuring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732312458180">Blythe, Baumann, &amp; Giovannetti, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732312458180">Bostrom &amp; Zimmerman, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732312458180">Clifford, 1998</xref>). Because many restructuring efforts are aimed at improving efficiency or reducing waste, they frequently are focused on streamlining nursing processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1049732312458180">Rundall, Starkweather, &amp; Norrish, 1998</xref>), bringing about undesirable effects on nursing morale and job satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049732312458180">Armstrong-Stassen, Cameron, &amp; Horsburgh, 1996</xref>). Restructuring can also lead to inefficient use of nurse time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1049732312458180">Murphy, 1993</xref>), increased workloads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049732312458180">Burke &amp; Greenglass, 2000</xref>), reduced patient contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1049732312458180">McKiel, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1049732312458180">Norrish &amp; Rundall, 2001</xref>), and feelings of uncertainty and disempowerment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732312458180">Blythe et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1049732312458180">Laschinger, Sabiston, Finegan, &amp; Shamian, 2001</xref>). Overall, the outcomes of restructuring have been found to be particularly bleak for nurses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732312458180">Curtin, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1049732312458180">Walston, Lawton, &amp; Kimberly, 2000</xref>), often resulting in “high costs with little return” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1049732312458180">Leatt, Baker, Haverson, &amp; Aird, 1997</xref>, p. 8).</p>
<p>Although nurses are often dissatisfied with hospital restructuring efforts, they have responded positively to so-called patient-centered restructuring when it supports interventions “to increase the productivity of nurses and [strengthen] their role in patient care” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1049732312458180">Rundall et al., 1998</xref>, p. 13).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1049732312458180">1</xref></sup> Using interviews and observations, we investigated nurses’ experiences following a move into a new hospital designed to be patient centered. However, the focus of the hospital’s patient-centered redesign was to improve patient experience and comfort by including features such as private rooms, exceptional customer service, and a variety of patient amenities. As we discuss below, the informants suggested that the adoption of this view of patient centeredness might have obscured substantial and substantive nursing work and undermined nurses’ established concepts of caregiving. These findings are necessarily provisional, because they come from close study of a single hospital only. Nonetheless, these nurses’ experiences might signal the need for a more holistic conceptualization of patient centeredness in which the perspectives of both patients and staff are considered.</p>
<sec id="section1-1049732312458180">
<title>Background</title>
<p>Although scholars and clinicians interpret patient centeredness in markedly different ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049732312458180">de Haes, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1049732312458180">Novotná, Urbanoski, &amp; Rush, 2011</xref>), as a philosophy of care, it receives widespread support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732312458180">Duggen, Geller, Cooper, &amp; Beach, 2006</xref>). Conceptually, patient centeredness promotes valuing the individual, “understand[ing] the patient as a unique human being” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049732312458180">Balint, 1969</xref>, p. 269), and recognizing the importance of individual illness experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1049732312458180">Mead, Bower, &amp; Hann, 2002</xref>). Unsurprisingly then, patient centeredness has been widely advocated in medical education and has been powerful in initiating change within the health care system. The Institute of Medicine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1049732312458180">IOM, 2001</xref>) identified patient centeredness, which it defined as “providing care that is respectful of and responsive to individual patient preferences, needs and values” (p. 6), as one of the six aims to improving health care. Hospitals and other health care organizations have variably conceived of patient needs and values and have used the concept of patient centeredness to support changes in a range of areas, including doctor–patient communication and patient amenities.</p>
<p>Patient centeredness has also influenced hospital design (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049732312458180">France et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1049732312458180">Lathrop, 1991</xref>). Once valued as paragons of science and organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1049732312458180">Starr, 1982</xref>), hospitals are now often derided as “noisy, cluttered, institutional environments with little regard for the potentially detrimental effects these environments have on the patients’ physical or psychologic well-being” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1049732312458180">Schweitzer, Gilpin &amp; Frampton, 2004</xref>, p. S71). Many hospitals are therefore striving to become “therapeutic landscapes” (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732312458180">Evans, Crooks, &amp; Kingsbury, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049732312458180">Gesler, Bell, Curtis, Hubbard, &amp; Francis, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1049732312458180">Williams, 2007</xref>), and are being redesigned to include noninstitutional spaces, elements of nature (e.g., natural light, scenic views, therapeutic sounds), and features of a home environment (e.g., large private rooms, satellite radio, soothing colors; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049732312458180">Altimier, 2004</xref>; France et al.). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1049732312458180">Watson (2005)</xref> noted the increasing amount of research exploring connections between such environmental features and health outcomes (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732312458180">Devlin &amp; Arneill, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049732312458180">Griffin, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1049732312458180">Ulrich, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1049732312458180">Wilson, 2003</xref>). To put these findings into practice and at the same time increase their competitive advantage by improving patient satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1049732312458180">Kearns &amp; Barnett, 1997</xref>), many hospitals are undergoing extensive transformations in an effort to provide a more positive patient experience (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049732312458180">Allday, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>These trends indicate a need for empirical exploration of clinicians’ responses to local interpretations of patient-centered restructuring. Although patient-centered restructuring can promote the inclusion of psychosocial concerns in the treatment plan, it can also lead hospitals to focus on nonmedical amenities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732312458180">Goldman, Vaiana, &amp; Romley, 2010</xref>), and to ask clinical staff to assume new tasks and roles in an effort to maximize patient comfort. Understanding nurses’ responses might be particularly important, because nurses have been found to be as essential in the creation of healing spaces as the physical environment. In fact, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049732312458180">Gilmour (2006)</xref> argued that the nurse and the relationship that the nurse builds with the patient are what constitutes “the hospital as a home space for patients” (p. 16). A number of studies have shown that patients report satisfaction with various hospital design features described as patient-centered (e.g., private patient rooms; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1049732312458180">Swan, Richardson &amp; Hutton, 2003</xref>). However, despite the importance of nurses’ work in creating patient-centered environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049732312458180">Carolan, Andrews, &amp; Hodnett, 2006</xref>, p. 205), and despite the changes to clinical roles such restructuring might bring, very few studies have examined nurses’ experiences in these hospitals.</p>

<title>Conceptual Framework</title>
<p>In this article, we extend a body of theoretical work that recognizes the impact of space on the content, process, and status of nursing work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1049732312458180">Walston et al., 2000</xref>). Many have described nursing work as invisible: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1049732312458180">Wolf (1989)</xref> listed interpersonal work, comforting work, privacy work, dirty work, body work, and death work as invisible, and thus unrecognized work performed by nurses. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1049732312458180">McWilliam and Wong (1994)</xref> pointed out, Wolf’s categories of hidden work involved direct patient care and were obscured simply because they were not discussed. They noted that a considerable amount of work relating to “professional caring and clinical judgment” (p. 153) was also hidden. Such work included overseeing the work practices of the health care team, adjusting to the demands of being short staffed, and monitoring organizational and coordination tasks and roles (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049732312458180">Hamilton &amp; Manias, 2007</xref>). This hidden work is reminiscent of what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1049732312458180">Strauss (1988)</xref> called articulation work—work that is accomplished in the service of more recognized clinical tasks. Articulation work consists of all the subtasks that are required to organize, coordinate, and carry out the principal task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732312458180">Gerson &amp; Star, 1986</xref>). Such subtasks are often unacknowledged and entail “<italic>following through, following up</italic> and ‘working things out’” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732312458180">Hampson &amp; Junor, 2005</xref>, p. 168, emphasis in original). Most of this work in hospital settings quietly belongs to nurses and is essential for the delivery of quality health care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732312458180">Gugerty, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Articulation work, although unacknowledged, is not always hidden; it might be visible or invisible and consist of routine and nonroutine tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732312458180">Hampson &amp; Junor, 2005</xref>). In nursing, tasks such as standard charting procedures are routine and visible, whereas spontaneously sharing knowledge about a new procedure or piece of equipment is nonroutine and invisible. Although both visible and invisible articulation work contribute to more recognized clinical work, invisible work plays a unique role in nursing. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1049732312458180">Star and Strauss (1999)</xref> claimed that nurses are striving to increase the visibility of nursing work, thereby transforming work that is “usually taken-for-granted into work that is legitimate, individuated and traceable across settings” (p. 15). Making tasks visible can provide legitimacy and recognition, but it can also create challenges because visibility entails accountability. Although hospital staff and administration might perceive visible work to be more valid than invisible work, visible work is also vulnerable to monitoring and top-down control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1049732312458180">Strauss, 1985</xref>), which can diminish worker autonomy. As we show in this article, patient-centered restructuring in this environment can change the visibility of a number of nursing tasks. According to the nurses we interviewed, this reshuffling of visible and invisible tasks resulted in a view of nursing in the hospital that often conflicted with nurses’ implicit and explicit understanding of their work.</p>

<title>Study Context and Methods</title>
<p>We investigated a hospital that opened in 2008. We describe the design intent, the building layout, and the amenities of the environment in more detail elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049732312458180">Bromley, 2012</xref>). The patient care floors we studied were organized into three-quarter round towers housing the inpatient units. Each of the medical or surgical units had an identical structure: they were circular and contained patient rooms around the perimeter. The central area of each unit contained storage, equipment rooms, medical supplies, and nursing conference areas. Doors divided these “core” areas from the hallways, patient rooms, and other visitor areas (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1049732312458180">Figure 1</xref>) so that visitors and patients could not see these work areas. Designers and administrators used this onstage/offstage approach, in which public and staff areas were strictly segregated, to guide many aspects of the space as well as hospital policies.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1049732312458180-fig1.tif"/></fig>
<p>The hospital design incorporated several amenities to make the environment more comfortable and appealing for patients and families. All private rooms included satellite radio, television, abundant patient storage space, and floor-to-ceiling windows. Patients ordered meals from a menu, rooms included space for families to stay overnight, and the building towers were staggered to provide patient rooms with views and maximum natural light. Visiting hours were flexible. Communication protocols instructed staff on the use of courteous introductions and exits with patients and families, and all staff wore uniforms distinguishing their roles. Hiring procedures included a behavioral assessment along with a behavioral interview that stressed the service orientation of the hospital. Designers, administrators, and planners said that the overall intent was to treat patients as guests and to provide them with service that helped them feel that their needs and preferences were foremost. Many described this approach as offering patients and visitors an “antihospital” experience.</p>
<p>We collected interview and observational data, as approved by the institutional review board (IRB), over 10 months from 175 clinical staff (115 nurses/nurse managers, 25 nursing assistants, 17 physicians, 11 nurse team leaders, and 7 occupational and respiratory therapists) 15 months after the move into the hospital. A researcher approached staff in break areas to describe the purpose and procedures of the study, assuring staff that their interview responses and notes taken during observational shadowing would be anonymized and that the purpose of the study was not to evaluate staff, but to understand how they experienced their work in the new hospital environment. The researcher provided staff with an IRB-approved information sheet, and oral consent was obtained. Throughout the study, the same researcher (Mikesell), who was not a hospital employee, conducted the interviews and shadowing.</p>
<p>Interviews were semistructured and most were conducted one on one in a break room or quiet space on the unit. Because hospital work is unpredictable, some interviews were conducted over the phone or as small focus groups with 2 to 5 care providers. In interviews, staff were asked about their work processes in the new space, what they needed to conduct excellent patient care, and their impressions of the hospital’s new procedures. Data collection also included &gt;300 hours of shadowing and observations. Shadowing functioned much like the go-along interview described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1049732312458180">Kusenbach (2003)</xref>; Mikesell accompanied staff as they went about their workday, asking questions and encouraging informants to provide commentary as they navigated their physical and social environments to accomplish daily work tasks. She was thus able to observe “spatial practices in situ while accessing [informants’] experiences and interpretations at the same time” (p. 463). Mikesell observed every intensive care unit (ICU) and medical-surgical unit, including specialty wards such as labor and delivery, the pediatric ICU, and the neonatal ICU in this manner. During go-alongs, she took field notes that were made available to the research team, which met weekly to discuss data themes.</p>
<p>Interviews were audiorecorded and transcribed verbatim. Mikesell then checked transcripts against the audio record. Mikesell and another member of the research team reviewed transcripts for recurrent themes using thematic content analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1049732312458180">Ryan &amp; Bernard, 2003</xref>). They inductively identified recurrent themes, which they then described as exclusive codes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1049732312458180">Patton, 2002</xref>). As codes emerged from the data, they systematically applied them to interviews. They iteratively revised the codes as additional interviews were conducted and new themes were identified. All five members of the research team also iteratively revised themes and codes through weekly discussions of themes and textual examples. We used field notes from go-alongs to validate, disconfirm, clarify, and/or contextualize the emergent themes from the interviews.</p>
<p>Data collection and analysis occurred simultaneously, each shaping the other, and thus the process was reflexive and dynamic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1049732312458180">Sandelowski, 2000</xref>). We held multiple feedback sessions with nurses, nurse managers, and hospital administrators in which we discussed preliminary findings. The perspectives highlighted in this article stem from the nursing staff, who comprised the largest group of respondents; however, from this feedback process, a highly consistent set of concerns emerged across all sources of data, across clinical disciplines and units, and across time points. Once we drafted the manuscript, it was shared with nurse managers, administrators, and nurses at the hospital to gather additional feedback on the interpretation of the data.</p>
<p>This study was unique in three ways: first, we incorporated observations of how the staff used the space during go-alongs, in addition to staff perceptions. These observations are important because verbal reports should not be “treated as acceptable surrogates for the observation of actual behavior” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1049732312458180">Heritage &amp; Atkinson, 1984</xref>, p. 2). Observations during go-alongs allowed immediate access to staff’s work and communication practices, which included features that both inhibited and facilitated workflow. As staff interacted with the environment, the use of space or the implementation of a particular process often prompted additional comments. Second, many studies have accessed staff perceptions of work experiences through survey results alone (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049732312458180">Aiken et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1049732312458180">Ingersoll, Olsan, Drew-Cates, DeVinney, &amp; Davies, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1049732312458180">Laschinger, 2004</xref>; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049732312458180">Hallin &amp; Danielson, 2007</xref>, for an exception). Surveys provide little contextual information and restrict responses to a particular subset of categories or themes, which might not be the most relevant to survey responders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049732312458180">Harré, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1049732312458180">Rosier, 1974</xref>). Third, the hospital we studied had been operational for nearly 2 years by the end of data collection, allowing a considerable amount of time for staff to adjust to the restructuring changes. Previous research has revealed that clinicians are often unhappy with restructuring changes within months after implementation (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1049732312458180">Redman &amp; Jones, 1998</xref>). How staff perceive restructuring changes after the novelty subsides and work practices settle has rarely been studied.</p>

<title>Findings</title>
<p>Although we focus on the viewpoint of nurses and highlight concerns, we present a summary of results of the staff surveys to contextualize the overall hospital environment from the staff’s collective perspective. We solicited participation in a Web-based survey by all staff working in the hospital. The solicitation was sent to approximately 5,000 hospital staff and we received 416 responses. Because of this low response rate (approximately 8%), we were cautious in interpreting the results. Fifty-four percent of respondents to the survey (<italic>n</italic> = 226) were nurses. The survey included items from the Organizational Climate Survey (OCL; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732312458180">Glisson, 2000</xref>) to assess four aspects of the hospital climate: cooperation, organizational commitment, role overload, and role conflict. All survey items measured these domains using a five-point Likert scale from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree.” Other items on the survey assessed nurses’ satisfaction with features of the new environment, such as private patient rooms. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1049732312458180">Table 1</xref>, staff at the hospital reported high levels of commitment and cooperation and modest levels of job-related stress. ANOVA analyses showed that physicians had significantly higher levels of role overload, role conflict, and commitment as compared with both nurses and other clinical staff. Other clinical staff also reported lower levels of cooperation compared with both nurses and physicians.</p>

<p>Furthermore, hospital administrators reported to the research team that surveys administered biyearly also showed that staff perceived a strong culture of patient safety in the hospital and reported high levels of job satisfaction (2007–2008, <italic>n</italic> = 4121; 2008–2009, <italic>n</italic> = 4476). Nurses’ interview responses resonated with these themes. Nurses were highly committed to their work and their colleagues. They also expressed appreciation for several features of the new space. They particularly valued the aspects of the environment that were designed to improve the patient and family experience, such as the privacy of the patient rooms, the convenience of room-service meals, and the beauty and natural light of the building.</p>
<p>Overall, these sources of data showed that staff were committed to both the values of the institution and those that underpinned the restructuring of the hospital. However, these data did not reflect many of the daily concerns nurses raised when asked to comment directly on their experiences. Nurses we interviewed voiced a consistent and conceptually overlapping set of concerns about the impact of the patient-centered restructuring on their satisfaction with their work and their professional identities. In these interviews, the allocation of space, the prioritization of customer service goals, and the need to struggle with multiple challenges to both workflow and professional identity resulted in dissatisfaction. One nurse described it this way:
<disp-quote>
<p>The patients like it, most patients, because [pause] they have the private room, they have the family come in. . . . It’s like their own little hotel. And that’s the good thing about the whole hospital. It’s good for the patients. But you gotta make the nurses and everybody that works here just as happy. We’re not happy.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Nurses we interviewed immediately recognized the physical space as convenient and comfortable for patients but complicated and inadequate for staff. They described the design of the units as “not user friendly,” “not designed for nurses,” and “terrible.” Overall, nurses voiced numerous concerns about the physical space and layout that observations confirmed: nurses we interviewed felt that conference rooms for holding clinic team meetings in private were sparse; the medication rooms were small and often crowded; there was insufficient private space for reporting at shift changes; supplies were inconveniently located (so as to keep them hidden from patient view); and there was little break space in which staff could congregate. The physical space meant that nurses walked long distances, and many nurses developed workarounds to more efficiently accomplish types of articulation work: skipping steps in customer service protocols, carrying supplies on their person or, when feasible, storing supplies in patient rooms.</p>
<p>These concerns reflect the fact that the restructuring significantly altered what constituted public and private work. Nurses described the behind-the-scenes and largely taken-for-granted coordination tasks of managing patient care and contingencies—organizing supplies, gathering medications, resolving errors, and relaying information to colleagues—as challenging in this environment. This was because the physical space relegated articulation work to obscure, out-of-the way spaces: nurses reported walking more, opening more doors, spending more time looking for other staff, and having to plan several steps ahead to accomplish a single task. At the same time, the hospital-wide policies and protocols made the customer service orientation and evaluation of staff more visible. As a result, nurses perceived a reversal of traditional hospital values, as a result of which clinical work became private and hidden and service work became public and explicit. As we describe below, the impact of this reversal on nursing work altered nurses’ concepts of their professional role, their relationships with patients, and their relationships with one another. In addition, nurses’ comments about the environment revealed the centrality of resiliency and sacrifice in nursing work and nursing identity.</p>
<sec id="section5-1049732312458180">
<title>Redefined Professional Roles and Identities</title>
<p>In our findings, nurses described their professional role as one of mediation and translation between the person of the patient and the medical work being done to him or her. Nurses expressed that nursing work bridges two cultures: the culture of medicine and the culture of caring. They described nursing as a “caring profession” oriented toward “healing,” “relationships with patients,” and “taking care of others,” as well as a medical profession oriented toward technical knowledge and clinical expertise (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1049732312458180">Tanner, Benner, Chesla, &amp; Gordon, 1993</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1049732312458180">2</xref></sup> Nurses’ understanding of their responsibility to be the bridge between medicine and caring was central to their struggle in the patient-centered environment we studied, where nurses believed that both orientations were altered. As a result, many nurses wondered, “What happened to the nursing?”</p>
<p>Many of the nurses interviewed expressed concerns that the caring culture had been redefined as a service culture. Many commented that the work made most visible in the new environment conflicted with their perception of nursing as a caring profession. They perceived that their first requirement in the new space was to be responsive to patient requests, and reported repeatedly walking back and forth to bring items to patient rooms and feeling pressure to deliver these items as quickly as possible. Additionally, policies mandated that all nurses were to carry phones with them and were required to write their phone number on whiteboards in patient rooms so they could be reached at any time. Nurses commented that, although having phones could be convenient, they often caused interruptions because the nurses felt pressure to respond to every call—even when they were with another patient or in the middle of a clinical task. During go-alongs, nurses were frequently interrupted by phone calls, sometimes every 5 to 6 minutes. Several nurses kept a small notebook with them to jot down patient requests and nonurgent matters. Their commentary revealed that this enabled them to better attend to their current task or patient without being mentally distracted with trying to remember phone requests. Nurses reported that fulfilling these requirements did not enable them to “know the patient”; that is, they were not perceived as caring tasks.</p>
<p>Other perceived priorities of the new space also foregrounded work that nurses did not value. For instance, evaluation procedures were service oriented: Cards were placed throughout the hospital for visitors to evaluate staff on service features such as how visitors were greeted. Several nurses believed that these forms of public evaluation diminished nurses’ professional status because they encouraged visitors to critique tasks that nurses felt were neither clinical nor caring tasks. Other nurses clarified that they cared deeply about issues like courtesy, warmth, and politeness with patients and visitors, but felt that continually soliciting evaluations of these behaviors could strip them of their genuineness. Many nurses reported feeling increasingly like “tip” workers, maids, and room attendants, and commented that the hospital was “more like a hotel.” One nurse said, “I’m confused. Am I a nurse or am I a concierge?” Many nurses confidently expressed beliefs about what nursing work should prioritize, yet also questioned what their priorities were in an environment where, as one nurse noted, the “customer is always right.”</p>
<p>At the same time, nurses described the medical orientation of nursing to be threatened because medical tasks were hidden, more challenging, and less acknowledged. Nurses discussed their frustration about the decision to keep crucial supplies hidden from patient view by storing them in the central core of the unit. They frequently voiced concerns about how this layout impeded workflow. One nurse summarized the ways in which the customer service orientation could conflict with nurses’ efforts to follow appropriate procedures in accessing intravenous (IV) central lines:
<disp-quote>
<p>The problem is much more complex than the actual dressing change policy. . . . The RNs [registered nurses] spend so much time bringing the family members chairs and coffee, checking on parking issues and other nonmedical questions. . . . These tasks are not beneath us, by any means. It is a time management issue. When a family member has a need as we enter the room to assess the patient or give a medication, they assume we are available to run these errands. And right now! It’s no wonder that we are tempted to cut corners on time while giving an IV medication.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In these ways, some nurses we interviewed expressed dissatisfaction with a sense that medical work had been devalued in the new space.</p>
<p>These same nurses often struggled to reconcile what they perceived as a threat to their values of caring and medicine with their own belief in the value of the patients’ experiences. In interviews, nurses aligned with the mission of patient centeredness while taking issue with the implementation of it:
<disp-quote>
<p>This is more for the patient, and that’s what it should be. . . . The patient seems to like it. I, myself, don’t think it needs to be this grandioso, but hey, who am I? [laughter] I think we’re getting away from the real issues, but that’s what people wanted. They want service.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In these ways, the nurses we studied valued prioritizing the patient, but perceived many of the restructuring changes to be obscuring nursing values and running counter to their understanding of patient care.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1049732312458180">
<title>A Changing Relationship With the Patient</title>
<p>Most nurses perceived that the physical layout and new policies undermined their relationships with patients. Commenting on the distance, private rooms, and closed doors that separated patients and staff to maximize patient privacy, one nurse remarked that her priorities for patients would be quite different: “[Patients] don’t need grandeur. They need warmth and comfort. And nurses need accessibility and closeness to the patients. They don’t need to be four doors away because they’re trying to shield everybody from whatever.” Nurses lamented the amount of time they spent traveling to and from patient rooms and to supplies located deep inside the core of the unit, not only because of the resulting inefficiency, but also because it meant less time spent with patients. They noted that the fatigue caused by walking and carrying items back and forth left them with little energy to interact and socialize with patients and families. Observations on the medical-surgical units also revealed that patient doors were often closed. Nurses valued patient privacy (the most common advantage mentioned about the private rooms), but closed doors meant nurses could not easily survey an area or patient, or casually say hello or engage in small talk with patients as they passed by—something nurses often did when patient doors were open or when patients ventured out of their rooms.</p>
<p>In interviews, nurses discussed the value of building a relationship with high-acuity, long-term patients, of knowing the details about patients’ social contacts, family values, and daily routines. They indicated that this knowledge provided a foundation to successfully bridge the cultures of medicine and caring. An interaction observed during a go-along illustrates the importance of spontaneous interactions with patients. The nurse expressed admiration toward a patient as he was walking laps around the unit. She asked him how many laps he had done and responded with encouragement as he continued on his way. Once the patient was around the corner, she mentioned to the researcher how much improvement he had shown in the previous few days. In this brief encounter, the nurse was able to connect to the patient and gain relevant information about his routine and recovery. Nurses reported how important this information was for them to do their job well and also how difficult it was to learn in this environment, where nurses and patients were more isolated. Another nurse touched on these issues when she described a perfect day at the hospital:
<disp-quote>
<p>A perfect day would include plenty of time to actually sit down and hang out [spend time] with the patient and family members, discussing the medical needs, changes, and goals for their loved one. As the days progress in this perfect world, the relationship between the family members and the staff would be healthy and fruitful, with all of our needs being met.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In general, the nurses we interviewed described their relationships with patients as less personal in the new space, and spending less time with patients made the nurses feel less like nurses.</p>
<p>In addition, several nurses commented that patients, in the new environment, showed less appreciation and value for the clinical work nurses performed. One nurse contrasted the semiprivate rooms in the old hospital to the new setup:
<disp-quote>
<p>Just by virtue of the semiprivate rooms and seeing how much you had to really work, handling two patients . . . seeing how much you have to round, giving meds [medications], doing tasks, cleaning, ambulating, whatnot, they appreciated your workload. Here, I feel like our workload is totally unappreciated because the doors are closed. They don’t see how much we’re walking around.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Some nurses also commented that, since the adoption of customer service policies and evaluations, patients had become “more entitled” and “more demanding.” In these ways, nurses expressed a fear that current priorities stood in contrast to their understanding of their relationships with patients, one in which physically close and intimate interactions facilitated their role in bridging caring and medicine.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1049732312458180">
<title>Sociality of Nursing</title>
<p>Finally, the nurses we interviewed described that the patient-centered environment significantly changed the ways in which staff related to each other, both personally and professionally. The layout altered workflow to the extent that nurses perceived that their inter- and intraprofessional relationships were compromised. The physical space—the rounded hallways, the distance between staff areas and patient rooms, and the lack of space and conference areas for staff to congregate—meant that staff were dispersed and rarely saw or ran into one another spontaneously. On several occasions, the researcher stood at a nursing station for up to 30 minutes without seeing clinical staff, and during go-alongs nurses spent a noticeable portion of time searching for other staff. When nurses needed someone to double check their work or act as a witness, they often could not easily find someone. For instance, when nurses were in isolation rooms and needed assistance, they might peer outside the room to see if they could flag someone down, but often eventually removed their gown and gloves to leave the room to find help. They made jokes in the break room that they did not know another nurse was working that shift, only to learn that the nurse was assigned to patients on the other side of the unit. One nurse, comparing the new building with the previous one, commented that there was “more of a family-unit feel” in the old hospital. She remarked,
<disp-quote>
<p>You could be having a crazy day and see other fellow staff members in the hall, and it was so nice: “Oh hey, how ya doin’?” We all knew each other a lot better, and that’s helpful, especially when we all have to work together. And the same thing for families or anybody who needs assistance. I’d be able to see or she’d be able to see. But there’s a lot more, uh, independence now, which is not good.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The majority of nurses reported feeling lonely, sad, and isolated as a consequence of not seeing their peers, or because they felt the unit lacked cohesiveness or camaraderie.</p>
<p>Nurses believed that the strain in communication, resulting from less contact with colleagues, impacted teamwork and clinical care. Several nurses noted that not having solid personal relationships with coworkers might affect professional tasks because staff were less willing or less likely to reach out to others for assistance, or had a harder time communicating candidly with coworkers whom they did not know well. One area described as particularly impacted by lack of face-to-face communication was coordination of care:
<disp-quote>
<p>To be able to communicate in person, that makes a big difference. You know, if you have a patient that is not doing well and I wanted to page a doctor, if he’s not or she’s not available or busy, they don’t call me right away. Sometimes I have to page them again. But versus the old hospital that, you know, the intern was there. I could just grab her or go to [a] resident. We knew each other face to face, but now we don’t.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Overall, nurses reported that professional tasks and camaraderie were compromised because staff were not visible to each other.</p>
<p>Nurses reported enduring a considerable amount of emotional labor worrying about not having adequate support from other staff. One nurse commented that as a result of the distances nurses had to travel to access each other, they were “less willing to stick [their] neck out,” because it was “at the risk of [their] own patient’s safety.” Nurses reported that not having “someone watch your back” and not being able to offer help to colleagues caused anxiety. They perceived sociality as critical to both the medical and humanistic aspects of nursing work. Consequently, nurses in this environment were distressed because they perceived that the interpersonal, cooperative culture that they valued was weakening.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1049732312458180">
<title>Foregrounding of Resiliency and Sacrifice</title>
<p>Although most nurses expressed concerns about the work space, they almost as commonly articulated a distinct sentiment: the centrality of resiliency and sacrifice to their work and identity as nurses. Nurses’ sentiments exposing the role of resiliency in nursing work were an unanticipated discovery. Interviews did not explicitly address resiliency; it is thus an underdeveloped area in our findings and in need of further research. Nevertheless, responses expressing such themes were so prevalent that a preliminary discussion of the role of resiliency in nursing seems warranted.</p>
<p>Many nurses we interviewed expressed dissatisfaction with the restructuring changes, but most also accepted that being adaptable was part of their job. One nurse said of the new environment, “I just don’t like it. . . . Oh, I’ve adjusted, we’ve all adjusted. You know, you just adjust to what’s going on. But it’s just so hard.” Nurses expressed strong certainty in their ability to adapt to the challenges, as well as hopelessness that alternatives existed to overcoming them: “We’ll make it happen. We always make things work. But it’s sad because we always have to compromise.” Another nurse remarked, “But you know what? You can make anything work. We make it work. It’s hard on you, but you make it work. What can you do? You’ve got to make it work.” Echoing sentiments expressed by nurses in other studies of restructuring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732312458180">Blythe et al., 2001</xref>), nurses reported feelings of resentment, abandonment, and neglect as a result of not being considered in the design decisions and because of experiencing less recognition despite the increase in effort they exerted to “make it work.” One nurse commented dishearteningly, “They don’t care about nurses here. That’s the bottom line.”</p>
<p>Despite such feelings of resentment, nurses expected that they should be the ones to adjust and sacrifice. Some nurses and nurse managers explicitly mentioned resiliency as a positive and required quality of the nursing staff, like a charge nurse, who summarized the implications of the challenges that she described earlier in the interview: “I would say the points that we mentioned are not super, super bad or detrimental to patient care. So that’s one thing about staff; they’re resilient, and we can adjust to whatever the situation may be.” Although nurses often expressed dismay that it was nurses’ responsibility to overcome a range of challenges, they also expressed pride in their unique ability to adapt so as to maintain high standards of patient care.</p>
<p>Similarly, several nurses commented that it was the nurse’s responsibility to be the “glue” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732312458180">Gugerty, 2007</xref>) that holds everything together: the nurse does the things that others assume will happen “automatically.” When asked what was important for nursing work in this environment, one nurse responded,
<disp-quote>
<p>It’s got to be the nurse that can be really proactive. . . . Looking through [a patient’s] admission assessment, “Oh, I see you’re Catholic. Do you want the priest to come by and give you a blessing? Do you have any questions? Do you need disability paperwork?” It’s the nurse that says all this; it doesn’t automatically happen. You’ve got to have a proactive nurse that can help fit it all together, and that’s not always done.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In other words, the nurse works hard at the task of building the bridge between the medical care and the care of the whole patient. In pursuing this work, she faces challenges, including those posed by the physical environment. These two discourses—one conveying difficulty and struggle, the other conveying success and adaptability—reveal nurses’ beliefs about what was required to be a “good nurse”: perseverance and the ability to overcome hardship in the service of an individual in treatment. Many of the nurses we interviewed articulated this fundamental conception of the nursing role quite clearly, and it seemed to serve to bolster their morale, even as they perceived it to be threatened.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1049732312458180">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>As a result of the shift in visible and invisible work following this patient-centered restructuring, nurses we interviewed perceived their jobs as more difficult in ways that directly challenged nurse identity. The restructuring made visible the work of customer service while obscuring the medical and caring work that nurses saw as crucial to their role. Additionally, nurses perceived the social work required to effectively fulfill that role to be challenged. They had to work around the inconveniences of the space and policies (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1049732312458180">Laing, 2002</xref>), and sensed the human element of patient care to be minimized. They felt their personal and professional relationships with colleagues to be strained and believed that this impeded teamwork and coordination. Consequently, they perceived the nursing values of medicine and caring, and their role to bridge these realms, to be undermined by the patient-centered environment. From their perspective, this patient-centered restructuring resulted in nurses walking more, spending less time at the bedside, having less face-to-face contact with patients and coworkers, having more phone interruptions, performing more service tasks, and experiencing feelings of loneliness, resentment, and neglect (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732312458180">Blythe et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Nurses’ concerns did lead to some changes in hospital policies. Before the move, administrators and nursing leaders had anticipated some of these concerns (i.e., more walking, more time on the phone). Nurse team leaders who heard these concerns regularly believed the concerns to be important and felt they might have long-term consequences. Administrators were generally aware of the concerns and made some efforts to respond. For instance, in response to nurses’ complaints of isolation, administrators converted a public lobby area into a space for nurses to socialize. In response to nurses’ concerns about coordinating care, units instituted strategies (e.g., new rounding schedules) to improve communication. The hospital implemented several targeted efforts (e.g., changes to the alarm systems) to cope with the decreased visibility of both patients and staff on the units.</p>
<p>Finally, administration provided nurses on most units with resources to pursue quality improvement activities and, on many units, nursing staff developed strategies to care for one another or improve morale. Nurses we interviewed generated a small number of additional suggestions for improving their work, including hiring more support staff, delivering medications directly to patient rooms, and placing coffee and snacks in an open location so visitors could access these themselves. Overall, these nurses were pessimistic that these solutions could be implemented. It might be that the generally positive feedback administrators and decision makers received from structured surveys enabled them to maintain some administrative distance from the pervasive day-to-day concerns of nurses.</p>
<p>In this article, we have presented a single case of patient-centered restructuring that seemed particularly customer service oriented. Several limitations to the interpretation of our findings deserve note. First, we have not included data describing patients’ experiences. These might impact how one would consider the relevance of nurses’ concerns. For instance, nurses perceived that patients were less aware of the number of tasks they juggled; data from patients might indicate that this is not the case. In addition, nurses we interviewed defined certain tasks as directly relevant to caring (e.g., identifying the patient’s religious affiliation and responding with a referral) and others as less relevant (e.g., bringing coffee and chairs). Yet patients might perceive tasks that nurses believed to be less relevant as genuine caring tasks that bring them closer to the nurse. In short, nurses’ understanding of the value of their various tasks to patients might be limited. Nevertheless, we aimed here to detail nurses’ own views of their work and professional identities, not patients’ preferences for nurses’ roles.</p>
<p>Finally, we have described the impact of this patient- centered redesign in one context only. These same redesign principles might impact nurses’ experiences differently in other contexts as a result of factors we did not measure, such as the level of nursing support staff. Nonetheless, the literature suggests that the challenges we identified in this patient-centered hospital were not unique.</p>
<p>Multiple authors have described nurses’ enduring struggles with defining their work and highlighting its true value. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1049732312458180">Star and Strauss’ (1999)</xref> concept of articulation work emphasized that much of nursing work is invisible and thus garners little priority. To encourage the appreciation of this work, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1049732312458180">Wolf (1989)</xref> argued that nurses “should make [their] hidden work noticeable, more explicit, so that the public’s regard of the work is closer to [the] clinical reality” (p. 463; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049732312458180">Hamilton &amp; Manias, 2007</xref>). However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1049732312458180">McWilliam and Wong (1994)</xref> claimed that nurses themselves often devalue articulation work that does not directly involve patient care, which is “the profession’s raison d’etre” (p. 160). They argued that for others to understand the value of work indirectly impacting patient care, nurses first must recognize and value such work themselves. It is significant, however, that in the context we examined, both spatial organization and hospital policies hid a large number of nurses’ tasks from view. In particular, the concept of patient centeredness was invoked to hide the technical and medical tasks of patient care as well as the work of caring that nurses most closely associated with their professional identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1049732312458180">Malone, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The findings suggest that some patient-centered redesigns could pose particular challenges to nurses’ status and professional roles. Just as much as job security and compensation, employees desire work that they find interesting, that elicits recognition, and that fosters feelings of accomplishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1049732312458180">Wiley &amp; Kowske, 2012</xref>). Nurses in this study indicated that their priority was to forge a bridge between caring and medicine. However, this mission was challenged in this context where customer service work was perceived to be valued instead of caring work and—at times—at the expense of medical work. Nurses articulated some of the same resentments expressed by service workers, who grow dissatisfied trying to appease ambiguous expectations from customers who might be demanding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732312458180">Dollard, Dormann, Boyd, Winefield, &amp; Winefield, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1049732312458180">Rosenthal, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>In this environment, adoption of a customer service orientation of patient centeredness seemed to prove particularly harmful to nurses’ sense of professional identity. Nonetheless, most nurses remained highly committed to maintaining their standards of medical and caring tasks, and many invoked the notion of resiliency as a critical ingredient for the successful completion of this nursing work. Many nurses described themselves as unhappy but able to persevere in the service of this larger cause. Perhaps more than the practical workarounds of skipping steps in customer service protocols and storing supplies in nondesignated areas, the psychological processes nurses underwent to define nursing identity and its relationship to patient care was what enabled them to persevere. Thus, the workability of the environment we studied rests in part on nurses’ identification with this resilient identity, even as they perceived that other aspects of their professional role were under siege. These findings and the others presented here warrant further empirical study in other contexts.</p>
<p>As described above, we solicited feedback on our analysis of the data at various stages. Nurses’ and nurse managers’ feedback on earlier drafts of this article ranged from general to fervent agreement. However, some hospital administrators expressed discomfort with the suggestion that the patient-centered orientation might have negative consequences. Although administrators acknowledged nurses’ difficulties, these were attributed to the physical space only. As authors, we understand this concern to be consistent with responses from many of the nurses we interviewed, who also stressed that, despite the challenges they faced, they supported prioritizing patients. Such responses show the strong motivation of hospital staff to preserve the mission of patient centeredness and to isolate the difficulties encountered in implementing it, such as by considering them to be idiosyncratic or by posing them as surmountable. However, many of the customer service protocols and the choices about physical space allocation that many nurses found difficult were a direct result of efforts to prioritize the patient experience. Thus, in this context, patient centeredness was more than a guiding mission; it was a set of localized practices that had real consequences for nurses.</p>
<p>These findings indicate that the challenge of defining and implementing patient-centered practices remains significant. Because patient centeredness as a concept promotes knowing and understanding a patient as an individual with a life context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049732312458180">Balint, 1969</xref>), the adoption of patient-centered features in hospitals, in theory, should create a space that aligns with nursing values. Nurses’ relationship to the patient is central to their work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732312458180">Chambliss, 1996</xref>) and requires not only spatial but temporal proximity to patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1049732312458180">Malone, 2003</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1049732312458180">Tanner et al. (1993)</xref> distinguished physical proximity necessary for nurses to be close to bodies and thus accomplish medical work, and narrative proximity necessary for understanding the patient as a person and thus accomplish caring work. However, some patient-centered designs and policies might diminish the nursing role by impeding nurses’ physical/spatial and narrative/temporal proximity to patients.</p>
<p>Some notions of patient-centered care, such as that described by Coile (1995, as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1049732312458180">Rundall et al. 1998</xref>), are intended to increase the percentage of time nurses spend with patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049732312458180">Hendrickson, Doddato, &amp; Kover, 1990</xref>). In these conceptualizations, the nurse is a central part of how patient centeredness is defined. However, if patient centeredness comes to mean attention to patient comfort and satisfaction and a prioritization of the clinician as an agent of customer service, our findings suggest a range of potential challenges to nursing identity, morale, cameraderie, and work quality that need to be considered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732312458180">Black et al., 2008</xref>). Instead, approaches that define and implement patient centeredness as an issue of both staff and patient well-being could allow the articulation work required for effective medical care to come to the fore (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049732312458180">France et al., 2005</xref>).</p>

<p>Patient-centered restructuring was defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1049732312458180">Redman and Jones (1998)</xref> as “the decentralization of an extensive variety of unit support and patient care services” that “are designed from the perspective of patient needs and work flow” (p. 47). Although nurses have been found to respond positively to patient-centered restructuring, Redman and Jones found that patient-centered models of care presented challenges for nurse managers.</p>

<p>The concepts of “care” and “cure” have frequently been viewed as being in opposition; however, the perceived gap between these two concepts is “an oversimplified character” that nurses often do not perceive to exist in reality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732312458180">Gastmans, 1998</xref>, p. 239).</p>
