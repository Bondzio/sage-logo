<p><italic>Compadrazgo</italic>, “coparenthood,” is a traditional ritual fictive kinship system that provides a network of mutually supportive relationships in the Mexican American culture. A literature search of CINAHL, Medline, PsychoInfo, and Web of Science was used to identify peer-reviewed journals and original sources. Keywords included comadre, <italic>compadrazgo</italic>, fictive kin, social support, Mexican, and Mexican American. Additional resources were identified through a focused review of references. Findings from this study indicate knowledge about <italic>compadrazgo</italic>, is limited to the social organization, historical practices, and a preliminary description of the compadres role. Minimal information is available about the relationship between <italic>compadrazgo</italic>, and health, and variations in roles and responsibilities of <italic>compadrazgo</italic>, participants. Frequency of enactment of <italic>compadrazgo</italic>, responsibilities and barriers to the enactment of social support by compadres remain unknown. Variations in practice have not been explored. Nursing implication include the recommended ways that <italic>compadrazgo</italic>, can be encouraged or promoted in patient care.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Family members are frequently the first persons to be called on for social support during a health crisis. Kin are expected to be available to assist in the care of the young, sick and older members of the family. The typical interpretation of family in the United States is of members living under one roof, related by marriage or biology. Extended family includes grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins. In other cultures, family is defined differently, according to relationships, not biology or marriage.</p>
<p>Kin relationships formed outside of biological family or marital ties are called fictive kin ties and can be as important as blood relationships or marriages. Many cultures develop ritual fictive kinships with a variety of terminology used to describe the significance of the relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1043659611433870">Chatters, Taylor, &amp; Jayakody, 1994</xref>). The Hispanic culture has practiced a traditional ritual fictive kinship system called <italic>compadrazgo</italic> (coparenthood) for many centuries that is rich with symbolic commitments and traditional practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1043659611433870">Ebaugh &amp; Curry, 2000</xref>). Mexican American women cite female family and friends as the most important and consistent sources of social support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1043659611433870">Eggenberger, Grassley, &amp; Restrepo, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1043659611433870">Martinez-Schallmoser, Telleen, &amp; MacMullen, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1043659611433870">Padilla &amp; Villalobos, 2007</xref>). Among these individuals, comadres (godmothers) have been identified as family or fictive kin that provide this support through assistance with child care, household assistance, and general peer support for healthy behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1043659611433870">Kaòpua, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1043659611433870">Kana’iaupuni, Donato, Thompson-Colón, &amp; Stainback, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1043659611433870">López, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast to non-Hispanic Whites, who seek support from friends, associates and professionals, social support is provided almost exclusively through family for Mexican Americans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1043659611433870">Kaniasty &amp; Norris, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1043659611433870">Martinez-Schallmoser et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1043659611433870">Padilla &amp; Villalobos, 2007</xref>). The interpersonal relationships of comadrazgo are similar to that between family members and are bound by the same time rights and responsibilities as blood related family members. Therefore, compadres are important sources of familial social support.</p>
<p>Kin relationships are an integral part of Mexican American families. Close family units often include grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins. The cultural value of familism is evident when these extended relations command the same level of respect and reciprocity as the parent/child relationship. In non-Hispanic White families, the nuclear family unit is usually the parents and children. The extended relationships between aunts, uncles, grandparents, and cousins are considered family but may have a different level of support and expectation.</p>
<p>The beneficial effects of social support on physical and mental health have long been acknowledged by the scientific community. Individuals receiving ample social support experience few health problems and engage in more healthy behaviors. Mexican American families that provide support to each other tend to experience less socially destructive behavior, such as substance use, delinquency, and violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1043659611433870">Ramirez et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1043659611433870">Schultz, Roditti, &amp; Gillettel, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Mexican Americans account for 14% of the total U.S. population and are expected to reach 25% of the population by 2050 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1043659611433870">Fox &amp; Livingston, 2007</xref>). As the fastest growing ethnic group in the United States, it is imperative that nurses broaden their knowledge and understanding of the unique culture and experiences of this population to provide culturally competent care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1043659611433870">Douglas et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Professional nurses need specific knowledge about the cultural background of the patients they serve to plan and deliver culturally competent care. Nurse researchers must incorporate the concepts of cultural competence in their work to improve the body of knowledge about cultural competence. Nurse educators empower students with the ability to practice cultural competence by including content about the diversity of social relationships and their affect on health behaviors. The social relationships that exist through <italic>compadrazgo</italic> are essential to the cultural value of familism in the Mexican American community. By understanding the role of <italic>compadrazgo</italic>, kin relationships, and how that affects social support, nurses will be better equipped to deliver culturally competent care to Mexican Americans.</p>
<p>Although comadres are often named in nursing literature, the role, relationship, and expectations of the comadre relationship have not been examined. The purpose of this literature review is to provide a background examination of the historical roots of <italic>compadrazgo</italic> in Mexican American women. Current research findings and research implications related to the practice of <italic>compadrazgo</italic>, the social support provided by the comadre and effects on health are then discussed. This information will provide nurses with an understanding of the background of the comadre relationship, and the potential resource it provides for the promotion of social support in Mexican American women.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>For the purposes of this writing, the term Mexican American includes individuals born in either Mexico or the United States, and living a portion of time in the United States. A literature search of CINAHL, Medline, PsycINFO, and Web of Science was used to identify peer-reviewed journals and original sources. Keywords included comadre, <italic>compadrazgo</italic>, and Mexican or Mexican American. The first search retrieved few peer-reviewed articles so keywords were expanded to include fictive kin and social support. Historical accounts of <italic>compadrazgo</italic> were included. Additional resources were identified through a focused literature review.</p>

<title>Fictive Kinship</title>
<p>Fictive kin are found in many societies. Some religious orders have “brothers,” “sisters,” and “fathers,” who are not biologically related, but hold special relationships with each other. Gang members often refer to themselves as “brothers and sisters,” considering themselves a unique family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1043659611433870">Shaw, 2008</xref>). Nontraditional families that include alternative sexual orientations may use similar terms. Members of certain professional occupations, such as law enforcement, refer to the profession as a brotherhood. This terminology reinforces the symbolic importance of the tie, and the recognition of a shared commitment or obligation.</p>
<p>Fictive kin ties provide mutually supportive networks, promote a sense of belonging and community, and may impose social order in a group of people. They are voluntary ties that can be refused or disbanded, although there may be consequences associated with either outcome. As family members, fictive kin provide additional resources that may be called on in times of emergency, during celebrations, and for sharing daily life. When fictive kin are added to the family network, all members experience an increase in available resources and obligations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1043659611433870">
<title>Compadrazgo System</title>
<p>Ritual fictive kinship has been traced from Roman times to the present in anthropological treatises, with an emphasis on social organization and benefits to society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1043659611433870">Foster, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1043659611433870">Mintz &amp; Wolf, 1950</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1043659611433870">Nutini &amp; Bell, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1043659611433870">Redfield, 1934</xref>). <italic>compadrazgo</italic> is a system of ritual fictive kinship resulting in reciprocal relationships based in the cultural tradition of Latin America and Mexico dating to the Spanish conquest that is still practiced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1043659611433870">Kana’iaupuni et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1043659611433870">Killick, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1043659611433870">López, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1043659611433870">Mintz &amp; Wolf, 1950</xref>). The tradition has a unique terminology to describe the relationships. In Spanish, the terms <italic>compadres</italic> and <italic>padrinos</italic> refer collectively to both males and females. The term <italic>comadre</italic> describes the adult relationship formed between the mother and the woman asked to be the godmother to her child. The child calls the godmother—madrina and the godfather—padrino. The madrina calls the godchild—ahijado (male) and ahijada (female). Although not biological relatives, padrinos were considered chosen family with the same rights and obligations as biological family members.</p>
<p><italic>Compadrazgo</italic> was brought to Mexico by the conversion of the indigenous populations to Catholicism, which required Baptismal sponsorship in accordance with Roman Catholic doctrine. The sponsor’s role was to oversee the continued encouragement of the convert’s religious education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1043659611433870">Mintz &amp; Wolf, 1950</xref>). When the new convert was a child, the sponsor was expected to provide the child with resources the parents lacked. Educational opportunities, access to health care, connections to jobs, or social contacts for the parents were made available by sponsors. Special gifts were given to the child for birthdays, Christmas, and at other important times. The most important role of the sponsor was to provide a home for the child in the event of the parents’ death.</p>
<p>The selection of compadres was confined to a trusted and respected individual, a person with whom a relationship already existed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1043659611433870">Carlos, 1973</xref>). The earliest scholars believed stratified communities practiced vertical <italic>compadrazgo</italic> (a parent asked a wealthier, more powerful person to be a godparent) whereas egalitarian communities practiced horizontally structured <italic>compadrazgo</italic> (within the family lines;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1043659611433870">Mintz &amp; Wolf, 1950</xref>). Rural peasants in Mexico acquired compadres from the wealthier class, such as landowners, business owners, or political leaders. These individuals held the resources necessary to provide financial and physical security for the child’s parent.</p>
<p>Horizontally structured relationships occurred when the compadre was selected from the same social class or from within the biological family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1043659611433870">Carlos, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1043659611433870">Deshon, 1963</xref>). When families were newly formed, and kin ties were few, compadres ties were often formed outside of the biological family which increased the resources for the newly formed family. As the family matured and had more fictive kin ties, compadres choices were usually confined within the biological family. By keeping ties within the biological family, the number of outside obligations was reduced, since each <italic>compadrazgo</italic> tie required a commitment of energy, loyalty, and support from the compadres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1043659611433870">Foster, 1969</xref>).</p>

<title>Functions of Compadrazgo</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1043659611433870">Nutini (1984)</xref> described 31 occasions of <italic>compadrazgo</italic>, divided into sacramental, primary nonsacramental, and secondary nonsacramental categories from field studies conducted in rural Mexico. The sacramental occasions were Basptisms, First Communions, Confirmations (a symbolic continuation of the Baptism), weddings, and erections of a burial cross. The primary nonsacramental occasions were the traditional rites of passage for children (including school graduations, a girl’s 15th birthday, presentation of a 3-year-old child in Church), blessings of inanimate religious objects (including crosses, pictures, altars, priestly ornaments), and ceremonial events (cleansing of a sick person, coronation of Mary, bedding of Jesus at the church). The secondary nonsacramental events were for blessings of homes, vehicles, businesses, and mangers.</p>
<p>The emphasis on the padrino–ahijado relationship may have changed to the compadres–compares relationship when the social aspect became more important than the spiritual aspect of the relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1043659611433870">Nutini, 1984</xref>). The question of whether the relationships initiated for the nonsacramental events held the same honor and responsibility as the sacramental occasions of <italic>compadrazgo</italic> was not clearly answered in the literature. However, the early scholars agreed the formation of any <italic>compadrazgo</italic> relationships resulted in stronger and larger social networks and contributed to social order (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1043659611433870">Foster, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1043659611433870">Nutini &amp; Bell, 1980</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1043659611433870">Kemper (1982)</xref> identified fewer occasions of <italic>compadrazgo</italic> in his review of 21 case studies conducted in Mexico. He termed the religious <italic>compadrazgo</italic> events as spiritual types and emphasized these were the most important and enduring relationships. The secular events, such as the 15th birthday celebration, graduations, and various blessings, occurred primarily in urban areas of Mexico. The extension of <italic>compadrazgo</italic> relationships to all of these events illustrates the adaptive nature of the tradition as it evolved to meet the needs of the participants. The spiritual types were practiced more frequently than the secular types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1043659611433870">Kemper, 1982</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1043659611433870">
<title>Interpersonal Relationships</title>
<p>In sacramental types of <italic>compadrazgo</italic>, the role of the compadres was first and foremost to be the second parent to the child. Over time the shared relationship between the compadres eventually became most important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1043659611433870">Nutini, 1984</xref>). Compadres treated each other with respect, trust, significant formality, and avoided friction. Any friction in the relationship was considered a serious risk to social stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1043659611433870">Foster, 1969</xref>). The polite <italic>Usted</italic> was used as a greeting between compadres even for family members. Compadres expected each other to provide support when needed without consideration of refusal or whether the shared resource would be returned. Financial and physical resources were shared between families, such as child care, household items, money, food, and jobs. Each participant gained a stronger network of resources, which resulted in a more secure and stable society. In addition to the social network gained by the individual participants, society as a whole benefited from the social expectation of assistance being readily available, the minimization of conflict, and the development of social stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1043659611433870">Foster, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1043659611433870">Nutini, 1984</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section8-1043659611433870">
<title>Current Research on Compadrazgo</title>
<p>Research on the benefits of compadres relationship has been limited to role expectations, general physical and mental well-being, family functioning, and socioeconomic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1043659611433870">Kana’iaupuni et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1043659611433870">López, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1043659611433870">O’Connor, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1043659611433870">Rayle, Sand, Brucato, &amp; Ortega, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1043659611433870">Vidal, 1988</xref>). Although not specifically identified as compadres, ample research has been found to show that fictive kin provide emotional and tangible support for new immigrants, mothers of young children, children of alcoholic parents, elderly persons, and women seeking breast cancer screening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1043659611433870">Balaji et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1043659611433870">Ebaugh &amp; Curry, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1043659611433870">Hall, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1043659611433870">Kaòpua, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1043659611433870">Tejeda, Thompson, Coronado, &amp; Martin, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Compadre’s role expectations were explored with Puerto Rican godparents in New York and with Mexican American women in California (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1043659611433870">López, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1043659611433870">Vidal, 1988</xref>). Puerto Rican godparents agreed their primary role was to provide a home for the child in case of the parents’ death, and the majority stated they would follow through with that role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1043659611433870">Vidal, 1988</xref>). Among the Mexican American women, fewer considered themselves ready and able to provide a home for the godchild (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1043659611433870">López, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Physical and emotional well-being improved for at-risk immigrant Mexican American women when the concept of <italic>compadrazgo</italic> was used in a pilot study to increase social support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1043659611433870">Rayle et al., 2006</xref>). Women adapted easily to considering group members as comadres, and they shared their concerns about abusive husbands, parenting, and issues related to racism. In a different study of social support, network size and child health in Mexico, mothers with more kin and comadre ties reported receiving significantly more emotional and financial support, and their children experienced better overall health than women with fewer ties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1043659611433870">Kana’iaupuni et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>Compadrazgo</italic> relationships improved working conditions for a group of mostly undocumented immigrant women when the comadres of two workers provided the only avenue to successfully negotiate a union contract with management. When workers experienced retribution from the management, the comadres provided emotional safety and informational resources to assist in legal battles and access to employment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1043659611433870">O’Connor, 1990</xref>).</p>

<title>Gaps in the Literature</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1043659611433870">Foster (1969)</xref> was the first researcher to suggest a full understanding of <italic>compadrazgo</italic> was limited by descriptions of the “ideal,” while knowledge of practiced <italic>compadrazgo</italic> behavior was minimal. Beyond the expectations of formality, respect and reciprocity, the comadre relationship has not been well described, although Mexican American men and women identify compadres and comadres as important providers of social support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1043659611433870">Kana’iaupuni et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1043659611433870">Kaniasty &amp; Norris, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1043659611433870">López, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1043659611433870">Martinez-Schallmoser, MacMullen, &amp; Telleen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1043659611433870">Menjivar, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1043659611433870">Tejeda et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Few researchers have examined the role of compadres or the frequency of enacted responsibilities among Mexican American men. This is an area that needs to be addressed, particularly since Mexican American machismo is frequently cited as a continued cultural value. The enactment of compadre responsibilities as a form of machismo may be an area of research that can be applied to the study of healthy families.</p>
<p>Sources of conflict between comadres have not been explored, although conflict has been alluded to in general terms in the historical literature. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1043659611433870">Carlos (1973)</xref> stated unanticipated or irreconcilable differences could sever the <italic>compadrazgo</italic> ties; however, what constituted these differences was not described. More recently, disrespectful behavior by the ahijado to the madrina, sexual relationships and marriage between fictive kin are considered taboo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1043659611433870">Ebaugh &amp; Curry, 2000</xref>). No other description of potential areas of conflict has been located in the literature.</p>

<title>Research Implications</title>
<p>Family consists of more than just biological or marital ties, and includes whomever the individual deems to be most important in life. Fictive kin, such as comadres, can make a contribution to overall well-being and health. Fictive kinship does provide additional social support that is known to buffer stress and may improve health.</p>
<p>This literature review showed a lack of resources available to nurses describing various fictive kinship patterns and the relationship to health and health behavior. The boundaries of interpersonal relationships between compadres remain unknown. Differences and similarities in the roles, responsibilities and expectations of compadre between men and women are unknown.</p>
<p><italic>Compadrazgo</italic> is an enacted form of the cultural value of familism in Mexican Americans that encourages the retention of traditional Mexican American cultural values. Respect for family and the expectation that help is available when needed enhance the provision of social support and positive social interactions within the family. Additional research is needed to explore the variability in the social support provided by compadres.</p>
<p>Little research has been conducted to examine the current practice of <italic>compadrazgo</italic> in the United States. Variations in practice may occur in different geographical areas of the country and among individuals of varying acculturation. These variations may indicate changes specific to U.S.-resident Mexican Americans, be related to specific blood-related <italic>compadrazgo</italic> ties, or be a result of unidentified factors. Whether encouragement of the tradition results in the continuation of traditional cultural values is also unknown. Throughout history changes in practice have not been recorded, which leaves a gap in being able to understand current practice in a modernized and industrialized society.</p>
<p>Ethnographic study would add valuable information about the practice variations of <italic>compadrazgo</italic>. Revisiting the issue of what is the ideal practice, and what is really done, is an important area needing study. The discrepancy between <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1043659611433870">López’s (1999)</xref> study and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1043659611433870">Vidal’s (1988)</xref> study shows that godparents may or may not be reliable caretakers of a godchild in need of a second home. Whether this can be attributed to the population differences or other factors is unknown. Some potential factors that affect the willingness or ability of the godparent to assume care of the godchild are economic or housing resources, acculturation level, and health condition. Barriers to caring for the child need to be examined and the child’s perception of the reliability of the godparents’ care when an emergency arises.</p>
<p>The effect of <italic>compadrazgo</italic> on physical and emotional well-being is underexplored. Robust studies are needed to identify effects of perceived and received social support provided by compadres. This will be a difficult area to tackle prior to developing a larger base of knowledge about overall practices. Prior to developing interventions to promote the inclusion of compadres in health care or encourage the adoption of fictive kin practices, research is needed to document the types of support delivered and the frequency of support provided by compadres, compared with the desired support.</p>

<sec id="section11-1043659611433870">
<title>Nursing Implications</title>
<p>Nurses are encouraged to include the practice of <italic>compadrazgo</italic> as a cultural strength for the care of Mexican American patients. Knowledge about this tradition can assist nurses in the development of culturally specific plans of care to support healthy behaviors in Mexican Americans. Compadres can be enlisted as providers of social support for Mexican American men and women with health problems.</p>
<p>Whether establishing key contacts for hospitalized individuals, encouraging patients to access available resources for health maintenance, or assessing social support networks for those coping with chronic and/or life-threatening illnesses, nurses need to know whom the patient regards as important family members. The fictive kinship system of <italic>compadrazgo</italic> provides emotional and instrumental support to participants. The individuality of family and kinship systems has not been included in nursing education. Rather than presuming that all members of a culture adhere to particular traditions, it is important to recognize that intragroup variability exists. Such awareness is critical to being able to plan individualized care. Nurses should incorporate knowledge of <italic>compadrazgo</italic> into cultural assessments by asking about fictive kin relationships. Nurses can remind Mexican Americans of the existing support system they have with compadres. By improving an understanding of the expectations, roles and responsibilities associated with kinship systems, nurses will be able to plan individualized care that encourages and promotes the continuation of the traditional family structure.</p>
<p>Nurses in pediatric settings can include compadres as important providers of social support for young Mexican American children experiencing health problems. They should be welcomed into acute care settings as family members. Compadres, who provide emotional support for the child’s parents, should be included as family members if a serious health problem affects a child. The compadre who provides unrequested emotional support at the time of illness or stress should be considered an asset and included in plans for taking care of the family. Parents of hospitalized children can depend on the compadres to assist them in caring for other children during a crisis when they are coping with another child’s hospitalization. Nurses in schools and primary care settings should be aware of compadres as valued family members. Compadres can provide instrumental support for children who are struggling in school or have families who are unable to meet their basic needs.</p>
<p>Cultural differences in the expectations associated with supporting the godchild, or the elderly madrina, need to be considered in context of what is the norm for the Mexican American culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1043659611433870">Vidal, 1988</xref>). Mexican Americans view kin relationships as the most important relationships in their lives and may place kin needs and goals above their own. An Anglo-American nurse may not view fictive kin relationships in the same light as the Mexican American woman. Nurses who are unfamiliar with <italic>compadrazgo</italic> may see compadres as being too involved in personal or family decisions during a health crisis. They may view compadres relationships as unhealthy or without appropriate boundaries when they do not understand the value of the relationship. On the contrary, the compadre who provides a significant amount of tangible support to a godchild should be considered a vital and respected member of the family network. Compadres who take godchildren into their home provide a nurturing environment that is an important emotional and tangible resource for families undergoing stress and difficulty. They should be recognized as a resource for a safe environment when parents are unable to provide it for their children.</p>
<p>The practice of <italic>compadrazgo</italic> encourages the retention of Mexican American cultural values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1043659611433870">Kana’iaupuni et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1043659611433870">Vidal, 1988</xref>). Mexican American families who practice <italic>compadrazgo</italic> may experience some protective effects related to traditional values that are as yet unidentified. Health benefits of <italic>compadrazgo</italic> have not been well identified. Comadres provide emotional and instrumental support to each other, yet the relationship of that support to health outcomes or healthy behaviors has not been explored. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1043659611433870">Kana’iaupuni et al., 2005</xref>). Nurses can encourage Mexican Americans to discuss the health effects of various behaviors, both health promoting and non-health promoting with compadres. This is especially relevant when planning for the long term health of children and family.</p>
<p>By asking multiple members of a family to describe their experiences, expectations, roles, and responsibilities associated with <italic>compadrazgo</italic>, additional aspects of the interpersonal relationships may become evident. Further analysis of the roles and boundaries may help determine the applicability of comadre relationships as a source of social support in a variety of health conditions.</p>

<title>Summary</title>
<p>Viewing the practice of <italic>compadrazgo</italic> as a cultural strength, nurses can include fictive kin relationships as sources of social support in the care of Mexican American women and their families. Tangible benefits are available from the social networks that comadres provide to each other. Improved health is associated with social support and fictive kin networks, such as comadres. As health care providers, nurses can support <italic>compadrazgo</italic> as a cultural strength and promote its practice as a mechanism for health promotion.</p>
<p>The relationships formed through <italic>compadrazgo</italic> provide an avenue for the study of social support in diverse populations. Family relationships and the definition of family will mirror the diversity of the population as the demographics of the United States continue to change. Nurse educators can include the subconcept of <italic>compadrazgo</italic> into the study of cultural values and family relationships. Nurses will need to be adept at communicating with diverse populations about a myriad of cultural beliefs and practices.</p>
<p>Assessment skills can be used when talking to family members about these beliefs and practices that may affect health. By including client traditions, nurses are more likely to provide culturally competent care.</p>
<p>Some researchers have proposed <italic>compadrazgo</italic> will diminish as Mexican American experience prolonged exposure to individualistic U.S. cultural values. Few researchers have explored the role of birthplace and acculturation on the practice of <italic>compadrazgo</italic>. Further research is needed to determine if acculturative changes result in changes in traditional practice. The retention of the traditional Mexican American values that encourage social support among family and fictive kin is poorly understood or documented. Nurse researchers have the opportunity to add to this body of knowledge as they examine the practice <italic>compadrazgo</italic> in Mexican Americans in the United States.</p>
