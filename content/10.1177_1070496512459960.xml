<abstract>
<p>This article argues that conservation agendas need to be informed by a landscape aesthetics that embraces the cultural and material richness of people’s relationship to place to better inform conservation agendas. Historical and contemporary views of landscape aesthetics and their relationship to nature conservation and notions of wilderness need to be included to complement a scientific expert assessment of conservation needs and approaches. Recent examples of conservation projects in Zanzibar are used to reveal how representations and symbols in nature are deeply embedded in biodiversity conservation aspirations and practices promoted by conservation experts. The article posits that an embodied and pluralistic approach to landscape aesthetics can more profoundly contextualize the specificity of interaction between people and between people and their environments and lead to more viable conservation and development outcomes. This would provide a contingent perspective that would to help elucidate nuanced understandings of social relations and place, thereby better serving both conservation and development agendas.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>This article discusses changing interpretations of landscape aesthetics to explore concepts of wilderness and its lingering relationship to contemporary biodiversity conservation practices. Before embarking on a detailed discussion of landscape aesthetics and its relationship to conservation it is worth reflecting on the problems that have beset the implementation of conservation in the Global South. The problems of designing just and effective conservation strategies have been discussed widely by scholars, practitioners, and activists. Of particular concern has been how to overcome the social justice problems of “fortress conservation,” which largely excluded and disadvantaged local populations, who were seen as a threat. Different models of community conservation have been presented as socially and politically acceptable responses to this dilemma; however, these approaches, despite their procommunity rhetoric, have achieved indifferent results in terms of both social and environmental outcomes.</p>
<p>This article begins with the assumption that there is a link between what we appreciate in nature<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1070496512459960">1</xref></sup> and the material benefits we expect to gain from land use or conservation. This relationship is rarely explicitly elaborated, and nearly always assumed; however, there is little doubt that the materiality of politics mediates the passage from perspective/appreciation to the formalized protection of valued “nature” objects. I will mainly focus this discussion around nature aesthetics and its relationship to biodiversity conservation. The central theoretical questions in pursuit of this then is, what should count as an appropriate appreciation of “nature” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1070496512459960">Rueger, 2007</xref>) and how has this perspective been applied to nature conservation? Or taken differently, what is a “legitimate” way of appreciating and conserving “nature”? Legitimate, both in the sense of what are the bases underpinning different constructions of nature and how do these different interpretations relate to contests over nature protection and use.</p>
<p>The discussion that follows draws out some historical and contemporary influences around the shifting notions of landscape aesthetics, wilderness, and power to generate insights into why the practice of conservation in Global South settings has been so problematic. Examples of conservation initiatives in Zanzibar are used to illustrate how ecological and wilderness notions of landscape aesthetics still influence contemporary conservation policy and land use. Finally, thoughts are discussed about how conservation policy and practice could be reformed, so it is better able to respond to changing local contexts.</p>

<sec id="section2-1070496512459960">
<title>Contested Views Over the Aesthetics of Nature</title>
<p>Although it is acknowledged that there are antecedent influences, this account of landscape aesthetics begins during the time spanning the romantic movement, industrial revolution, and colonial expansion, when the ideals of the enlightenment were perhaps at their most crude and powerful, but perhaps paradoxically, at their most vulnerable.</p>
<p>Artistic movements have historically been important to “resolving” the “problem” of how different landscapes are to be perceived. This view advocated that beautiful nature should look like art and could be ascertained using the same reasoning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1070496512459960">Rueger, 2007</xref>). This perspective, called “picturesque aesthetics” has encouraged “us” to look for or appreciate the scenically interesting or beautiful parts of nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1070496512459960">Saito, 1998</xref>). The picturesque aesthetic has received criticism for being inappropriate because it reifies and commodifies landscape as a two-dimensional scene ready for consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1070496512459960">van Eeden, 2004</xref>), or as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1070496512459960">Tuan (1989)</xref> puts it, as a surface-level reaction driven by sensory stimulation of agreeable forms and color or how they appear. In agreement, others argue that the scenic as a way of seeing or interpreting nature only offers a theoretically “thin” elaboration of aesthetics that does not explicitly elicit views about the underpinning basis of aesthetic judgments, whether they are values, knowledge, or ideological views. In agreement, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1070496512459960">Benediktsson (2007)</xref> contends that scenic approaches are simplistic and, problematically, exclude the embodied, materialistic, and everyday experience of landscape/nature.</p>
<p>Taking another perspective, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1070496512459960">Carlson (2004)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1070496512459960">Parsons (2002)</xref> argue that nature “should” be appreciated through a rational understanding of science and natural history and experience. This position gives central place to conservation scientists to decide the aesthetic (read ecological) worth of different landscapes. It is a normative position arguing that landscape appreciation should be informed by scientific (ecological/biodiversity) information about its constituent parts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1070496512459960">Parsons, 2002</xref>). In debates about ecological aesthetics, this is termed the “cognitive thesis.” It follows then that those who are ecologically literate (in a scientific sense) would be in an advantaged societal position to make aesthetic judgments about nature protection. According to the cognitive thesis, science offers the most “truthful” way of understanding nature. Important sociological and epistemological debates about socioeconomic and politicocultural forces that privilege scientific knowledge over other forms of knowledge are generally sidestepped in this discussion. Arguably (natural) science already dominates aesthetic conservation agendas as scenic values have been subsumed within biodiversity protection reasoning. Biodiversity protection has become the dominant argument for protecting nature exercised by powerful conservation organizations with global reach, such as WWF and Conservation International, among many others. An obvious question to ask, particularly in relation to developing countries is, “Whose aesthetics count?” This question is particularly relevant to explore in the context of Carlson’s scientific (only) arguments to interpret and inform nature aesthetics. This position excludes possibilities to value and draw on local culturally embedded knowledge and experience that are not considered to be scientific. Such contextual “knowledges” may take the form of lived participatory experience (and its offshoot, folk-biological knowledge) that has evolved from coping with a particular landscape—it is embodied knowledge. Given this, exclusion of the possibility of other landscape knowledge perspectives seems to be problematic on epistemological, social justice, and conservation grounds. Practically, incorporating local knowledges as well as forging equitable partnerships are strategies that are more likely to serve conservation interests by leading to better understandings of how to reduce conflicts by designing contextualized policies that would work to mitigate the material costs of conservation projects on local populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1070496512459960">Kabiri, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1070496512459960">Metcalfe &amp; Kepe, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Developing a substantive theory of aesthetics is deemed important by some in order to further our understanding of human/nature relations. To this end, the term <italic>ecological aesthetics</italic> has been developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1070496512459960">Carlson (2004)</xref> as a means to merge the irrational (or subjective) with the rational (objective), that is, the aesthetics of beauty with the rationality of science (biodiversity). This position has its roots in Leopold’s land ethic, which saw beauty in preserving the biotic community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1070496512459960">Baird, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1070496512459960">Callicott, 1989</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1070496512459960">Benediktsson (2007)</xref> argues, with social justice issues in mind, that some scholars have undervalued or not given adequate credence to the potential of a pluralistic aesthetics. This position posits that we should not privilege science (biodiversity) as a preferred or superior form of appreciating nature’s values but rather emphasize democratic processes of engagement among different knowledge perspectives to settle questions of nature conservation. This view is tolerant of different ways of appreciating nature and acknowledges the relationship between power and knowledge in terms of how some discourses are privileged over others. That said, some form of knowledge valuation involving political mediation is still required if the process is seeking to preference protection of one landscape over another. In a similar manner to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1070496512459960">Benediktsson (2007)</xref>, except without the emphasis on process, others such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1070496512459960">Berleant (1992)</xref> argue for a unifying approach that sees a “subjective beauty” and an “objective utility” combine to make up a perception that is formed by cultural knowledge (including scientific) and experience. Whose knowledge wins out where there is conflict? How are stand-offs over values and interests resolved except through political processes? In these situations trade-offs occur and it is more likely that power defines what is (more) acceptable as knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1070496512459960">Fletcher, 1992</xref>), thereby providing an unobtrusive means to shape and set expert-based conservation agendas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1070496512459960">Saunders, 2011</xref>). Alternatively, avoiding conservation interventions where habitats or species are threatened with extinction would not seem to be a reasonable or prudent approach either.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1070496512459960">Carlson (2004)</xref> sees <italic>ecological aesthetics</italic> or <italic>scientific cognitvism</italic> as a means to formalize and to make more tangible the link between aesthetics, nature, and science. Carlson’s central point is that the actual process of perceiving nature will be “enhanced” or at least transformed by having an “understanding of ‘natural’ processes.” Others, such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1070496512459960">Budd (2002)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1070496512459960">Brady (2002)</xref>, are quick to dismiss this argument. Budd questions the view that a deeper scientific understanding of nature, provided by biological or ecological knowledge, translates a priori to a deeper aesthetic understanding of nature. He argues that such knowledge may or may not aid or enhance aesthetic appreciation. Moreover, that one can still have a profound and “true” aesthetic experience with nature, while not fully appreciating the ecological processes and interactions that science tells us are underpinning them. Budd’s essential position that it is only knowledge that connects to an aesthetic experience is valid to consider, whether it be scientific or other types of knowledge.</p>
<p>Aesthetic views about nature are not views from nowhere. Nor are they apolitical. They are constructed by our particular emotional response and cultural/scientific knowledge, lived experience, mediated through our sensory experience and motivated by our interests. There appears to be common view that those who prefer a cognitive perception of nature inevitably privilege science as a superior form of knowledge production. Although as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1070496512459960">Parsons (2002)</xref> points out, separating cognition from emotion is problematic and probably illusory in terms of how we view landscapes.</p>
<p>Lived-in experience provides a “dwelling-in” view, which may be essential to understanding how landscape exists for those who live there (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1070496512459960">Ingold, 1993</xref>). This material culture perspective has several dimensions of importance, not least being that understanding how the production of this more socialized nature may be vital to furthering conservation concerns. “Natural” landscapes have been influenced and formed for thousands of years by the productive practices of their human inhabitants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1070496512459960">Berkes, Colding, &amp; Folke, 2000</xref>). Recent developments in “new” ecology suggest that some ecosystems valued by conservation biologists <italic>rely</italic> on ongoing human “disturbance” (usually through modes of production) to maintain their biodiversity and landscape qualities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1070496512459960">Leach &amp; Mearns, 1996</xref>). This view indicates that understanding historical and contemporary cultural and material relationships of landscapes is likely to be vital in informing their evolutionary potential and conservation requirements.</p>
<p>The discussion above suggests that landscapes are constituted differently depending on one’s vantage point (including experiences, “knowledges,” and interests) and that several perspectives may be important to realizing competing land use objectives. So there are contested and multiple layers of meaning attributed to landscapes that manifest as politicized agendas that lay claim to territorial representation and control or, alternatively, are just part of one’s everyday living experience. That is not say that landscape is merely discursive; undeniably, landscape possesses “real” physical qualities; however, constructions of it are mediated through social, cultural, economic, and political processes.</p>
<p>The scientific-only position denies or devalues the myriad other “lived-in” experiences and cultural “knowledges” that influence cognitive responses to nature and may even limit societal responses to conservation. Privileging of scientifically constructed aesthetic nature over other “knowledges” or emotional responses has already led to the privileging of aesthetic forms in nature as valued by science. In line with this claim, wilderness as scenic beauty has largely been aligned with, or subsumed by, biodiversity as idealized natural beauty. Science has largely informed this agenda, although as the next section discusses it also has deep roots in colonial expansion.</p>
<p>I have argued in this section that in some ways an ecological aesthetic has already overtaken scenic qualities as the predominant driver and rationale for appreciating and preserving nature. In this regard, science has played a vital, if at times limited, role in highlighting ecological concerns that threaten the viability of our collective future. However, the implications of application of scientifically constructed imperatives with their biophysical emphasis on “ecology” and biodiversity are technocratic and have generally been unable to deal with socioenvironmental issues or concerns or outright ignored them.</p>

<title>The Aesthetics of Wilderness: A Potted History</title>
<p>The concept of wilderness has historically played a central role in the discussion about nature aesthetics and conservation. It has philosophical, political, cultural, and social justice dimension that need to be discussed in order to ascertain its origins, complexity, and scope. Wilderness is commonly understood as “a place, which remains largely unmanaged and unmodified by human beings” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1070496512459960">Cafaro, 2001</xref>, p. 2) or as others put it, “an original state of nature” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1070496512459960">Bryant &amp; Goodman, 2004</xref>). Such places have been seen as a refuge from modernizing human activity.</p>
<p>During the 18th century, while picturesque aesthetics was being developed, a counteraesthetic that sought to value “wild nature” or a scenic wilderness was also being played out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1070496512459960">Nash, 1982</xref>). The stimulus for the idealization of wild nature (a.k.a. wilderness) is said to have been in response to the expansion of industrialization and the enclosure movement and their implications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1070496512459960">Draper, 2002</xref>). Somewhat paradoxically, the tools of modernization (particularly the institutions of science and politics) supported by the raison d’etre of instrumental rationality have provided the means enabling the domination and control of “nature” through regulated zones of “primeval nature.”</p>
<p>While these conditions gave birth to Western conceptions of wilderness some commentators have suggested that the concept of the “sublime”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1070496512459960">2</xref></sup> provided much of the conceptual basis of imperial discourses toward nature in Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1070496512459960">Wittenberg, 2004</xref>), where much of the tension between the enactment of wilderness and people has occurred over the past 200 years. This asserts that the “gaze” from the North selectively essentialized African landscapes (using keystones components such as charismatic mega-fauna) as sublime (understood as a powerful, majestic, almost fearful aesthetic experience; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1070496512459960">Ivanhoe, 2008</xref>). This had the effect of romanticizing those living “traditionally” as part of this nature in contrast to “rational,” modern, rural populations who were to be excluded. The following quote is taken from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1070496512459960">Wolmer (2005</xref>, p. 263; from Foreword to <italic>The Low Veld</italic>, Col. J. Stevenson Hamilton; Cassell, 1929) characterizes this romanticized, sublime perception:
<disp-quote>
<p>The lowveld came to be valued as a particularly authentic, unalienated wilderness experience. General Smuts epitomised this romanticised, sublime, even sexualised, perception when he wrote: Wild Africa makes a very subtle appeal to our emotions, and fortunately for us much of Africa remains wild. Civilization has barely touched it at a few selected points, and in the course of the ages the contacts of Africa with civilization have never been permanent or long-lived. After a casual acquaintance with her sister continents she has always shaken herself free and returned to her wild ways. By turns gentle and soothing, hard and cruel, always baffling, mocking, and yet binding, the Spirit of the Wild is essentially feminine. Those who would successfully woo her must possess qualities of mind and body not given to all. Moral and physical weaknesses are sternly punished by her, and, like all else worthy of achievement, her conquest takes time and demands perseverance; but, once fairly won, she holds her successful suitor in thrall so fast that he remains her lover until he dies.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In the East African context it is conjectured that during colonial times (and perhaps even now) Europeans perceived much of the continent as a “lost Eden” where they could rediscover a harmony with nature perceived as no longer available in the despoiled metropolises of industrializing Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1070496512459960">Wolmer, 2005</xref>). It is argued that this imagery then motivated an emotional response to protect it for the purposes of the European imagination (as well as for the more material pursuits of hunting and colonial exploitation of course). The essentialism, inherent in this <italic>terra nullius</italic> view, lies in stark contrast to the productive, complex, and changing landscapes in which people had to live and use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1070496512459960">Draper, 2002</xref>). This imagery did not fit and could not fit the picturesque landscape of Europe,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1070496512459960">3</xref></sup> so one reaction was to frame it as the exotic “Other.” The reinforcing relationship highlighted here between the wilderness imagery of colonial Africa and aspects of colonial conservation and land use policies highlights the danger of embedding, in unequal power relations, abstract cultural concepts (such as “the sublime wilderness” in this case) that bear little or no relationship to the landscapes being invoked (such as the long-settled and productively used East African savanna). That said, the imaging of Africa as wilderness inevitably leading to preservationist initiatives should not be seen as a monolithic occurrence. As Wolmer notes, wilderness has either been seen as something to be tamed—transformed into the picturesque (conjured) or something to be revered and maintained in its subliminal awfulness (conserved). Either way skewed power relations were invoked through various means in pursuit of colonial ambitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1070496512459960">Kabiri, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Normatively, in a policy sense, wilderness is invoked by preservationist/ conservationists as means to secure wild nature (the sublime and premodern) and more recently biodiversity (the scientific or ecological) in protected areas that seek to formally exclude (selective) locally consumptive human activities. A WWF website excerpt concerning coastal East Africa promotes this message when its states, “Over the past 50 years, human activity has significantly altered this <italic>once pristine paradise</italic>” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1070496512459960">WWF, n.d</xref>.).</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the influence of the sublime, colonial landscapes were never seen as merely something for pleasurable contemplation. It has been suggested that landscape has acted as a metaphor through which colonial and national identities were constructed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1070496512459960">Brück, 2007</xref>)—certainly taming the wilderness (to conform to the picturesque) has been a very important part of building white national identity in places such as South Africa and Zimbabwe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1070496512459960">Alexander, McGregor, &amp; Ranger, 2000</xref>). To varying degrees, culturally, all things African were condemned as colonial powers sought to remake Africans in their own images (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1070496512459960">Boahen, 1987</xref>, p. 60).</p>
<p>Many of these “wild places” were conceived and “administered” at a distance by central, remote agencies consisting of colonial experts in forestry, irrigation, soil sciences, and wildlife; however, these measures were also introduced and enforced through the governance of indirect rule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1070496512459960">Neumann, 1998</xref>). In Tanzania, this necessitated the British concocting a tribal and legal system (Native Authorities) based on race and ethnicity to administer tasks across a wide range of functions, including aspects of forestry and wildlife management to enact social control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1070496512459960">Goldstein, 2005</xref>). Advocates of “peopleless” wilderness landscapes are by no means resigned to colonial history; they have also asserted their presence in relatively recent times. Bernard Grzimak, president of the Frankfurt Zoological Society in the 1960s and 1970s, emphasizes this view: “A National Park . . . must remain a primordial wilderness to be effective. No men, not even native ones, should live inside its borders” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1070496512459960">Adams &amp; McShane, 1992</xref>, p. xvi). It has been reiterated even more recently among parts of the “Back to the Barriers” movement (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1070496512459960">Hutton, Adams, &amp; Murombedzi, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1070496512459960">Comer (1997)</xref> advises that wilderness, in contemporary “deep ecology” discourse, is a nonhuman, extra-industrial, spiritual topography of humbling otherness, where biodiversity and the sacred coexist, and a reminder that humankind is not all-powerful. This view emphasizes the wild beauty and psychospiritual benefits of wilderness landscapes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1070496512459960">Trudgill, 2001</xref>). The deep ecology movement has been accused of being insensitive to current and past social justice concerns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1070496512459960">Bookchin, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1070496512459960">Guha, 1989</xref>). In the United States, Africa, Australia, and elsewhere advocates using the wilderness lever have been accused of erasure of the “first peoples” history in seeking to promote images that that exclude stories of how the “peopleless” landscapes were constructed and enacted through evictions and social control of settlement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1070496512459960">Sarkar, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>In trying to operationalize conceptions of wilderness, the “objective” definition offered above has temporal and spatial dimensions. In that, it infers wilderness exists in places where human occupation or activity has been “negligible” or even nonexistent. Much ambiguity exists about what is actually meant by this. Interpretations of wilderness range from particular places where no humans have ever existed, to where people have left the land “untrammeled,” to places devoid of modern mechanization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1070496512459960">Rolston, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1070496512459960">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1070496512459960">Sutter, 2009</xref>). Extreme conceptions of wilderness seems rather problematic given that human activity has had an impact throughout the world and has been integral to producing many if not all sociocultural landscapes that are now commonly regarded as wilderness (e.g., “firestick farming” in the woodlands of Australia). Furthermore, in such landscapes it is not uncommon for current conservation managers to (try and) simulate past sociocultural practices (often drawing on inadequate scientific understandings) to achieve desired “disturbance” regimes.</p>
<p>Acts of wilderness preservation may acknowledge past occupation or activity in a territory but may seek to “create” (note: not recreate) spaces (through wilderness practices) that meet the definition offered above by contemporary exclusion of undesired human presence (such as in the United States, Australia, and East Africa). This type of scenario has been problematized by commentators (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1070496512459960">Cronon, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1070496512459960">Guha, 1989</xref>) for viewing wilderness as more as a state of mind than any objective reality. Both historical and contemporary wilderness practices have been concerned with protecting nature from the destructive forces of modernization. Commentators like Guha and Cronan have argued, in pursuing this agenda, those affected by acts of wilderness practice have not been seen as environmentalists. If recognized at all by states, they have been viewed as marginal subjects, resisting the forces that promote the broader good. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1070496512459960">Sutter (2009)</xref> points out, this way of framing social contests over nature, aside from raising serious social justice concerns, removes the possibility of learning from “other” materially oriented environmental traditions. Sutter further argues that the formation of contemporary notions of wilderness were not rooted in principles of preservation, as argued by some other critics discussed above, but in the politics of pragmatism that sought to establish nature sanctuaries from excesses of a burgeoning consumer culture (read automobiles) in the United States in the interwar period. This alternative conceptualization of wilderness, which adopts a more pragmatic approach to concrete material realities (rather than a mere principled stance), has the potential to support a more contextualized approach to conservation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1070496512459960">Minteer, Corley, &amp; Manning, 2004</xref>). Although this is slowly being recognized with the rise of social conservation, arguably, notions of wilderness as spaces of primordial authenticity still pervade international conservation agendas.</p>

<title>The Contemporary Relationship Between Nature Aesthetics and Biodiversity Conservation</title>
<p>Biodiversity is the dominant scientific concept that captures the entire gamut of the biological hierarchy from molecules to ecosystems as well acting as a neologism to replace an entire lexicon of previously used terms such as “natural variety,” ecosystems, endangered species, and wilderness, among others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1070496512459960">Nieminen, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1070496512459960">Oksanen, 2004</xref>). It includes the diversity of all living organisms and their interactions. The scope of its ambit are so sweeping that applying positivistic methodologies to its measurement are fraught with problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1070496512459960">Brown, 1998</xref>). At its most basic, notions of biodiversity knowledge have a commonsense element in that we can all recognize different types of species (cat vs. dog) and even landscapes (tropical forest vs. desert; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1070496512459960">Oksanen, 2004</xref>). However, this elemental understanding does not enable us to access the underlying ecological processes at work in each type of landscape.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1070496512459960">Carlson (2004)</xref> suggests that we should harness “our” ecological knowledge to enhance our landscape aesthetics view. This line of argument seeks to increase the “legitimacy” or credibility of landscape aesthetics and thereby give greater power in the current political climate to influence public policy about land use. That is, we should use ecological (read) biodiversity knowledge to give (a) meaning to a landscape aesthetic experience. Arguably in contemporary conservation discourse, (visually oriented) landscape aesthetics has been largely marginalized; however, linking it to biodiversity (as it was linked previously to wilderness) would give its proponents the authority to more effectively participate in nature and conservation politics. The question of what would be an adequate level of knowledge to inform an aesthetic experience is fraught with problems. Ecological knowledge or appreciation of biodiversity values and processes is also to a degree place specific; for example, knowledge of tropical ecological systems does not necessarily enable a sound understanding of the workings of an ecosystem in sub arctic or arid dryland environments.</p>
<p>Much of the discussion in landscape studies is about connecting ecological knowledge to an appreciation of aesthetics, but the converse also occurs where visual devices devoid of explicit scientific content have been employed in support of conservation goals. All we have to do is think of the numerous images of endangered species or “unspoiled” nature (e.g., tropical forests) used as metonyms for biodiversity and wildness in conservation campaigns by NGOs, ecotourism advertisements, or in television documentaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1070496512459960">Foale &amp; Macintyre, 2005</xref>). Foale and Macintyre argue that such images invite us to escape the bleakness and drudgery of “our” everyday lives in the industrialized North and bath in an offer of untrammeled, pristine beauty. Preservation of the images becomes the paramount goal of some conservation projects. This certainly links pleasing unspoiled (by modernization) scenery with the hotspots of biodiversity (and thus conservation) such as tropical forests and coral reefs. Conservation NGOs frequently employ images of charismatic (usually cute, often juvenile) fauna (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1070496512459960">Garland, 2008</xref>). For instance, WWF’s panda is one of the foremost conservation symbols in the world. These symbols are used to emotively win public opinion and to mobilize resources for conservation practice. This strategy using a visual recipe has been used to engender emotional and aesthetic appeal for a range of different conservation objectives: in general (e.g., WWF’s Giant Panda—<italic>Ailuropoda melanoleuca</italic>), for a specific conservation project (such as the Dugong—<italic>Dugong dugon</italic>) at the Sanganeb Atoll and Dungonab Bay National Parks in the Red Sea of Sudan), and for a type of habitat (such as the large blue butterfly—<italic>Maculinea arion</italic>) in dryland grasslands in the United Kingdom.</p>

<title>Science and Representations in the Service of “New” Conservation in Zanzibar</title>
<p>The different perspectives about what landscape aesthetics entails provides pointers to various interests and power dynamics of those involved in conservation governance of resources in the tropics. Revealing the genealogy of the role of landscape aesthetics in creating images and enclosures of “wilderness” in colonial East Africa is illuminating when examining the influences involved in conservation efforts today in Zanzibar. This section takes up two examples, mangroves (tropical forests) and monkeys (charismatic species), to show how a rather “limited” landscape aesthetic conception is invoked either overtly or implicitly in the service of concrete conservation policy. Both of these “conservation objects have attracted social conservation projects” that accept the notion that conservation and development are mutually interdependent and must be linked in conservation planning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1070496512459960">Neumann, 1997</xref>). Despite this, local perspectives and interests have been still been largely marginalized and conservation goals jeopardized. As the previous discussion shows the lingering influence of wilderness perspectives and the predominance of biodiversity science as a arbiter of conservation values dominates the conservation agenda. The examples discussed below also consider how practical conservation tools could be used to forge more equitable relationships with locals that reflect a more embodied landscape aesthetic.</p>
<sec id="section6-1070496512459960">
<title>Mangrove Forests</title>
<p>The contemporary narrative underpinning Zanzibar’s forest management policy reflects the natural resource orthodoxy of the region: that dwindling forests are threatened by population growth linked to unsustainable, market-oriented forest resource use driven by poverty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1070496512459960">Abdalla &amp; Kitwana, 1997</xref>). Arguably, it is this narrative of “permanent deforestation” that drives conservation efforts, even though in Zanzibar <italic>clearance</italic> of mangroves (for land-use change), unlike in parts of Southeast Asia, does not appear to be an imminent threat in many situations; this is not to say that it has not occurred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1070496512459960">Masoud &amp; Wild, 2000</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1070496512459960">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Worldwide, mangroves play an important role in the polemics over tropical forest conservation and use. Terms frequently used to represent tropical forests are the <italic>lungs of the earth, fragile, biodiversity, vulnerable</italic>, and <italic>global heritage</italic>. These landscapes are frequently described as beautiful by advocates of protected area conservation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1070496512459960">Slater, 2004</xref>), as this following quote from the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1070496512459960">WWF-Global (n.d.)</xref> describes, “Much maligned as ‘smelly, swampy, mosquito-ridden places’, the true beauty and value of mangroves should not be overlooked.” Tropical forest images are aimed at Northern audiences and embedded in conservation narratives that are constructed to set up an exotic “other” outside of daily urban lives of many people in way that excludes the sociopolitical realities of such places (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1070496512459960">Stott, 1999</xref>). They also stress the uniqueness and vulnerability of these places making them ideal projects areas for conservation interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1070496512459960">Myers, Mittermeir, Mittermeir, da Fonseca, &amp; Kent, 2000</xref>). Zanzibar’s mangrove forests<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1070496512459960">5</xref></sup> have been identified as a part of a global “biodiversity hotspot” because of their high rates of endemism and imminent threats to habitat and fauna caused by high levels of poverty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1070496512459960">WWF-United States, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1070496512459960">Carlson’s (2004)</xref> ecological aesthetic views combined with images of the exotic “other” dominate our thinking in the North concerning mangroves. It is not only the North that has embraced the scientific view of landscape preservation; local elites, state conservation bureaucrats, and researchers are also keen to prioritize biodiversity conservation. This is not surprising given that conservation projects are largely driven by bureaucrats trained as foresters or natural resource manager as they are often closely connected to the development aspirations of the state. In this policy milieu, the environmental expert, as the bearer of scientific knowledge, is highly valued and influential, regardless of the emphasis given to local participation or development for that matter.</p>
<p>All mangrove forests in Zanzibar were declared Forest Reserves in 1965, subject to central control soon after the revolution. Prior to this, in the early 1950s, large mangrove areas were decreed Government Forest Reserves in an effort to exert colonial control over mangroves for tannin production. During this time people continued to use mangrove resources throughout Zanzibar. However, it was not until the promulgation of the Forest Management and Conservation Act (FMCA) in 1996 that mechanisms existed to formally enable locally oriented community-based management of natural resources (CBNRM) in Zanzibar. Since then, in the quest to conserve “biodiversity hotspots,” mangrove forests in Zanzibar have been prioritized for conservation by international NGOs (e.g., WWF), multilateral organizations, and government agencies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1070496512459960">6</xref></sup> Zanzibar has pursued participatory natural resource management reforms to attract international donors, facilitate personal interests of key actors in government, and attract foreign investment, especially in tourism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1070496512459960">Levine, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1070496512459960">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1070496512459960">Myers et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1070496512459960">Saunders, Mohammed, Jiddawi, Lundèn, &amp; Sjöling, 2010</xref>). These relations have been built up by sensitizing actors to accepted problematizations and solutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1070496512459960">Mosse &amp; Lewis, 2006</xref>),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1070496512459960">7</xref></sup> including the need for political and economic reform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1070496512459960">Saunders, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In Zanzibar, a mixed bag of state, private, and community-based conservation regulations softened by tourism development opportunities have been promoted as the solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1070496512459960">Levine, 2007</xref>). Despite this recent rhetoric of local democracy in Zanzibar forest policy, the bustle for positions as expert mediators of conservation interventions has resulted in set agendas trickling down for implementation on the ground, leaving little space for local history, voice, or knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1070496512459960">Saunders, 2011</xref>). What might be regarded as “embedded local knowledge” is often marginalized during these mostly technocratic interventions, which are usually regulated by expert-driven management plans, often incomprehensible to local populations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1070496512459960">8</xref></sup> Despite the emphasis on the role of experts, somewhat surprisingly mangrove conservation projects in Zanzibar have not always been informed by an adequate level of (technical) silvicultural knowledge to inform sustainable use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1070496512459960">Saunders et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, it is not unusual for conservation planners to adopt a view that CBNRM projects are apolitical, or rather, can be made apolitical through institutional intervention. This view is implicitly driven by the influence of common pool resource (CPR) theory in CBNRM institutional design. CPR theory is an influential institutional theory that in implementation commonly overlooks the social embeddedness of resource use and assumes that interventions can be driven by technical and managerial means alone without considering existing conditions, aspects of culture, or power struggles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1070496512459960">Nelson &amp; Agrawal, 2008</xref>). This approach characterized a failed CBNRM mangrove project at Kisakasaka, where planners, taking a largely technical view of the intervention, ignored fractious party political politics, which contributed to the demise of the project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1070496512459960">Saunders et al., 2010</xref>). This is not to say that conservation partnerships should not be forged with local communities, but that local politics linked to economic concerns over the effects of conservation must be handled by understanding how local cultural and material interests can be realistically and meaningfully connected to conservation interests. This would also mean that local environmental and economic contexts inform conservation projects rather than rolling out generic arguments linked to blueprint solutions.</p>
<p>The “taskscape” of people in situ using and seeking control of mangrove forests for cultural, subsistence, and commercial harvest uses (of their own choosing) would necessitate invoking a rather different aesthetic experience, say to that of a short-term visitor’s disembedded view from an eco-tourism-placed boardwalk or environmental NGO representative with a universal Southeast Asian–situated “mangrove as shrimp farm” discourse or the scientific forestry official who too readily diagnoses threats to biodiversity with population growth linked to unsustainable, market-oriented forest resource use driven by poverty. It is also not to say that in some areas charcoal production or more generally fuel-wood harvesting have not resulted in changed environments, but as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1070496512459960">Saunders et al. (2010)</xref> show through mapping mangrove forest cover over time, mangrove forest can grow back relatively quickly either through reforestation programs or natural regeneration.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1070496512459960">9</xref></sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1070496512459960">Struhsaker (1998)</xref> argues that what needs to be clarified here is whether the goals of management are directed at sustainable use or biodiversity conservation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1070496512459960">10</xref></sup> Although I am in agreement that there may be some merit in making this distinction, in doing so there should not be a denial of the coevolution of specific people and place interactions and how these synergies have produced the “biodiversity” or “resource” that is the target of conservation. It should also be acknowledged that the two concepts are inherently interrelated in practice, albeit that they may require different focuses.</p>
<p>Whereas in conservation discourse the value of mangrove “environmental services” are being increasingly valued in a market-based and abstracted way, particularly in the context of climate change,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1070496512459960">11</xref></sup> local people know and experience these environments in a profoundly different culturally rooted and material way. That said, using an environmental services approach is one means that has the potential to more fully capture the “global value” of nature conservation and, thereby, more adequately compensate locals for their conservation efforts. For some Zanzibaris, mangrove forests have always been material places of labor, resources, opportunity, ritual, and leisure. Mangrove forests are shadowy, dense, canopied environments that dynamically ebb and flow with the changing of tides. They are politicized and productive places that have been part of Zanzibar’s monsoonal trade in the Western Indian Ocean for millennia. These are the forests where clandestine dhows hid when the British were trying to regulate boat traffic and tax trade in 19th and early 20th century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1070496512459960">Gilbert, 2004</xref>). They are vibrant places teeming with interwoven life and resource opportunities that are part of peoples day-to-day social and material life. They continue to be a reservoir of renewable resources of valued building materials and fuel wood for subsistence use and local and regional trade (and in former times, tannins). They contain valued local herbal medicines, harbor juvenile fish, and provide habitat for tasty crabs sought after by the burgeoning Zanzibar tourist trade. These are not simply “natural” ecosystems with trees but landscapes occupied by peoples with diverse values and complex customary tenure arrangements using resources in multiple ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1070496512459960">Bauer, 2008</xref>). This eclectic range of relations to mangroves may not be readily recognizable by any one villager as a description of their everyday attachments to place, but it provides a richer insight into the cultural ecology of mangroves in Zanzibar than the conservation orthodoxy underpinned by technocratic institutionalism and lurking notions of pristine forests under ever-increasing threat. As discussed above, an environmental services approach that incorporates an embodied landscape aesthetic offers some promise to reveal a fuller suite of mangrove forest values (e.g., nontimber forest value of mangroves, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1070496512459960">Adhikari, Baig, &amp; Iftikhar, 2010</xref>). This would acknowledge a more embodied landscape aesthetic largely rooted in material concerns. Such an approach would need to meaningfully consider the contribution that mangrove ecosystems make to the incomes of different groups to ensure that trade-off for conservation at least reasonably considers equity and distribution concerns. Trade-off processes alone do not adequately consider the local politics of projects or the inertia of customary practice; therefore, institutional change, even with local involvement, still faces considerable hurdles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1070496512459960">Saunders, 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>Conservation, Tourism, and Monkeys</title>
<p>In conservation interventions, scientific knowledge has been accused of rendering highly political issues, such as claims about agricultural pests and restrictions on resource use as technical management issues that can be “made” devoid of politics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1070496512459960">Li, 2007</xref>). The aim is to transform embodied notions of aesthetics to biodiversity conservation awareness through better scientific understanding. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1070496512459960">Instone (2003)</xref> points out, this approach a priori assumes that locals lack the knowledge to guide “right behavior” and need incentives to steward nature in the “proper” way. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1070496512459960">Forsyth (2003)</xref> argues that such technocratic approaches disembed ecological knowledge from its historical, social, and political context.</p>
<p>Monkeys are inherently connected to images of tropical conservation. A key event that transformed the politics of the formation of Jozani Chawka Bay National Park in Zanzibar was how a conflict between local farmers and conservation interests was handled.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1070496512459960">12</xref></sup> The nub of this dispute was a claim by farmers for compensation because of crop damage caused by the protected red colobus monkey population, which is valued as a tourism attraction. The “resolution” of this long-standing dispute paved the way for the formation of Jozani Chawka Bay National Park (JCBNP). The Pete-Jozani village, which was at the center of the conflict, had already lost valued village land and resources in previous forestry enclosures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1070496512459960">Chachage, 2000</xref>), so distrust among local residents toward a proposed national park was tangible from the outset. A scientific study by Siex and Struhsaker carried out during the planning phase of the Jozani project refuted the link between red colobus monkey browsing and smaller yields from coconut trees (an important local agricultural crop). The article went well beyond reporting on a field study of the effect of monkey browsing on coconut trees to making strong policy and institutional recommendations related to the protection of the red colobus. Siex and Struhsaker’s findings were expanded even further in policy translation by the Department of Commercial Crops, Fruits and Forestry (DCCFF) to a position that red colobus monkeys do not harm farmers’ crops. The Jozani conservation planners made it clear that claims by farmers over crop damage were seen to be inseparable from strong vested interests and unfounded cultural beliefs, so local knowledge in this case was easily devalued as parochial and irrational (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1070496512459960">Saunders, 2011</xref>). Here, scientific knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1070496512459960">Siex &amp; Struhsaker, 1999</xref>) was seen to be reliable and interest-neutral, despite it being derived from a nonreplicated study with results that were clearly aligned with the researchers’ and powerful policy actors’ interests. The senior author of the aforementioned article is well known for advocating biodiversity conservation before local people’s interests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1070496512459960">Struhsaker, 1998</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1070496512459960">13</xref></sup> Perhaps a more reasonable policy response would have acknowledged the limitations of this one-off study. Such an approach would not have expediently translated the study’s findings into policy without further explorations of how local communities perceive and are materially affected by the red colobus monkeys. This is an example where local aesthetics, as viewed as knowledge derived from embodied material experiences, was devalued when it conflicted with scientific knowledge produced in the service of biodiversity conservation. In sum, despite the emphasis put on “valuing the local” in community conservation this conflict was swept aside when the Jozani conservation planners privileged scientific knowledge over local knowledge—in effect separating “local culture” from “local nature.” Incorporating local cultural aspects into conservation interventions does not necessarily mean privileging local material concerns, but it would mean that local embodied experiences and interests can be more fully integrated into conservation planning decisions. In situations like Jozani, this may mean recognizing, and being more cognizant of, the inequity of power relations when already poor farmers are “forced” to shoulder the burden of wildlife conservation when pitted against globalized discursive power of biodiversity conservation.</p>
<p>The richer landscape aesthetic that I am advocating is aligned loosely with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1070496512459960">Olwig’s (1996)</xref> substantive landscape and includes notions of history, attachment, social justice, productive practices, voice, exchange, and how these social phenomena dialectically interact with non-human nature. That is not to say that people’s everyday experiences of landscape <italic>should</italic> contain all of these aspects all of the time but to press home the point that appreciation leading to land-use planning needs to reflect the shifting relationships between people and place and not a reified nature or a power: knowledge<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1070496512459960">14</xref></sup> situated solely in (natural) science.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1070496512459960">15</xref></sup> These aspirations do not differ too much from the rhetoric of community conservation, although they do put more emphasis on embodied perspectives and interests rather than institutional design issues, which tend to dominate community conservation projects.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This article argues that a more productive, just, and arguably historically “truer” approach would continue to see humans as an essential part of nature. This would lead to an acknowledgment that perceptions of nature are influenced by the observer’s situated perspective; therefore, although large tracts of lowly populated nature exist, our relationship with it is culturally and politically mediated. That is not to say that biodiversity conservation is a worthless exercise that is always implemented hegemonically or repressively, but to advocate a perspective that provides a historical and contemporary human context, which would better serve both conservation and development agendas and enrich aesthetic experiences of “nature.” Separating knowledge from power—say science from politics in conservation agendas—is problematic as the red colobus example above shows. Colonial science and, to some extent, contemporary conservation biology demonstrate that ignoring the political and cultural dimensions of knowledge production can result in a chimera of neutrality that enables it to be “unproblematically” employed. That is to say, that power–knowledge relations in such projects can intertwine and act in tandem uncritically. In these situations “local knowledge” derived from context can easily be discredited as impartial if it conflicts with conservation goals. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1070496512459960">Agrawal (1995)</xref> argues perhaps the use of anthropological methods to weigh and value the differing logics and epistemologies of local “knowledges” could help “even up” the power politics of conservation interventions. To complement this, a landscape aesthetic that reveals historical context and that provides a platform for negotiation of pluralistic interests and perceptions would be well worth pursuing. Furthermore, an embodied landscape aesthetic ethic would complement and support valuation approaches that have the potential to capture a wider range of conservation costs that are invariably borne by local communities.</p>
<p>This endeavor could be given practical expression by engaging in approaches to conversation that take greater account of subgroup- and individual-level experiences of landscape and responses to it. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1070496512459960">Benediktsson’s (2007)</xref> proposal for a more democratic engagement among different knowledge/experience perspectives offers more inclusive possibilities for conservation practice. This view rejects the “objectivist” and technical notions of biodiversity science as the only legitimate paradigm to drive and inform conservation. The important challenge for conservation scientists and practitioners is to acknowledge the limitations of their own ethical, knowledge, and aesthetic preferences and interests. In this way there would be more possibilities in conservation practice to integrate the engaged and immediate experiences and connections of subcommunities and individuals that involve a wider range of cognitive, ethical, cultural, socioeconomic, and personal dimensions. This should include a role for social scientists, not just to socially engineer biodiversity conservation solutions but to help elucidate nuanced understandings of social relations and place and how these relations are shaped and constrained by multiscaled institutionalized interactions. Through such a process there would the potential to be more cognizant and reflective of the particularity and dynamism of the interconnectedness of place and people. In enacting the pluralistic process described above, a wider range of losses and gains associated with conservation projects would be revealed (e.g., through environmental valuation processes), thus supporting a recent call by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1070496512459960">McShane et al.’s (2011)</xref> for conservation to be more explicit and honest about the trade-offs inherent in conservation projects. This approach would not resolve all the hard choices, particularly with the uncertainty posed by localized climate change effects, but it would support greater opportunities to realize more just, adaptive, and effective conservation outcomes.</p>

<p>Although “the sublime” has proved to be a complex and mobile concept (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1070496512459960">Dickinson, 2007</xref>), some postcolonial writers have seen its colonial conception as a form of stability or closure that attempts to establish rational order over dark, immense, and threatening experiences. So in this view, landscapes on the frontier were not only exotic, dangerous, and wild but also represented racial difference and the threatening dangers of colonial otherness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1070496512459960">Wittenberg, 2004</xref>).</p>

<p>Early Australia colonial landscape paintings suspiciously reflected a rather green and lush idealized English woodlands, rather than the harsh, dry, and startlingly bright landscape of the more typical Australia.</p>

<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1070496512459960">Masoud and Wild (2000)</xref> describe, Zanzibar’s mangrove forests are largely intact, albeit overcut in some areas.</p>

<p>Zanzibar was recognized as a conservation hotspot because of its high rates of endemism and imminent threats to habitat and fauna seen to be caused by high levels of poverty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1070496512459960">Myers, Mittermeir, Mittermeir, da Fonseca, &amp; Kent, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1070496512459960">WWF-United States, 2003</xref>)</p>

<p>This is similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1070496512459960">Hajer’s (1995)</xref> concept of story lines that are used to impose a version of events as well as possible solutions to it on others—this includes allocating roles to actors in the storyline.

<p>This is a Foucauldian term that infers that knowledge is power and power is knowledge (the two concepts are inseparable), thereby questioning the objectivity of knowledge regardless of how it is produced (i.e., by scientific methods or not). This provides a starting point to excavate why some types of knowledge are favored (have achieved dominance) over others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1070496512459960">Foucault, 1980</xref>). The corollary of this view is that actors who have claims to truth through the legitimacy of their knowledge can exercise power in circumstances where these truth claims apply.</p>
