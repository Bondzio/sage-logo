<abstract>
<p>This study tested Construal Level Theory and examined social desirability and cultural differences as factors affecting blood donation intention across different time frames. Findings showed that individuals indicated stronger intentions for the distant future (one-year and no-time indication frames) than for the near future (one-week and three-month frames). The relationship between social desirability rating of blood donation and intention was positive and significant for the no-time indication frame, but it was not significant for the one-week time frame and the three-month time frame. Koreans and Americans did not differ in the relationship between social desirability and intentions across different time frames.</p>

<p>Intention to engage in a behavior can depend on how far in the future individuals consider acting on that behavior. For behaviors such as donating blood, individuals may not intend to do them today, but may plan for them at some time in the future. Among the many factors that can affect behavioral intentions, the current study focused on temporal distance, which refers to the time interval between the present and any time in the future when a behavior is supposed to occur. Construal Level Theory (CLT) posits that temporal distance affects the way individuals construe a behavior, and that the effect of temporal distance on the construal is reflected in behavioral choices and responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1359105311421048">Trope &amp; Liberman, 2003</xref>). Distant-future events and behaviors are represented abstractly on a high-level construal, whereas near-future events and behaviors are represented concretely and with details on a low-level construal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1359105311421048">Trope &amp; Liberman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1359105311421048">Trope, Liberman, &amp; Wakslak, 2007</xref>). Depending on whether individuals expect to engage in a behavior in the near future or distant future, the abstract or concrete aspects of each construal become salient, with different influences on individuals’ behavioral motivation over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1359105311421048">Trope &amp; Liberman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1359105311421048">Trope et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The current study tests CLT with regard to the effects of temporal distance on intentions to engage in socially desirable behaviors. Blood donation is an example of a socially desirable behavior as it has positive societal impacts, such as helping people in need. According to CLT, abstract features such as attitudes and social values (e.g. altruism, independence, freedom, and equality) are more likely to guide distant-future decisions, whereas near-future decisions are more likely to depend on situational conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1359105311421048">Trope &amp; Liberman, 2003</xref>). This study predicts that the farther into the future individuals plan socially desirable behaviors, their intentions to engage in those behaviors will strengthen as the abstract aspect (i.e., social desirability) becomes more salient over temporal distance.</p>

<title>Theoretical background</title>
<sec id="section2-1359105311421048">
<title>Construal level theory</title>
<p>According to CLT, temporal distance influences individual responses to future events by systematically changing the way they construe the events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1359105311421048">Trope &amp; Liberman, 2003</xref>). Constructing an event using high-level construals involves drawing the perceived essence, gist, or summary of the given information, while constructing an event using low-level construals involves descriptions using secondary and incidental features of events or objects. CLT postulates that near-future events are constructed with low-level construals, but distant-future events are constructed with high-level construals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1359105311421048">Liberman, Sagristano, &amp; Trope, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1359105311421048">Trope &amp; Liberman, 2003</xref>). For example, “reading a science fiction book” was explicated as “I broaden my horizons by reading a science fiction book”, when the activity pertained to a distant future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1359105311421048">Liberman &amp; Trope, 1998</xref>, p. 8). Conversely, the same activity was described as “I read a science fiction book by flipping pages”, when it was referring to a near-future event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1359105311421048">Liberman &amp; Trope, 1998</xref>, p. 8).</p>
<p>CLT has been used to examine future choices, evaluations, and perceptions, including changes in preference for tasks, purchases, or values over temporal distance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1359105311421048">Trope &amp; Liberman, 2000</xref>), choices over probabilistic tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1359105311421048">Todorov, Goren, &amp; Trope, 2007</xref>), negotiating styles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1359105311421048">Henderson, Trope, &amp; Carnevale, 2006</xref>), and activation of different selves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1359105311421048">Kivets &amp; Tyler, 2007</xref>). These studies reported that perception about an action is contextualized by psychological distance (i.e., temporal distance or probability level), meaning that favorability of low or high-level construal factors increases as their values become salient with psychological distance. For example, when examining the changes in preference on conducting main (high-level construal factor) and filler (low-level construal factor) tasks at the current time versus in the future, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1359105311421048">Trope and Liberman (2000)</xref> found that the attractiveness of these tasks changed over time because different features of tasks became salient depending on whether people planned to engage in them in the near or distant future.</p>

<title>CLT and behavioral intention toward a socially desirable behavior</title>
<p>Social desirability of a behavior can be a type of high-level construal that gets activated when individuals consider the behavior for the distant future. According to CLT, individuals are more likely to construe future activities with value-laden terms rather than value-neutral terms, and are also more likely to apply moral principles to distant than to near-future actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1359105311421048">Eyal, Liberman, &amp; Trope, 2008</xref>). The prediction of CLT and previous empirical findings in support of CLT indicate that the values reflected in high-level construals (e.g., the abstract and prosocial values such as morality, altruism, or benefit to others in need) will be considered more positive than the values reflected in low-level construals (e.g., the concrete and practical considerations such as efficiency, materialism, and convenience) when considered in the distant rather than near future (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1359105311421048">Eyal et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1359105311421048">Eyal, Sagristano, Trope, Liberman, &amp; Chaiken, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Reviews of blood donation literature characterize blood donation as a prosocial behavior benefiting others in need. The reviews surveyed factors affecting blood donation, such as altruism, moral norms, social pressure, fear, and convenience, just to name a few (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1359105311421048">Oswalt, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1359105311421048">Piliavin, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1359105311421048">Gillespie &amp; Hillyer, 2002</xref>). Among the various motivators or inhibitors, convenience of collection site and prosocial motivation such as altruism are the two most frequent reasons for blood donation; low self-efficacy, lifestyle barriers, amount of blood to be donated, and perceived inconvenience were commonly listed inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1359105311421048">Bednall &amp; Bove, in press</xref>). Thus, it seems reasonable to apply CLT to blood donation and consider social desirability as one type of high-level construal that represents an abstract and idealistic aspect of blood donation. As it is expected that socially desirable aspects of behaviors will become more prominent when individuals consider engaging in those behaviors in the far future instead of a closer future, the following hypotheses are advanced:</p>

<title>Blood donation in the US and Korea</title>
<p>Blood donation is a behavior that Easterners also view favorably and consider to be an act of altruistic people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1359105311421048">Tison, Liu, Ren, Nelson, &amp; Shan, 2007</xref>). Among Korean undergraduates, one common reason for donating blood is to help society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1359105311421048">Lim, Choi, &amp; Chung, 2005</xref>). But in both Korea and the US, the number of donors is still lower than ideal. Based on phone interviews with adults, aged 18 and older, a Gallup poll reported that 15% of American adults indicated to have given blood in the past 12 months and 27% of American 18- to 29-year-olds indicated to have given blood in the past 12 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1359105311421048">Saad, 2008</xref>). In Korea, 7.25% of eligible Koreans, aged 16 and older, had given blood in 2010, and donors in 16 to 29-year-old group comprise nearly 80% of the blood donors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1359105311421048">Korean Red Cross, 2010</xref>). Based on the data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1359105311421048">Statistics Korea (2006)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1359105311421048">Korean Red Cross (2010)</xref>, approximately 22% of Korean 16- to 29-year-olds are estimated to have given blood in 2010. The demographic trend that the rate of increase in the 65 years and older group exceeds that of the eligible donor population (aged 16–64) may put a greater challenge in the blood supply and demand in the future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1359105311421048">Benjamin &amp; Whitaker, 2011</xref>). Thus, it is important to understand motivators and inhibitors for donors and non-donors better. Prior research both in the US and Korea has focused on identifying factors associated with donation intentions and behaviors (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1359105311421048">Armitage &amp; Conner, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1359105311421048">Gillum &amp; Masters, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1359105311421048">Hong &amp; Park, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1359105311421048">Hong, Park, &amp; Song, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1359105311421048">Lee, Piliavin, &amp; Call, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1359105311421048">Lee et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1359105311421048">Nguyen, DeVita, Hirschler, &amp; Murphy, 2008</xref>). Yet to be examined is whether temporal distance can affect blood donation intention. Based on CLT, it can be expected that people may differently evaluate the weight of individual costs (i.e., low-level construal factors) against societal benefits (i.e., high-level construal factors) as they plan donations in the near or distant future. The current study proposes a research question to examine if the CLT predictions will hold cross-culturally.</p>

<sec id="section7-1359105311421048">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) and informed consent was obtained for voluntary participation. American participants completed the questionnaires in English; Korean participants completed the questionnaires in Korean. Because the survey should be equivalent in transferring the meanings of questionnaires, the original English questionnaires were first translated into Korean by a professional English-Korean translator who was not involved in this research. Then, the authors (who were fluent in both English and Korean) carefully checked the English and Korean versions. Participants received one of four versions of the survey (no time indication, one-week, three-month, and one-year time frames).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1359105311421048">
<title>Measurements</title>
<p>All the measures used a seven-point scale (1 = strongly disagree, 7 = strongly agree). Each variable was measured with multiple items and each participant’s scores on the items were averaged to create a single scale score for each variable.</p>
<sec id="section9-1359105311421048">
<title>Behavioral intentions</title>
<p>Behavioral intentions were measured with four items (Cronbach’s α = .97 in the US and .97 in Korea). The four items were “I will try to make myself available for blood donation about (one week/three months/one year/no time frame) from now”, “I intend to participate in blood donation about (one week/three months/one year/no time frame) from now”, “I plan to participate in blood donation about (one week/three months/one year/no time frame) from now”, and “I have it in my mind to donate blood about (one week/three months/one year/no time frame) from now”. In the no-time indication frame, none of the items specified any time frame (e.g., “I will try to make myself available for blood donation”).</p>
<p>In order to examine the effect of temporal distance on behavioral intentions, each behavioral intention item was accompanied with one of four time points (one week/three months/one year/no time frame). Although the standards for creating intervals of temporal distance were not mentioned in previous CLT studies, the temporal distance interval was set to observe the relative salience of high or low-level construals for distant or near-future judgments of activities. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1359105311421048">Eyal, et al. (2009)</xref> used “next week” versus “a year from now” and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1359105311421048">Liberman and Trope (1998)</xref> used “tomorrow” versus “some time next year” to activate a low-level and a high-level construal. In addition, the current study used the item with no time indication to observe how much the intention toward the behavior in the future is different from the current intention.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1359105311421048">
<title>Social desirability evaluation</title>
<p>Social desirability of blood donation was measured with six items (Cronbach’s α = .76 in the US and .68 in Korea). The six items were “It is expected that blood donation would enhance community welfare”, “Donating blood is an ethical behavior”, “Participating in blood donation is beneficial to other people in the society”, “Blood donation does not contribute to others’ well-being (reverse-coded)”, “Blood donation is a behavior that undermines morality (reverse-coded)”, and “Blood donation is not a socially responsible act (reverse-coded)”.</p>

<title>Preliminary analyses</title>
<p>The upper section of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1359105311421048">Table 1</xref> presents the results of preliminary analyses. A 4 (temporal distance: one week, three months, one year, and no time indication) × 2 (culture: Koreans and Americans) between subject two-way ANOVA showed that temporal distance did not have a significant main effect on social desirability evaluation: F (3, 474) = .54, p = .65, η<sup>2</sup> = .00. Culture had a significant main effect: F (1, 474) = 24.11, p &lt; .001, η<sup>2</sup> = .05. Americans considered blood donation more socially desirable than did Koreans. Temporal distance and culture did not have a significant interaction effect: F (3, 474) = 1.71, p = .16, η<sup>2</sup> = .01. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1359105311421048">Table 1</xref>, participants rated blood donation well above the scale midpoint (4) on social desirability: t (260) = 29.15, p &lt; .001 in the US and t (220) = 22.16, p &lt; .001 in Korea.</p>
<p>Additionally, it was examined whether past behavior of blood donation affected any of the hypothesized relationships among the variables. Individuals who answered that they had donated blood in the past (n = 116, M = 4.21, SD = 1.69) indicated greater intention to do it again than those who had never donated blood (n = 365, M = 3.26, SD = 1.68), t (479) = 5.30, p &lt; .001, η<sup>2</sup> = .06. Individuals who had donated blood evaluated blood donation as a socially desirable behavior (M = 5.50, SD = 0.72) to a greater extent than those who had not donated blood (M = 5.28, SD = 0.84), t (479) = 2.48, p = .01, η<sup>2</sup> = .01. When past behavior pattern was included in the main analyses testing hypotheses and answering the research question, however, past behavior did not have any significant interaction effects with temporal distance for the blood donation intention, F (3, 465) = 0.86, p = .46.</p>

<title>Main analyses</title>
<p>Hypothesis 1a predicted that blood donation intentions would vary across different temporal distance. A 4 (temporal distance: no time indication, one-week, three-months, and one-year) × 2 (culture: Koreans and Americans) between subject two-way ANOVA showed a significant main effect for temporal distance, F (3,474) = 21.35, p &lt; .001, η<sup>2</sup> = .12. Post hoc comparisons using Tukey’s procedure (p &lt; .05) revealed that the intention was greatest when no time indication frame (M = 4.26, SD = 1.60) was used. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1359105311421048">Table 1</xref>, intentions for the one-year frame and the no-time frame were significantly stronger than intentions for the one-week frame and the three-month frame. The main effect for culture was not significant, F (1, 474) = 2.44, p =.12, η<sup>2</sup>= .00. The analysis revealed a significant interaction effect between temporal distance and culture, F (3, 474) = 3.22, p &lt; .05, η<sup>2</sup> = .02. Among Koreans, intention was higher for no time indication than for one-week, three-month, and one-year frames. Among Americans, intention was higher for one-year and no-time indication than for one-week and three-month frames.</p>
<p>Hypothesis 1b predicted that the relationship between intentions and perceived social desirability of blood donation would vary across different temporal distance. Research Question 1 asked whether Americans and Koreans would differ in the relationship between social desirability and intentions across different time frames. A hierarchical multiple regression analysis was conducted to test H1b and to answer RQ1.</p>
<p>Before conducting the analysis, one dummy variable labeled ‘culture’ was created for Korean participants as the reference group (coded with 0) and American participants as the comparison group (coded with 1). Temporal distance was dummy-coded to create three dummy variables; each labeled as Time 1, Time 2, and Time 3). The dummy variables for each time frame included no time indication as the reference group (coded with 0) and each time frame as the comparison group (coded with 1). The continuous independent variable (social desirability) was mean-centered in order to protect against unessential multicollinearity when testing for the interactions among the variables. Age, sex, and past behavior were included in the first block as control variables. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1359105311421048">Table 1</xref>, only past behavior was significant. Social desirability and the dummy variables (i.e., first-order effect predictors) were entered in the second block. The interaction terms of social desirability and each dummy variable (i.e., second-order effect predictors) were entered in the third block. For any significant interactions, simple regressions were conducted to examine the patterns of the interactions. The lower section of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1359105311421048">Table 1</xref> shows the multiple regression results.</p>
<p>Among the predictors in the second block, Time 1 and Time 2 were significant, indicating that intentions for one-week and three-month frames were significantly lower than intention for the no-time indication frame. The upper section of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1359105311421048">Table 1</xref> shows means for each time frame. Among the predictors in the third block, the second order interaction term of Time 1 and social desirability was significant, indicating that the relationship between social desirability and intention in the no-time frame was significantly different from the relationship between social desirability and intention in the one-week frame. That is, in the one-week frame, social desirability was not significantly related to intention (β = -.06, p = .54). But in the no-time indication frame, social desirability was positively related to intention (β = .20, p = .02). Similarly, the second order interaction term of Time 2 and social desirability was significant. In the three-month frame, social desirability was not significantly related to intention (β = -.08, p = .39). But in the no-time indication frame, social desirability was positively related to intention (β = .20, p = .02).</p>
<p>Further analyses were conducted to examine if any pair of time frames would show significant differences in the way social desirability was related to intention. The results showed that the regression coefficient comparing the relationship between social desirability and intention in the one-year time frame with the relationship between social desirability and intention in the one-week time frame was significant, B (unstandardized coefficient) = -0.60, SE = 0.24, β = -.16, p = .01. The regression coefficient comparing the relationship between social desirability and intention in the one-year time frame with the relationship between social desirability and intention in the three-month time frame was significant, B = -0.61, SE = 0.26, β = -.13, p = .02. Although the relationship between social desirability and intention in the one-year time frame was not significant (β = .15, p = .095), it was more positive than the relationships between social desirability and intentions in the one-week (β = -.06) and three-month (β = -.08) time frames. On the other hand, the regression coefficient comparing the relationship between social desirability and intention in the one-year time frame (β = .15) with the relationship between social desirability and intention in the no-time frame (β = .20) was not significant, B = -0.09, SE = 0.25, β = -.02, p = .71.</p>
<p>In brief, H1b was partially consistent with the data. The relationship between social desirability and blood donation intention was different between the distant future (i.e., one-year and no-time frames) and the near future (i.e., one-week and three-month frames). There were no differences between the one-year frame and the no-time frame or between the one-week frame and the three-month frame. Additionally, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1359105311421048">Table 1</xref>, none of the interaction terms involving culture was statistically significant. Thus, in answering RQ1, the results did not show cultural differences in the association between social desirability and intentions over temporal distance.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study tested Construal Level Theory (CLT) with blood donation intentions and social desirability. The results showed that individuals indicated stronger intentions to donate blood in the distant future (i.e., a year from now) than in the near future (i.e., a week from now and three months from now). In support of CLT, individuals might have focused more on high-construal level factors (e.g., social desirability) when they considered blood donation in the distant future, while they might have focused more on low-construal level factors (e.g., practical concerns such as inconvenience and difficulty in finding a blood donation center immediately) when they considered blood donation in the near future. This finding may imply that intentions of blood donation are formed primarily under the influence of its idealistic aspects as people plan it in the distant future.</p>
<p>In fact, this study found that the relationship between social desirability and blood donation intention was stronger in the distant future than in the near future. This finding indicates that social desirability is indeed one type of high-level construal that can be activated and become salient when individuals have to think about blood donation for the distant future. The lack of the relationship between social desirability and intentions in the one-week and three-month time frames indicates that social desirability is not what individuals consider seriously when thinking about blood donation in one week or three months.</p>
<p>Interestingly, blood donation intention in the one-year frame did not differ from blood donation intention when the time was not specified. Additionally, the relationship between social desirability and intention did not differ between the one-year time frame and the no-time indication frame. These findings may indicate a possibility that if researchers ask participants to indicate blood donation intention and do not specify when to donate blood, they might be inadvertently asking participants to think about blood donation in the distant future. For blood donation intentions, the one-year time frame may be far enough in the future so that it is undifferentiated from no specific time in the future. If campaign planners and practitioners need to promote blood donation within a short time period (i.e., it is desirable to have an immediate and successful outcome of a blood donation drive campaign), they may need to target factors associated with blood donation in the very near future. For example, featuring an abstract message such as “blood donation saves lives and is an altruistic behavior” in a campaign may help with increasing individuals’ blood donation intention in the distant future, but a campaign’s effort to make it convenient and easy to donate blood immediately may help with increasing individuals’ blood donation intention in the near future.</p>
<p>There was no overall difference between the one-year frame and no-time indication for blood donation intentions when the data from Americans and Koreans were combined and analyzed together. However, when the analysis was done separately for each culture, Koreans but not Americans showed a significant difference between the one-year frame and no-time indication for blood donation intentions. And, among Koreans, intentions did not differ across the one-week, three-month, and one-year time frames. If the no-time indication is considered as unspecified time in the distant future, a possible implication of this result is that “one year from now” may not be considered to be a distant future by Koreans. On the other hand, for the relationship between social desirability and intention, the lack of distinction between the 1-year frame and the no-time indication frame was similar in both Korea and America. At this point, it is not clear whether the one-year time frame can be categorized as the distant or the near future for blood donation in Korea. If cultures differ in what constitutes the distant future, future research may need to identify comparable time frames in the near and distant future when testing CLT cross-culturally.</p>

<title>Limitations and future directions</title>
<p>This study used only one behavior to test the theoretical framework of CLT. It would be worth examining if CLT can be also applied to other socially desirable behaviors that promote one’s own or others’ health. Future research may also need to examine whether temporal distance can be relevant to the decision to engage in socially undesirable behaviors such as binge drinking or driving under the influence.</p>
<p>Although this study differentiated donors and non-donors based on self-reports, it did not separate novice/occasional donors and regular donors. Even among donors, novice/occasional donors and regular donors show different cognitive and behavioral patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1359105311421048">Ferguson &amp; Chandler, 2005</xref>). The predictions of CLT may work differently for various types of donors and non-donors. One possibility is that salience of low-level versus high-level construals for different time frames may be more likely for non-donors and novice/occasional donors than for regular donors. Because repeated experience of donation may lead regular donors to consider the donation process as convenient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1359105311421048">Gillespie &amp; Hillyer, 2002</xref>), low-level construals (e.g., practical barriers, inconvenience of collection site) may be a less important factor for the near future among regular donors than among non-donors or first-time donors.</p>
<p>This study examined the function of a high-level construal only and did not examine a low-level construal in activating intentions of blood donation. By focusing only on the relationship between social desirability and intentions across different time frames, this study showed that one type of high-level construal was more strongly related to intentions in the distant future than in the near future. But this study did not examine whether a low-level construal is more strongly related to intentions in the near future than in the distant future. Future studies may need to investigate various types of low-level and high-level construals, and their inverse relationships with intentions across various time frames.</p>
