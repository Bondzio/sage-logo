<p>The home base of this Journal, the Nordic School of Public Health, will be closed down by the end of next year.</p>
<p>The Nordic School of Public Health is an institution founded 60 years ago by the Nordic countries together, supervised by the Nordic Council, directed by a Nordic Board, and run by the teaching staff headed by an executive principal.</p>
<p>The Nordic countries through the Nordic Council are running around 40 other Nordic institutions in all of the member countries and free-standing regions. Many of the institutions have, like the Nordic School, assignments to support the common Nordic cultural heritage. Financing is by country-wise contributions related to the populations.</p>
<p>The reason for the start of the Nordic school in 1953 by the health ministers was a lack in the Nordic countries of institutions for post-graduate training in public health and health services. Gradually over the years, the mission expanded by supporting students to combine courses to formal examinations, and Masters of Public Health was granted from 1978. From the mid 1980s, qualified research training was introduced and the first Doctor of Public Health graduated in 1987. Over the years, more than 17,000 students have taken courses at the school.</p>
<p>Today – in contrast to 1953 – there are indeed several academic public health programmes in the Nordic universities. However, the postgraduate principle of attracting people with experience from the working life has made the Nordic school the only one of its kind. Students aged between 30 and 60 have, in addition to the formal education, been sharing experiences and building the Nordic networks that are the exceptional features of the school. These qualities will not be achieved in any of the national programmes.</p>
<p>The future of the Nordic school has been discussed for a long time, and from the Nordic countries different arguments for and against have been verbalized; however, for closing the school, financing seems to be the most obvious.</p>
<p>The <italic>Scandinavian Journal of Public Health</italic> and its executive board, which represents the associations of public health in the Nordic countries, will have to look into the question of a new home base. Before the final closure of the Nordic School of Public Health, the Journal will welcome any tender for a new host institution.</p>
