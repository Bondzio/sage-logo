<abstract>
<p>Acetabular hip joint components manufactured from gamma-sterilized ultra high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE), gamma cross-linked UHMWPE, or polycarbonate-urethane (PCU) polymers were evaluated in a hip joint simulator, using cobalt alloy femoral components, for at least 5 million cycles. The volume of material losses due to wear was calculated for each type of sample, based upon mass loss measurements, every 500,000 cycles. The loss of material for the conventional UHMWPE was much higher than for the cross-linked UHMWPE, showing about a 70% reduction in wear due to cross-linking. The material loss for the PCU samples appears to have been at least 24% lower than for the cross-linked UHMWPE. Based upon these results, the PCU material seems to have potential for use as an alternative bearing material to UHMWPE for total hip replacement surgeries.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0885328210394471"><title>Background</title>
<p>Total hip replacement has had promising results since it was first performed in 1960 in treating hip pain and improving mobility in the hip joints in patients with arthritis, fracture and other conditions. Many technological improvements have taken place since then in the surgical techniques and the materials used for hip replacement devices. However, despite the success achieved with most total hip replacement procedures, there have been cases of failures.</p>
<p>One of the major causes of failure of total hip replacement is implant wear and resultant periprosthetic osteolysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0885328210394471">1</xref></sup> Published literature shows that macrophages activated by wear debris from articulating surfaces stimulate bone resorption leading to osteolysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0885328210394471">2</xref></sup> This reaction to wear debris from metal and polyethylene articulating surfaces has been referred to as ‘particulate disease.’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0885328210394471">3</xref></sup> Macrophages that have phagocytized polyethylene particles have been shown to release mediators that can lead to bone resorption.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0885328210394471">4</xref></sup> UHMWPE wear particles have also been shown to stimulate osteoclasts present at the bone implant junction leading to resorption of the calvarial bone <italic>in vitro</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0885328210394471">5</xref></sup> Thus, wear debris may lead to bone resorption and loosening of the implant if sufficient numbers of particles are present, although variability in patient physiology and individual response to particles means that it is difficult to predict what level of particulate debris is safe. Failures associated with periprosthetic fracture in the region of the pelvis, the peritrochanteric area, or the femoral diaphysis may be related to osteolysis and have been occasionally seen after hip arthroplasty.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0885328210394471">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Since wear debris contributes to the osteolytic process at the bone/implant junction, an important factor in the success of total joint replacements is the minimization of wear of the articulating surfaces. Previous research has shown a number of factors that predispose polyethylene to wear in clinical practice. These factors can be grouped as polymorphism of the material, defective design features and three body wear.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0885328210394471">7</xref></sup> Design features take into account the thickness of the polyethylene, socket geometry and the fixation, and support of the liner.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0885328210394471">7</xref></sup> Therefore, in order to minimize wear, alternative materials with potentially improved properties such as polyurethanes have been proposed for possible use. From the literature we can conclude that the choice of an optimum material and design considerations is very important in order to minimize wear and subsequent failure.</p>
<p>UHMWPE has been the material of choice for total joint arthroplasty in orthopedic and spine implants because of its resistance to wear and impact. Polyurethane, on the other hand, is widely used in high resiliency applications due to high tear and abrasion resistance, and flexural fatigue life. Polyurethane has been the material of choice in some intervertebral disc replacement implants,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0885328210394471">8</xref></sup> implantable artificial heart valves<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0885328210394471">9</xref></sup> and ventricular assist devices,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0885328210394471">10</xref></sup> micro catheters,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0885328210394471">11</xref></sup> and heterografts for dialysis access<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0885328210394471">12</xref></sup> because of its biocompatibility and mechanical properties. Recently, polycarbonate urethane is being advocated as an alternative bearing material for the acetabular cup as it shows low wear articulation and good biocompatibility. Research is being encouraged to evaluate merits of polycarbonate urethane as an articular bearing material.</p>
<p>Traditionally, ultra high molecular weight polyethylene has been used as articular bearing material. Conventional polyethylene was replaced by highly cross-linked polyethylene since wear rates were lower in highly cross-linked polyethylene as compared to conventional polyethylene and other changes to the mechanical properties due to the cross-linking process do not appear to have an effect on device performance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0885328210394471">13</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0885328210394471">18</xref></sup> Wear-induced osteolysis is also reduced in cross-linked polyethylene.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0885328210394471">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0885328210394471">20</xref></sup> Thus, cross-linked polyethylene was preferred because of improved properties. When employing conventional polyethylene it was recommended to use heads of smaller radius in order to reduce wear rate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0885328210394471">21</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0885328210394471">23</xref></sup> Wear is also dependent on the thickness of the acetabular liner and contact stress, which are factors influenced by head diameter.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0885328210394471">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0885328210394471">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0885328210394471">25</xref></sup> However, since wear rates are lower in cross-linked polyethylene the prospect of use of larger heads has been introduced.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0885328210394471">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>The material properties influence the choice of larger heads. It has been shown that the wear rate is independent of head size for highly cross-linked ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0885328210394471">27</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0885328210394471">29</xref></sup> This has encouraged the use of larger heads which facilitate greater hip range of motion, improved joint stability, and reduction of the risk of dislocation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0885328210394471">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0885328210394471">31</xref></sup> Use of highly cross-linked polyethylene has also been advocated in younger patients because of its excellent wear properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0885328210394471">32</xref></sup> Polycarbonate urethane showing good mechanical properties is being suggested as an alternative material for fabrication of large acetabular cups, providing the benefits of joint stability and reduced dislocations while potentially showing improved wear rates.</p>
<p>Wear particles of polycarbonate urethane have been shown to be less inflammatory and therefore potentially less disruptive to bone-implant fixation as compared to UHMWPE by studies conducted <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0885328210394471">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0885328210394471">34</xref></sup> This stands as an added benefit over highly cross-linked polyethylene. It is not known exactly why there is this difference but the authors speculated that the difference may be related to the fact that PCU is hydrophilic while UHMWPE is hydrophobic. Studies have also been conducted to evaluate wear performance of a polyurethane acetabular component tested in a sheep model of cemented total hip arthroplasty. This testing in ovine arthroplasty models has effectively shown the biostability of this material over periods as long as 48 months with no apparent changes in the material or evidence of degradation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0885328210394471">35</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0885328210394471">37</xref></sup> Preliminary results for two examples of the same device that is being tested in this study have shown minimal wear debris and the absence of evidence of synovitis in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0885328210394471">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0885328210394471">39</xref></sup> in retrieved acetabular cups of polycarbonate urethane indicating good potential for polycarbonate urethane as a weight bearing material due to its low wear and biocompatibility.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0885328210394471">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>Research has been performed to determine ideal processing techniques for manufacturing polycarbonate urethane to get the desired properties. Mechanical properties of polyurethane have further been assessed by static and dynamic compression tests giving promising results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0885328210394471">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0885328210394471">41</xref></sup> <italic>In vitro</italic> stability of polycarbonate urethane has also been tested under oxidative conditions and at a constant strain rate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0885328210394471">42</xref></sup> <italic>In vivo</italic> testing of polycarbonate urethane in one of the published papers shows that it has better biostability than polyether polyurethanes and shows absence of degradation mechanisms of polyurethanes like hydrolysis, environmental stress cracking (ESC), and metal ion oxidation (MIO).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0885328210394471">43</xref></sup></p>
<p>A novel concept of fluid film lubrication attributed to polycarbonate urethane has also been introduced.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0885328210394471">44</xref></sup> Further frictional testing to determine the mode of lubrication with polyurethane has been successfully conducted. One such study evaluating Corethane 80A as the bearing material in presence of a synthetic lubricant has shown that a radial clearance of between 0.10 and 0.25 mm gave results similar to that expected with full-fluid-film lubrication.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0885328210394471">45</xref></sup> Fluid film lubrication is a mechanism that mimics that present in the natural hip joint and will markedly influence wear with polycarbonate urethane surfaces.</p>
<p>By friction testing, creep testing and wear testing on a hip joint wear simulator, another study has shown that polyurethane-compliant layer in a knee prosthesis with cement fixation was tribologically superior to the UHMWPE design being used clinically.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0885328210394471">46</xref></sup> This reiterates the promising performance of polycarbonate urethane in clinical studies and research being conducted over the past few years.</p>
<p>Earlier studies evaluating CoCrMo-on-polyurethane unicondylar knee prostheses <italic>in vitro</italic> have also shown similar lower friction values compared to conventional joints and close to full fluid film lubrication.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0885328210394471">47</xref></sup> A similar study was conducted to test a compliant layer knee joint when bone cement particles were added to the lubricant, thereby increasing the friction between the bearings. This study also reported lower friction in polyurethane bearings compared to polyethylene and greater damage was done to the surface of the polyethylene than to the polyurethane bearings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0885328210394471">48</xref></sup></p>
<p>Assessment of the wear properties of polycarbonate urethane and its comparison with cross-linked UHMWPE is necessary to determine whether there is an improvement in wear properties through this material selection. This study compares the wear rates in acetabular cups manufactured from UHMWPE and polycarbonate urethane under similar conditions of hip wear simulator testing.</p>

<p>All testing was conducted on an eight station rotary bearing hip simulator equipped with 23° angled bearing blocks, giving a 46° range of rocking during testing (MTS, Eden Prairie, MN). Each station of the machine was equipped with a load cell and torque cell, allowing verification of the loads being applied to the samples and the friction experienced between the cups and heads as represented by the torque that was being measured. A Paul loading curve<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0885328210394471">49</xref></sup> was applied at the rate of one cycle per second with a maximum load of 3000 N. Bovine calf serum (Hyclone) diluted to 50% concentration (approximately 33 g/L total protein) and supplemented with EDTA (EDTA disodium salt, dihydrate, Sigma Scientific) was used as the lubricant for all testing. The rotation of the angle blocks was synchronized with the trigger for the loading curve such that the devices were in the same orientation to each other at the same load levels for each cycle of testing.</p>
<p>The serum was changed every 500,000 cycles, at which time the wear samples were removed from the machine, cleaned and dried according to laboratory protocols, and then weighed on a balance readable to 0.01 mg. During testing, loaded soak controls and unloaded soak controls were included to assess the change in mass due to fluid uptake. The loaded soak controls were used to adjust the mass loss measurements for changes due to fluid content. Mass changes were converted to volume of material lost using the density of the materials being weighed.</p>
<p>The serum from each moving test station was collected and frozen for possible analysis for characterization of the size and morphology of the wear particles being generated.</p>
<p>The tested acetabular components were constructed of either conventional Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene (UHMWPE), cross-linked UHMWPE (50 kGy irradiated), or Polycarbonate-urethane (PCU) (Bionate 80A, DSM PTG) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0885328210394471">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0885328210394471">2</xref>) and all were of the same design and size. All acetabular components were supplied sterile to assure that the materials being tested were representative of what would be used clinically. All femoral head components were manufactured from a cobalt/chromium alloy and were 40 mm in diameter. The testing groups are detailed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0885328210394471">Table 1</xref>. The three types of samples were all manufactured to the same dimensions. The UHMWPE cups were machined from bar stock material while the PCU samples were injection molded. For the conventional gamma-sterilized UHMWPE, three test samples and one loaded soak control were utilized. For the remaining two studies, six test samples, one loaded soak control, and one unloaded soak control were used. In addition, for these groups, an unopened packaged sample was held for evaluation at the conclusion of testing. All samples were soaked for 30 days in serum of the same composition as the testing lubricant before initial weighing for baseline mass.

<p>Cleaning of the UHMWPE cups was accomplished according to the normal laboratory protocol. The cups were cleaned with an enzyme detergent and a soft (children’s) toothbrush and then sonicated for 15 min in the detergent solution. The cups were then rinsed with filtered (0.2 micron) deionized water and sonicated in deionized water twice for 15 min. The cups were then rinsed with 100% ethanol. Finally, the cups were vacuum dried overnight and allowed to equilibrate to ambient conditions for 30 min before weighing in the morning. The PCU cups were cleaned by the same protocol except that they were not rinsed with ethanol or vacuum dried. It had been shown experimentally that the hygroscopic nature of the PCU meant that vacuum-dried cups would be continually gaining weight during weighing and would also risk losing any benefit that might have been gained in wear properties due to the 30-day soak in serum before testing. Following a protocol published by another research group in 2007,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0885328210394471">47</xref></sup> the cups were carefully dried with lint-free cloths and then air-dried on the laboratory bench for 30 min before weighing. All the weighings were conducted in a round-robin fashion five times and the results averaged and corrected for fluid uptake using the results from the loaded soak controls.</p>
<p>Once testing had been completed, representative cups of all three types were examined using a laser confocal microscope to characterize the surface morphology of tested, loaded soak and, where available, nonloaded soak control and unopened samples. Photographs of a small area of the cup surface near the apex were stored for further inspection.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0885328210394471" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title>
<p>In weighing the PCU cups according to the chosen protocol, it was clear that the cups were continuing to change weight during weighing. The change occurred in a linear manner and the rate of weight change during the five weighings was consistent for all cups, meaning that the average weight change of the loaded soak controls was still a valid adjustment for fluid uptake. Because there was no vacuum drying of the PCU samples, the level of hydration of the samples was different at each time point but consistent within time points, making the soak controls particularly important. Within a single weighing observation, all of the samples (tested and controls) exhibited nearly identical rates of weight change (usually around 60 µg per minute) with <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> linear correlation coefficients normally greater than 0.99. Comparison of the mass profiles of the control cups with the experimental cups showed that the fluid absorption and drying characteristics of the cups were consistent. Additionally, the linear nature of the material loss curves shows that a reproducible and consistent weighing process was achieved.</p>
<p>The averaged data for the experimental groups are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0885328210394471">Figure 3</xref>. The wear properties of the cross-linked UHMWPE were significantly improved from the conventional gamma-sterilized material. The conventionally sterilized UHMWPE exhibited an early wear-in period with a higher rate of wear followed by a second region with a lower linear wear rate. Both the cross-linked UHMWPE and PCU testing results showed a linear wear rate throughout the testing period. There is a trend towards the PCU samples having better wear properties than the cross-linked polyethylene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0885328210394471">Figure 4</xref>) but the standard deviations of the mean are quite high due to a single sample in the cross-linked UHMWPE testing group that had a much lower wear rate than the other five samples in the group. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0885328210394471">Figure 5</xref> shows the average data from the two groups when only the five consistent UHMWPE samples are averaged. The PCU cups are seen to have an average material loss of 19.1 mm<sup>3</sup> per million cycles while the cross-linked polyethylene cups had a loss rate of between 25 and 27 mm<sup>3</sup> per million cycles depending upon whether all six or only five samples are included in the calculation.

<p>Weighings of the loaded soak controls were used for adjustment of the mass of the tested samples to account for fluid uptake. During testing, it was seen that the loaded soak controls for the UHMWPE continued to increase in mass with continued testing. The unloaded soak controls increased in mass much more slowly, suggesting that the loading was having an impact on fluid uptake. For the PCU cups, the mass of the loaded and unloaded controls were variable throughout testing because the ambient drying conditions varied from week to week and vacuum drying was not done for these samples.</p>
<p>Microphotography of the bearing surfaces of the cups shows the changes in surface finish that have occurred due to the wear processes.

<p>Since the PCU cups are molded to final shape rather than being machined, the as-manufactured bearing surface appears smoother (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0885328210394471">Figure 10</xref>) with a mottled appearance which may be related to the different segments in the PCU or may possibly reflect surface irregularities. When tested, these surface features disappear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0885328210394471">Figure 11</xref>) and the surface more closely resembles the worn appearance of a polyethylene cup.

<p>Another wear study using PCU acetabular cups of the same design and from the same manufacturer was recently published.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0885328210394471">50</xref></sup> This study was conducted on wear simulator of a different design with a different loading and movement pattern than that used in this study and at a different serum protein concentration. The authors found a wear rate of approximately 12.5 mg per million cycles which may be converted to 10.5 mm<sup>3</sup> per million cycles, as compared with 19.1 mm<sup>3</sup> per million cycles in this study. It is known that serum concentration will have an effect on measured wear rates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0885328210394471">51</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0885328210394471">53</xref></sup> in a hip simulator and differences in loading parameters and configuration will also have an effect. The referenced study did not contain a direct comparison with polyethylene cups of the same design tested according to the same protocol so it is difficult to make a direct comparison with the results of this study.</p>
<p>The comparison of conventional gamma-sterilized UHMWPE to gamma cross-linked UHMWPE shows about a 70% reduction of wear due to the cross-linking process, which is about what would be expected for this type of processing. This finding suggests that the comparison of the cross-linked UHMWPE to the PCU samples is a valid comparison since the UHMWPE is seen to behave as expected in this device design and configuration. The wear rates of the cross-linked polyethylene are much higher than would be expected for 28 mm cups with thicker walls. It seems likely that both the larger head size and thinner wall of the cups may have contributed to these results, which was the justification for testing these samples for comparison with the cups of the new material of manufacture.</p>
<p>The simulator evaluation of the polycarbonate-urethane acetabular cups showed wear rates that appear to be lower than for cross-linked ultra high molecular weight polyethylene of the same design. The material losses due to wear for PCU appear to be about 24% or more lower than for the cross-linked UHMWPE. This finding may be significant to the success rate of bearing systems utilizing this polymer as the acetabular material. In addition to having a lower wear rate, research has shown<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0885328210394471">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0885328210394471">34</xref></sup> that the PCU material may also elicit a milder response from tissues in cell culture and in the peri-implant site. Two publications on retrieved devices of this type<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0885328210394471">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0885328210394471">39</xref></sup> have shown no synovitis in the adjacent tissues, although there were wear particles found in the synovial fluid. Both articles suggested that further clinical results and testing were warranted to determine the suitability of the material for acetabular replacement.</p>
<p>During the early period of testing, the conventional UHMWPE cups showed evidence of a higher linear rate of wear than was seen after 2,000,000 cycles of testing. This typical pattern of a change in wear rates after initial cycles was neither seen for the cross-linked UHMWPE nor for the PCU cups in this study, suggesting that the initial wear rate is maintained throughout testing, based upon the averaged data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0885328210394471">Figure 3</xref>. Both the cross-linked and PCU cup testing exhibited one or more samples with a noticeable difference in wear rates, suggesting that the mechanisms of wear and the testing parameters in these types of studies may not yet be fully understood or optimized.</p>
<p>While it is not expected that fluid uptake by the UHMWPE will have an effect on wear rates, the mechanisms of lubrication with the PCU material may be partially dependent upon the fluids present within the polymer due to exposure to the serum. The necessity for removal, cleaning, and weighing of the samples means that, while not vacuum dried, it was necessary to dry the cups to a reasonably stable mass in order to take accurate measurements of losses due to wear during testing. It was clear that the loaded soak controls played a very important role in the measurement of losses due to wear because the correction for the controls was responsible for the calculated losses to be measured in a consistent manner, since the actual fluid content of the cups varied by several milligrams from week to week during testing due to variability in ambient drying. The linear nature of the fluid-compensated data shows that the measurement technique was consistent throughout the testing period.</p>
<p>In conducting simulator wear testing, the results are not expected to reflect the actual volumetric wear rates that will be seen in the patient but, rather, allow the comparison of a proposed bearing material or bearing combination to the properties of material with a known clinical experience, as has been done in this study. This study has compared the wear rates of devices of the same design but different materials of manufacture directly on the same machine and according to the same protocol.</p>

<sec id="sec5-0885328210394471" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The use of polycarbonate-urethane elastomers for acetabular components in hip surgery appears to be a viable option, based upon simulator wear testing and previous published data on the use of urethane polymers as bearing surfaces in joint replacement.</p>
<p>The wear rates observed for the PCU bearing appears to be less than that for cross-linked ultra high molecular weight polyethylene materials, suggesting that there may be an advantage to PCU usage in large diameter devices, particularly considering the results of laboratory testing of PCU particulate for tissue response.</p>
<p>Continued study of this new material in the laboratory and in clinical trials seems to be warranted to better determine its suitability as an option for total hip replacement.</p>
