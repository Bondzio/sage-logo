<body>
<p>A growing body of research examines media framing of key scientific issues of our time, specifically, those issues that include political and moral components, such as global climate change and stem cell research (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0002764211419489">Dahmen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0002764211419489">Lakoff, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0002764211419489">Nisbet, Brossard, &amp; Kroepsch, 2003</xref>). In regard to stem cell research, the moral component and related controversy arise from the fact that a human embryo must be destroyed to isolate the stem cells.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0002764211419489">1</xref></sup> Yet scientific research shows that embryonic stem cells offer the potential to create replacement cells and tissues that could be used in treating numerous diseases and disabilities, including Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases, heart disease, strokes, burns, spinal cord injuries, and diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0002764211419489">National Institute of Health, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Starting from the traditional idea of the “angle” or “slant” given to a news story, framing theory focuses on how journalists and media producers use literal and visual devices to organize the news, which thereby effects how audiences perceive that news (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0002764211419489">Entman, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0002764211419489">Gitlin, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0002764211419489">Iyengar, 1991</xref>). The majority of framing research examines media content and media effects as related to <italic>textual news</italic>. Little examines the content and effects of <italic>visual news</italic>. However, the importance of visuals—specifically, the news photograph—and their associated effects cannot be ignored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0002764211419489">Dauber, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0002764211419489">Goldberg, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0002764211419489">Perlmutter, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>The current research builds on a photographic framing study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0002764211419489">Dahmen (2009)</xref> that identified key photographic frames used in the stem cell research debate. Although that study classified photographic media frames, it did not test for effects of photographic framing on participants. The current study uses a pretest-posttest experimental design to test for effects of photographic framing in the stem cell research debate. Additionally, the study is unique in that it combines a traditional framing effects study with eye-tracking data to provide for a new dimension of framing effects research. The goal of the research is to understand whether photographic frame has an effect on participant perception of and attention to the message and effect on perception of or attitude toward stem cell research. Given the political and ethical debate surrounding stem cell research—and the fact that stem cell research remains on both the national and the international news agenda—the issue warrants further attention from media scholars.</p>
<sec id="section1-0002764211419489">
<title>Literature Review</title>
<p>In regard to the media, framing, as first attributed to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0002764211419489">Goffman (1974)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0002764211419489">Bateson (1972)</xref>, refers to the process by which the media organize and make sense of the news. More specifically, framing theory purports that journalists and media producers use literal and visual devices, known as frames, to organize the news, which has an effect on how audiences perceive that news (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0002764211419489">Entman, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0002764211419489">Gitlin, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0002764211419489">Iyengar, 1991</xref>). Framing effects can be seen in the classic experiment by cognitive psychologists <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0002764211419489">Kahneman and Tversky (1984)</xref>. In this often-cited experiment, participants showed overwhelming preference for the frame that positioned an issue in terms of “saving lives” to the frame that positioned the issue in terms of “causing deaths.” In thinking about framing from a mass media perspective, the media have the power not only to define what issues are on the public agenda but also to define how the public thinks about those issues. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0002764211419489">McCombs (2004)</xref> refers to this mass media function as the “epitome of political power” (p. 82). He explains, “Controlling the perspective of the political debate on any issue is the ultimate influence on public opinion” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0002764211419489">McCombs, 2004</xref>, p. 82).</p>
<p>The vast majority of framing effects research examines text and ignores visuals. However, studying visuals is “especially relevant to the concerns of framing theory,” argue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0002764211419489">Messaris and Abraham (2003</xref>, p. 225). Because the human brain can make sense of images that are not exact reproductions of the objects they represent, viewers tend to overlook the fact that all images are, in reality, “human constructions” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0002764211419489">Messaris &amp; Abraham, 2003</xref>, p. 217). And given the fact that images generally look like what they intend to represent, visual framing is potentially “less obtrusive” than verbal framing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0002764211419489">Messaris &amp; Abraham, 2003</xref>, p. 217). This is especially true in regard to photographs. Given their “true-to-life” quality, Messaris and Abraham argue that photos have “an implicit guarantee of being closer to the truth than other forms of communication” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0002764211419489">Messaris &amp; Abraham, 2003</xref>, p. 217). In terms of framing, this quality leads the authors to conclude that “the use of photographic media in the framing process could diminish the likelihood that viewers would question what they see” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0002764211419489">Messaris &amp; Abraham, 2003</xref>, p. 217). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0002764211419489">Dauber (2001)</xref> argues that because audiences read news images as “evidence” rather than “representation,” news media consumers are vulnerable to “the power of the image in photojournalism in a way we are not in other contexts” (p. 654).</p>
<p>Furthermore, media scholars have shown that photographs can be more emotionally jarring than words. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0002764211419489">Goodwin (1983)</xref> wrote, “their capacity to shock exceeds that of language” (p. 190). Given the importance of news photographs, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0002764211419489">Dauber (2001)</xref> argues that in our “media-saturated environment, ignoring visual imagery provides less and less satisfactory work” (p. 655) and concludes that media research is critically lacking when visuals are ignored.</p>
<p>In regard to the study of news photographs, most research in this area falls into one of five areas: in-depth study of one news image (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0002764211419489">Dauber, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0002764211419489">Hariman &amp; Lucaites, 2003</xref>); study of related ethical considerations, such as violence, manipulation, or diversity (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0002764211419489">Lester, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0002764211419489">Newton, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0002764211419489">Reaves, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0002764211419489">Wischrnann, 1987</xref>); study of practices of photojournalists or editors (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0002764211419489">Fahmy, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0002764211419489">King &amp; Lester, 2005</xref>); study of technological impact (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0002764211419489">Davenport, Randle, &amp; Bossen, 2007</xref>); and study of effects.</p>
<p>Research in the visual effects area dates back to 1960s psychological research showing that pictures are easier to recall than words (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0002764211419489">Paivio, Rogers, &amp; Smythe, 1968</xref>). More recently, researchers have examined visual framing effects on such topics as presidential elections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0002764211419489">Coleman &amp; Banning, 2006</xref>) and images of war (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0002764211419489">Pfau et al., 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0002764211419489">Zillmann, Gibson, and Sargent (1999)</xref> found that participants were strongly influenced by one-sided photos. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0002764211419489">Gibson and Zillmann (2000)</xref> later found that the ethnicity of people pictured in a news photo influenced participants’ perception of the issue presented in the accompanying story. Zillmann et al. conclude that “media professionals must make efforts to balance the photographic content of news reports, presenting visual documentation for all sides involved in an issue” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0002764211419489">Zillmann et al., 1999</xref>, p. 225).</p>
<p>In examining visual framing effects in the context of protest news, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0002764211419489">Arpan et al. (2006)</xref> found a relationship between framing effect and photographic framing, especially when prior attitudes were examined. They conclude, “Visual information alone can be an important piece of evidence audience members use when evaluating contentious issues” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0002764211419489">Arpan et al., 2006</xref>, p. 14). As previously mentioned, findings from these studies have led researchers to conclude that focusing on textual information and ignoring visual information “overlooks a great deal of complexity and subtly about the way humans process information” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0002764211419489">Coleman &amp; Banning, 2006</xref>, p. 322). In essence, researchers continue to find that visual framing can influence message perception. Researchers have already begun to form an understanding of how stem cell research has been framed, both visually and textually, in the news media.</p>
<p>In a study of photographic frames in articles about stem cell research in <italic>The New York Times</italic> and <italic>USA Today</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0002764211419489">Dahmen (2009)</xref> found that two frames dominated the photographic coverage: science and politics. The science frame was represented in three primary ways: highly magnified human embryos (balls of cells), blood or stem cells in test tubes, or scientists working in labs. Photos of politicians mainly represented the political frame. Also present in the photographic framing were the medical and ethical frames (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0002764211419489">Dahmen, 2009</xref>). The medical frame was represented through photos of people who believe that stem cell research can help them or their loved ones. Without question, the ethical frame is the central point of the debate about stem cell research. Dahmen also found this frame in the analyzed photos, but it was manifested in specific ways and categorized as such: religion (religious figures or religious activism) or snowflake babies (babies who were born as a result of another couple’s “adopting” a frozen embryo that was in excess from an in vitro fertilization procedure). Previous textual framing studies of stem cell research also found these frames to be prominent, with the political frame dominating textual coverage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0002764211419489">Dahmen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0002764211419489">Nisbet et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Given the vehement debate surrounding stem cell research, it is not surprising that much survey data has been collected about public opinion of stem cell research. The Pew Research Center has collected copious amounts of public opinion data about stem cell research. As seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0002764211419489">Table 1</xref>, public opinion has remained relatively stable in recent years. However, when parsed by political and religious ideologies, differences in support for research are clearly seen. Pew data from March 2009 indicates that 69% of Democrats show support for stem cell research, whereas only 35% of Republicans support research. Support for stem cell research among White, non-Hispanic Catholics is 46%, compared to 29% for White evangelical Protestants and 64% for White mainline Protestants.</p>

<p>Although eye-tracking is a relatively new method of data collection, it is becoming well established in media research. For example, researchers have studied advertising effectiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0002764211419489">Bott et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0002764211419489">Pieters, Wedel, &amp; Batra, 2010</xref>), typography readability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0002764211419489">Josephson, 2008</xref>), and website design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0002764211419489">Chu, Paul, &amp; Ruel, 2009</xref>). In this data collection method, participants view selected materials on a special eye-tracking computer that can identify exactly where participants look. Data, such as time to first fixation, total visit duration, and gaze path, can be collected and analyzed both for individual participants and for participants as a whole. Previous research has shown that eye-tracking is an “objective, quantifiable measure of attention as it is linked to cognitive processing” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0002764211419489">Krugman, Fox, Fletcher, &amp; Rojas, 1994</xref>, p. 44). Data collected from eye-tracking are used in this study as a new approach to test for framing effects.</p>
<p>To date, no known research has used eye-tracking to study framing effects. The current study is unique in that it combines a traditional framing effects study with eye-tracking data to provide a new dimension of framing effects research. Again, the goal of the research is to understand whether photographic frame has an effect on participant perception of and attention to the message and effect on perception of or attitude toward stem cell research.</p>
<p>Although much work has been done on visual framing and framing of scientific issues, the unique combination of photographic framing in the stem cell debate with the integration of eye-tracking data led the researcher to propose research questions rather than hypotheses:</p>

<p>Data were collected through a pretest-posttest experimental research design. Participants were randomly assigned to one of five conditions (four experimental and one control group). After the completion of the paper-and-pencil pretest, participants viewed the stimulus material in digital format on a Tobii 1750 eye-tracking system. The system uses infrared illumination, which tracks the center of the pupil to measure gaze pattern. Participants were not required to wear any head-mounted device; the tracking hardware is fully integrated into the Tobii 1750 machine. In addition, participants could freely move their eyes around the screen, and the tracking process is hidden from the users. Data were collected on a 17-inch color-calibrated, flat-screen monitor positioned at a fixed distance from participants. Immediately following message exposure, participants completed the paper-and-pencil posttest.</p>
<p>Participants were recruited from a research participant pool at a major public university in the American South. The participant pool comprised students enrolled in a mass communication course, but not all students were mass communication majors. A total of 132 participants completed the experiment. Of these, 63% of participants were female; 37% were male. Median age was 20. In regard to race, 78% self-identified as White, 8% African American, 7% Hispanic, 3% Asian or Pacific Islander, and 5% Other.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0002764211419489">2</xref></sup> Political affiliation data showed that 17% self-identified as Democrat, 53% Republican, 14% Independent, 4% other; 12% selected <italic>not sure</italic>. Because of the subject matter of the research topic, religious affiliation was an essential piece of demographic data. The majority of the sample self-identified as Catholic (48%). Other religious affiliations were 22% mainline Protestant, 6% evangelical Protestant, 5% other, 17% unaffiliated, and 2% “don’t know.”</p>
<p>The stimulus material for the experiment was a print news article with an accompanying photograph about stem cell research. Previous research indicates that the article, which was an actual <italic>New York Times</italic> article, included all key relevant textual frames: political, medical, scientific, and ethical.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0002764211419489">3</xref></sup> The article text was integrated into a researcher-created, one-page layout that included a headline, byline (article author), body copy, photo, and cutline (photo caption). The body copy was edited for length. The experimental conditional was one of four photos with a related cutline. The control group article did not include a photo or cutline. Again, participants were randomly assigned to one of the five conditions (four experimental and one control group).</p>
<p>The four experimental-condition photos emphasized the following frames: political (President Obama signing stem cell legislation), medical (person in a wheelchair because of a spinal cord injury), scientific (scientist conducting research in a laboratory), and ethical (protesters praying and holding anti–stem cell research signs). Photos were selected on the basis of previous research findings of visual framing of stem cell research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0002764211419489">Dahmen, 2009</xref>). The article layout was a <italic>U</italic>-shaped story, a four-column story with a horizontally oriented photo occupying the top half of the central two columns. The article was a stand-alone piece; it did not include an affiliated newspaper.</p>
<p>Participants viewed the stimulus material in digital format on a Tobii eye-tracking machine. Two types of eye-tracking data were collected: time to first fixation (the amount of time it took for a user to first look at a specific area of interest [AOI]) and total visit duration (the total amount of time a user looked at a specific AOI). AOIs were designated by the researcher during data analysis. The AOIs were the four experimental condition photos. These data were used to test for statistical differences between experimental conditions based on the collected eye-tracking data and pre- and posttest questionnaires.</p>
<p>The pretest questionnaire included demographic questions as well as knowledge of the stem cell research debate and position on stem cell research. The posttest questionnaire included questions about opinion of message, relevance of message, position on stem cell research, and news consumption.</p>

<p>A total of 132 participants completed the experiment. Participants were randomly assigned to experimental conditions, with 26 assigned to political frame (19.7%), 26 to ethical frame, (19.7%), 26 to medical frame (19.7%), 25 to scientific frame (18.9%), and 29 to control group (22%). Again, the goal of the research is to understand whether photographic frame has an effect on participant perception of and attention to the message and effect on perception or attitude toward the stem cell research debate. Findings begin with an overview of participants.</p>
<p>On the basis of pretest questionnaire results about previous knowledge of the stem cell research debate, 20% had heard about it “a lot,” 67% had heard “a little,” 7% had heard “nothing at all,” and 6% were “not sure.” Participants generally supported stem cell research, with 42% stating that conducting research was more important, 22% stating that protecting embryos was more important, and 36% selecting <italic>not sure</italic>. Not surprisingly, pretest results showed a significant relationship between religious affiliation and support for research (χ<sup>2</sup> = 23.894, <italic>df</italic> = 8, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) and political affiliation and support for research (χ<sup>2</sup> = 12.191, <italic>df</italic> = 6, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .10).

<p>Research Question 2 asked about the relationship between photographic frame and participant attitude toward stem cell research. Despite aggregate differences in participants’ attitude toward stem cell research following message exposure, on the basis of chi-square analysis, there was no significant relationship between photographic frame and participant attitude toward stem cell research following message exposure. This analysis was based on participants’ posttest answer to the question, “Which is more important: finding new cures or protecting embryos?” In addition, an ANOVA also showed no significant relationship between photographic frame and posttest (Cronbach’s alpha = .870) feelings toward stem cell research measured by a five-item, 5-point semantic differential scale.</p>
<p>Research Question 3 asked about the relationship between photographic frame and participant perception of the predominant issues in the stem cell research debate. Regardless of condition, participants felt that the stem cell research debate was mostly about political strategy (7%); scientific discovery (12%); ethics, religion, or morality (60%); finding new cures (20%); or other (2%). Participants overwhelmingly stated that the stem cell research debate was mostly about ethics, religion, or morality. According to chi-square analysis, there was no significant relationship between photographic frame and participant perception of the predominant issues in the stem cell research debate.</p>
<p>Research Question 4 asked about the relationship between photographic frame and participant perception of the predominant message conveyed by the stimulus material. Regardless of condition, participants felt that the message was mostly about political strategy (35%); scientific discovery (9%); ethics, religion, or morality (36%); finding new cures (17%); or other (3%). The majority of participants stated that the message was mostly about political strategy or ethics, religion, or morality. According to chi-square analysis, there was no significant relationship between photographic frame and participant perception of the message.</p>
<p>Regarding the eye-tracking data, Research Question 5 asked about the difference in participants’ visual attention to the photographic frames during message exposure. Two of the most used measures in eye-tracking research are time to first fixation and total visit duration. Again, time to first fixation is the amount of time it took a participant to look at a specific AOI. Total visit duration is the total amount of time a participant spent looking at a specific AOI. These data are based only on participants who were exposed to an experimental condition (<italic>n</italic> = 103); the control group was exposed to an article with no photograph.</p>
<p>As seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0002764211419489">Table 6</xref>, it took participants only 0.25 s to first fixate on the ethics and science photographic frames, whereas it took participants 0.5 s to fixate on the political frame. It took participants more than 1 s to first fixate on the medical frame. An ANOVA showed no significant difference between photographic frame and time to first fixation. There was, however, a significant difference between photographic frame and total visit duration. Although the medical frame had the slowest time to first fixation, it also had the longest total visit duration, with participants spending an average of 11.5 s fixating on the medical photographic frame. The political photographic frame had the shortest total visit duration, with participants fixating on the political photograph for close to 2.5 s. Bonferroni post hoc analysis showed a significant difference between the political frame and each of the other three frames: political and ethical (<italic>t</italic> = −5.464, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .10), political and medical (<italic>t</italic> = −9.177, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), and political and scientific (<italic>t</italic> = −7.217, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05).</p>

<p>Research Question 6 asked about the relationship between participants’ political and religious affiliations and visual attention to the photographic frames during message exposure. In regard to political affiliation, for the purposes of this question, only participants who self-identified as Republican or Democrat are included in analysis.

<p>In regard to religious affiliation, for the purposes of this question, only participants who self-identified as Protestant (mainline), Protestant (Evangelical), or Catholic are included in analysis.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Again, the intention of this research was to understand whether photographic frame had an effect on participant perception of and attention to the message and effect on perception of or attitude toward stem cell research. The research study was grounded in framing theory, which asserts that the media’s structuring of news has an effect on how audiences perceive that news.</p>
<p>Findings indicate that regardless of experimental condition, there was an increase for both conducting research and protecting embryos following message exposure. The indication is that message exposure increased participant awareness and knowledge of the issues surrounding stem cell research, leading participants who were previously “not sure” about which was more important to form a more concrete opinion on the issues of stem cell research. In addition, although there was a significant increase for both conducting research and protecting embryos following message exposure, findings also show that regardless of experimental condition, there was an aggregate positive effect on attitude toward stem cell research. Participants felt significantly more positively toward stem cell research following message exposure.</p>
<p>However, posttest results did not reveal any significant effects between experimental condition and participant perception of the predominant issues in the stem cell research debate or participant perception of the message. Regardless of experimental condition, participants felt that the stem cell research debate was primarily about ethics, religion, or morality. In other words, changing the associated news photograph did not have an effect on what participants deemed the leading issue in the stem cell research debate. In regard to the message itself, participants were almost evenly split between the dominant issue of the message, with 35% choosing political strategy and 36% choosing ethics, religion, or morality. Again, the results were not significant; changing the associated news photograph did not have an effect on what participants deemed the leading issue of the message itself.</p>
<p>These findings might lead one to conclude that photographic frame had no effect. However, what makes this study—and its findings—important is the integration of eye-tracking data. Significant differences were found between photographic frame and the total amount of time participants spent viewing each photograph. And because participants were randomly assigned to experimental conditions, the conclusion is that photographic framing did have a significant effect on participants’ visual attention to the given photograph. Participants spent the greatest amount of time viewing the medical frame photo (approximately 11.5 s) and the least amount of time viewing the political frame photo (approximately 2.5 s). Participants spent close to 8 s viewing the ethical frame photo and approximately 9.5 s viewing the scientific frame photo. Findings support the conclusion that photographic frame did, in fact, have a significant effect on participants’ visual attention to the message.</p>
<p>Recall that the medical frame was a photograph of a man in a wheelchair, and the political frame was a photograph of President Obama signing stem cell research legislation. Participants spent the most time studying the medical frame photo, whereas the political frame photo was largely ignored. This finding—that the emotionally laden photo of a wheelchair-bound individual garnered more visual attention than a politically based photo of a politician signing a piece of paper—reinforces the findings of previous visual communication scholars who have repeatedly demonstrated the emotional power of photos. Additionally, the finding reinforces the premise of an effects study of photographic frames.</p>
<p>A second conclusion must also be considered: given the predominance of self-identified Republicans in the sample, one might also conclude that participants were not supporters of Obama and, therefore, were not intrigued by a photograph of him. Moreover, further data analysis found significant interaction effects between photographic frame, political affiliation, and total visit duration. Self-identified Republicans spent less time than self-identified Democrats looking at the Obama photo. Conversely, self-identified Republicans spent more time than self-identified Democrats looking at the ethical frame photo and the scientific frame photo. As the ethical frame was a photograph of protesters praying and holding anti–stem cell research signs, a possible conclusion that one may reach is that self-identified Republicans were potentially more invested in understanding the ethical dilemmas involved in the debate. Further study is needed on this point.</p>
<p>The scientific frame yielded somewhat surprising results. Recall that the science frame was a photograph of a scientist conducting research in a laboratory. The photo was a close-up of the scientist’s hands, a petri dish, and a microscope. Given self-identified Democratic participants’ overwhelming support for conducting research, it seems logical that self-identified Democrats would have spent more time than self-identified Republicans looking at the scientific frame. However, the reverse was true: Self-identified Republicans spent nearly 6 s longer than self-identified Democrats looking at the scientific frame photo. Perhaps this finding indicated that self-identified Democrats were already accepting of the science, whereas self-identified Republicans were interested in understanding more about the science behind the debate.</p>
<p>This brings about a limitation of this study. Different photos for each frame could yield different results. For example, a photo of former President Bush could have been received in a different way by the study sample. Or a photo of a highly magnified embryo rather than a photo of a scientist conducting research in a laboratory could also yield different results. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0002764211419489">Zillmann et al. (1999)</xref> showed, participants are strongly influenced by one-sided photos. Future research in this area should certainly consider including photos that represent additional sides of the debate. Another limitation was the use of a college student sample and the artificial nature of the laboratory setting. Finally, the study was limited in the small number of self-identified Democratic participants.</p>
<p>Despite inevitable limitations, this study advances our understanding of the topic. Findings show significant results related to photographic framing and visual attention to the message—a new perspective on our current understanding of framing theory. This lends further support to the assertion by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0002764211419489">Arpan et al. (2006)</xref> that “visual information alone can be an important piece of evidence audience members use when evaluating contentious issues” (p. 14). Findings from this study show that participants were the most visually attentive to the medical frame photo and least visually attentive to the political frame photo. This is especially interesting considering previous findings that both textual and photographic media coverage of the stem cell debate has been dominated by the political frame, with the medical frame being largely absent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0002764211419489">Dahmen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0002764211419489">Nisbet et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>In today’s media-saturated world, photos help grab audience attention. Photos can also give audiences an initial idea about the content, tone, or frame of the accompanying news article. If the audience finds the photo appealing, it follows that they are more likely to read or pay closer attention to the rest of the message or, from a practical perspective, buy or support the message or publication. In addition, media producers must be extremely cautious about selection of photographs. Adding to previous findings that media professionals must strive to provide photographic balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0002764211419489">Zillmann et al., 1999</xref>), this study provided additional evidence that photographic framing does, in fact, directly relate to audiences’ visual attention to the message, especially when considering demographic variables. Study findings suggest that eye-tracking methodology can be an important tool with the potential to enhance our understanding of media effects beyond that provided by traditional methods.</p>
