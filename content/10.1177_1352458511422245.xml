<p><bold>Background</bold>: Gender effects are strong in multiple sclerosis (MS), with male patients showing a worse clinical outcome than female patients. Functional reorganization of neural activity may contribute to limit disability, and possible gender differences in this process may have important clinical implications.</p>
<p>Objectives: The aim of this study was to explore gender-related changes in functional connectivity and network efficiency in MS patients. Additionally, we explored the association of functional changes with cognitive function.</p>
<p><bold>Methods</bold>: Sixty subjects were included in the study, matched for age, education level and intelligence quotient (IQ). Male and female patients were matched for disability, disease duration and white matter lesion load. Two cognitive domains often impaired in MS, i.e. visuospatial memory and information processing speed, were evaluated in all subjects. Functional connectivity between brain regions and network efficiency was explored using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging and graph analysis. Differences in cognitive and functional characteristics between groups, and correlations with cognitive performance, were examined.</p>
<p><bold>Results</bold>: Male patients showed worse performance on cognitive tests than female and male controls, while female patients were cognitively normal. Decreases in functional connectivity and network efficiency, observed in male patients, correlated with reduced visuospatial memory (<italic>r</italic> = −0.6 and <italic>r</italic> = −0.5, respectively). In the control group, no cognitive differences were found between genders, despite differences in functional connectivity between healthy men and women.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions</bold>: Functional connectivity differences were found in male patients only and were related to impaired visuospatial memory. These results underline the importance of gender in MS and require further investigation in larger and longitudinal studies.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Hyperactivation of brain areas and/or recruitment of additional brain areas (‘functional reorganization’) are known mechanisms that may compensate partly for neurodegeneration in multiple sclerosis (MS) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458511422245">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1352458511422245">3</xref></sup> delaying clinical and cognitive deterioration. Overall decreases in brain activation are usually seen in later disease stages, with concomitant cognitive decline.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458511422245">4</xref></sup> As many aspects of neuroanatomy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1352458511422245">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1352458511422245">6</xref></sup> and neurophysiology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1352458511422245">7</xref></sup> are affected by gender, resulting in differences in brain function between sexes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1352458511422245">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1352458511422245">9</xref></sup> it is tempting to hypothesize that physiological gender differences impact functional activation patterns and connectivity in neurological disease.</p>
<p>MS is an ideal disease model to test this hypothesis. Women are twice as likely to develop MS,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1352458511422245">10</xref></sup> but men generally have a worse clinical outcome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1352458511422245">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1352458511422245">12</xref></sup> In addition, faster clinical progression is reported in male patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1352458511422245">13</xref></sup> In this study, we explored the hypothesis that male MS patients show reduced functional reorganization compared to female patients, which might be associated with greater cognitive decline. We investigated functional reorganization with respect to one of its aspects, i.e. changed functional connectivity, indicating an altered level of communication between brain areas. We employed resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which can visualize brain networks in healthy subjects,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1352458511422245">14</xref></sup> as well as functional changes in neurological disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458511422245">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1352458511422245">15</xref></sup> and performed a novel method of analysis (i.e. graph analysis). This novel method identifies brain networks as a set of nodes (or vertices) and their connections. Gender-related changes in efficiency (or topology) of functional networks were investigated in patient and control groups. Finally, the relationship between gender-related differences in functional connectivity and network efficiency with cognitive function in MS patients was explored.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Thirty patients with clinically definite multiple sclerosis (CDMS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1352458511422245">16</xref></sup>, 15 male, 44.3 ± 8.2 years and 15 female 42.8 ± 7.6 years) were matched for age, level of education and premorbid intelligence quotient (IQ) to 30 healthy subjects (15 male, mean age 42.0 ± 9.6 years and 15 female, 42.8 ± 9.6 years) from a larger, existing dataset. Male and female patient groups were additionally and carefully matched for disease duration, disability and lesion load (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1352458511422245">Table 1</xref>). The four groups did not differ regarding handedness. Patients had low physical disability (median Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1352458511422245">17</xref></sup> = 3, range = 0–6.5); 26 patients had relapsing–remitting (RR) MS,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1352458511422245">18</xref></sup> while four patients (one female) had secondary progressive (SP) MS. Removing progressive patients from the analyses did not influence any of the results.</p>

<p>We have performed further post hoc analyses to study the robustness and consistency of our results in two additional patient groups, which were also matched for disability and lesion load. These were (i) 10 female patients with significantly reduced brain volumes (seven RRMS and three SPMS, 51.4 ± 7.4 years, EDSS range 3.5–6, disease duration 12.4 ± 6.9 years), and (ii) eight male patients who did not meet the criteria for ‘cognitive impairment’, i.e. impairment of at least two standard deviations in at least two cognitive domains (five RRMS and three SPMS, 46.2 ± 8.3 years, EDSS range 3–5.5, disease duration 10.5 ± 7.9 years).</p>

<title>Neuropsychological evaluation</title>
<p>All subjects underwent neuropsychological evaluation, based on domains often impaired in MS,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1352458511422245">19</xref></sup> on the day of the scanning: visuospatial memory and processing speed, using the Location Learning Test (LLT)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1352458511422245">20</xref></sup> and Letter Digit Substitution Test (LDST),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1352458511422245">21</xref></sup> respectively. The LLT specifically assesses visuospatial memory, whereas the LDST assesses speed of visual information processing. Additionally, premorbid IQ was assessed using the Dutch version of the new Adult Reading Test (DART-IQ).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1352458511422245">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1352458511422245">23</xref></sup> Education level was measured based on the highest level of Dutch education acquired.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1352458511422245">24</xref></sup> To evaluate possible confounding effects of anxiety, depression and fatigue, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-A and HADS-D),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1352458511422245">25</xref></sup> and the Checklist of Individual Strength (CIS-20)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1352458511422245">26</xref></sup> were used.</p>

<sec id="section5-1352458511422245">
<title>Magnetic resonance imaging</title>
<p>All subjects underwent an MRI scan using a 1.5 T whole-body MR system (Siemens Sonata, Erlangen, Germany), using an eight-channel phased-array head coil. Scans included magnetization prepared rapid acquisition gradient-echo (MPRAGE, TR 2700 ms, TE 5 ms, TI 950 ms, 248 × 330 mm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458511422245">2</xref></sup> field of view (FOV), 176 contiguous sagittal partitions, 1.3 mm isotropic voxel size), and functional MRI acquired during resting state (10 min, 200 volumes of echo planar images (EPI), TR 2850 ms, TE 60 ms, 211 × 211 mm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458511422245">2</xref></sup> FOV, 36 axial slices, 3.3 mm isotropic voxel size). To assess MS lesions, all subjects also received an interleaved turbo spin echo proton density (PD) and T2 weighted sequence (TR 3130 ms, TE 24/85 ms, 192 × 256 mm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458511422245">2</xref></sup> FOV, 46 axial slices of 3.0 mm thickness, 1.0 × 1.0 mm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458511422245">2</xref></sup> in-plane resolution), as well as an interleaved spin-echo T1 weighted sequence (TR 485 ms, TE 12 ms, 192 × 256 mm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458511422245">2</xref></sup> FOV, 46 axial slices of 3.0 mm thickness, 1.0 × 1.0 mm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458511422245">2</xref></sup> in-plane resolution).</p>

<sec id="section6-1352458511422245">
<title>Image pre-processing</title>
<p>All imaging pre-processing steps were performed using FSL4.0 (FMRIB’s Software Library, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl">http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl</ext-link>). All functional MR images were pre-processed in FEAT (part of FSL4.0), which included motion correction, removal of non-brain tissue and high-pass filtering using a cut-off of 100 s. The fMRI scans were not spatially smoothed and were kept in subject space (i.e. they were not registered to the MNI standard space), where further analyses were performed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1352458511422245">
<title>Regions of interest</title>
<p>Functional connectivity was assessed between the mean time series of cerebral regions of interest (ROIs), based on an existing anatomical atlas (Automated Anatomic Labeling (AAL) atlas, part of MRIcro; see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cabiatl.com/mricro/mricro/template.html">http://www.cabiatl.com/mricro/mricro/template.html</ext-link>).</p>
<p>This atlas was previously used in several other papers on graph analysis of fMRI data in Alzheimer’s disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1352458511422245">27</xref></sup> and healthy controls<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1352458511422245">9</xref></sup> and consists of 116 ROIs. Of these, all 26 cerebellar and two cerebral regions (the left and right olfactory cortices) were excluded due to the limited field of view, yielding 88 cerebral regions of the brain that were analysed.</p>
<p>The ROIs were linearly co-registered to each subject’s MPRAGE scan using FLIRT (part of FSL4.0). At this stage non-brain and CSF-related areas were removed using a mask of each subject’s grey and white matter based on the volumetric analyses (see below). Afterwards, the ROIs were co-registered to each subject’s fMRI sequence. Here, all ROIs were thresholded at 0.7 and binarized. Finally, any remaining non-brain areas caused by the registration process were removed using a mask of the brain-extracted fMRI sequence. These steps ensured that virtually no CSF and non-brain signal was included in the analysis. An example of the AAL atlas and the resulting ROIs in one subject are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1352458511422245">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Functional connectivity</title>
<p>Functional connectivity analyses were performed using synchronization likelihood (SL),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1352458511422245">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1352458511422245">29</xref></sup> a measure of linear and nonlinear synchronization, between ROIs (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1352458511422245">Figure 1</xref>). A greater synchronization between two ROIs means more similarity between the time series, indicating a higher level of communication between two brain areas. We therefore expect larger mean synchronization to relate to better cognitive performance. SL calculation was performed in locally developed software DigEEGXP, which was previously used to investigate network topology in Alzheimer’s disease using SL as a measure of functional connectivity in fMRI data with a very similar approach.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1352458511422245">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>ROI time series were entered into the software, where SL was applied to calculate the level of synchronization between all combinations of the 88 brain regions, using an embedding dimension of five data points, a time lag of one data point and a P-ref of 0.05. The resulting 88 × 88 matrix was used for further analyses.</p>
<p>SL values were analysed by creating a smoothed histogram of all the individual ROI combinations in the unthresholded SL matrices to display the probability distribution of specific synchronization value ranges in each group, using bins of 0.001 SL in Microsoft Excel 2007 for Windows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1352458511422245">Figure 2</xref>). Peak height and peak position were calculated. The SL matrices were also used to calculate the average synchronization of each individual ROI with the rest of the brain and analysed using a threshold of <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01 to reduce problems concerning multiple comparisons, leaving a false positive rate of 1 in 100. A whole-brain mean of SL was calculated per subject. All these SL-based measures only included SL values for ROIs with other ROIs (i.e. not an ROI with itself).</p>

<p>Graph analysis was used to simultaneously investigate the whole brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1352458511422245">30</xref></sup> and is based on the representation of a network as a graph. That is, a network is represented as a set of nodes (vertices) and their connections (links or edges). In the current study, SL matrices are represented as graphs, one node per ROI, and one vertex per functional connection. All parameters were based on a non-weighted representation of the network, i.e. using thresholded and binarized SL matrices. As no specific threshold is known to accurately represent the brain’s functional network, all parameters were calculated for a range of thresholds represented by <italic>K</italic> (<italic>K</italic> = 5–15), which represents the average number of connections per node. This was done to show that the results were robust with respect to the choice of the threshold. Thresholded and binarized SL matrices were used to calculate two graph analytical parameters, namely path length (Lp, measuring the shortest ‘pathway’ or number of steps between any two brain regions in the modeled functional network, indicating overall integration and efficiency) and clustering coefficient (Cp, measuring local connectivity of a region, indicating local specialization) for each <italic>K</italic>. After Lp and Cp were calculated per ROI a whole-brain average was calculated per subject.</p>
<p>To be able to compare functional network parameters optimally, each graph parameter was divided by averaged parameters of 50 randomly generated networks (Lp-s and Cp-s), based on each subject’s personal network specifications. The resulting values (Lp/Lp-s and Cp/Cp-s, depicted simply as <italic>λ</italic> and <italic>γ</italic> from here on) therefore describe how close a person’s network topology is to that of random networks, enabling an estimation of how random or regular the network of a person is, with small-world networks typically being in between. Graph analytical parameters were analysed for each <italic>K</italic> value, after which statistical values (<italic>Z</italic>, <italic>F</italic>, <italic>r</italic> and <italic>p</italic>) were averaged over all <italic>K</italic> values.</p>
<p>Therefore, network efficiency is analysed using two parameters describing network topology (<italic>γ</italic>, clustering coefficient (local specialization) and <italic>λ</italic>, path length (overall integration and efficiency). As an efficient network (or small-world network) has been reported to display low path length and high clustering coefficient, changes in one or both of these parameters are expected to be found in patients when compared to controls.</p>

<title>Volumetric assessment</title>
<p>Total grey matter, total white matter and whole brain volumes, corrected for head size, were measured using the MPRAGE images and SIENAX<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1352458511422245">31</xref></sup> version 2.5 (part of FSL 4.0). T1-hypointense and T2-hyperintense lesions in MS patients were marked and their volumes were measured using Alice for Windows (Perceptive Informatics, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA), based on a local-threshold technique.</p>

<sec id="section11-1352458511422245">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>All variables were checked for normality using the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test in SPSS 15.0 for Windows together with histogram inspection. The four groups were matched based on the variables in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1352458511422245">Table 1</xref>, of which only age and IQ were normally distributed and assessed using independent <italic>t</italic>-tests. The remaining variables of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1352458511422245">Table 1</xref> were assessed non-parametrically using the Mann–Whitney <italic>U</italic>-test. For the rest of the data, normally distributed variables were analysed using a general linear model (GLM) analysis, with group (defined as male or female control/patient) as a fixed factor and age as a covariate. Post hoc tests were performed to compare the main effects between the individual groups, using a Bonferroni confidence interval adjustment. Where normality was not found, variables were tested non-parametrically using the Mann–Whitney <italic>U</italic>, looking at differences between (i) male patients and male and female controls, (ii) female patients and female and male controls, and (iii) male controls and female controls. For gender × disease interaction effects and correlation analyses, values were transformed to normality before analysis. Interaction effects were investigated using GLM, using disease status and gender as fixed factors and age as a covariate. Partial correlations between cognitive and connectivity parameters were assessed for transformed mean SL and graph analysis values (if they were found to be significantly different in patients) with transformed visuospatial memory and information processing speed performance scores in the patient groups only, using age and disease duration as covariates.</p>

<title>Cognition</title>
<p>Male patients performed worse on information processing speed, as measured by the LDST, when compared to female (Bonferroni corrected <italic>p</italic> = 0.02, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1352458511422245">Table 2</xref>) and male controls, although this last comparison did not survive Bonferroni correction (<italic>p</italic> = 0.10, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1352458511422245">Table 2</xref>). In addition, male patients performed worse than male and female controls on visuospatial memory, as measured by the LLT (Mann–Whitney, <italic>Z</italic> = −2.0, <italic>p</italic> = 0.04 and <italic>Z</italic> = −1.97, <italic>p</italic> = 0.05, respectively, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1352458511422245">Table 2</xref>). On the contrary, female patients showed a cognitive performance similar to that observed in male and female controls in both LDST and LLT. Cognitive testing showed no differences between healthy men and women.</p>

<title>Resting-state functional connectivity</title>
<p>Male patients showed a lower synchronization of brain functional activity at rest when compared to male controls. In particular, male patients showed decreased mean synchronization likelihood (SL) (<italic>Z</italic> = −2.5, <italic>p</italic> = 0.01, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1352458511422245">Table 2</xref>) and increased peak height (<italic>Z</italic> = 2.3, <italic>p</italic> = 0.02, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1352458511422245">Table 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1352458511422245">Figure 2</xref>) than male controls. Regionally, 26 anatomical regions displayed significantly lower SL (average <italic>p</italic> = 0.003) in male patients compared to male controls (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1352458511422245">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1352458511422245">Table 3</xref>). Strikingly, in male patients, all significantly abnormal ROIs overlapped with regions that were significantly different in respect to functional connectivity between healthy men and women, as reported below. These areas are also part of commonly described resting state networks, which are found using independent component analyses,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1352458511422245">15</xref></sup> like the default mode network and visual processing networks.

<p>In patients there were no differences in white matter lesion volume between the genders.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Changes in activation patterns in the brain (functional reorganization) have previously been suggested to be important in terms of delaying functional deterioration in neurological conditions such as AD and MS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458511422245">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458511422245">2</xref></sup> Whether this fundamental physiological ‘coping mechanism’ of the brain is different between genders has so far been unknown. If functional adaptation is different between female and male MS patients, it might explain (part of) the difference in clinical progression between these groups and it would hold potential for a more individualized treatment. In this study, using closely matched patient groups, we indeed found clear gender differences in terms of cognition, functional connectivity and brain volumetric measures, while making use of sophisticated functional and structural MRI analysis techniques.</p>
<p>In our group of patients suffering from MS, male patients showed impaired functional connectivity and altered network topology, as well as cognitive decline, compared to male controls. In the female patients, however, no such functional changes were seen when compared to female controls. Male and female patients were closely matched for disability, disease duration and white matter damage, rendering these factors highly unlikely as explanations for the observed gender effects. The clinical relevance of these gender effects was indicated by a strong correlation of both lower mean synchronization (<italic>r</italic> = −0.6) and lower network path length (<italic>r</italic> = −0.5) with a worse visuospatial memory performance in male patients only. However, it cannot be determined which developed first (e.g. network changes or cognitive deficits), and causality could not be ascertained using the present data. No gender effect was found for information processing speed, nor were any of the functional connectivity measures correlated with this cognitive domain. However, in a small group of male MS patients without cognitive impairment according to definition, LDST scores remained lower than controls, and lower SL values and brain volumes were also found in this group. This possibly indicates that even without overt cognitive dysfunction network changes are already present in male MS patients, although larger and longitudinal studies are needed to confirm and further explore these findings.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the extent of lesion damage in the white matter showed no gender effects. Brain volumes were, however, only significantly decreased in men, although adding these as covariates to the statistical model did not change the relationship between connectivity and cognition. If one considers atrophy as a form of tissue loss which is secondary to lesion damage, this might indicate that similar amounts of lesion damage due to MS cause more functional changes, atrophy and cognitive decline in men than in women. Cognitive discrepancies between the genders were suggested in a previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1352458511422245">32</xref></sup> showing cognitive decline to be more predominant in men in a large group of MS patients. Similarly, previous literature on traumatic brain injury<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1352458511422245">33</xref></sup> and Parkinson’s disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1352458511422245">34</xref></sup> also showed that men tend to suffer from more severe cognitive impairment. Taking together our interesting findings of (i) gender-related differences in functional connectivity, and (ii) association between altered network topology and cognition, may suggest that female patients who are cognitively impaired could be at a relative advantage with respect to functionally reorganizing their brain upon damage. Interestingly, atrophy and cognitive performance did not display a direct correlation, while functional connectivity changes and cognitive performance did, even after adding brain volume as a covariate. This indicates that the different ranges of neurodegeneration in men and women alone, as measured with atrophy, may not explain the full range of cognitive abnormalities. As a further exploration of the relationship between atrophy, connectivity and cognition, this study additionally investigated a small group of female MS patients with known atrophy. Interestingly, this group still did not show significant changes in functional connectivity or cognitive performance. Although the small sample size limits interpretation, the data seems to indicate that, even with significant atrophy, female patients appear to be more adept at circumventing functional consequences of structural MS-related damage in the brain. This remains hypothetical, however, as the present study is purely correlative. Further research is now needed to pinpoint exact causative factors determining greater male sensitivity to functional disconnectivity, and to study in a longitudinal fashion how connectivity changes might be related to (different levels of) neurodegeneration, whether caused by gender or not.</p>
<p>In the healthy control group, we found that healthy male and female brains inherently possess different functional connectivity patterns, as men displayed a larger path length, with an unaltered clustering coefficient. Despite this difference, healthy men and women still achieve similar cognitive performance, possibly due to a higher level of synchronization present in male brain networks. This increased synchronization and path length might imply that male brain functional networks are less efficient, a hypothesis which is supported by other recent studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1352458511422245">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1352458511422245">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1352458511422245">36</xref></sup> As male brain networks appear to have lower anatomical connectivity,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1352458511422245">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1352458511422245">36</xref></sup> male networks may need to induce stronger functional connections to ensure normal performance, i.e. sending more data through fewer connections, in order to safeguard cognition. This implies that women have more degrees of freedom in reorganizing their networks when necessary; for example, in response to brain damage such as that caused by MS. In addition, a recent magnetoencephalographic study has demonstrated that cognitive functioning in male subjects is more dependent on functional brain network topology than that in women, and therefore may be more sensitive to changes in network efficiency induced by pathology.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1352458511422245">37</xref></sup> Of course, these results need to be further reproduced in larger sample sets.</p>
<p>Treatments focusing on increasing plasticity and improving cognitive function in MS will need to be individualized and take factors such as gender into account. Furthermore, our findings are of interest in terms of understanding pathological heterogeneity specific to MS. Although the effects of sex hormones on the healthy brain are well known, their effects on neurological disease are not. Future research on the neuroprotective role of sex hormones is therefore warranted. In particular, the influence of different sex hormone receptor profiles may be an interesting target for further research in MS, as there is increasing evidence that oestrogens may have a distinct beneficial influence on the disease regarding inflammation and neurodegeneration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1352458511422245">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1352458511422245">39</xref></sup> Finally, our findings suggest that it would be worthwhile extending the investigation of functional connectivity and network efficiency to other neurological diseases which display a gender effect.</p>
<p>A drawback of the current study is its relatively limited sample size, which necessitates further research in order for findings to be generalized. However, the presented combination of highly sophisticated functional, clinical and structural techniques has not been applied to a complex and heterogeneous neurological disease such as MS before, and our findings clearly show the existence of gender-related differences in brain functional connectivity and functional networks in carefully matched groups of subjects, controlling for variations in age, intelligence, disability and structural damage. Additionally, the relatively limited neuropsychological evaluation does not allow for a broad extrapolation of the relationship between overall cognitive performance and functional connectivity, which will have to be investigated in further studies. Future studies will also have to shed more light onto the issue of how functional connectivity changes as measured in the resting state are related to specific cognitive deficits in MS.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our present results show that male MS patients show gender-specific functional network changes, which were related with worse cognitive functioning. This was not the case for female patients. This finding deserves further investigations in larger and longitudinal studies.</p>
