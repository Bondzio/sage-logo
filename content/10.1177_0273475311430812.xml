<abstract>
<p>Teaching the restless young generation business students of today is not easy. Furthermore, the traditional lecture method has failed miserably to engage the business students and deliver significant learning. The author presents a discussion on the photo novel as an attractive communication medium and the participatory photo novel as an innovative pedagogical tool, in place of the traditional lecture method. In fact, this method puts the onus of learning on the students and empowers them to co-create content and subsequently learn through classroom discussions. This is followed by a brief classroom guide on the process of creating a participatory photo novel. Student evaluation and feedback are discussed. Specifically, the content analysis reveals that students experienced the following learning outcomes: understanding and knowledge, critical thinking, transfer ability, creative thinking, communication skills, and leadership ability. This is followed by an agenda for empirical research. The limitations and implications of using this pedagogy are also discussed in detail. Overall, it is hoped that the use of participatory photo novel as a pedagogical tool can go a long way in augmenting learning resources, popularizing of this genre of literature, and providing the young generation business students with a unique learning experience.</p>

<p>The young generation of today, also termed <italic>Generation Y</italic> (Gen Y), and born roughly between 1982 and 2003 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0273475311430812">Short &amp; Reeves, 2009</xref>), is characterized by “short attention spans, stimulation overload and even attention deficit disorder” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0273475311430812">Paul, 2001</xref>, p. 48). This presents unique challenges before educators as they grapple to attract the attention of this <italic>virtual generation</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0273475311430812">Proserpio &amp; Gioia, 2007</xref>). Even corporate trainers have reported that the “Gen Ys don’t respond to a traditional training manual or lecture method” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0273475311430812">Morton, 2002</xref>, p. 48). Talking about the lecture method, this has been one pedagogy that has been presently at the receiving end of huge criticism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0273475311430812">Biggs &amp; Tang, 2007</xref>). However, this is nothing new. Almost 30 years ago, Bligh (1972) did extensive research on lecturing versus other methods, such as group discussions, projects, and so on. He came out with the following findings (as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0273475311430812">Biggs &amp; Tang, 2007</xref>, p. 108).</p>

<list-item><p>Students like very good lectures; otherwise, they prefer <italic>well-conducted group work</italic>.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Indeed, educators have, over the years, introduced a variety of pedagogical innovations to get the attention of their students. These innovations, within management education, have included doll making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0273475311430812">Gaya Wicks &amp; Rippin, 2010</xref>), films (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0273475311430812">Smith, 2009</xref>), graphic novels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0273475311430812">Gerde &amp; Foster, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0273475311430812">Short &amp; Reeves, 2009</xref>), photo-essays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0273475311430812">Ng, 2006</xref>), game shows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0273475311430812">Sarason &amp; Banbury, 2004</xref>), computer simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0273475311430812">Thompson, Purdy, &amp; Fandt, 1997</xref>), and noncomputer simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0273475311430812">McKone &amp; Bozewicz, 2003</xref>), to name just a few. This article argues for the introduction of the participatory photo novel as an innovative pedagogical tool, instead of the traditional lecture method. This is followed by a short discussion on the process of creating a participatory photo novel. Student feedback is examined, followed by an agenda for empirical research. Finally, limitations of this pedagogy along with implications and conclusions are presented.</p>
<sec id="section1-0273475311430812">
<title>The Photo Novel</title>
<p>Let us understand the photo novel before going ahead to understand the concept of participatory photo novel. The photo novel, which is also known as <italic>fotonovela</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0273475311430812">Valle, Yamada, &amp; Matiella, 2006</xref>), has its origins in Italy way back to the post–World War II era when pictorial summaries of Hollywood movies in the form of photo booklets were produced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0273475311430812">Matiella, 2007</xref>). The photo novel is a story told with photos and dialogues (or thoughts), presented in bubbles just like in comic books (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0273475311430812">Matiella, 2007</xref>). This combination makes it a very entertaining and easy-to-read medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0273475311430812">Matiella, 2007</xref>). Over the decades, it has evolved to become a popular medium of entertainment in Mexico and to an educational tool in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0273475311430812">Milliken, 2008</xref>). In fact, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0273475311430812">Valle et al. (2006)</xref> have reported the following two categories of photo novels: <italic>popular culture</italic> and <italic>health educational/informational</italic>. As the names indicate, the first type is meant for entertainment and the second is meant to inform, educate, and empower (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0273475311430812">Wang &amp; Burris, 1994</xref>). This section argues the use of photo novel to communicate business and marketing concepts.</p>
<p>An important point to note here is the following: Out of the age range that is defined for Gen Y, the ones who are in the age group of 18 to 29 years are typically studying in undergraduate or graduate business schools. They have seen their growth from childhood to adulthood “coincide with the spread of the Internet and visually stimulating technologies, such as high-definition television and sophisticated video games” (Ketchen &amp; Short, 2011, p. 21). The authors infer both logically and empirically that many Gen Ys can be regarded as “visual learners, or people that retain knowledge better when information is presented through stimulating visual formats rather than via traditional text and lectures” (p. 21). Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0273475311430812">Murphy and Smark (2006)</xref> have discussed how student learning can be positively influenced by the incorporation of visual elements.</p>
<p>Of course, the average age of students studying business management in executive education programs is much higher. However, visual learning is not a preferred style unique to the Gen Y only. In fact, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0273475311430812">Starkey (2000)</xref> writes about Lockheed Martin employees using visual storyboards in the 1960s to clinch defense and aerospace contracts.</p>
<p>Several teachers and researchers have recommended storytelling as an effective strategy for communicating business concepts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0273475311430812">Barry &amp; Elmes, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0273475311430812">Forman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0273475311430812">Muir, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0273475311430812">Short &amp; Ketchen, 2005</xref>). Also, educators have talked about increasing use of graphic novels in teaching business concepts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0273475311430812">Gerde &amp; Foster, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0273475311430812">Short &amp; Reeves, 2009</xref>). Recently, Harvard Business School published, for the first time in its entire history, a standard text-only case in graphic novel format (i.e., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0273475311430812">Austin &amp; Short, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The photo novel resembles the graphic novel except that it contains photos instead of drawings. Thus, the photo novel can be an attractive and effective medium to learn management concepts, compared with textbooks or pure lectures. Interestingly, the present author is currently working with a Harvard professor to convert the latter’s text-only case into a photo novel format, which is the first effort of its kind for the prestigious institution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0273475311430812">Yumlembam, 2011</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section2-0273475311430812">
<title>The Participatory Photo Novel</title>
<p>This article also talks about the process of creating a photo novel by the students themselves and using the same to generate discussion in the marketing classroom and thus delivering learning to all the participants involved.</p>
<p>In the present context, a series of photo novels are being made by groups of marketing students on assigned topics. They are developed much before the scheduled classroom sessions. Furthermore, each photo novel is distributed (physically/electronically) among the classroom members, at least 2 days before the scheduled session. On the scheduled day, the assigned photo novel is discussed and debated in the classroom with respect to application of theory and implications for marketers, and thus learning takes place. The faculty, in this pedagogy, plays a passive role acting more like a facilitator to ensure that the whole process goes off smoothly. The nature of photo novel construction is collaborative and so is the nature of reflection in the marketing classroom. Tim Hawkes (as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0273475311430812">Doherty, 2005</xref>) states that the new generation students prefer collaborative learning. Thus, the participatory photo novel, which is a collaborative activity, should be appreciated by the students.</p>
<p>The participatory photo novel requires the participants to apply the knowledge residing in text/reference books and thereby learn. The learning process is further made interesting, as they need to develop a story, enact it, shoot it, edit it, work on the page layout, and finally publish it. In short, the learning outcomes of creative thinking, analytical thinking, communication skills, and so on are achieved. These are actually the outcomes that are considered valuable by the employers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0273475311430812">Floyd &amp; Gordon, 1998</xref>). Furthermore, to achieve these outcomes, the classes need to become increasingly “learner centered” and collaborative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0273475311430812">Cunningham, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0273475311430812">Koch, 1997</xref>), which is what the learners want!</p>
<p>Even the American Association of Higher Education, the Education Commission of the States, and The Johnson Foundation provide guidelines about encouraging both collaborative and active learning toward creating a learner-centered environment in higher education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0273475311430812">Chickering &amp; Gamson, 1987</xref>). Regarding active learning, the guidelines state that the students must actively experience the class material and make it a part of themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0273475311430812">Chickering &amp; Gamson, 1987</xref>).</p>
<p>Participatory photo novels are constructed by students themselves based on their real-life experiences or those of practitioners. So it becomes a case of experiential learning for the students, which is the “incorporation of active, participatory learning opportunities in the course” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0273475311430812">Hawtrey, 2007</xref>, p. 144). This is widely regarded as a superior pedagogy compared with the traditional lecture method leading to enhanced learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0273475311430812">Johnson &amp; Johnson, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0273475311430812">Kayes, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0273475311430812">Kolb, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0273475311430812">Senge, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, photo novels can be constructed very easily with the help of a standard digital camera (which is quite inexpensive nowadays) and some basic supporting software, which again is affordable. Students enjoy being pseudo filmmakers and learn lot of skills while on-the-job, thus enhancing their overall experience. However, constructing graphic novels is not so easy and requires special skills (e.g., penciling, inking, etc.) that are not always readily available within the student pool, nor can they be easily acquired. At the end of the day, photo novels are more “real” than graphic novels, and that gives them the additional power to attract the serious business students.</p>

<title>Creating Participatory Photo Novels</title>
<p>This section presents brief guidelines<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0273475311430812">1</xref></sup> for creating photo novels through student participation for delivering learning on marketing subjects.</p>
<list id="list2-0273475311430812" list-type="order">
<list-item><p><italic>Assigning a marketing topic</italic>: The faculty assigns a topic from the syllabus to groups of five to seven students. Though not all marketing topics are amenable for photo novel construction, most are. The topics, which involve application of quantitative methods like demand forecasting, and so on, are the ones that pose challenges. Some suggested topics from the subject Principles of Marketing that have been successfully tried by the author are the following:
<list id="list3-0273475311430812" list-type="alpha-lower">

<list-item><p>Social marketing</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Cause-related marketing</p></list-item>
</list></p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Understanding theory</italic>: Once the theory topic is assigned, the group members should read the theory well and discuss the same collectively. Furthermore, they should search for personal experiences or published case studies to check the applicability of the theory.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Assigning roles</italic>: This stage requires each group to assign specific responsibilities to the members, such as scriptwriting, photography, direction, costumes, locations, props, makeup, acting, and so on, based on existing skills/student preferences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0273475311430812">Nimmon &amp; Begoray, 2008</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Writing a story</italic>: This is the most crucial stage where students, after having understood the theory well, work on writing a story based on their personal experiences or those of others (e.g., published or heard experiences of practitioners, customers, acquaintances, etc.). The story should have a “problem” at its core that will drive the protagonist (e.g., sales manager, marketing manager, CEO, customer, etc.) to action and lead to some resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0273475311430812">Nimmon &amp; Begoray, 2008</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Developing the script</italic>: The script is the dialogue version of the selected story. It also provides plenty of other details, which is crucial to the creation of the photo novel. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0273475311430812">Table 1</xref> provides a format inspired by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0273475311430812">Dorance (2008)</xref>.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Developing characters and casting</italic>: In developing the characters, the scriptwriter should consider the following points: name, age, gender, appearance, personality, occupation, income, family background, and so on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0273475311430812">Dorance, 2008</xref>). This is required to achieve effective storytelling. The details also enable the director to do proper casting and the actor to portray the character better.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Working on locations and props</italic>: The scriptwriter should ensure that the locations required by the script are easy and inexpensive to reach and access (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0273475311430812">Dorance, 2008</xref>). Care should also be taken that permissions to shoot in the various locations are obtained in writing well in advance and properly filed to prevent any problem on the day of the shoot. Regarding shooting in public places, permission will not be necessary. However, if the script demands shooting in a public place for significant time to the extent that normal life can be disrupted, then getting permission in advance becomes essential.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Working on costumes and makeup</italic>: Costume here will mean clothes, footwear, headgear, jewelry, and so on. The costume manager should ensure that the actors are wearing costumes that meet the requirements of the script. Regarding makeup, tissue papers and a basic makeup kit are enough.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Taking photographs</italic>: The arrival of digital camera has given photography a shot in the arm. The sample photo novel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0273475311430812">Figure 1</xref> was shot using a low-quality 4-GB digital camera. Nowadays, one can easily get a 12-GB digital camera at a very reasonable price with a powerful inbuilt flash and zooming facility. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0273475311430812">Table 2</xref> provides a primer on camera angles and image sizes.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Directing the photo novel</italic>: The director is the master strategist who excels in planning and shows extreme creativity in overcoming resource constraints. He or she should be preferably well versed with all the different functions and lead by example. The director should further prepare the shooting schedule, without which the project will be a logistical nightmare. A suggested shooting schedule format is provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0273475311430812">Table 3</xref>.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Working on the page layout</italic>: A typical photo novel varies in size from 10 to 30 pages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0273475311430812">Nimmon &amp; Begoray, 2008</xref>). Each page is of A4 size and can carry 4 to 6 photographs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0273475311430812">Dorance, 2008</xref>). Therefore, for a 30-page photo novel, a total of 120 to 180 photographs will be required. For preparing the pages, any word processing software (e.g., Microsoft Word) will suffice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0273475311430812">Nimmon &amp; Begoray, 2008</xref>). Specialized software such as ComicLife will provide added advantages in terms of higher designing efficiency and better aesthetics.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Printing and publishing</italic>: The photo novel is ready for printing once all the pages are ready as image files (e.g., jpeg, gif, bitmap, etc.). Color printing is definitely going to be expensive, and, therefore, limited color copies should be printed just to keep in the physical library. These copies can be subjected to soft binding that will lend them a paperback finish. Spiral binding or simple stapling can be other options. Another important step would be to produce an e-book (in PDF format), which can be e-mailed to all the class students. Alternatively, the same can be published in the institute intranet/extranet for students to easily access the photo novels.</p></list-item></list>

<title>Discussing the Photo Novels</title>
<p>Once the participatory photo novels are ready and distributed among the class students, the platform is set for a lively discussion on the same. It is essential that each group prepares a discussion guide along with their photo novel and circulates the same among the students well in advance to ensure proper discussion. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0273475311430812">Table 4</xref> provides an indicative list of questions for classroom discussion with respect to the sample photo novel.</p>

<p>The discussion rounds proved to be very lively. This was helped by the fact that the photo novels were well made. Besides, the students found the project unique and that got them even more interested.</p>
<p>The group, which created the sample photo novel, <italic>Lappy Makes Lucky Happy</italic>, was appreciated for their short story. They could clearly delineate the five stages of the consumer buying decision process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0273475311430812">Kotler &amp; Armstrong, 2009</xref>). Others in the classroom also found the theory easy to understand in the light of the photo novel. The students showed lot of enthusiasm in answering Questions 2 and 3 (refer to <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0273475311430812">Table 4</xref>), which required applying the chosen model in different contexts. In the process, their understanding of the theory got more refined. In answering Question 4, students understood the classification of information sources such as personal sources, commercial sources, public sources, and experiential sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0273475311430812">Kotler &amp; Armstrong, 2009</xref>). In answering Question 5, they realized the differences between the various information sources and their linkages to the product and the buyer. Questions 6 and 7 were heavily debated by the students as they tried to apply the consumer buying decision process model in different contexts.</p>

<title>Student Evaluation and Feedback</title>
<p>The participatory photo novel was used by the author in teaching Principles of Marketing to 120 graduate business school students in the year 2009. The author used the following two parameters in evaluating the effort expended by the students.</p>
<list id="list4-0273475311430812" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Quality of photo novel (story, script, direction, photography, page layout, editing)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Quality of discussion (ability to answer the discussion questions and stimulate debate in the classroom)</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Both the parameters had the same weight and were applicable to the entire group. However, educators may decide to have different weights and even choose to assess individual performance. A sample grading rubric has been provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0273475311430812">Table 5</xref> to assist academics interested in using this pedagogy.</p>

<title>Findings</title>
<p>At the end of the exercise, the students were asked to provide written feedback on <italic>what they learned</italic> without revealing their identity and using a maximum of 1,000 words. All the students were informed that writing the feedback note was voluntary and that their final grades would not be affected. They were asked to justify their reactions giving suitable examples from the project experience. However, some students found the question vague and sought clarification. They were then given <italic>examples of possible learning outcomes</italic> such as leadership ability, communication skills, and so on, which may or may not have happened in their case. This was done just to provoke their thought process and make them find the voluntary feedback exercise easy and interesting.</p>
<p>Of the students, 102 responded to the request, and their essays were content analyzed to identify the broad categories of learning outcomes. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0273475311430812">Unerman (2000)</xref>, the typical unit of analysis can be paragraphs, sentences, words, and so forth. For the present study, the unit of analysis used was a sentence. There were in all 7,912 sentences across the feedback notes. Each of the sentences was read by the author and classified into appropriate categories. This process was repeated by another independent researcher. The two researchers discussed their classification and decided mutually on the following categories—namely, understanding and knowledge, critical thinking, creative thinking, transfer ability, communication skills, and leadership ability. Both researchers felt that the entire content across all the feedback notes can be fully classified as per the chosen classification. Both of them had a common understanding of education-related issues and were careful about being unbiased while doing the classification independently, thus ensuring objectivity.</p>
<p>The correlation between the two lists of responses was found to be 92.8%, which is very good. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0273475311430812">Holsti (1969)</xref>, an interjudge agreement level of 85% or more is the minimum requirement for categorical data to be considered acceptable. This can be regarded as one type of reliability index (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0273475311430812">Kolbe &amp; Burnett, 1991</xref>). The disagreements between the two researchers were resolved by using the services of a third academic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0273475311430812">Schibrowsky, Peltier, &amp; Nill, 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0273475311430812">Table 6</xref> provides the content analysis results of student feedback.</p>

</table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap>
<p>As mentioned earlier, one of the key learning outcomes identified is <italic>understanding and knowledge</italic>. According to Sampson and Betters-Reed (2008), this can include identifying and defining marketing concepts and processes, identifying marketing trends, developing a marketing plan, and so on. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0273475311430812">Sautter (2007)</xref> considers this learning outcome as mastery of specific content. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0273475311430812">Young, Klemz, and Murphy (2003)</xref> regard this as a key measure of learning performance. In the present study, a significant 20.35% of the responses were classified under this very important learning outcome category. This is understandable as the students need to toil very hard to first understand the assigned theory topic so that they can create a relevant story around it for developing the photo novel. Later on, in the discussion round, their knowledge of the theory gets further enhanced as classroom members present different perspectives and arguments.</p>
<p>Another key outcome experienced by the students is <italic>critical thinking</italic>. In fact, marketing educators have written extensively on the need for critical thinking (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0273475311430812">Catterall, Maclaran, &amp; Stevens, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0273475311430812">Easton, 2002</xref>). Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0273475311430812">Roy and Macchiette (2005)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0273475311430812">Sautter (2007)</xref> have suggested classroom debate/discussion as a tool to enhance the critical thinking skills of marketing students. But what is critical thinking? <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0273475311430812">Dehler, Welsh, and Lewis (2001)</xref> state that critical thinking includes the ability to identify, analyze, and present arguments; distinguish fact from judgment and knowledge from belief; and maintain intellectual standards such as accuracy, evidentiary support, logicalness, fairness, and clarity. In the present context, the students are forced to exhibit their critical thinking as they ponder and debate over the answers to the discussion questions. The findings indicate that a significant 19.57% responses fall in this learning outcome category, which augurs well for this pedagogy.</p>
<p>Another learning outcome felt by the students is <italic>transfer ability</italic>. Learning today is getting very complex with students being overloaded with information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0273475311430812">Ng, 2006</xref>). In such a situation, the marketing student will be judged not by his or her learning ability but the ability to apply the knowledge gained, also termed as <italic>transfer ability</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0273475311430812">Boyer, 1990</xref>). Therefore, the marketing courses are designed to enable the student to integrate theory and practice toward solving real-world marketing problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0273475311430812">Haas &amp; Wotruba, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0273475311430812">Harich, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0273475311430812">Karns, 1993</xref>). In this direction, the participatory photo novel has a significant role to play as it forces the students to understand theory and apply that knowledge to create a compelling story. Furthermore, in the discussion round, the students are required to apply the theory in other contexts as well. The results indicate that 15.71% responses have been classified in this category.</p>
<p><italic>Creative thinking</italic> is another learning outcome suggested by the findings, which is valuable for the marketing curriculum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0273475311430812">Ng, 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0273475311430812">Alvino (1990)</xref> defines creative thinking as “a novel way of seeing or doing things that is characterized by four components—fluency (generating many ideas), flexibility (shifting perspective easily), originality (conceiving of something new), and elaboration (building on others’ ideas)” (p. 50). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0273475311430812">McCorkle, Payan, Reardon, and Kling (2007)</xref> examined both student perceptions about creativity and their levels of creativity. Their results reveal that both business and marketing students perceive creativity as important to their career, with the latter placing greater importance. Constructing participatory photo novel is definitely an act of creativity and should augment the creative thinking ability of the participants. In fact, as per the results, the students found creative thinking as the most prominent learning outcome with 24.42% responses being classified under this category.</p>
<p><italic>Communication skills</italic> are crucial to the success of marketing professionals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0273475311430812">Petkus, 2007</xref>). Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0273475311430812">Young and Murphy (2003)</xref> have observed that accreditation requirements, academic research, and feedback from employers, campus recruiters, and alumni consistently and clearly state that communication skills are essential for the success of marketing students. In fact, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0273475311430812">Crittenden, Crittenden, and Hawes (1999)</xref> have suggested a team approach to case analysis toward strengthening oral and written communications. Likewise, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0273475311430812">Bridges (1999)</xref> has proposed oral case exams in marketing to augment the oral communication skills of the students. In the present case, the process of writing a compelling story, converting that into a dialogue format, and finally converting it into a photo novel format is bound to enhance the communication skills of the participations. Furthermore, the discussion round will also add to the oral communication skills of the students. As per the results, a modest 11.68% of the responses have been classified under the category of communication skills.</p>
<p><italic>Leadership</italic>, which is the ability to influence others to achieve organizational goals, was also reported to be a learning outcome of the present exercise. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0273475311430812">Duke (2002)</xref> reveals that marketing students place highest importance to leadership and interpersonal skills with respect to learning outcomes. Additionally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0273475311430812">Barr and McNeilly (2002)</xref> state that internships, part-time jobs, and leadership positions in extracurricular organizations are viewed by job recruiters as better indicators of employability than classroom experiences. The participatory photo novel project group will invariably witness the emergence of one or more leaders as the work progresses. Members who remain as followers also get to know the attributes of successful leaders, which can act as important learning points for them. As far as the results of the content analysis go, this was the least prominent learning outcome felt by the students who participated in the feedback process. There were 8.28% responses classified under this learning outcome category, which is quite modest.</p>
<p>As the findings indicate, the student evaluation can be even structured around the six learning outcomes. In other words, the students can be assessed individually or collectively on understanding and knowledge, critical thinking, transfer ability, creative thinking, communication skills, and leadership ability demonstrated by them through their photo novel creation and classroom discussion.</p>

<title>Future Research</title>
<p>Overall, the author found that the assignment contributed to student learning in a significant way. However, there is a serious need to measure the same more objectively and compare the results with respect to learning gained using traditional pedagogical tools such as the lecture method. Specifically, the following research questions can be investigated by interested educators:</p>
<list id="list5-0273475311430812" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Is the photo novel an effective medium for communicating marketing concepts? If so, which concepts are best suited for communication using this tool?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Is a photo novel more effective in attracting and sustaining student interest compared with a traditional textbook? How does it compare with textbooks with respect to important learning outcomes?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Is the participatory photo novel a more effective tool to promote organizational storytelling than traditional textbooks or lectures?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>How does the photo novel compare with another popular genre such as the graphic novel in terms of attracting and sustaining student interest, learning delivered, and promotion of organizational storytelling?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Is the participatory photo novel more effective in learning marketing concepts compared with traditional lecture method?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Does this pedagogy provide higher student satisfaction as compared with a traditional alternative such as the lecture method?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Is this pedagogical tool more effective among certain demographic segments (e.g., executive students, females, etc.) in delivering learning on marketing subjects?</p></list-item></list>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0273475311430812">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>This project does take away lot of leisure time of the students. They need to brainstorm on suitable scripts and then go searching for suitable locations, actors, props, and so on. All these can affect their time commitment to other subjects and their subsequent overall performance. Therefore, this assignment should also be “positioned” as an opportunity to learn “time management” in order to gain the full acceptance of the students. Moreover, an additional motivational approach can be positioning the assignment as a holistic one (or “combo project”) that will help them in learning the marketing concepts, stimulating higher order thinking, and enhancing key soft skills—all in one.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this pedagogy practically does away with the traditional lecture method as the classroom discussions eat away most of the available time. Therefore, educators trying this pedagogy for the first time should resist their natural desire to use the lecture method. Even the students may initially ask for the traditional lecture method, which is easy on them, as it does not require them to play any active role. Furthermore, this pedagogy may require the faculty to spend plenty of time with the students outside the classroom—sacrificing valuable time for research and subject preparation—in solving their queries and providing necessary guidance. However, the immense satisfaction derived at the end makes all this pain and sacrifice appear insignificant.</p>
<p>Besides, there can be significant monetary expenses involved as students go overboard and start searching for best actors, props, locations, printing quality, and so on. It is essential that they are advised to keep production expenses minimal, irrespective of the funding decision of the institute. In fact, they should be encouraged to find out innovative ways to overcome the various resource constraints. Regarding printing expenses, around two to five copies per title can be printed for keeping in the institute physical library. This should be approved by the faculty as some photo novels may not be of a reasonable standard and, therefore, there can be no reason to print them. The total printing expenses will be very modest given the fewer number of hard copies required and the declining printing costs (thanks to improving technology) and, therefore, should be definitely bearable for any institute.</p>
<p>Plus, there is always an initial resistance among students to take up a project that is very demanding in terms of time and effort. Therefore, it is strongly recommended that this pedagogy is restricted to the first term of the graduate business school students, when the members are most enthusiastic and have lot of buffer time with them. This was one reason why the present author was successful in introducing this pedagogical innovation among graduate students. Another reason could be the fact that most students in India join graduate business schools usually without any work experience. (Fortunately, this trend is slowly changing for the better.) Therefore, teaching business management to such students using the lecture method is quite challenging as they are unable to relate to many business situations. The participatory photo novel project forces the students to gain a deeper understanding of the business world and thus leads to superior learning.</p>
<p>Needless to say, this pedagogy should be immensely more successful in an undergraduate program, where the level of maturity of students is significantly lower and they may take this assignment more joyfully rather than cynically, as was experienced by the author initially in the case of MBA students. However, as these graduate students get engaged in the exercise, they start discovering the joy of learning delivered through this pedagogy and see value being delivered.</p>
<p>A typical textbook chapter, say, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0273475311430812">Kotler and Armstrong (2009)</xref>, depending on the depth of content, may require two to three photo novels to cover it adequately. Furthermore, usually only one photo novel can be properly discussed in a single session of 60 minutes. Therefore, for a 20-chapter textbook, around 50 sessions may be required to fully cover the subject. If the institute curriculum allows only 35 to 40 sessions per course, a typical marketing subject cannot be fully addressed by the participatory photo novel pedagogy. The faculty can then decide which topics he or she would like to address using the traditional lecture method. Ideal topics for the lecture method can be the ones involving significant quantitative techniques or complex theoretical frameworks. Another alternative would be to redesign the entire curriculum of the marketing subject, say, Principles of Marketing, in terms of syllabus and total number of classroom contact hours so that there is no need for lecture sessions.</p>
<p>It is in the faculty’s control to ensure that students working for any assigned topic do not neglect the topics covered by other groups, thus diminishing their overall knowledge. One recommended solution is keeping some marks especially reserved to reward individual students who adequately participate in discussions centered on photo novels created by other groups. Executing this, of course, becomes very tedious for the lone faculty if the classroom size is large. A suggested solution is to have the class participation videotaped for grading individual performance later.</p>
<p>The present author has just a degree in engineering and subsequently management. What might have helped the author was probably an introductory course in filmmaking done privately, and more out of curiosity, over 8 weekend evenings in the year 2008. The course was modestly priced at $200. Nowadays, you have such courses, with varying duration, delivered using a variety of modes suiting the requirements of the learners. Attending such a course, however, is not at all necessary to make this pedagogy successful. This is because photo novels do not use sound and moving images and many other things that are essential in cinema. In fact, there is plenty of literature available freely on the Internet to guide interested academics to understand the process of developing and publishing photo novels (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0273475311430812">Dorance, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0273475311430812">Nimmon &amp; Begoray, 2008</xref>). Furthermore, there is no need for academics to have any relevant background in terms of formal arts education and/or experience in order to do better, though having such a background may provide an added advantage.</p>
<p>A point that is to be noted here is this that the students are not expected to produce photo novels that are flawless, in terms of scripting, acting, editing, production quality, relevance, and so on. They should just ensure that the photo novel is centered on an interesting story that is relevant to the assigned marketing topic. Period. For an academic wanting to use this pedagogy, enthusiasm and the eagerness to acquire new skills and knowledge and gain unique experiences are the key prerequisites. That is what exactly happened with the present author.</p>
<p>Once this new learning takes place, the faculty is more empowered to create different and innovative pedagogies to provide experiential/active learning to his or her students such as the use of photo essays, photo films, photography, drama, and so on in doing projects on assigned marketing or other subject topics and thus deliver a superior learning experience.</p>

<title>Implications and Conclusions</title>
<p>This project compares well with other well-known graduation projects such as simulations, case studies, or real-world projects. Case studies are largely known for testing and improving the analytical skills of the participants. In that context, the present project is superior as it delivers more learning outcomes. Regarding simulation, this project can be considered at par with respect to learning outcomes. However, participatory photo novel may not be as good as a real-world project, but then given the paucity of such projects (and companies nowadays are very guarded about revealing their problems and key inside information), the present pedagogy appears to be a good alternative.</p>
<p>The conduct of the participatory photo novel led to a buildup of a high degree of excitement and energy among the participants during both the execution stage as well as the discussion stage, as witnessed by the author. The students learned new skills such as photography, scriptwriting, and so on, which they regarded as valuable incentives. The photo novels made by the students contributed to the existing learning resources of the institute. The project also helped the institute in providing a differentiated classroom experience that was highly appreciated by the parents, accreditation bodies (e.g., All India Council for Technical Education for management and engineering institutes in India), and the faculty members. The feedback given by the parents was conveyed by their wards. The All India Council for Technical Education team that visited the institute for inspection commented favorably on this pedagogy, which was showcased to them. Finally, the faculty colleagues at the institute greatly appreciated the author for this unique initiative.</p>
<p>It is hoped that the use of participatory photo novel as a pedagogical tool can go a long way in augmenting learning resources, popularizing of this genre of literature, providing the young generation business students with a unique learning experience, and delivering important skills such as critical thinking, creative thinking, transfer ability, communication skills, and leadership ability.</p>
<p>It is also believed that the technique can be equally effective for teaching various other management subjects such as organizational behavior, entrepreneurship, principles of management, business communication, and so forth. Finally, the learning outcomes identified by the students are the ones advocated by the liberal arts education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0273475311430812">Petkus, 2007</xref>). Therefore, promoting the participatory photo novel tool can contribute to the development of more well-rounded students having a very broad and enlightened perspective with the ability to see the implications of the marketing processes in a global context.</p>
