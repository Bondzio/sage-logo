<p>The discovery that dental pulp stem cells are capable of differentiating into endothelial cells raises the exciting possibility that these cells can be a single source of odontoblasts and vascular networks in dental tissue engineering. The purpose of this study was to begin to define signaling pathways that regulate endothelial differentiation of SHED.

In vivo</italic>, VEGFR1-silenced SHED seeded in tooth slice/ scaffolds and transplanted into immunodeficient mice showed a reduction in human CD31-positive blood vessels as compared with controls (p = 0.02). Exposure of SHED to EGM2-MV supplemented with VEGF induced potent activation of ERK and Akt signaling, while it inhibited phosphorylation of STAT3. Notably, genetic (MEK1 silencing) or chemical (U0126) inhibition of ERK signaling restored constitutive STAT3 phosphorylation and inhibited the differentiation of SHED into endothelial cells. Collectively, analysis of these data unveiled the VEGF/MEK1/ERK signaling pathway as a key regulator of the endothelial differentiation of dental pulp stem cells.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Dental pulp tissue engineering is emerging as a potential treatment alternative for necrotic immature permanent teeth. Engineering of dental pulp requires the generation of a complex tissue, composed of odontoblasts, sensory cells, supportive fibroblasts, and a functional vascular network. Stem cells from exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHED) are capable of differentiating into functional odontoblasts that secrete mineralizable dentin matrices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022034512466263">Casagrande <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022034512466263">Sakai <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Dental pulp stem cells can also differentiate into vascular endothelial cells that form functional blood vessels that anastomize with the host vasculature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022034512466263">d’Aquino <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022034512466263">Iohara <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022034512466263">Cordeiro <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022034512466263">Sakai <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). Therefore, SHED are uniquely suited for dental pulp engineering, since they generate functional dental pulp while providing a vascular network that supplies the oxygen and nutrients required for the high metabolic demands of cells that are engaged in tissue regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022034512466263">Casagrande <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>). An understanding of the signaling pathways involved in the endothelial differentiation of dental pulp stem cells is critical for the optimization of methods to translate dental tissue engineering to the clinic.</p>
<p>Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a potent inducer of angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022034512466263">Hoeben <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). Emerging evidence demonstrates that VEGF can function as an inducer of differentiation of human adipose-derived stem cells into endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022034512466263">Cao <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022034512466263">Behr <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>). However, the effect of VEGF on the differentiation of dental pulp stem cells is unknown. We have recently shown that SHED constitutively express the membrane-bound vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)-1 and its co-receptor neuropilin (NP)-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022034512466263">Sakai <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). VEGFR1 is widely expressed in normal and malignant tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022034512466263">Fan <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022034512466263">Roy <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022034512466263">Cao, 2009</xref>) and modulates the angiogenic potential of cells exposed to VEGF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022034512466263">Kearney <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022034512466263">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). Interestingly, VEGF induced VEGFR2 up-regulation in SHED, which was correlated with other evidence of endothelial differentiation of these cells. Analysis of our data, collectively, suggested that VEGFR1 is the receptor responsible for VEGF-induced endothelial differentiation, which is demonstrated by an increase in the expression of VEGFR2 along with CD31 and VE-cadherin, and an increase in capillary sprout formation in 3-D matrices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022034512466263">Sakai <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Here, we will focus on the downstream signaling events triggered by VEGF signaling in SHED.</p>
<p>It has been shown that the MAPK pathway is critical for endothelial differentiation of bone marrow stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022034512466263">Xu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). Further, in adipose-derived stem cells, it is the PI3K-Akt pathway that regulates endothelial differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022034512466263">Cao <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022034512466263">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>). We know that both Akt and ERK signaling pathways are induced by VEGF in SHED (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022034512466263">Sakai <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>), but we do not know which pathways are required for this process. Therefore, the overall goal of the project is to understand the signaling pathways that regulate the differentiation of SHED into endothelial cells.</p>

<title>Cell Culture</title>
<p>Human Stem cells from Exfoliated Deciduous Teeth (SHED) were isolated from primary teeth and fully characterized, as we described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022034512466263">Miura <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>). SHED were cultured in alpha-MEM medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Invitrogen) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. We induced endothelial differentiation by culturing SHED cells with endothelial cell growth medium (EGM-2MV; Lonza, Walkersville, MD, USA) supplemented with 50 ng/mL rhVEGF<sub>165</sub> (R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA), referred to as ‘differentiation medium’ throughout this manuscript. The cell culture medium was changed every 2 days in all experiments included here. We assessed endothelial differentiation <italic>in vitro</italic> by determining the expression of 2 endothelial markers (VEGFR2 and CD31) by Western blot and RT-PCR. Human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMEC; Lonza) were used as positive control. To evaluate cell morphology, we cultured SHED cells in 8-well chamber slides (Fisher, Rochester, NY, USA) in alpha-MEM or EGM2-MV medium with or without rhVEGF supplementation. Alexa Fluor 488 phalloidin (Invitrogen) was used for visualization of the cytoskeleton (F-Actin; green), and nuclei were stained with DAPI (Prolong Gold; Invitrogen).</p>

<title>Lentiviral-mediated Gene Silencing</title>
<p>Gene silencing was performed with lentiviral vectors encoding shRNA constructs, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022034512466263">Sakai <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Briefly, 293T cells were transiently co-transfected with lentivirus packaging vector psPAX2, pMD2.G, and shRNA-C (control), shRNA-VEGFR1 or shRNA-MEK1 (Vector Core, University of Michigan) with calcium phosphate. We used supernatants containing lentiviruses to infect SHED overnight, and then cells were selected with 1 μg/mL puromycin (InVivogen, San Diego, CA, USA) for at least 1 wk. Infection efficiency was determined by fluorescence, and gene silencing by Western blot.</p>

<title>Tooth Slice/Scaffold Assay</title>
<p>To evaluate the role of VEGFR1 in the differentiation of SHED into endothelial cells <italic>in vivo</italic>, we seeded SHED stably transduced with shRNA-VEGFR1 (SHED-shRNA-VEGFR1) or control shRNA (SHED-shRNA-C) in a human tooth slice/scaffold, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022034512466263">Cordeiro <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). Briefly, 1-mm-thick tooth slices were obtained from healthy human third molars. The pulp chamber of the tooth slice was filled with sieved NaCl, and a PLLA/chloroform solution was gently dropped, soaking the salt. After 24 hrs, tooth slice/scaffolds were washed with Milli-Q water to remove the salt, and scaffolds were re-hydrated/ disinfected with decreasing concentrations of ethanol (100%-70%). Cells (6 x 10<sup>5</sup>) were seeded in each tooth slice/scaffold that was transplanted subcutaneously into the dorsum of severe combined immunodeficient mice (CB.17 SCID; Charles River, Wilmington, MA, USA). After 28 days, specimens were retrieved and fixed with IHC Zinc Fixative (BD Pharmingen, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) for 24 hrs at 4<sup>o</sup>C and demineralized with Decalcifier II (Surgipath; Richmond, IL, USA) for 24 hrs at room temperature. Hematoxylin-eosin staining and immunohistochemistry with rabbit anti-human CD31 (Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, TX, USA) were used to evaluate the morphology and microvessel density. Vessels were counted in 5 fields <italic>per</italic> tooth slice by a calibrated evaluator (ICC = 0.95) in a blinded fashion. This work was done under a protocol reviewed and approved by the appropriate institutional committee.</p>

<title>Time-course of the Differentiation of SHED into Endothelial Cells</title>
<p>To evaluate the effect of VEGF on endothelial differentiation, we exposed SHED to EGM-2MV supplemented with rhVEGF<sub>165</sub> and observed cells with acquired mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022034512466263">Fig. 1A</xref>) and protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022034512466263">Fig. 1B</xref>) expression of endothelial markers (VEGFR2 and CD31). In contrast, SHED cultured in α-MEM without rhVEGF<sub>165</sub> did not express endothelial markers for up to 28 days (data not shown). VEGFR2 and CD31 mRNA expression was highest 1 day after exposure to the differentiation medium and then tapered off (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022034512466263">Fig. 1A</xref>). Interestingly, VEGFR2 protein expression was observed after 7 days of treatment and lasted for 28 days, while CD31 expression was strong from day 7 through day 21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022034512466263">Fig. 1B</xref>). Qualitative morphological evaluation revealed that SHED exposed to EGM-2MV, whether containing VEGF or not, became elongated, when compared with controls cultured in alpha-MEM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022034512466263">Fig. 1C</xref>). Analysis of these data, collectively, characterizes culture conditions with EGM2-MV supplemented with rhVEGF<sub>165</sub> that induce the differentiation of dental pulp stem cells into endothelial cells.</p>

<title>VEGFR1 Silencing Inhibits Endothelial Differentiation of SHED <bold><italic>in vivo</italic></bold></title>
<p>We have previously reported that VEGFR1 is constitutively expressed in SHED (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022034512466263">Sakai <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). We have also observed that SHED-LacZ differentiate into human blood vessels when seeded in tooth slice/scaffolds and transplanted into immunodeficient mice, as determined by the consistent presence of B-galactosidase-positive blood vessels in the resulting pulp chambers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022034512466263">Cordeiro <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). However, the role of VEGFR1 signaling in the endothelial differentiation of SHED <italic>in vivo</italic> is unknown. Here, VEGFR1-silenced SHED or SHED transduced with control lentiviral vector (shRNA-C) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022034512466263">Fig. 2E</xref>) were seeded into tooth slice/scaffolds and transplanted into immunodeficient mice.

<title>MEK1/ERK Signaling is Required for Endothelial Differentiation of SHED <italic>in vitro</italic></title>
<p>To begin to evaluate the signaling events involved in the endothelial differentiation of SHED, we exposed cells to EGM2-MV supplemented with VEGF and evaluated phosphorylation of key signaling molecules. We observed that ERK and Akt became phosphorylated within 15 min of exposure to the differentiation medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022034512466263">Fig. 3A</xref>). This was followed by de-phosphorylation of STAT3, which is constitutively active in SHED (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022034512466263">Fig. 3A</xref>). To evaluate a potential crosstalk between these pathways, we exposed SHED to the differentiation medium in the presence of well-characterized chemical inhibitors of STAT3 (Stattic V), PI3k/Akt (LY294002), or MEK/ERK (UO126). This experiment revealed that inhibition of ERK signaling with U0126 prevented differentiation medium-induced de-phosphorylation of STAT3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022034512466263">Fig. 3B</xref>). Analysis of these data suggests the existence of crosstalk between ERK and STAT3 in SHED cells exposed to the differentiation medium. Notably, while inhibition of STAT3 or Pl3k/Akt pathway inhibited SHED proliferation, inhibition of MEK/ERK did not have such an effect under the experimental conditions used here (Appendix Fig.).</p>

<p>To define a functional role for ERK signaling in the acquisition of an endothelial phenotype by SHED cells, we inhibited this pathway using 2 complementary strategies, a chemical (U0126) and a genetic (shRNA-MEK1) approach. SHED exposed to differentiation medium in the presence of U0126 no longer presented an elongated shape suggestive of endothelial differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0022034512466263">Fig. 4A</xref>). Notably, induction of the endothelial cell marker (VEGFR2) by the differentiation medium was completely inhibited by treatment with the ERK inhibitor U0126 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0022034512466263">Fig. 4C</xref>). Similar results were observed when ERK signaling was inhibited by silencing MEK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0022034512466263">Fig. 4D</xref>), the upstream kinase that phosphorylates ERK. SHED stably transduced shRNA-MEK1 and, exposed to differentiation medium, no longer expressed VEGFR2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0022034512466263">Fig. 4E</xref>). In contrast, inhibition of PI3k/Akt signaling with LY294002 did not affect SHED morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0022034512466263">Fig. 4A</xref>), nor did it prevent expression of the endothelial marker VEGFR2 induced by the differentiation medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0022034512466263">Fig. 4B</xref>). Collectively, these results demonstrate that specific signaling through MEK1/ERK is required for the endothelial differentiation of SHED.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We have recently demonstrated that human dental pulp stem cells differentiate into functional human blood vessels in immunodeficient mice, broadly recapitulating the differentiation steps observed in embryonic vasculogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022034512466263">Sakai <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). To generate functional blood vessels, dental pulp stem cells had to undergo differentiation into endothelial cells, organize themselves into capillary structures, and anastomize with the host vasculature. While the cellular events leading to the differentiation of dental pulp stem cells into endothelial cells have been partially characterized, the molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways underlying the acquisition of the vasculogenic fate are not known. Such knowledge may accelerate the translation of dental pulp stem-cell-based therapies to the clinic.</p>
<p>We have shown that SHED cultured in tooth slice scaffolds in α-MEM supplemented with rhVEGF<sub>165</sub> express endothelial markers suggesting their differentiation into endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022034512466263">Sakai <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). We hypothesized that angiogenic factors residing in the dentin matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022034512466263">Roberts-Clark and Smith, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022034512466263">Zhang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>) or stromal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022034512466263">Tran-Hung <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>), together with rhVEGF<sub>165</sub>, triggered signaling pathways that were sufficient to induce endothelial differentiation of SHED. Here, we explored the possibility of creating differentiation conditions that were sufficient to induce endothelial differentiation of dental pulp stem cells without the tooth slice, which would facilitate mechanistic signaling studies. We discovered that the endothelial growth medium (EGM2-MV), which contains rhEGF, hydrocortisone, 5% fetal bovine serum, rhbFGF, R3-IGF-1, ascorbic acid, and 2 ng/mL rhVEGF supplemented with an additional 50 ng/mL rhVEGF, provides an inductive stimulus that allows for endothelial differentiation of SHED in monolayer culture. This culture condition (‘differentiation medium’) was used thereafter for the mechanistic studies included here.</p>
<p>VEGFR2 and CD31 are expressed primarily by vascular endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022034512466263">Albelda <italic>et al</italic>., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022034512466263">Yamaguchi <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>). Both have been used as markers of endothelial differentiation of bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022034512466263">Quirici <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022034512466263">Xu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). In contrast, VEGFR1 is widely expressed in normal and malignant tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022034512466263">Fan <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022034512466263">Roy <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022034512466263">Cao, 2009</xref>) and modulate the angiogenic potential of cells exposed to VEGF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022034512466263">Kearney <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022034512466263">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). Indeed, we have observed that VEGFR1 is constitutively expressed by undifferentiated SHED cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022034512466263">Sakai <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). Here, it was observed that VEGFR1-silenced SHED showed less angiogenic potential <italic>in vivo</italic> than controls, suggesting that VEGFR1 signaling plays an important role in endothelial differentiation of dental pulp stem cells. We postulate that VEGFR1 signaling allows for the differentiation of dental pulp stem cells into endothelial cells, as demonstrated by the acquisition of VEGFR2 and CD31 expression over time.</p>
<p>STAT3 phosphorylation is sufficient to maintain stem cells in an undifferentiated state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022034512466263">Matsuda <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>). In contrast, unstimulated stem cells express low levels of phosphorylated ERK and AKT, while cells that are induced to undergo differentiation exhibit an increase in ERK and Akt phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022034512466263">Cao <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022034512466263">Xu <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022034512466263">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>). Here, we observed that unstimulated SHED express high levels of phosphorylated STAT3 and that exposure of these cells to the differentiation medium quickly inhibits (within 30 min) STAT3 activity, which is in line with the observation that STAT3 activity correlates with stemness. Surprisingly, the inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation with STATTIC V enhanced ERK, but not Akt phosphorylation, beyond what was achieved with the differentiation medium. Further, inhibition of ERK with U0126 allowed for recovery of STAT3 phosphorylation in SHED cells that were induced to differentiate. To characterize the functional relevance of ERK signaling, we inhibited ERK with U0126 or by silencing MEK1 expression and observed that SHED cells no longer differentiated into endothelial cells. Finally, we observed that inhibition of PI3K/Akt resulted in slowdown in cell proliferation and/or induction of cell death, but had no effect on the regulation of SHED stemness/differentiation. In contrast, inhibition of ERK had no effect on cell proliferation/survival, but had a profound effect on cell differentiation. These findings suggest a cause-effect relationship between ERK inhibition and maintenance of STAT3 phosphorylation, which is consistent with ERK’s role in the regulation of SHED stemness. Collectively, these results demonstrate the existence of bi-directional crosstalk between STAT3 and ERK signaling that plays a critical role in the regulation of dental pulp stem cell fate.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this work unveiled a pathway triggered by VEGF/MEK1 signaling that results in the inverse and reciprocal regulation of STAT3 and ERK activity that results, in turn, in the differentiation of primary tooth pulp stem cells into endothelial cells and the importance of VEGF signaling through VEGFR1 for this process. Such studies may offer clues into the mechanisms regulating cell differentiation during odontogenesis. In addition, the understanding of signaling pathways will be critical to exploit the differentiation potential of dental pulp stem cells in regenerative medicine.</p>
