<abstract>
<p>The nonproliferation of weapons agenda was entirely about chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear weapons because they were seen as the most threatening to human existence and the security of the most powerful countries. Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALW), which have been instrumental to massive destruction of life and property, began to receive a serious attention from world leaders in the 1990s. Consequently, this article is concerned with the problems of controlling the proliferation of SALW in the Niger Delta of Nigeria. It argues that supply implicitly obeys the demand for SALW because it lacks a control factor. The presence of such a factor makes the acquisition of nuclear capability very difficult. Therefore, the effective control of SALW’s proliferation would depend not only on controlling local demand factors but also on the presence of a supply control factor.</p>

<p>Weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and small arms and light weapons (SALW) are traditionally distinguished by their capacity for massive destruction. Thus, WMD is used to refer to weapons that have an enormous destructive capacity while those thought otherwise are labeled SALW. Historically, the number of deaths caused by both categories of weapons makes this distinction untenable. As Mueller has observed, the destructive potential of biological and chemical weapons, and ballistic missiles—on the basis of which they are considered as WMD—is exaggerated.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0095327X12446925">1</xref>
</sup> Indeed, SALW have killed more people than biological and chemical weapons, and ballistic missiles.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0095327X12446925">2</xref>
</sup> The difference between WMD and SALW is not just destructive capacity! Against this background, the recent literature on weapons considers several advantages of SALW over WMD, which make them very attractive to those desiring to acquire weapons (See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0095327X12446925">Table 1</xref>). Besides being cheaper to acquire and useful to the individual and nonstate and state actors, SALW are not subject to effective control factor.</p>

<p>There is hardly hue and cry about the intention to acquire SALW. Thus, leading weapons’ producing countries, particularly the United States and her western allies, are absolutely disinclined to the acquisition of nuclear power and other kinds of WMD by state actors they eagerly transfer SALW to.</p>
<p>SALW are sufficient for successfully undertaking a rebellion or engaging in armed conflict of all types: minor armed conflict (25 and &lt;1,000 deaths), intermediate armed conflict (25 and accumulated total of 1,000 deaths), and war (at least 1,000 deaths per year).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0095327X12446925">3</xref>
</sup> In Africa, SALW have changed the role of child soldiers in internal conflicts, and fueled cross border conflicts.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0095327X12446925">4</xref>
</sup> Such is the fluid security situation in Africa that armed conflicts have spilled over from Sudan to Chad, Liberia to Sierra Leone, Sierra Leone and Liberia to Guinea, and Uganda to western Kenya and DRC and back to Uganda.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0095327X12446925">5</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The United Nations’ (UN) resolutions that first expressed concern over SALW’s proliferation are Resolution 53/77 V, December 4, 1998; Resolution 53/77 S, December 1998 and Resolution 54/54, O, December 1, 1999. The UN is currently working toward a Small Arms Trade Treaty through its Program of Action to Prevent, Combat, and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects. Of its 192 members, 153, including the United States, voted in the General Assembly (GA) in 2010 in support of a Small Arms Trade Treaty.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0095327X12446925">6</xref>
</sup> It has planned a conference in 2012 to finalize work on the treaty.</p>
<p>However, the aim of this article is to examine the multiple stakes that support the proliferation of SALW in the Niger Delta (ND) of Nigeria. The stakes are communal power and state-bureaucratic or political power; the struggle for control of illegal oil trade routes; ownership of oil bearing territories and the question of ownership of oil and gas deposits while the stakeholders are youths; local chiefs and elders; oil companies; local, state, and federal governments; and international illegal oil trade syndicates. The article argues that supply implicitly obeys the demand for SALW because it lacks a control factor. The presence of such a factor makes the acquisition of nuclear capability very difficult. Therefore, the effective control of SALW’s proliferation would depend not only on controlling local demand factors but also on the presence of a supply control factor.</p>

<title>Study Area—Niger Delta</title>
<p>There are two concepts of ND: geographic and political. The geographic ND where most of Nigeria’s oil production takes place, encompasses three states—Rivers, Bayelsa, and Delta—and is about 5,600 square miles (14,400 square kilometers). The political concept includes the geographic ND and the surrounding states where oil prospecting and production also take place but in much less quantity. The federal government of Nigeria used the political concept for distributing compensatory development projects in oil producing states through the Oil Mineral Producing Areas Development Commission (OMPADEC) between 1992 and 1999. It switched to the use of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) in 2000.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0095327X12446925">7</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The focus of this article is the geographic ND, which is still endowed with an estimated 38 billion barrels of crude oil and 4,007 trillion cubic meters of gas reserves. As the fulcrum of oil production in Nigeria, the bulk of oil revenue/income is generated legally and illegally (bunkering) in the geographic ND. It is thus the attraction of Nigerian and non-Nigerian fortune seekers, and the Nigerian epicenter of illegal trading in SALW.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0095327X12446925">
<title>Study Population</title>
<p>The Ijaw cohabit Delta State part of the geographic ND with the Urhobo and Itsekiri ethnic groups. Relations among them in Warri area powerfully illustrate the history of decentralized system of British colonial domination where “the preservation of traditional authority structures allowed each ethnic group to maintain its own elites.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0095327X12446925">8</xref>
</sup> The development of separate ethnic identities around traditional structures, which started under colonialism, received a boost from oil production in Warri.</p>
<p>For a very long time, each group sought an affirmation of its claim to a part of Warri in government boundary demarcations and/or the court even as it coexisted peacefully, intermarrying, with other groups. Violence became Ijaw-Itsekiri instrument of territorial claims in 1997 as a result of the General Sani Abacha-led federal government’s relocation of the headquarters of the newly created Warri South Local Government Area from the Ijaw district of Ogbe-Ijoh to Itsekiri district of Ogidigben. The Urhobo were drawn into what became an Ijaw-Itsekiri-Urhobo tripartite violence when the Delta State military government attempted to resolve the ethnoterritorial conflicting territorial claims in Warri, administratively, with the “creation of four autonomous ethnic communities each with its own traditional ruler in early 1999.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0095327X12446925">9</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>However, identity and clientelist national politics have combined to produce shifting political alliances in Warri. Up until the second republic (1979–1983), the Itsekiri were in the same political alliance with the Yoruba, the second largest ethnic group in Nigeria<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0095327X12446925">10</xref>
</sup> while the Ijaw and Urhobo banded together in an opposing political alliance. But all the three groups have pursued their political objectives in the ruling Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) at the state and national levels since the reintroduction of party politics in 1999 even as they maintain separate ethnic identities.</p>
<p>But the Ijaw ethnic identity is the principal source of the political conflict largely responsible for SALW’s proliferation in ND. A self-estimation ranks them as the forth largest ethnic group in Nigeria.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0095327X12446925">11</xref>
</sup> While they constitute about 98 percent of the population of Bayelsa state, they are in varying degrees a minority group in Akwa Ibom, Bayelsa, Delta, Edo, Ondo, and Rivers states. Until 2010 when one of their own, Dr. Goodluck Jonathan became Nigeria’s president, they regarded themselves as a politically and economically marginalized group; more so because their native territory is the major source of Nigeria’s economic mainstay.</p>
<p>The Ogoni are another ethnic minority group in Rivers State who on the basis of their territory’s contribution to Nigeria’s oil wealth, formed the Movement for the Survival of Ogoni People (MOSOP) in 1990 to protest their political and economic marginalization. That Ogoni’s example touched off Ijaw’s sensitive chord is evident from the formation of the Ijaw National Congress, their umbrella ethnic organization; and Ijaw youth-led organizations such as the Movement for the Survival of Ijaw Ethnic Nationality (MOSSIEND) and Movement for Reparation to Ogbia (MORETO). Much later in 1998, they formed the Ijaw Youth Council (IYC) and announced the Kaima Declaration (more on this below). In the meantime, <italic>Egbesu</italic> <italic>Boys</italic>, an Ijaw youth organization served as an armed wing of Ijaw ethnic organizations. The Ijaw also joined other ND ethnic minorities to form the pan-Niger Delta Chicoco Movement in 1998 for resisting the Nigerian state and oil companies. This movement soon became extinct because of internal bickering and the fear of Ijaw domination by its member smaller ethnic nationalities.</p>

<sec id="section3-0095327X12446925">
<title>The Compensation Regime</title>
<p>The Nigerian law separately provides for compensation for the encroachment on land and pollution of the environment by the oil industry. Basically, the operative compensation laws since 1978 leave the determination of compensation not for encroachment on the land by itself but for landed assets—buildings and crops. However, seeking compensations through the courts was an arduous task. As Jedrzej George Frynas wrote,<disp-quote>
<p>The law has limitations as far as the claims of litigants suing oil companies are concerned. The rules of negligence, nuisance and strict liability offer a legal remedy for plaintiffs suing oil companies but each legal rule imposes specific limitations on the plaintiffs’ ability to sue. Even if a plaintiff can invoke a particular rule of tort law, oil companies can apply a number of standard legal defenses in court.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0095327X12446925">12</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In essence, constitutional and specific legal provisions on compensation for land and landed assets were not plaintiff friendly. General legal defenses oil companies employed to avoid paying compensations include “statutes of limitation, admissibility of scientific evidence, and misjoinder of parties.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0095327X12446925">13</xref>
</sup> Indeed, “oil companies had won a number of law suits by pleading sabotage.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0095327X12446925">14</xref>
</sup> To top it all off, the amendment to the Federal High Court Act 1993 striped state high courts, evenly spread across Nigeria, of jurisdiction over compensation suits! That meant that the court was no longer easily accessible to seekers of compensations since Federal High Courts are located far away in the capitals of their states.</p>
<p>Even where won, compensations did not often get to grassroots claimants, thanks to the Oil Pipelines Act.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0095327X12446925">15</xref>
</sup> This provides that compensations should be paid to the local Chief for administration on the basis of criteria established by the court. The Act allows the court to entrust its appointee with compensations for “application to the general social or educational advancement of that community or any section thereof.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0095327X12446925">16</xref>
</sup> Thus, compensations hardly got to legitimate claimants when they were eventually dispensed. Compensation mechanisms of oil companies and government generally favored the local elite—traditional rulers, chiefs, and contractors, leaving the youth helpless. A government’s own newspaper, <italic>Daily Times </italic>(Lagos) acknowledged the mass deprivation arising from the very selective system of compensation. As it put it, the Nigerian state is “the predatory, rapacious, even sadistic society which just takes without giving.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0095327X12446925">17</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>However, compensation improved tremendously during the late 1990s. In his tentative explanatory framework for compensations, Frynas assigns the greatest weight to the changing social attitudes of judges. For him, “public pressures and the existence of a new generation of judges” generated new court perceptions.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0095327X12446925">18</xref>
</sup> He thus begs the question of the cause of the new social attitudes of jurors since “new generation of judges” suggests a new set of judges and contradicts his factor of “changing social attitudes,” presumably of judges who have been on the bench unless he means paradigm shift.</p>
<p>If indeed, Frynas means paradigm shift, it is more reasonable to attribute the changing social attitudes of judges to the well documented evidence of ND minority and environmental rights movement in the early 1990s. This movement generated “public pressures” and, in turn, awareness among judges, old and new, about the effects of the activities of the oil industry on the host communities. But the improvement in compensations came too late and was too little for the expectations of the youth activists of ND who had been mobilized for a drastic revision of the principles of interregional resource allocation in Nigeria. Deprivation was ripe for exploitation for the pursuit of private and/or collective interest; and on hand as a pillar of support and justification even for the most banal individual interest. Hence, the unending violence in ND has mixed causes as a survey I conducted in September 2005 revealed: state repression, defense of the community, competition for power between individuals within communities and also between communities for state power, self-defense, quests for development projects, resource control, land disputes, and resistance of sea piracy.</p>

<title>How SALW’s Proliferation Got out of Hand</title>
<p>Europeans first introduced modern arms into Africa during their slave and/or colonial exploits. At independence in the 1960s, African states contracted three types of defense agreements, that is, agreements on military assistance, defense cooperation/technical assistance, and the establishment of military bases with their former colonial masters and emergent imperial powers. More than all others, defense assistance agreements allowed African countries to pursue an independent foreign policy including importation of arms from any other country.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0095327X12446925">19</xref>
</sup> Thus, by 1966, twenty nations were supplying arms to African states. Another source of supply of small arms in West Africa is local manufacturing in Ghana, Mali, and Nigeria. Most African countries were able to prevent arms from getting into too many private hands, thanks to the absence of civil wars. Thus, Africa remained largely war-free and politically stable from the sixties to the end of the eighties because the cold war helped to prevent the grievances of oppressed groups from exploding.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0095327X12446925">20</xref>
</sup> Those grievances exploded in internal wars when the polar security regime with its peculiar global defense strategy of containment withdrew its protection of the oppressive African political regimes at the beginning of the nineties.</p>
<p>In 1992, Sierra Leone joined Liberia, which had been engulfed by civil war since 1989, in an expanding war of attrition in West Africa. At the turn of the century, the military broke Ivory Coast’s record of political stability by overthrowing the civilian government and triggering sporadic violence. Each country’s conflict drew in the Economic Commission for West African States Peace Keeping Force (ECOMOG), a largely Nigerian military contingent.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0095327X12446925">21</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The demand for SALW triggered by these internal conflicts and international laxity consequent upon the end of the cold war, promoted profit concerns above strategic concerns.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0095327X12446925">22</xref>
</sup> Thus, cold war surpluses moved freely to conflict zones of the world with 40,000 old-fashioned nonetheless lethal St.G-58 assault rifles from Switzerland ending up in Africa and Asia. Other cold war SALW’s surpluses from the Czech Republic found their way to Southern African states such as Uganda, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Sudan, Angola, Central African Republic, and Ethiopia. Transfers have also occurred between African states. For example, unused RENAMO (Mozambican National Resistance Movement) weapons were transferred through a Tanzanian port to rebel groups in Burundi and Zaire (DRC).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0095327X12446925">
<title>The Foundation of a Violent Order</title>
<p>Traditionally, violence is used as a kind of jousting for political power all over Nigeria. The intersection of oil-induced armed rebellion, gang cruelty, and lawless electoral politics turned violence into an order of political and social relations in ND. The suppression of the Ogoni mass protest by the Nigerian military authorities, which began under General Ibrahim Babangida (1990–1993), reached its climax under General Sani Abacha on November 9, 1995, with the execution of its key leaders, Ken Saro-Wiwa and his eight Ogoni folks. That was more than another bristling of the opposition because it also disaccredited argumentation as a means of expressing grievances arising from Nigeria’s resource allocation system. General Abacha had many times before delivered dreadful blows to the opposition in his battle to keep state power he seized in November 1993. In 1995, he moved against two former military rulers, General Olusegun Obasanjo and his deputy, General Musa Shehu Yar’Adua, presumably for treason; secretly tried and sent them to prison.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0095327X12446925">23</xref>
</sup> Earlier in 1994, General Abacha forced key leaders of the National Democratic Coalition (NADECO), which was fighting for the revalidation of the June 12, 1993, Presidential Election into exile.</p>
<p>Flushed with success, General Abacha began mobilizing youths across the country toward a “two million man match” in the capital city of Abuja to demonstrate his popularity. To counter Abacha, the opposition planned a “five million man match” in Lagos, Nigeria’s erstwhile capital for the same day. In self-contradiction of popularity contest, Abacha used state security agents to disrupt the Lagos peaceful procession against him. It is more important to note that the Abuja procession of a rented crowd of few thousands for Abacha served the inadvertent function of exposing youths from ND to the reality of their deprivation. Many of them wondered whether they were in Europe and were able to make the connection between Abuja’s outlook and oil revenue derived from their impoverished land.</p>
<p>Thus in early December 1998, youths drawn from over forty Ijaw subgroups announced a new platform, namely, “Kaiama Declaration,” which articulates Ijaw grievances and strategies, for achieving recompense.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0095327X12446925">24</xref>
</sup> IYC also issued a document of 100 reasons the Ijaw should control the natural resources in their land.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0095327X12446925">25</xref>
</sup> They gave oil companies up to the end of December 1998 to meet their demand for a fair share of oil benefits or quit their land. Of course, oil companies ignored them. The state responded to the attempt of the youth militants to enforce compliance with more repression. Their united force decimated, they went their different ways.</p>
<p>It was about this time that the Nigerian military rulers under the leadership of General Abdulsalam Abubakar were reinvigorating the moribund transition to multiparty politics, thoughtfully captured as “permanent transition” by a volume on the sluggishness of the democratization of Nigeria.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0095327X12446925">26</xref>
</sup> Besides the help they could avail themselves with the possession of arms, armed youth militants were going to be relevant at three levels for ND politicians and elders in the burgeoning unprecedented high oil prices, which peaked at $147 per barrel in mid-2007.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0095327X12446925">27</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>First, they were to serve as a defense line and tool of armed struggle for the South–South geopolitical zone in the regional competition for resources in Nigeria. Their demand for a fair share of oil revenues and later resource control in numerous Declarations, Charters, or Bills of Rights had been ignored by the central government.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0095327X12446925">28</xref>
</sup> When the new President Olusegun Obasanjo’s government bowed to the pressures of their political leaders to apply the constitutional provision of the minimum of 13 percent derivation principle in the sharing of oil revenues, it commenced application from January 1, 2000, rather than May 29, 1999, when the 1999 Constitution came into effect. They had secured the reintroduction of derivation principle, which was wiped out in 1981 under President Shehu Shagari (northerner), at the 1994 Constitutional Conference. General Abacha convened the conference to buy time and douse the political tension generated by the annulment of the June 12, 1993, presidential election. The annulment pitted northern Nigeria against western Nigeria, the home region of the presumed winner, Chief Moshood Abiola. Given that 40 percent of oil production in Nigeria is done off-shore and the on-shore/off-shore dichotomy in oil revenue sharing employed by Obasanjo’s government, the oil producing minority states of ND actually received only 7.8 percent as derivation revenue. The Obasanjo government further alienated the six South–South oil producing states and their political leaders by going to the Supreme Court to seek validation of the on-shore/off-shore dichotomy, which he got on April 5, 2002. Spontaneous state government organized protests followed in Akwa Ibom and Delta states, which were the most devastated by the Supreme Court judgment. Mindful of the threat to his chances of reelection in 2003 by the loss of South–South support, Obasanjo sought to abolish the dichotomy through legislation. But the regional shade of the petulant struggle for oil revenues got a vent when the Kano Elders’ Forum (a northern Nigerian group), led by the Emir of Kano, moved to stop it.</p>
<p>The second relevance of youth militants to ND elders and politicians was twofold, that is, to help with externalizing the responsibility for mass impoverishment of their region and exact tolls from oil companies and federal government. With the first component, youth militancy provided cover for local misgovernance and misallocation of resources. It is not surprising that all former governors of geographic ND states, Dr. Peter Odili (Rivers), Chief James Ibori (Delta), and Chief Depreye Alamieasegha (Bayelsa) have been indicted or convicted for misappropriation of state funds. Despite huge revenue transfers to its state governments through the derivation principle, ND remained underdeveloped. The federal government and some non-ND Nigerian stakeholders of Nigeria often countered the allegation of neglect of ND youth militants made against them with references to the misappropriations of derivation revenues to pin the blame of underdevelopment of ND on its local political leaders. The misappropriation explanatory category of ND’s underdevelopment presumed that ND people freely chose and could bring their local representatives to account to them. But the massive disenfranchisement under Olusegun Obasanjo meant that those who emerged as ND political leaders were not chosen by their people. If a free election is the foundation of accountability in participatory democracy, the misappropriation explanatory category is self-contradictory.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, each time youth militants triggered a crisis, by for example, taking expatriate oil workers hostage, the elders/politicians used their mediatory role to enrich themselves. The Nigerian National Petroleum Company’s Group Managing Director, Abubakar Lawal Yar’Adua admitted to the House of Representatives Committee, which was probing the oil revenue earnings and remittances to the Federal Government in July 2008 that the federal government paid militants $12 million to be allowed to repair the damaged Charnomi pipeline in Delta State. The negotiations were facilitated by the elders/politicians. The bigger the accumulated wealth through mediation, contracts for the execution of oil projects and other kinds of patronage, the stronger the local politicians would be in the money-based contest for political power at the local council, state, and national levels.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0095327X12446925">29</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The third level of armed youth militants’ relevance to ND politicians was in the violent contest for elective offices. This was one of the greatest constraints on the Obasanjo Administration to effectively deal with the violence in ND. Others were ND’s terrain and the duplicity of security agents. Hence, an important solution to arms proliferation in ND is transparent elections.</p>
<p>For the three diverse functions, politicians have complemented the arming of ND by government and oil companies with the sponsorship and acquisition of guns for their loyal youth militants.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0095327X12446925">30</xref>
</sup> Consequently, strong self-interested individuals fix their eyes on oil-based financial resources and seek the voice and representative of the community to oil companies as chair and/or member of the council of chiefs or community development committee. With party politics comes a new constellation of interests. Politicians seeking state power or access to it, recruit already politically mobilized youths and arm them for their struggle with opponents. Those in government recruit some youths and arm them for their power bolstering or retention operations.</p>

<title>SALW: Agents and Victims in ND</title>
<p>Three days of helicopter gunship attacks in February 2006 in the federal government’s renewed offensive on illegal oil sales in the Ijaw village of Okerenkoko triggered the idea of the Movement for the Emancipation of Niger Delta (MEND). It instantly became the umbrella militant organization of the Ijaw.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0095327X12446925">31</xref>
</sup> The then spokesman of the Joint Military Task Force for the Niger Delta (JTF), Colonel Rabe Abubakar described MEND as “unpatriotic” and a bunch of “criminals.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0095327X12446925">32</xref>
</sup> Interestingly, ND academics/activists have also so characterized certain perpetrators of violence in their land.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0095327X12446925">33</xref>
</sup> There is a tendency then to distinguish between militants, cultists, and criminals on the basis of motivation in ND’s violence, which was at its peak in 2009. Such a distinction particularly by the Nigerian state authorities is based on the denial of marginalization and thus their responsibility for the violent order prevailing in the ND. If on the other hand, government has directly and indirectly admitted that ND has been marginalized, what minders of the state like others who distinguish between agents of oil induced violence do not know is that all counternormative behaviors of the marginalized express a form of politics.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0095327X12446925">34</xref>
</sup> Cult, criminal, and militant groups draw membership from the same pool of aggrieved persons. Thus, a government eighteen-member panel’s estimated 20,000 militants in ND very likely include criminals and cultists who play different roles in subaltern politics.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0095327X12446925">35</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>From all indications, cult gangs predated militant groups. But all belong to camps well known to government agencies. For example, the federal government admitted that it was aware of the existence of Camp 5 long before it ordered the JTF to attack and destroy it in May 2009. Thus, key agents in the arming of ND are cultists and militants. That it is meaningless distinguishing between ND violent agents of SALW as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0095327X12446925">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0095327X12446925">2</xref> below, is evident from their alliances.

<p>Mujahid Dokubo-Asari was the leader (President) of Ijaw Youth Congress (IYC), a nonviolent, civic group advocating justice and group rights for the Ijaw prior to the 2003 general elections. He formed the Niger Delta Peoples Volunteer Force (NDPVF) in 1999 for resisting the federal government. Tom’s violent bent and Asari’s immense political influence attracted Governor Peter Odili of Rivers State who was seeking reelection. Courted by Odili, Tom and Asari combined forces to work for his reelection.<sup>

<p>Other politicians in government and opposition political parties had also armed existing cult groups to seize political power using the 2003 elections as a smokescreen. Rivalry, criminal tendencies, and purported struggle for group rights eventually consolidated violence in ND. Violence first flared up on a large scale in the third quarter of 2004. Odili attempted disarmament of the militants but failed. The violence that reerupted between Asari’s NDPVF and NDVF in June–September 2005 caused 500 to 1,000 deaths and displaced 7,000s in Port Harcourt.<sup>

<title>Demand Factors of SALW</title>
<p>The demand factors of SALW (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0095327X12446925">table 2</xref>) are the security of oil installations, violent ethnic hostilities, illegal oil trade, and violent electoral politics.</p>
<p>There is no greater sign of the importance of oil in the Nigerian economy than the customary use of world oil price by the federal government since the 1973/1974 oil boom for budgeting. Crude oil’s contribution to national revenue is estimated at between 80 and 95 percent. Therefore, the security of the oil industry was an imperative from its beginning. Earliest security concerns were sabotage, theft, and vandalism, which could be checked with simple security measures. Examples are the 1987 Mpkanak and Iko blockades on Mobil Oil and Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC), respectively. In the 1990s, such protests increased not only in number but also in intensity. They increased security concerns among oil companies especially Chevron and SPDC as well as the federal government. Examples of ferocious sieges on oil companies during the early 1990s are Umuechem (1990), Yenagoa (1991), Obagi (1992), Bonny (1992), Brass (1993), Opueke (1994), Nembe Creek (1993), Rumuobiokani (1994), and Uzere (1994).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0095327X12446925">46</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>More hosting communities (Ekpan, Choba, Nembe, Abam Uruogu, etc.) blockaded oil company installations for reasons ranging from unfulfilled promises regarding youth employment, provision of amenities to the struggle for the ownership of sites of oil production activities during the late 1990s. In Nembe’s case, youth generational rivalry over SPDC’s patronage, “community relations,” in the forms of contracts, employment opportunities, and cash gifts proved very disruptive for SPDC. The first youth age band had successfully displaced the local elders as middleman between the community and SPDC and stirred the envy of two younger age bands, <italic>medium</italic> fish and <italic>little</italic> fish who were enjoying their exploits including drawing salaries from SPDC for doing no tasks. Abam Uruogu’s attack and looting of SPDC was the consequence of the struggle with Obeakpu for the control of SPDC’s patronage resources.</p>
<p>Thus, increasing threats to oil installations—flow stations, platforms, vessels, and pipelines—consequent upon the growing activism of hosting communities created multifarious security difficulties. “The upsurge in cases of disruption of oil operations not only became rampant but assumed a crisis proportion” as the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Chief Uffot Ekaette admitted to the Presidential Special Security Committee on Oil-Producing Areas chaired by the Chief of Defense Staff, General Alexander Ogomudia.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0095327X12446925">47</xref>
</sup> By 2008, government was paying heavily for the sieges on oil installations. According to Abubakar Lawal Yar’ Adua, “The price we pay is very high. It is difficult to get expatriates to work in the Niger Delta . . . we were losing $81 million [daily] to the problem” [Charnomi pipeline burst].<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0095327X12446925">48</xref>
</sup> Grave security demands also stemmed from the destruction of oil installations and facilities as kidnapping/killing of some oil company personnel. As a result, Nigeria’s oil production quota fell by an average of 25 percent between 2001 and 2010.</p>
<p>The above incidents led J. Peter Pharm to describe Nigeria as a potential theater of terrorism.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0095327X12446925">49</xref>
</sup> One may hazard that anti-US terrorists outside of Nigeria may well be putting their own spin on the legitimate but unattended grievances of the people of ND to sabotage oil supply to the world particularly from the confirmed report of the presence of mercenaries in the ND.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0095327X12446925">50</xref>
</sup> Indeed, the ongoing Boko Haram (an Islamic religious sect) terrorism in the northern part of Nigeria has been reported to have a link with Al Qaeda.</p>
<p>Ethnic violence is another SALW’s demand factor in ND. In its clearest intra-ethnic manifestation, youth gangs emerged against traditional authority and local bodies of elder or chief over the distribution of the benefits of money-based patronage dispensed by oil companies. They later took to criminal behavior including collaboration with wealthy people to steal “crude oil and refined petroleum” products.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0095327X12446925">51</xref>
</sup> If security for pipelines is effective, theft of crude oil will decrease and correspondingly, arms proliferation will diminish because of the absence of incentive to own small arms. The most recent presidential study on ND (Mitee’s 2008 Technical Committee Report) observed that the cooperation of the host oil-producing community is required for pipeline security. In this regard, it recommended US $2 per barrel for the community. This is a tall order for the federal government going by its past attitude to the sharing of oil revenues.</p>
<p>The violent transformation in 1997 of the Ijaw-Itsekiri age long conflict over ownership of various parts of Warri, Nigeria’s second largest oil city (after Port Harcourt), illustrates the inter-ethnic SALW’s demand factor. The immediate cause of the violence was the ownership/the hosting right of the headquarters of the South West Warri local government council, created in late 1996 under General Abacha’s military dictatorship. The Ijaw thought that the new local government was theirs since their province formed its largest part and should thus host its headquarters as originally announced. Thus, the Ijaw reacted violently to the relocation of the council’s headquarters from their Ogbe-Ijoh quarters to Ogidigben quarters of the Itsekiri. The pogrom that ensued spread from Warri metropolis to its environs.</p>
<p>According to John Ipoko, who fought on Ijaw’s side against the Itsekiri between 1997 and about 2003 when the Delta state government successfully brokered a truce, a community chief gave him twelve guns while another gave him four. He turned to armed robbery and other criminal activities after the cessation of hostilities because his sponsors did not give him enough financial resources for his rehabilitation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0095327X12446925">52</xref>
</sup> The President of Bayelsa State Youth Federation, Mr. Nengi James corroborated the relationship of the Ijaw-Itsekiri conflict to the arming of ND in a memorandum to the Judicial Commission of Inquiry into the Odioma communal conflict. According to him, this conflict stimulated the demand for arms in the Ekeremor area of Bayelsa State.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0095327X12446925">53</xref>
</sup> The <italic>Amayanabo</italic> (king) of Okrika (an Ijaw subgroup in Rivers State) kingdom, Chief Alfred Abam provides additional evidence of the role of ethnic conflict in SALW’s proliferation in a disclosure at a weapons’ surrender ceremony. According to him, NDVF was formed and armed as a vigilante group for protecting the Okrika people against their Ogoni adversary.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0095327X12446925">54</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The Ogomudia Report admits booming illegal oil trade as a factor in SALW’s proliferation in ND. Governor Peter Odili also referred to armed gangs’ “acts of gangsterism, cultism, and involvement in oil bunkering business and amassing of sophisticated offensive weapons/ammunition to defend their illegal activities.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0095327X12446925">55</xref>
</sup> Illegal trade in oil was possibly prompted by the oil boom in the 1970s. Ogomudia Report reveals that it began to flourish following the termination of naval patrol of the sea ways under General Ibrahim Babangida in 1985.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0095327X12446925">56</xref>
</sup> A senior naval officer confirmed General Babangida’s complicity in this trade to this author. According to him, Babangida told a newly posted flag staff officer who in response to the question, “how are you settling down?” declared his readiness “to tackle the bunkering business soon”: “You should be careful so that you are not consumed by it.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0095327X12446925">57</xref>
</sup> Babangida positively meant to use the termination of naval patrol for patronage and so, “highly placed and powerful individuals within the society” including serving and retired military personnel are involved in bunkering.<sup>58</sup>
</p>
<p>Bunkering is a very lucrative trade for foreign merchants since prices are much lower than those in the legal trade. It is estimated that illegal trade yields “between US$1.5 billion and US$4 billion per year.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-0095327X12446925">59</xref>
</sup> Against this background, the federal government’s renewed determination to stop it was bound to meet with stiff resistance, in turn, increased demand for arms. According to the former commander of the JTF, Brigadier-General Elias E. Zamani, armed gangs “exchange crude oil with weapons that are imported.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-0095327X12446925">60</xref>
</sup> Crude oil is also exchanged for rifles with international oil merchants.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-0095327X12446925">61</xref>
</sup> Similarly, militants acquire guns from raids on police posts and police officers killed in active duty.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-0095327X12446925">62</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Popular accounts corroborated by separate submissions of ND public figures including former Rivers State Director of State Security Service, Albert Horsefall, former Rivers State Governor, Rufus Ada-George, and Chairman of Nembe/Ogbolomabiri Council of Chiefs, Kien Diette-Spiff point to party politics as a strong SALW’s demand factor in ND.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-0095327X12446925">63</xref>
</sup> In Diette-Spiff’s testimony before the Senate Committee on Defense in Yenagoa in April 2005, politicians armed existing cult groups—Isenasawo and Isongufuro (Teme) in Nembe, Bayelsa state for the 2003 general elections.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-0095327X12446925">64</xref>
</sup> Dokubo also names cult groups that enjoyed the approval and patronage of the Rivers State government as Njemanze and Elegemface.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-0095327X12446925">65</xref>
</sup> The fact that they are not listed by the State’s Secret Cult and Similar Activities (Prohibition) Law, No. 6 of 2004 indirectly confirms his allegation that government presented them to the public as vigilante groups rather than “cult groups that they actually are.”</p>
<p>Mutually reinforcing political and economic goals have generated SALW’s demand factors in ND. Thus, when politicians arm the youth to fight elections, it is for securing a political position for gaining control of crude oil based resource allocation system. In the same vein, chieftaincy rivalries, youth group rivalries and intra- and inter-ethnic conflicts are generated from the “understanding that the control of the machinery of power and authority [at any of these local levels] places the individual or group at some advantage to receive compensation, royalty or patronage of all sorts from oil companies or government.”<sup>

<title>Supply Factors of SALW</title>
<p>As Reno has observed, the self-perpetuation in office project leads a leader to “distribute weapons and military expertise more widely in societies, often to local strongmen and youth groups not formally associated with armies or law enforcement agencies.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-0095327X12446925">67</xref>
</sup> General Sani Abacha pursued such a course from 1993 to 1998. “Once the civilian government took office in 1999, the demobilization of paramilitaries and security forces formed during General Abacha’s rule added to the Weaponry and military experts available to” militia groups.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-0095327X12446925">68</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Between 1996 and 2000, state and federal governments deployed seven security task forces to ND: Rivers State Internal Security Task Force, Joint Security Force, Operation Salvage, Operation Flush, Operation Storm, Operation Sweep, Operation Restore Hope, and the existing JTF.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69-0095327X12446925">69</xref>
</sup> The desire to get a slice of the huge recurrent security vote became a strong motivation to security personnel to serve on the government special security task force. Consequently, they became stakeholders in the continuation of a state of anarchy to justify their continued presence in ND. Some of the many cult groups in Port Harcourt claimed “that security operatives encouraged them to continue to feud,” ostensibly, for this reason.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn70-0095327X12446925">70</xref>
</sup> Some security agents have exploited the volatile security situation and terrain of ND to transfer government arms in their possession to civilian buyers by lying that they lost them to violent conflicts while on active duty or to a boat accident on the way to a duty post.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn71-0095327X12446925">71</xref>
</sup> The conviction in 2008 of six officers of the Nigerian army by a military tribunal for stealing and selling arms to MEND is a confirmation of this.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn72-0095327X12446925">72</xref>
</sup> In this regard, militarization has aggravated rather than checkmated restiveness in ND.</p>
<p>As the main oil companies operating onshore in ND, SPDC and Chevron-Texaco are faced with security problems to which they have responded with “security communitization,” “security privatization,” and “security corporatization.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn73-0095327X12446925">73</xref>
</sup> Security communitization is a “community youth security contract system.” It was within this security system that Dokubo-Asari served as a middleman between chiefs of “clusters” and Shell before he embarked on a violent resistance of the federal government.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn74-0095327X12446925">74</xref>
</sup> He helped to collect royalties on behalf of chiefs and their communities for the protection of Shell’s facilities. He also helped to collect compensations for oil spillages, some of which resulted from the vandalism by him, his boys, and corrupt Shell’s staff. The control of these clusters was partly responsible for the rivalry between Ateke Tom and Soboma George. Security communitization has caused more “disruptive violence than otherwise” because of retaliatory violence of the excluded youth militia groups.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn75-0095327X12446925">75</xref>
</sup> “Security privatization more broadly refers to the surge of specialized security companies/organizations and private military corporations (PMCs).”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn76-0095327X12446925">76</xref>
</sup> Oil companies maintain numerous such outfits in ND.</p>
<p>Security corporatization “also known as corporate militarism, refers to the increasing empowerment of some large business corporations to operate their own security outfits or to considerably run (equip, fund and/or command) a detachment of the state’s defense forces assigned to protect the corporation’s personnel and property.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn77-0095327X12446925">77</xref>
</sup> The major oil companies, SPDC, Chevron-Texaco, and Mobil-Exxon separately spend huge sums on a monthly basis on the allowances of government security personnel at their service.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn78-0095327X12446925">78</xref>
</sup> Some of these companies have confessed to acquiring and distributing arms to their security personnel including civilians for use in protecting their facilities.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn79-0095327X12446925">79</xref>
</sup> They have armed local factions “to ensure that communities in oil-producing areas did not unify to challenge them.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn80-0095327X12446925">80</xref>
</sup> Thus, armed youth organizations are used not only for their protection but also for suppressing “emergent politically assertive youth organizations.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn81-0095327X12446925">81</xref>
</sup> Among the Ogoni, Abacha armed Peacekeeping Movement in Ogoniland and Patriotic Ogoni Youth to weaken MOSOP. As Reno (1998) has pointed out, such a strategy “is the material for warlord politics” or the seed for SALW’s proliferation.</p>
<p>Governments spend much bigger amounts of money on security. In the words of Governor Odili, “never in the history of the state [Rivers State] has . . . huge funds been channeled towards internal security for the safety of lives and property.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn82-0095327X12446925">82</xref>
</sup> The 10.3 percent of Delta State’s 2005 approved budget was allocated to security. <sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn83-0095327X12446925">83</xref>
</sup>That was a colossal share of the state’s budget, given the centralized police force of the Nigerian federation that assigns state governors only an advisory role in security matters.</p>
<p>Militarization was complete with the growing attraction of state legitimate force as an instrument of survival during the closing years (1994–1999) of military rule. The most detestable economic scarcity of that period was acute gas shortage. Apart from dedicated supplies enjoyed by military establishments like very few civilian establishments, military personnel had access to public gas supplies, as gas distribution task force members and chairpersons. To save valuable time wasted by millions of Nigerians at gas stations in endless queues, links with military personnel increasingly became relevant. Those who had such links exploited them to get gas while those who did not sought them. Thus, where social connections with [civilian] gas dealers were unhelpful, connections with the military came to the rescue. As Emmanuel Ojo has observed, the militarization of the Nigerian society during many years of military rule has lingered even under elected governments.<sup>

<title>Policy Responses to SALW’s Proliferation</title>
<p>In 2008, the Heads of State and Government of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) announced the Declaration of Moratorium on Importation, Exportation, and Manufacture of Light Weapons in West Africa. The leaders intended to use the moratorium to arrest SALW’s proliferation. It became clear to them after a few years of implementation that the moratorium was not sufficient for dealing with the issue of SALW in their region because it lacked the force of law. They decided to transform the moratorium into the ECOWAS Convention on Small Arms and Light Weapons, Their Ammunition, and other Related Materials in 2006. With the ninth instrument of ratification by the Republic of Benin in September 2009 (Nigeria had earlier done so), the Convention came into force. Its implementation is based on a five-year action plan adopted by ECOWAS member states.</p>
<p>Between 1999 and 2004, Delta and Rivers states embarked on a disarmament/demobilization of armed gangs. Delta State used cash awards and the offer of skill acquisition opportunity between 1999 and 2003. Rivers state government set up the Joint Security Force (JSF) comprising the armed forces, the Nigeria Police and State Security Service in 2004. In May 2004, JSF carried out raids on suspected hideouts of cult gangs, arrested 47 suspects, and recovered 3 AK-47 riffles, 3 G3 riffles, and 2 pistols. In several other raids, security operatives claimed they recovered 7 AK-47 riffles, 6 assault riffles, 2 locally made guns, 3 magazines, 6 G3 riffles, 1 berretta pistol, 1 English made brownie, 8 automatic pump action guns, 2,026 rounds of ammunition, 76 detonators, 147 dynamites, and 7 fuses.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn85-0095327X12446925">85</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>When the application of force failed, the Rivers state government resorted to the Delta state-type approach in late 2004 to be implemented by a peace committee of fifteen representatives of all groups. The committee employed meetings with militia leaders, peace rallies addressed by warlords, oath-taking to sheath arms, amnesty for those arrested by security agents for violent acts, disarmament, and rehabilitation. The government thereafter announced that it had recovered 1,000 guns from one group.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn86-0095327X12446925">86</xref>
</sup> In a rebuttal, Dokubo-Asari claimed that he turned in 3,000 guns.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn87-0095327X12446925">87</xref>
</sup> This might mean that government officials who supervised the demobilization program used it to build their own personal armory for the upcoming 2007 general elections.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn88-0095327X12446925">88</xref>
</sup> The controversy over recovered guns aside, splinter and new groups emerged from disputes over the money given in exchange for arms.</p>
<p>Between 2000 and 2001, the federal government set up two ad hoc committees (later merged) for SALW’s proliferation control. Its attempt in 2007 to convert the committee into a national commission has not materialized because of “a lack of political will, financial support, technical experts, and capacity.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn89-0095327X12446925">89</xref>
</sup> The federal government resorted to a military solution in 2004 in an operation codenamed “Operation Flush Out.” But when the military strategy was failing, President Olusegun Obasanjo held a peace meeting with the leaders of NDPVF and NDVF, the then most awesome armed groups in ND, reaching an agreement on disarmament and rehabilitation with them in late 2004. The Presidency also organized peace education workshops for youths suspected to be kingpins of violence in ND. But the renewal of violence proved these efforts futile. Still, in December 2005, it entered into an energy and security partnership with the United States “to protect the Niger Delta Region and the Gulf of Guinea.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn90-0095327X12446925">90</xref>
</sup> One of its special committees, “Disrupting illicit small arms trafficking” directly bears on nonproliferation of SALW. In furtherance of this partnership, the United States increased her military presence in the Gulf of Guinea in the form of AFRICOM. This partnership later blossomed into the Gulf of Guinea Energy Security Strategy with three members by 2005—Nigeria, United States, and United Kingdom. The stated aim of the strategy is the security of oil production and the development of ND.</p>
<p>After Dokubo Asari and Ateke Tom agreed to disarmament with the Presidency, the former complained that the disarmament program of the government was targeted at him to strengthen the latter, his archrival. He charged that Ateke Tom was not being disarmed while he was surrendering weapons in his possession.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn91-0095327X12446925">91</xref>
</sup> His rejection of the 2003 Presidential Election results to the displeasure of Rivers State government and by implication, a declaration of opposition to it, arrest and arraignment in September 2005, seem to confirm his allegation of the partisan uses of armed gangs by the government.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn92-0095327X12446925">92</xref>
</sup> His suspicion is given teeth by no other person than Governor Rotimi Amaechi of Rivers State: “In 2005, Ateke Tom was declared wanted by government. (But) the police were escorting the same man to his father’s burial.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn93-0095327X12446925">93</xref>
</sup> Thus, the federal government was using its favorite gangs to terrorize those who opposed its desire for tenure elongation for representatives whose second term in office was about to lapse. The tenure elongation project crumbled on the floor of the National Assembly on May 16, 2006.</p>
<p>The above national and international efforts failed to check SALW’s proliferation and violence in ND. The federal government in May 2009 embarked on another round of military solution to youth resistance by attacking and destroying Camp 5 and “Iroko” Camp. By federal government’s admission, those destructions were provoked by the murder of twelve men of JTF by Camp 5, meaning that the federal government allows armed groups to exist so long as they do not cross its path. It offered amnesty, which was to be accepted during August–October 2009 by militants while the raiding of their camps continued. The well-beaten path of dramatic display of surrendered arms, took place during the same period. But critics pointed out that government took amnesty out of context of Mitee’s Technical Committee Report, which recommended amnesty as part of a holistic approach including greater commitment to the development of ND. For these critics, selective implementation of the report could not end violence in ND.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn94-0095327X12446925">94</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Such critics have been proven right. In January 2011, JTF arrested sixty-two members of MEND from whom it recovered forty-five AK-47 riffles, twelve general purpose machine guns, and thousands of ammunition. The militants were hunted and arrested following MEND’s renewed attacks on government interests. According to Major General Charles Omoregie, JTF’s commander, some of them had accepted amnesty and were collecting allowances from the federal government. The leader of the group, twenty-five-year old Tamuno Tonye Kuna claimed that they returned to violence because they were neglected by their former leaders.<sup>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>ND exemplifies Reno’s concept of shadow state where rulers use public resources to give “payouts” to key strongmen for their support rather than provide services or public goods that would benefit all because they find the former more cost efficient for satisfying their personal political and economic interests.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn96-0095327X12446925">96</xref>
</sup> A typical payout in the ND is the protection of leaders of armed gangs engaged in oil bunkering in exchange for political support. Government, state or federal, born of the support of armed gangs, was willing to tolerate perpetrators of brigandage unless it threatened civil–military relations or societal stability. Thus, reigning in the illegal weapons trafficking in ND was not the overarching goal of the Obasanjo-led PDP government because violence was an important instrument of its political machine. Its strategy was, at best, the pacification and unification of the disputing factions under its umbrella. The evidence of, to borrow Reno’s words, “intensification of transnational commerce” around crude oil is the increased involvement of local and foreign merchants in the “stealing of crude oil for sale in the international market.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn97-0095327X12446925">97</xref>
</sup> While crude oil production hovers around 2 million barrels per day, theft of oil rose from 200,000 in 2003 to a horrendous 680,000 barrels per day by April 2009.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn98-0095327X12446925">98</xref>
</sup> According to the Managing Director of SPDC, Mutiu Sunmonu, Nigeria loses $5 billion yearly to oil theft.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn99-0095327X12446925">99</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>As shown in the foregoing, hundreds of human lives have been wasted through the reckless use of SALW in ND. Huge resources have been diverted to security concerns, which have, paradoxically, prejudiced life and property because of the duplicity of government and security agents. The resolution of these contradictions will depend on the commitment of internal political actors to tackling the social and political conditions that encourage the demand for arms.</p>
