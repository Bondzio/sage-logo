<abstract>
<p>In this progress report on climate change, I examine the growing literature dealing with the proposal to engineer global climate through the deliberate injection of aerosols into the stratosphere. This is just one of a wide range of technology proposals to geoengineer the climate, but one in particular which has gained the attention of Earth System science researchers and which is attracting wider public debate. I review the current status of this technology by exploring a number of different dimensions of the proposal: its history and philosophical and ethical implications; how it is framed in public discourse and perceived by citizens; its economic, political and governance characteristics; and how the proposed technology is being researched through numerical modelling and field experimentation. Unlike many other geoengineering interventions, stratospheric aerosol injection has no additional societal co-benefits: its sole raison d’etre would be to offset planetary heating caused by rising concentrations of greenhouse gases. The deployment of such a technology would have profound implications for the view humans have of themselves in relation to the non-human world.</p>

<title>I Introduction</title>
<p>This is the second of three progress reports I am writing for <italic>Progress in Physical Geography</italic> covering the broad theme of (anthropogenic) climate change. Two years ago I reviewed the growing scholarly literature examining (critically or otherwise) the knowledge-making practices of the IPCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0309133312456414">Hulme and Mahony, 2010</xref>). Here, I turn my attention to another feature of climate change discourse which has gained salience in certain scientific, political and social settings in recent years, namely the prospect of controlling the Earth’s heat balance through deliberate injection of aerosols into the stratosphere.</p>
<p>This is not a review of the much wider field of deliberate engineering of the Earth’s climate (sometimes referred to as ‘geoengineering’, although this term is rather imprecise). This topic would be too broad for a short progress report and a good introduction exists in the form of the Royal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0309133312456414">Society’s (2009)</xref> report on geoengineering (see also popular books such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0309133312456414">Goodell, 2010</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0309133312456414">Kintisch, 2010a</xref>). The technical and environmental aspects of many of these other forms of intervention have been comprehensively reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0309133312456414">Vaughan and Lenton (2011)</xref>. Rather, this review reports on studies which consider the specific technology of stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI), which is itself merely one technology within the geoengineering family of solar radiation management (SRM) interventions. I focus on SAI because of the danger that the policy and public discourse around geoengineering ‘closes down’ on this particular technology (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0309133312456414">Stirling, 2008</xref>): this technology has been deemed ‘affordable’ and ‘effective’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0309133312456414">Royal Society, 2009</xref>) and substantial work research into SAI is now being undertaken. It therefore demands close critical scrutiny.</p>
<p>SAI might be thought of as deliberate ‘global dimming’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0309133312456414">Wild et al., 2007</xref>) with the intention of offsetting the accumulation of heat in the lower atmosphere and oceans caused by rising concentrations of greenhouse gases. The progress report does not survey other SRM techniques such as cloud-whitening or surface albedo enhancements, nor the other geoengineering family of Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) techniques. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0309133312456414">Robock (2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0309133312456414">2011a</xref>) points out, the philosophical, ethical and governance aspects of SRM and CDR interventions are radically different; and, as I suggest here, some of these aspects with regard to SAI are also particularly distinctive.</p>
<p>Nor is this a review of merely the numerical simulation studies of SAI which have been conducted using a variety of Earth System models to explore the atmospheric and biogeochemical response to aerosol injection. My concern is much broader than this. The very idea of deliberately modifying the composition of the stratosphere to effect a global system response – namely some form of temperature regulation or ‘global climate control’ – evokes a wide range of cultural, social, political and ethical responses. The progress report is therefore divided into five sections dealing with, respectively: context and history; philosophy and ethics; framings, discourse and public perceptions; economics, politics and governance; and numerical modelling and field experimentation.</p>
<p>I survey the literature in this order because at the very heart of SAI technology lies a series of crucial questions about, inter alia, the meaning of nature, the human desire for climate control, the ethics of technology and the public governance of science. Earth System scientists, atmospheric engineers and physical geographers who embark on research into the technical feasibility and environmental sensitivities of such interventions need alerting to these prior questions emerging from human imagination and public concern (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0309133312456414">Macnaghten and Owen, 2011</xref>). The literature reviewed here therefore extends well beyond physical geography and includes publications in science and technology studies, policy studies, political science, environmental sociology, philosophy of science and human geography.</p>

<sec id="section2-0309133312456414">
<title>II Context and history</title>
<p>The growth of scientific, scholarly, political and public attention to the idea of stratospheric aerosol injection is frequently attributed to an article written in 2006 in the journal <italic>Climatic Change</italic> by the Nobel Prize-winning atmospheric chemist Paul Crutzen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0309133312456414">Crutzen, 2006</xref>). Although the idea of SAI was not new at this time (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0309133312456414">Budyko, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0309133312456414">NAS, 1992</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0309133312456414">Crutzen (2006</xref>: 212) argued that ‘the usefulness of artificially enhancing Earth’s albedo and thereby cooling climate by adding sunlight reflecting aerosol in the stratosphere might again be explored and debated as a way to … counteract the climate forcing of growing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions’. Although recognizing the important legal, ethical and societal dimensions of such an undertaking, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0309133312456414">Cruzten (2006</xref>: 216) called for ‘active scientific research of the kind of geo-engineering discussed in this paper’. Six years later, such active research is now taking place.</p>
<p>With SAI grouped alongside a range of other large-scale climate intervention technologies, rather loosely labelled together as ‘geoengineering’, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0309133312456414">Crutzen’s 2006</xref> article prompted significant scientific attention being given to the idea of deliberate engineering of the Earth’s climate. For example, a simple Scopus search for ‘solar radiation management’ in peer-reviewed journal article titles, keywords and abstracts finds none pre-dating 2007. It has also prompted significant media attention – especially in Anglophone nations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0309133312456414">Buck, 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0309133312456414">Nerlich and Jaspal, 2012</xref>) – and the emergence of a new public discourse about ‘Plan B’ and ‘global climate control’.</p>
<p>Within three years of Crutzen’s paper, the first national academy assessment of ‘geoengineering’ was published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0309133312456414">Royal Society, 2009</xref>), followed by governmental reports in the USA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0309133312456414">USGAO, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0309133312456414">2011</xref>) and from a variety of NGOs and think-tanks (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0309133312456414">ETC Group, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0309133312456414">Olson, 2011</xref>). In 2010, the Asilomar International Conference on Climate Intervention Technologies was organized by the non-profit foundation the Climate Response Fund together with the Climate Institute in Washington, DC. Mimicking the 1975 Asilomar Conference on recombinant DNA, Asilomar-2 as it became known sought to develop a set of voluntary guidelines for the conduct of research and testing of such intervention technologies, SAI included (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0309133312456414">Kintisch, 2010b</xref>). The conference statement from the 175 scientists gathered there included the call ‘to initiate further research in all relevant disciplines’.</p>
<p>Through Crutzen’s intervention, therefore, it can be claimed that SAI is the technology that has catalysed this resurgent interest in planetary climate control, and it remains the emblematic technology to achieve such ends because of the frequently made claim that SAI is relatively cheap, is simple and brings about rapid results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0309133312456414">Boyd, 2008</xref>). The Royal Society report, for example, claimed it to be the most ‘affordable’ and ‘effective’ of all the geoengineering technologies they surveyed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0309133312456414">Royal Society, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The present context in which SAI has gained this emblematic status needs to be understood against a much longer history of human desire for climate control. Fleming’s excellent historical survey of human efforts to ‘control’ climate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0309133312456414">Fleming, 2010</xref>) is recommended as the place to start such an examination (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0309133312456414">Keith, 2000</xref>; for a critical assessment of Fleming’s history, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0309133312456414">Hamblin, 2011</xref>). The desire to ‘improve’ climate for human benefit is a long-standing one, whether on regional scales through land modification, locally through cloud-seeding, or domestically through indoor and outdoor temperature regulation (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0309133312456414">Hitchings, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0309133312456414">Meyer, 2002a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0309133312456414">2002b</xref>). The distinctiveness of SAI should be understood and analysed in this context. Rather than seeking local or regional climate <italic>improvement</italic>, SAI is about limiting global climate <italic>deterioration</italic> believed to be underway as a result of other large-scale human changes to the environment; what some would term climate remediation (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0309133312456414">Long et al., 2011</xref>). SAI proposals result from a contemporary anxiety about climate and human flourishing which has deep cultural roots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0309133312456414">Boia, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0309133312456414">Fleming and Jankovic, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast to the above historical discourses, however, it is the distinctively <italic>global</italic> scale of SAI technologies that provokes some of the most challenging philosophical, ethical, legal and political questions which are surveyed below.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0309133312456414">
<title>III Philosophy and ethics</title>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0309133312456414">Jamieson (1996)</xref> developed one of the first significant assessments of the ethical dimensions of what he termed ‘intentional climate change’ (i.e. geoengineering). Many of the concerns now being explored in much greater depth were raised by Jamieson, although he did not specifically refer to SAI as one of his intentional technologies. What I am interested in highlighting here is recent work which has considered some of the philosophical and ethical considerations that are particularly significant for SAI.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0309133312456414">Galarraga and Szerszynski (2012)</xref> have developed an interesting argument about solar radiation management and what they call ‘the ethics of fabrication’. In particular, in considering what it means to ‘make something’ – as in to remake global climate – they draw out distinctions between the ideas of ‘production’, ‘education’ and ‘creation’. This raises philosophical questions about what it might mean to bring global climate under the orbit of human-made entities. What sort of a god would we become? They introduce the idea of the ‘climate artist’ as a way of capturing some of the imaginative practices involved in the technology of SAI. Their conclusion is not dissimilar from Buck’s call to assess all geoengineering technologies, but especially SRM, within much wider sociocultural frameworks than merely those of techno-environmental risk assessment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0309133312456414">Buck, 2012b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0309133312456414">2012c</xref>). This is a proposition that will be familiar to many geographers (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0309133312456414">Hulme, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0309133312456414">Tadaki et al., 2012</xref>). It also resonates with the argument against SAI put forward by Clive <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0309133312456414">Hamilton (2011)</xref>.</p>
<p>Buck’s argument is to widen the setting in which ethical considerations of technologies such as SAI take place. If new cohorts of climate engineers are to refashion planetary climates then we all become clients of these engineers. We need to decide what kind of Earth our engineers are being commissioned to make. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0309133312456414">Buck (2012c</xref>) does not explore the problematic ‘we’ here (see the section on governance below), but she does ask what societal ‘goods’ other than merely climate benefits might be co-delivered by the various geoengineering technologies. In her judgement SRM fares rather poorly here relative to CDR technologies, and even within SRM interventions SAI fares worst of all. Conversely, there are certain aesthetic effects which are unique to SAI and which might be considered as public ‘bads’, namely whitening of the skies and redder sunsets. This would be a very visible consequence of SAI and would carry considerable psychological significance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0309133312456414">Robock, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Another distinctive feature of the ethics of SAI concerns the ‘slippery-slope argument’ in relation to research and deployment. This was outlined originally by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0309133312456414">Jamieson (1996</xref>: 333) in a generic sense, the danger being that ‘in many cases [geoengineering] research leads unreflectively to development’ and ultimately deployment. This argument is now much more pertinent, especially in relation to research into SAI. Geoengineering research is increasingly framed in relation to SAI – and conducted too: not just through numerical simulations, but also through field experimentation (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0309133312456414">Izrael et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0309133312456414">Macnaghton and Owen, 2011</xref>). The consequences of ‘just’ researching such technologies need to be evaluated upfront. This is an argument made forceably by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0309133312456414">Bunzl (2009)</xref>. He suggests that the social history of scientific research shows that new technologies, once embarked upon, are more than likely to be deployed. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0309133312456414">Betz (2012)</xref> also reaches this conclusion in his critique of the ‘arm the future’ argument for research (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0309133312456414">Gardiner, 2010</xref>). In the case of technologies like SAI, large-scale research and deployment become one and the same thing (although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0309133312456414">MacMynowski et al., 2011</xref>, offer a partial rebuttal of this claim).</p>
<p>The conclusion of these and other such studies into the ethics of SAI is the necessity to differentiate <italic>between</italic> different geoengineering and SRM technologies. They do not all carry the same ethical or philosophical concerns and they can be analysed using different ethical frameworks: for example, deontological, consequentialist and virtue-based ethics as suggested by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0309133312456414">Royal Society (2009)</xref>. (SAI perhaps most easily falls into a consequentialist framework; i.e. the end justifies the means.) But <italic>some</italic> ethical stance is inevitable when assessing (and indeed researching) geoengineering technologies; the concern is whether this stance is made transparent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0309133312456414">Gardiner, 2011</xref>). All scientists who intervene publicly and who also undertake research into SAI should make it very clear what their ethical position is.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0309133312456414">1</xref></sup> This is especially so given the increasing salience of SAI in the public sphere – to which we now turn.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0309133312456414">
<title>IV Framings, discourse and public perceptions</title>
<p>The few longitudinal studies that have been conducted into media representations of geoengineering have not differentiated between different technologies – and nor to my knowledge have they moved outside Anglophone cultures. The post-2006 rise in media coverage is very evident in all such studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0309133312456414">Porter, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0309133312456414">Buck, 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0309133312456414">Nerlich and Jaspal, 2012</xref>). What is also clear from such work are the particular framings and the narrow range of authoritative voices which are being offered to citizens. Buck’s analysis of the 93 substantive articles dealing with geoengineering she found in the world’s major English print newspapers between 2006 and 2010 showed that natural scientists and engineers together contribute 70% of all reported claims about geoengineering. Of these claims, over half are made by the very small ‘geoclique’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0309133312456414">Kintisch, 2010a</xref>) comprising just 10 Earth System scientists. Whether it be SAI or other climate intervention technologies, through such media a very small elite of Caucasian male scientists are shaping the discourse surrounding these putative technologies of climate control.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0309133312456414">Sikka (2012)</xref> explores this exercise of discursive power in her investigation of the particular ideologies being displayed by these authorial individuals and institutions. ‘Language gains power by the use powerful people make of it’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0309133312456414">Sikka, 2012</xref>: 173, citing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0309133312456414">Wodak, 2001</xref>) and she suggests that technological determinism, philosophical exceptionalism and a market-driven ideology underpin the discursive strategies of many of these prominent geoengineering advocates. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0309133312456414">Nerlich and Jaspal (2012)</xref> also survey a corpus of English-language popular literature about geoengineering between 1988 and 2010, but their interest was in the development and deployment of metaphor, or how geoengineeing was ‘linguistically engineered’. In this corpus taken from the publication category of ‘Industry Trade Press’, they found one master argument, that of philosophical exceptionalism (backing up Sikka’s assertion above): geoengineering is the only option to avoid a planetary catastrophe. Supporting this master narrative were three dominant metaphors: the planet as a machine, the planet as a body and the planet as a patient. SAI, therefore, is framed as either fixing the machine, screening the body or healing the patient. Nerlich and Jaspal conclude their study by asserting the power of metaphor to influence political debate and public understanding.</p>
<p>What these studies on representation, discourse and metaphor suggest is that the results of public surveys such as that reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0309133312456414">Mercer et al. (2011)</xref> need careful and critical scrutiny. In a survey of over 3,000 citizens in the USA, Canada and the UK, these authors found that 72% of respondents ‘somewhat’ or ‘strongly’ supported scientific research into SRM. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0309133312456414">Mercer et al. (2011</xref>: 5) conclude that ‘The public support for SRM found here provides empirical support for oft expressed fears of a rush toward implementation’. However, such a conclusion needs cautioning. When asked at the beginning of the survey ‘Have you ever heard of geoengineering’, only 20% said ‘yes’; furthermore, only 8% could offer an adequate definition of ‘geoengineering’. How subsequent questions about SRM were therefore framed – in this study they went on to use a ‘climate emergency’ framing – must have considerable bearing on the answers elicited.</p>
<p>This points to a considerable dilemma in attempts to engage publics with ideas such as SAI. Drawing upon lessons from previous technology controversies, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0309133312456414">Corner and Pidgeon (2010)</xref> argue for widespread public engagement <italic>before</italic> research into SAI and other geoengineering technologies proceeds, what has elsewhere been termed ‘upstreaming’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0309133312456414">Corner et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0309133312456414">Wilsdon and Willis, 2004</xref>). Yet citizen exposure to these technologies and their implications remains either very weak (as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0309133312456414">Mercer et al., 2011</xref>, and backed up in other survey work; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0309133312456414">Corner et al., 2012</xref>) or else heavily framed through selective discursive strategies (as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0309133312456414">Sikka, 2012</xref>). These concerns were recognized in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0309133312456414">Royal Society’s 2009</xref> report and in subsequent work funded in the UK to engage citizens in upstreaming activities around geoengineering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0309133312456414">NERC, 2011</xref>). In the NERC study, SAI technology was not popular among UK citizens and even though perceived as a ‘quick fix’ to global heating, participants recognized it carried moral hazard and did not deal with the underlying causes of climate change. The fiasco (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0309133312456414">Macnaghton and Owen, 2011</xref>) over one of the first field experiments to test a possible SAI delivery mechanism – spraying water into the atmosphere through a 1 km balloon-tethered hose – shows the difficulty both of how to satisfy citizen concerns deploying the ‘slippery-slope argument’ (see above) and of how to speak intelligibly across different scholarly communities. Further careful work is clearly needed in this area (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0309133312456414">Kahan et al., 2012</xref>), not just in Anglophone cultures but, given the global repercussions of technologies such as SAI, across the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0309133312456414">Corner et al., 2012</xref>).</p>

<title>V Economics, politics and governance</title>
<p>Given the pre-embryonic state of SAI technology at the present time, there are no reliable costs of deployment for different levels of aerosol loading. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0309133312456414">Royal Society (2009)</xref>, following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0309133312456414">Robock et al. (2009)</xref>, reported relatively modest costs in the order of tens of billions of dollars, while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0309133312456414">Morgan (2010)</xref> suggests that very fine-sized particle injection could be done at relatively low cost. As part of Bjørn Lomborg’s Copenhagen Consensus process, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0309133312456414">Bickel and Lane (2009)</xref> were commissioned to estimate the costs of different SRM technologies and for SAI claimed costs of the order of US$230 billion to offset 21st-century global warming: a benefit-cost ratio of 25:1. All such estimates must be taken with some incredulity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0309133312456414">Goes et al., 2011</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0309133312456414">Barrett, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it is the claimed ease and cheapness of SAI that lends this particular technology as a site of political protest. For example, if the economic attractiveness of the technology is reason to mobilize the global financial system to direct capital into SAI development and deployment, then global capitalism needs to be brought to account (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0309133312456414">Castree, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0309133312456414">ETC Group, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0309133312456414">Storm, 2009</xref>). Furthermore, scientists such as those gathered by the IPCC for an expert meeting on geoengineering in Peru in June 2011 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0309133312456414">IPCC, 2010</xref>), are deemed by some to have neither the expertise nor the legitimacy to determine the suitability of geoengineering governance mechanisms. Shortly before this meeting, the campaigning coalition Hands Off Mother Earth (HOME) organized an open letter from many dozens of civil society organizations around the world to the Chair of the IPCC Rajendra Pachauri claiming that ‘The likelihood that geoengineering will provide a safe, lasting, democratic and peaceful solution to the climate crisis is non-existent’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0309133312456414">HOME, 2011</xref>). This would be a conclusion seemingly shared by the experienced German climate scientist John Schellnhuber. On close inspection, he argues, SAI exhibits some of the same characteristics as the Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD) of the Cold War, ‘that is, the ominous doctrine of the arms race frenzy. If the climate can be influenced rather inexpensively by sending aerosol rockets to the stratosphere, then who decides when and where the buttons are pushed?’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0309133312456414">Schellnhuber, 2011</xref>: 20277).</p>
<p>Questions of how SAI would be governed therefore become central (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0309133312456414">Allenby, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0309133312456414">Suarez et al., 2010</xref>) and are now the subject not just of research, but even of graduate summer schools.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0309133312456414">2</xref></sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0309133312456414">Virgoe (2009)</xref> offers an early account of generic geoengineering governance concerns, drawing attention to the different roles that could be played in relation to SAI by the United Nations, by single states or by consortia of states such as the OECD. Following the Royal Society’s report in 2009, a set of governance principles for geoengineering – known as the Oxford Principles – have been developed by social science scholars such as Steve Rayner, Catherine Ridgewell and Nick Pidgeon. They were adopted at the Asilomar Conference and, with caveats, endorsed by the UK House of Commons Report into the regulation of geoengineering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0309133312456414">UK Parliament, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>These principles are being further researched and developed as part of one of the SRM Governance Initiatives (SRMGI). Their first report was published in 2011 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0309133312456414">SRMGI, 2011</xref>) in which they argue for research into the ‘governance of risk’ (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0309133312456414">Van Asselt and Renn, 2011</xref>) associated with SRM – drawing in more countries and wider perspectives. They do not call for a moratorium on research into technologies such as SAI, although even the SRMGI members were divided on this position. Many commentators have suggested that the complexity of this governance challenge will dwarf the difficulties of finding governance mechanisms for reducing global carbon emissions (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0309133312456414">Humphreys, 2011</xref>; although see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0309133312456414">Millard-Ball, 2012</xref>, for a different reading of the problem) – a task which itself has proved largely intractable. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0309133312456414">Robock (2011b</xref>: 5) summarizes: ‘The UK SRMGI is just beginning to address these issues, but it is not obvious that they will be successful. In any case, fundamentally new international rules, observing systems, and enforcement will be needed before we start spraying.’</p>

<title>VI Modelling and experimentation</title>
<p>One of the arguments I make throughout this progress report is that the technologies of geoengineering cannot be analysed as though they belong to a single genre or family, and neither can those technologies grouped under SRM. Each proposed climate intervention technology has a unique set of technical characteristics and environmental side-effects, and hence a unique set of ethical, legal and governance concerns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0309133312456414">Betz, 2012</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0309133312456414">Vaughan and Lenton (2011)</xref>, for example, argue that the simulated uncertainties of SAI are much greater and more meteorologically complicated than those relating to CDR technologies.</p>
<p>There is already considerable environmental and technical research being conducted into SAI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0309133312456414">Robock et al., 2010</xref>) – as called for in the Asilomar-2 Conference Declaration. Most of this research is currently being conducted through numerical model simulation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0309133312456414">Rasch et al. (2008)</xref> provided one of the first syntheses of SAI environmental research, mostly an assessment of climate modelling experiments but also including some speculation about methods – such as guns, balloons and high-level aircraft – for delivering sulphur species into the stratosphere. Since then new modelling work has offered an SAI-optimization framework using reduced-form models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0309133312456414">Moreno-Cruz et al., 2012</xref>), explored the effectiveness of SAI as a function of climate sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0309133312456414">Ricke et al., 2012</xref>), simulated the regional climatic effects of SAI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0309133312456414">Irvine et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0309133312456414">Robock et al., 2008</xref>) and shown, using a multi-model ensemble, the impossibility of stabilizing <italic>both</italic> regional temperature and precipitation through SAI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0309133312456414">Ricke et al., 2010</xref>). In relation to precipitation effects of SAI, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0309133312456414">MacMynowski et al. (2011)</xref> show that given the very large natural variability of regional precipitation, establishing the effects of SAI experimentation on regional hydrology would require decades of experimental monitoring (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0309133312456414">Mahlstein et al., 2012</xref>). This result reinforces the concern expressed in the ‘slippery-slope argument’: research and deployment become one and the same.</p>
<p>But the environmental consequences of SAI extend well beyond the merely climatic. Additional sulphate aerosols in the stratosphere provide surfaces for enhanced heterogenous chemistry, thus resulting in potentially increased ozone depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0309133312456414">Crutzen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0309133312456414">Rasch et al., 2008</xref>), although the associated radiation scattering and attenuation effects are complex. The ratio of direct to diffuse radiation, too, would be altered with consequences for photosynthesis, ecosystems (such as coral; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0309133312456414">Crabbe, 2009</xref>) and crop yields (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0309133312456414">Pongratz et al., 2012</xref>). And if SAI were to be used as a technology for limiting the rate of global sea-level rise then significant contradictions arise between achieving this goal at the same time as stabilizing global temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0309133312456414">Irvine et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>All of these studies are, of course, simulation studies using a variety of Earth System simulation models. Their conclusions remain subject to the well-known and enduring limitations of such models. For this and other reasons, therefore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0309133312456414">Kravitz et al. (2011)</xref> have called for a Geoengineering Model Intercomparison Project (GeoMIP), along the lines of other climate and biosphere model intercomparison projects. Specifically applied to model investigations into the consequences of SAI, these authors call for standard SAI scenarios to be applied to multiple climate models to compare results and to determine the robustness of model-simulated responses. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0309133312456414">Jones et al. (2010)</xref> show the results of one such study in which the effects of SAI, simulated in two leading climate models, were intercompared.</p>
<p>Experimental research into SAI has tended to study natural analogues to gain insight into the effects of deliberate injection. The injection of sulphate aerosols into the lower stratosphere to cool the climate seeks to mimic the effect of large volcanic eruptions such as Mt Pinatubo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0309133312456414">Crutzen, 2006</xref>). The aggregate large-scale effects of such eruptions are reasonably well known (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0309133312456414">Kravitz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0309133312456414">Rasch et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0309133312456414">Robock et al., 2008</xref>). Going beyond natural analogues, however, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0309133312456414">Izrael et al. (2009)</xref> have conducted limited-area field experiments to study solar radiation passage through aerosol clouds of differing thicknesses and particle sizes. These empirical results were compared against model simulations and found to be in close agreement. In proposed work in the UK, the Stratospheric Particle Injection for Climate Engineering (SPICE) Consortium plans to test at least one possible aerosol delivery device (see above).</p>

<title>VII Conclusions</title>
<p>Of the various climate engineering technologies that have been proposed – <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0309133312456414">Vaughan and Lenton (2011)</xref>, for example, reviewed 19 such – SAI is one that has gained particular salience within the climate science and Earth system modelling community. SAI offers a brute force way of rebalancing the Earth’s heat budget and offers most obviously the creation of what some have metaphorically labelled a ‘global thermostat’. It scored most highly of all the geoengineering technologies evaluated by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0309133312456414">Royal Society (2009)</xref> against the criteria of ‘effectiveness’, ‘affordability’ and ‘timeliness’, although it gained only a ‘low’ score with respect to ‘safety’.</p>
<p>In contrast to other SRM technologies, however, and certainly in comparison with CDR, there are no societal or ecological co-benefits to offer alongside the primary objective of adjusting the radiative balance of the planet. This is the argument explored by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0309133312456414">Buck (2012c</xref>), where she was unable to offer any social co-benefits of undertaking SAI – as opposed to some that could be imagined for other SRM and CDR technologies (such as, respectively, urban albedo enhancement or biochar).</p>
<p>What therefore is at stake in the emerging research agenda into SAI technologies and with respect to embryonic efforts to stimulate public deliberation about the technology? What should be immediately clear from this brief survey of the literature is that SAI cannot simply be evaluated on the basis of some narrow techno-environmental assessment of risk. Even the very proposition to conduct research into SAI carries with it a set of ethical and political judgements, not to mention the much deeper philosophical presumptions about the natures of nature, technology and humanity. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0309133312456414">Gardiner (2011)</xref> observes in his essay exploring the ethical assumptions buried in the Royal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0309133312456414">Society’s 2009</xref> report, any assessment of technologies such as SAI necessarily involves adopting an ethical stance. What matters is ‘whether it is made perspicuous’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0309133312456414">Gardiner, 2011</xref>: 184).</p>
<p>My other claim here is the importance of differentiating between the individual climate engineering technologies being proposed. This is as true for upstream public engagement work as it is for considerations about research, implementation, ethics or governance. SAI is radically different as a form of technology from, say, biochar or roof albedo enhancement. The distinctions must not be blurred by labelling them all together as simply ‘geoengineering’.</p>
<p>Geographers have inherited the moniker ‘earth-describers’ – <italic>geo-graphia</italic>. As a new cohort of human actors and entrepreneurs come in to being – the ‘earth-engineers’ – it is important that geographers engage in conversation with them and facilitate wider public scrutiny of their mission. What is the nature of this ‘geo’ being engineered? Whose stakes are at risk and whose are being defended? To whom should the engineers be accountable? For geographers to remain useful to society, are not the new worlds that are today being created, mapped and colonized by SAI explorers exactly those worlds we are called upon to study and describe?</p>
