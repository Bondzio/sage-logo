<p>A 3 m core from the New River Lagoon, adjacent to the Maya city of Lamanai, Northern Belize, contains a continuous record of vegetation change between <italic>c</italic>. 1500 <sc>bc</sc> and <sc>ad</sc> 1500. Inferred changes in forest abundance and plant community assemblage build on previous palaeolimnological analysis of the same core reported by Metcalfe et al. (2009). A near-complete, abundant record of <italic>Zea mays</italic> grains provides a detailed account of field-based agriculture local to Lamanai, in the context of a regional record obtained from a large lake (13.5 km<sup>2</sup>) with a substantial catchment. Three periods (<italic>c</italic>. 170 <sc>bc</sc>–<sc>ad</sc> 150, <italic>c</italic>. <sc>ad</sc> 600–980 and <italic>c</italic>. <sc>ad</sc> 1500) of extraction of <italic>Pinus</italic> from pine savannas adjacent to the east of the New River Lagoon, can be distinguished from clearance of seasonal broadleaf forest for agriculture. An increased palm signal is observed during <italic>c</italic>. 1630–1150 <sc>bc</sc> and 100 <sc>bc</sc>–<sc>ad</sc> 1100 and may be indicative of Maya cultivation. This record shows that during the late Classic period the Maya actively managed the vegetation resources using a combination of field-based agriculture, arboreal resources and perhaps, palm cultivation. There is no evidence from the vegetation history of drying during the late Classic coincident with the Maya ‘collapse’ and this is consistent with the palaeolimnological and archaeological records of continuous occupation of the Maya at Lamanai. Both the decline in palms <italic>c</italic>. <sc>ad</sc> 1400 and the increase in <italic>Pinus extraction c.</italic> ad 1500 are consistent with changes in vegetation associated with European arrival, however further analysis of material from the last 1000 years will enable a better understanding of vegetation change pre- and post-European encounter.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The vegetation history of the Maya lowlands (parts of Belize, Mexico and Guatemala) reflects a complex mixture of both climatic change and anthropogenic disturbance. The balance of these factors during the Classic and early Post-Classic periods (<italic>c</italic>. <sc>ad</sc> 300 to <sc>ad</sc> 1450) is of particular interest. Palaeoclimatic reconstructions from the Yucatán have shown fluctuations in water balance consistent with droughts which have been linked to the Maya ‘collapse’ <italic>c</italic>. <sc>ad</sc> 900–1000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0959683612465449">Curtis et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0959683612465449">Hodell et al., 1995</xref>). However, the impact of the Maya on their environment and the nature and scale of vegetation change in the post ‘collapse’ period have also been a focus of attention. Reconstructions of vegetation cover have furthered our understanding of the causes and consequences of the ‘Maya Collapse’, with studies demonstrating links to anthropogenic impact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0959683612465449">Abrams et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0959683612465449">Rue, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0959683612465449">Webster et al., 2000</xref>) and climate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0959683612465449">Leyden, 1998</xref>) or, indeed, a combination of both factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0959683612465449">Aimers and Hodell, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0959683612465449">Metcalfe et al., 2009</xref>).There is clear evidence of anthropogenic disturbance over the Holocene, including examples of forest clearance associated with the appearance of crops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0959683612465449">Jones, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0959683612465449">Leyden, 1998</xref>); intensive cultivation of crops linked with evidence of hydraulic manipulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959683612465449">Beach et al., 2006</xref>); deforestation and management of arboreal resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0959683612465449">Leyden, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0959683612465449">McNeil, et al., 2010</xref>) and recovery of forest cover coincident with a decline in population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0959683612465449">Bradbury et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0959683612465449">Islebe et al., 1996</xref>). Belize has extensive archaeological evidence for the occupation of the Maya, with crops appearing in pollen records throughout the region during 2000–1000 <sc>bc</sc> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0959683612465449">Hansen, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0959683612465449">Jones, 1994</xref>) and large-scale agricultural terracing and major hydraulic manipulation during the Classic period (<sc>ad</sc> 300–500) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959683612465449">Beach et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959683612465449">2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Using new pollen and charcoal records, we present a 3000 year (<italic>c</italic>. 1500 <sc>bc</sc>–<sc>ad</sc> 1500) vegetation history from the New River Lagoon (NRL), to document the nature of vegetation change near the Maya site of Lamanai, and to explore the impacts of the Maya on the floristic composition of the landscape, in particular the arboreal resources. Lamanai was one of the largest Maya settlements in Northern Belize and shows continuity of settlement through the late Classic ‘collapse’ period. Settlement began at <italic>c</italic>. 1500 <sc>bc</sc>, with major construction and population peaking during the early Classic period (<italic>c</italic>. <sc>ad</sc> 300) and Maya settlement continuing into the 17th century. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0959683612465449">Metcalfe et al. (2009)</xref> suggest that population and erosion peaked during the Preclassic and early Classic, with a population of approximately 10,000.

<p>The new pollen and charcoal analyses were undertaken on a 3 m core previously examined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0959683612465449">Metcalfe et al. (2009)</xref>, as part of study of environmental change since the latest Pleistocene using diatoms and stable isotopes (supported by mineralogical and major elemental data). The research questions addressed in this new study include: What was the extent of Maya forest clearance around Lamanai and, furthermore, is it possible to distinguish different types of clearance events? Is there evidence of Maya management of vegetation resources? Is a period of ‘Maya Collapse’ visible in this vegetation record? Finally, does this record show any forest ‘recovery’ from periods of human disturbance?</p>

<title>The vegetation and Maya settlement of Northern Belize</title>
<p>Belize is situated in the southeast of the Yucatán Peninsula (between approximately 88°45′ and 89°15′W and 18°30′N) with Mexico to the north, Guatemala to the south and west and the Caribbean Sea to the east (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0959683612465449">Figure 1</xref>). The climate is defined as seasonally dry tropical and has a boreal summer wet season, directed by the movement of the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). Northern Belize has a drier more seasonal climate than the south (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0959683612465449">Esselman and Botes, 2001</xref>), with annual precipitation in the northern region in the range 1520–2030 mm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0959683612465449">Walker, 1973</xref>).The vegetation of Northern Belize is mainly comprised of lowland broadleaved forest, lowland savanna and mangrove and littoral swamp. The ecology is driven by the underlying geology, with pine savanna found in well-drained acidic sand ridges, evergreen forest on calcareous sediments, and herbaceous swamps, seasonally inundated savanna and marshland in the freshwater lowlands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0959683612465449">Metcalfe et al., 2009</xref>).</p>

<p>Lamanai is situated on the west side of the New River Lagoon, (located approximately at 88°40′W and 17°40′N), a freshwater lagoon within the river channel about 23 km long and 750 m wide, covering approximately 13.5 km<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0959683612465449">Metcalfe et al., 2009</xref>). The lagoon is surrounded by a fringe of reeds dominated by <italic>Phragmites australis</italic> and <italic>Cladium jamaicence</italic>. To the west of the lagoon the reeds grade into a band dominated by logwood (<italic>Haematoxylon campechianum</italic>) and then into tropical evergreen seasonal broadleaved lowland forest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0959683612465449">Meerman and Sabido, 2001</xref>) and this is the vegetation that today surrounds the archaeological site of Lamanai. To the east of the lagoon, vegetation changes from a reed fringe to marsh land (dominated by <italic>Eleocharis intersticta</italic> and <italic>C. jamaicence</italic>) and then into a band of logwood, and finally into the savanna zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0959683612465449">Meerman and Sabido, 2001</xref>). The savanna zone has been described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0959683612465449">Meerman and Sabido (2001)</xref> as short-grass savanna with scattered needle-leaved trees, with characteristic species including <italic>Pinus caribaea, Metopium brownei</italic> and <italic>Byrsonima crassifolia</italic>. Detailed ecological mapping of Belize has been undertaken by the Biodiversity and Environmental Data Resource System of Belize (BERDS) and is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.biodiversity.bz/mapping/">http://www.biodiversity.bz/mapping/</ext-link></p>

<title>Sediment collection</title>
<p>A 319 cm core was extracted in 1999 using a square-rod modified Livingstone piston corer, from the end of a jetty adjacent to Lamanai in a water depth of approximately 2 m, and was shipped to the UK in plastic piping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0959683612465449">Metcalfe et al., 2009</xref>). A core top sample was extracted in 2010, from the same location and water depth using a Glew corer to retrieve the sediment–water interface intact. Samples were extruded in the field in 1 cm intervals and were shipped in sealed plastic bags. All material was stored at 4°C. From the main core, samples for pollen analysis were taken at approximately 10 cm intervals and each of the stratigraphic subsections (described shortly after the core was extracted) were sampled. The top 1 cm surface sediment from the Glew core was analysed for comparison with the modern vegetation.</p>

Owing to the length of time that has elapsed since the core was first extracted, and multiple other proxies that have used sediment sampled from this core, the core length at the time of sampling for pollen analysis had decreased to 309 cm, with the majority of core lost in the basal section, however, all the units described in 2001 were visible when sampling for this study.

<title>Pollen and charcoal analysis</title>
<p>Standard chemical digestion protocol was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0959683612465449">Bennett and Willis, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0959683612465449">Faegri et al., 1989</xref>) including hot 10% NaOH and acetolysis treatments. Additional initial stages undertaken prior to chemical digestion included a sieving stage at 250 µm to remove larger shells and then a cold 10% HCl treatment to remove carbonates. HF was not used on the samples, but instead hot Calgon® was used to remove clays, and the samples were repeatedly rinsed with distilled water until the supernatant was clear. Initial scans revealed that <italic>Zea</italic> was absent from the record, and samples from this core were included in a methodological trial to improve the recovery of <italic>Zea mays</italic> and other large cultigens grains as reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0959683612465449">Whitney et al. (2012)</xref>. The application of this methodology on five initial samples was successful in recovering a <italic>Z. mays</italic> signal, and so this new methodology was applied to the remaining samples. Known concentrations of <italic>Lycopodium</italic> spores were added to each sample to enable the calculation of pollen and charcoal concentrations. Charcoal counts were made from material prepared for pollen analysis. Particles with the length of the longest axis greater than 20 μm were counted and concentrations were calculated relative to the <italic>Lycopodium</italic> spike. Samples were counted using a Zeiss Axioscope photomicroscope at ×100, ×400 and ×1000 magnification. Pollen grains were, in the main, identified using the Central American pollen reference collection held in the School of Geography, University of Nottingham. Pollen atlases were also consulted, including those of Quintana Roo, Mexico (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0959683612465449">Palacios-Chávez et al., 1991</xref>) and Barro Colorado Island, Panama (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0959683612465449">Roubik and Moreno, 1991</xref>), as well as digital images from the ‘Neotropical Pollen Database’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0959683612465449">Bush and Weng, 2007</xref>). A minimum of 200 and a maximum of 320 fossil terrestrial grains were counted: the pollen sum is exclusive of unidentifiable damaged grains, aquatic taxa and fungal spores. Cyperaceae were included in the pollen sum because sedges comprise a large proportion of the herbaceous component of the adjacent savanna communities, as well as forming the marginal fringing semi-aquatic vegetation at NRL. Species of Rhizophoraceae (mangroves) are components of littoral forest in central Belize, and were also included in the pollen sum.</p>

<title>Pollen source</title>
<p>The modern core top sample reflects the dominant ecosystem types that surround the site at Lamanai, and the wider New River Lagoon catchment, namely seasonal broadleaf forest, which is found to the west of the New River Lagoon and surrounds the present archaeological site, and pine savanna, which is found to the east. Seasonal broadleaf forest includes ecological dominants such as <italic>B. alicastrum, B. simaruba, M. zapota</italic> and <italic>S. macrophylla</italic> that are reflected in the modern pollen assemblage. However, compared with modern pollen spectra from forested sites in this region that report Moraceae/Urticaceae comprising &gt;40% of the pollen assemblage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0959683612465449">Bhattacharya et al., 2011</xref>), the modern core sample has a relatively low arboreal signal (18%). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0959683612465449">Correa-Metrio et al. (2011)</xref> reported that it was not possible to distinguish evergreen seasonal, tropical semi-deciduous and tropical deciduous using their modern pollen spectra, and that these subcategories had to be grouped as tropical seasonal forest. This large group of taxa meant that the pollen signal was wide ranging, and this could account for the comparatively low arboreal signal in the modern assemblage from the NRL.</p>
<p>Savannas dominated by <italic>P. caribaea</italic> are represented in the modern pollen assemblage by abundant <italic>Pinus</italic> pollen. Pines are prolific producers of wind-dispersed pollen, thus regional sources, such as high elevations from Mexico/Guatemala, may contribute some pollen to the <italic>Pinus</italic> signature in the NRL record. However, source plants located nearer to deposition sites can be distinguished from regional or ‘background’ pollen where vegetation patches in a heterogeneous environment are larger than the lake area, as are Belizean pine savanna (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0959683612465449">Sugita, 1994</xref>). Therefore, we can be confident that nearby pine savannas, adjacent to the east of the NRL, contribute the greatest proportion of pine pollen in NRL and past variations in the abundance of pine in these savannas are reflected in the pollen signature. <italic>Byrsonima crassifolia</italic> is also a characteristic taxon found in Belizean pine savannas and, although of low abundance in the modern pollen assemblage at NRL, <italic>Byrsonima</italic> has been identified as an important indicator species of pine savanna in the modern pollen rain from northern Belize, as it was exclusively found in the modern pollen spectra of pine savanna sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0959683612465449">Bhattacharya et al., 2011</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0959683612465449">Ledru (2002)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0959683612465449">Gosling et al. (2009)</xref> have both demonstrated that <italic>B. crassifolia</italic> is a good indicator species of savanna (or cerrado) in the Neotropics and the presence of the less prolific <italic>Byronsima</italic> (of which there is only one additional species found in Belize), combined with <italic>Pinus</italic> pollen, is indicative of local pine savanna.</p>
<p>The presence of <italic>H. campechianum</italic> and <italic>M. brownei</italic> most likely indicate the logwood fringe that surrounds the NRL today. Palms are not abundant in the modern pollen record, and this underrepresentation is possibly due to both the large grain size (&gt;60 µm) and the large catchment of the New River Lagoon (13.5 km<sup>2</sup>). Crop taxa were only represented by a small amount of <italic>Z. mays</italic> however, it has been demonstrated in both field and laboratory settings that because of its large size (50–120 µm) <italic>Z. mays</italic> grains are poorly dispersed from the source plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0959683612465449">Jarosz et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0959683612465449">Raynor et al., 1972</xref>) and the condition of the pollen grain has been used as a proxy for taphonomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0959683612465449">Cushing, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0959683612465449">Lowe, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0959683612465449">Tipping, 1987</xref>).

The presence of multiple, undamaged <italic>Z. mays</italic> grains most likely represent a distinctive local signal within a regional record of change, and therefore provides an opportunity to examine both local and regional change within this record.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0959683612465449">Abrams and Rue (1998)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0959683612465449">McNeil et al. (2010)</xref> have suggested that the Maya selectively used <italic>Pinus</italic> for construction and fuel, with vast quantities needed to produce the limestone for stucco work. In this record <italic>Pinus</italic> has periods where it is much reduced (170 <sc>bc</sc>–<sc>ad</sc> 150) or completely absent (<sc>ad</sc> 600–980). Both these periods of a substantial or complete absence of <italic>Pinus</italic> are consistent with periods of construction and development of the site in the archaeological record and the pollen record is consistent with the heavy exploitation of <italic>P. caribaea</italic> for timber in nearby savannas. Construction began on the largest known temple (High Temple or Str. N10-43) <italic>c</italic>. 100 <sc>bc</sc> and there was significant early Classic building in various areas of the site during <sc>ad</sc> 100–400 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0959683612465449">Pendergast, 1981</xref>).

During the Terminal Classic (<sc>ad</sc> 800–1000) the construction of masonry platforms continued and the only ball court at the site dates from this period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0959683612465449">Pendergast 1982c</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0959683612465449">1986</xref>). The charcoal record is also consistent with <italic>P. caribaea</italic> being used for fuel, with the primary, secondary and tertiary peaks of charcoal at <sc>ad</sc> 590, 1250 <sc>bc</sc> and 40 <sc>bc</sc>, respectively, coincident with very low or absent <italic>Pinus</italic>. The palaeolimnological evidence is in agreement with the palynological and archaeological records. A secondary peak in silica, iron, and aluminium and magnetic susceptibility <italic>c</italic>. 170 <sc>bc</sc> to <sc>ad</sc> 270 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0959683612465449">Metcalfe et al., 2009</xref>) indicates increased erosion from the NRL catchment which could be associated with increased building at Lamanai.</p>
<p>This is the first record which demonstrates that <italic>Pinus</italic> could be used as a proxy for periods of construction because it is possible to distinguish the extraction of <italic>Pinus</italic> for timber in savannas, from clearance for agriculture (and initially, timber) in the broadleaf forest.This distinction is possible due to the edaphic controls on the distribution of these vegetation types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0959683612465449">Furley, 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0959683612465449">2007</xref>). At Copán, Honduras, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0959683612465449">McNeil et al. (2010)</xref> reported the most substantial deforestation of pine (<italic>Pinus</italic>) during the Preclassic period (<italic>c</italic>. 1800 <sc>bc</sc>–<sc>ad</sc> 250), during periods of experimental agriculture, and that pine levels increased during the Classic period as a result of management by the Maya. At Lamanai, <italic>Pinus</italic> increases post-<sc>ad</sc> 1000 after the end of major construction at the site whereas broadleaf seasonal forest species do not (e.g. <italic>Brosimum</italic> type, <italic>Maclura</italic> type). Furthermore, at the top most part of the core <italic>c</italic>. <sc>ad</sc> 1500 the decrease in arboreal signal is dominated by a reduction in <italic>Pinus</italic>, which could indicate the continued use of pine as a source of fuel and in construction, as it was a familiar resource to the European settlers, and easily accessible in the pine savannas. The early Spanish Colonial period at Lamanai dates from <italic>c</italic>. <sc>ad</sc> 1544–1641, with the construction of two churches (YDL I and YDL II) during this period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0959683612465449">Graham, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0959683612465449">Pendergast, 1975</xref>), which further supports the interpretation of the use of pine at Lamanai as a source of fuel and building materials.</p>

<title>Multifaceted Maya management of vegetation resources</title>
<p>Alongside these periods of increased pine extraction associated with construction, the pollen record suggests an active and multifaceted management of vegetation resources. There is some evidence of palm cultivation. Palms including <italic>Acrocomia aculeata</italic> and <italic>Attalea cohune</italic> form part of the forest cover at the modern site of Lamanai (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0959683612465449">Meerman and Sabido, 2001</xref>) and palms are present in the modern pollen assemblage at low levels (1%), however in the pollen record there are two periods where the palm pollen signal is much higher (4–20%). During 1630–1150 <sc>bc</sc> the palm signal is much increased (4–13%), and again, to an even higher level during 100 <sc>bc</sc>–<sc>ad</sc> 1100 (5–20%). These two periods of abundant palms are separated by a <italic>c</italic>. 700 year period (<italic>c</italic>. 930–200 <sc>bc</sc>) where the palm signal is similar to the modern assemblage. The later period (100 <sc>bc</sc>–<sc>ad</sc> 1100) is one of substantial construction at Lamanai (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0959683612465449">Pendergast, 1981</xref>) and such disturbance might be associated with an increase in the palm signal. A substantial increase in palms also occurs during a period without significant clearance, during the earliest known Maya settlement at Lamanai (1630–1100 <sc>bc</sc>). This suggests that these periods of increased palm pollen may be due to Maya cultivation, as well as clearance associated with settlement. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0959683612465449">Jones (1994)</xref> also recorded increases in the palm signal during periods of Maya occupation and attributed this to Maya cultivation.</p>
<p>The pollen record has a low arboreal signal at <sc>ad</sc> 590, with an absence of <italic>Pinus</italic>, reflecting heavy timber extraction from the savannas, and a reduction in pollen reflecting high forest, such as <italic>Brosimum</italic> type and <italic>Maclura</italic> type. This is associated with high herb taxa, a peak in charcoal concentrations and a strong <italic>Z. mays</italic> signal. This record indicates that this is a period of substantial agricultural activity at Lamanai, and is consistent with both the interpretation of a reduction in pine as a signal for increased construction, as well as the archaeological record described above. Post-<sc>ad</sc> 590 there is a slight increase in seasonal forest taxa, <italic>Z. mays</italic> is present between <sc>ad</sc> 970 and <sc>ad</sc> 1100, and palms peak <italic>c</italic>. <sc>ad</sc> 740. These changes could represent an increase in diversification by the Maya, with the management of forest resources alongside the cultivation of palms and field based agriculture, providing multiple resources, from a ‘managed mosaic’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0959683612465449">Fedick, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>This pollen record of management of vegetation resources is consistent with the archaeological record of continued occupation throughout the Terminal Classic (<sc>ad</sc> 800–1000). Papers from the wider Yucatán region have observed a period or periods of drought associated with the ‘collapse’ of Maya polities during the Terminal Classic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0959683612465449">Curtis et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0959683612465449">Hodell et al., 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0959683612465449">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0959683612465449">Neff et al., 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0959683612465449">Metcalfe et al. (2009)</xref> report that there is some isotopic enrichment <italic>c</italic>. <sc>ad</sc> 970, which could be indicative of a drying event, however this could be reflecting a regional drying signal rather than an event local to Lamanai. The local pollen record of large immobile grains (<italic>Z. mays</italic>, palms) and archaeology demonstrate that a regional-scale drying event found in other records <italic>c</italic>. <sc>ad</sc> 900 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0959683612465449">Hodell et al., 2007</xref>) does not impact upon the settlement at Lamanai.</p>

<title>Forest recovery post periods of disturbance, 1150–800 <sc>bc</sc> and post-<sc>ad</sc> 1400</title>
<p>Two periods of forest recovery after periods of disturbance are visible in this record. The first occurs after 1150 <sc>bc</sc> until <italic>c</italic>. 800 <sc>bc</sc>, with the highest arboreal levels found at <italic>c</italic>. 900 <sc>bc</sc>. This increase in arboreal taxa is accompanied by a decrease in herbs and a decrease in particulate charcoal. This possible period of forest recovery is also visible in the C/N ratios, as the peak at <italic>c</italic>. 1300 <sc>bc</sc> declines until <italic>c</italic>. 900 <sc>bc</sc> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0959683612465449">Metcalfe et al., 2009</xref>). At <sc>ad</sc> 1400 the arboreal signal increases, with a great variety of taxa including <italic>Z. guidonia</italic>. There also could be a recovery of fringing marsh that may have encircled the NRL as it does today, with the highest levels of Cyperaceae found at <sc>ad</sc> 1400 alongside a complete absence of crops (including palms), and low charcoal concentrations together suggesting decreased Maya activity. This is consistent with the record of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0959683612465449">Metcalfe et al. (2009)</xref>, which also suggested reduced anthropogenic activity at Lamanai in the topmost part of the core, indicated by low magnetic susceptibility and δ<sup>13</sup>C values. The first and second samples from the top of the core have the lowest C/N ratios which would be consistent with aquatic material comprising the majority of the organic matter deposited in the sediment core. There are no diatoms found in the period <italic>c</italic>. <sc>ad</sc> 1100–1400, which could suggest increased evaporation and increased alkalinity. Pollen evidence of forest recovery post-<sc>ad</sc> 1000 appears in other records from Northern Belize. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0959683612465449">Hansen (1990)</xref> observes forest recovery at <sc>ad</sc> 1000, indicated by a fall in <italic>Ambrosia</italic> pollen and an associated increase in arboreal taxa, and links this to a switch to less intensive farming methods consistent with a fall in population post-Collapse period. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0959683612465449">Jones (1994)</xref> also reports an increase in forest cover post-<sc>ad</sc> 900, which is consistent with the abandonment of the nearby site of Colha at <italic>c</italic>. <sc>ad</sc> 850. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0959683612465449">Brenner et al.

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The pollen and charcoal record from the NRL, near Lamanai, reflects a continuous vegetation history for the period <italic>c</italic>. 1630 <sc>bc</sc>–<sc>ad</sc> 1500. Crops, including <italic>Z. mays</italic> found at Lamanai from <italic>c</italic>. 1630 <sc>bc</sc> indicates cultivation of maize throughout the occupational history of Lamanai (Pendergast, 1987[AQ], <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0959683612465449">2002</xref>), and crops are also found <italic>c</italic>. 1600 <sc>bc</sc> in other records from Northern Belize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0959683612465449">Hansen, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0959683612465449">Jones, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0959683612465449">Pohl et al., 1996</xref>). The almost continuous and abundant local <italic>Z. mays</italic> signal from the NRL highlights the potential for a dual regional/local signal within the same record. This may improve our understanding of site-specific responses to both climatic change and human disturbance, within a regional context. Three distinct periods of construction are visible in this record, with <italic>P. caribaea</italic> extracted from the pine savannas for timber and fuel. These periods occur during the Preclassic, late Classic and the early Spanish Colonial period, and concur with the archaeological record of continuous occupation and development throughout these periods at Lamanai. Disturbance in the Preclassic was indicated in the record of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0959683612465449">Metcalfe et al. (2009)</xref> and this new palaeoecological record confirms this period as a time of anthropogenic disturbance at Lamanai, rather than reflecting regional climatic change. Furthermore this new record, combined with the previous record of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0959683612465449">Metcalfe et al. (2009)</xref> demonstrates that Maya management of resources continued into the Late Classic. Palm cultivation during the Classic and late Classic periods perhaps formed part of a suite of managed vegetation resources which also included arboreal and field-based crops. There is no evidence that climatic drying associated with ‘Maya Collapse’ found in other records from the region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0959683612465449">Curtis et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0959683612465449">Hodell et al., 1995</xref>), had any substantial impact in the palaeolimnological, palaeoecological and archaeological records from Lamanai. There is a limited record of European contact <italic>c</italic>. <sc>ad</sc> 1500, with a reduction in palms and <italic>P. caribaea</italic>, however the analysis of pollen and charcoal material from the last 1000 years will allow us to better understand the relative impacts of pre- and post-Columbian land use.</p>
