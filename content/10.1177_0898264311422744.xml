<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Socioeconomic status (SES) of the family of origin is a fundamental indicator of multiple and diverse environmental conditions that might be implicated in chronic disease incidence and mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0898264311422744">Power, Hyppönen, &amp; Davey Smith, 2005</xref>). This study explores how the onset and mortality of breast cancer are affected by various dimensions of early-life SES, including mothers’ and fathers’ education, fathers’ occupation and occupational prestige, and family income. We also examine the extent to which women’s characteristics in adulthood and late midlife mediate the associations between early-life conditions and breast cancer. Our analysis is guided by a life course epidemiological framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0898264311422744">Ben-Shlomo &amp; Kuh, 2002</xref>), which emphasizes the importance of timing in the relationships between exposures and outcomes, and suggests that exposures at different stages of the life course are involved in the etiology of chronic diseases in later life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0898264311422744">Lynch &amp; Davey Smith, 2005</xref>). Consistent with the life course emphasis of this analysis, we use data from the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study (WLS) that followed 4,275 women from their adolescence in the 1950s until 2005.</p>
<p>Early-life environmental conditions can influence health in later life both <italic>directly</italic> and <italic>indirectly</italic> through their influence on subsequent life course trajectories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0898264311422744">Ben-Shlomo &amp; Kuh, 2002</xref>). Based on existing research, we propose specific direct and indirect pathways between early-life socioeconomic conditions and the risk of breast cancer incidence and mortality. Direct pathways involve childhood environment as a critical exposure, whereas indirect pathways include women’s socioeconomic achievement, reproductive behaviors, and lifestyle in adulthood. Below we describe each pathway in detail referring to hypothesized pathways (labeled <italic>a-i</italic>) summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0898264311422744">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

<sec id="section2-0898264311422744">
<title>Parents’ SES and Early-Life Environment</title>
<p>A direct pathway between early-life SES and breast cancer is represented in life course epidemiology by the <italic>critical period model</italic>, according to which exposures acting early in life have lasting effects on organs, tissues, and bodily systems, and these effects are not modified in any considerable way by experiences later in life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0898264311422744">Ben-Shlomo &amp; Kuh, 2002</xref>). Exposures in a critical period may result in permanent and irreversible changes leading to the development of chronic diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0898264311422744">Ben-Shlomo &amp; Kuh, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>It is possible that early-life socioeconomic characteristics shape the environment that directly affects biological processes in childhood and adolescence, which in turn may reduce or increase the risk of breast cancer incidence later in life (path <italic>a</italic>). Moreover, whereas low SES of the family of origin was consistently shown to be a risk factor for other chronic conditions, such as cardiovascular disease or smoking-related cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0898264311422744">Galobardes, Lynch, &amp; Davey Smith, 2004</xref>), research suggests that the relationship between low parental SES and daughters’ breast cancer incidence is more complex. Low SES in early life may be associated with both protective and deleterious influences on breast cancer in later life. Specifically, low parental SES may decrease the risk of breast cancer via daughters’ body weight. Children of parents with low SES are more likely to be overweight or obese than children from higher SES families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0898264311422744">Thibault, Contrand, Saubusse, Baine, &amp; Maurice-Tison, 2010</xref>). Interestingly, a higher body mass index in childhood is related to a reduced risk of breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0898264311422744">Ruder, Dorgan, Kranz, Kris-Etherton, &amp; Hartman, 2008</xref>). In contrast, low parental SES may increase the risk of breast cancer via unhealthy diet. Low parental SES is associated with the “Western” dietary pattern consisting of refined sugars and grains, fried foods, and processed meats, whereas higher parental SES is conducive to the healthy eating pattern including whole grains, fruit, vegetables, and fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0898264311422744">Ambrosini et al., 2009</xref>). In turn, cancer risk in adulthood may be influenced by childhood diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0898264311422744">Maynard, Gunnell, Emmett, Frankel, &amp; Davey Smith, 2003</xref>). For example, women who had frequently consumed French fries at preschool age had a higher risk of breast cancer than women with a low consumption of fried foods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0898264311422744">Michels, Rosner, Cameron, Colditz, &amp; Willett, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>With respect to a direct pathway between early-life SES and breast cancer mortality (path <italic>a</italic>), individuals with poorer socioeconomic circumstances in childhood experience a higher risk of overall mortality, independent of their adult SES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0898264311422744">Galobardes et al., 2004</xref>). For example, middle-aged women whose parents achieved fewer years of education had higher levels of the inflammation marker C-reactive protein than women with higher parental education, even after adjustment for women’s own educational attainment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0898264311422744">Phillips et al., 2009</xref>). This finding suggests that low SES of the family of origin may be associated with persistent inflammation over the life course. In turn, chronic inflammation may increase the risk of breast cancer progression and recurrence and, thus, contribute to breast cancer mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0898264311422744">Cole, 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Parents’ SES and Women’s Roles in Adulthood</title>
<p>Childhood SES may affect women’s reproductive behaviors by shaping women’s childbearing preferences, as suggested by path <italic>b</italic>. Low SES of the family of origin is associated with offspring’s younger age at first birth and higher parity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0898264311422744">Kahn &amp; Anderson, 1992</xref>). Path <italic>c</italic> represents a link between women’s childbearing and breast cancer. Later age at first birth (especially after age 30) and lower parity are associated with a moderately elevated risk of breast cancer incidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0898264311422744">Reeves et al., 2007</xref>), most likely via prolonged cumulative exposure of the breast to endogenous estrogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0898264311422744">Kelsey &amp; Bernstein, 1996</xref>). Because of their earlier entry into motherhood and higher parity, women from families may have lower breast cancer risk than their peers from higher SES families.</p>
<p>In addition, childhood SES may affect women’s reproductive behaviors <italic>indirectly</italic> through women’s educational attainment (path <italic>de</italic>). Parents’ SES is positively associated with children’s education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0898264311422744">Sewell &amp; Hauser, 1975</xref>). In turn, women with higher education have lower fertility, later age at first birth, and a greater prevalence of childlessness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0898264311422744">Heck &amp; Pamuk, 1997</xref>). Thus, women from advantaged socioeconomic background may have higher breast cancer incidence because they achieve higher education, which is associated with later age at first birth and lower parity (path <italic>dec</italic>).</p>
<p>In addition to breast cancer incidence, family SES may have an indirect effect on breast cancer mortality. Among women already diagnosed with breast cancer, higher levels of education are associated with lower mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0898264311422744">Bouchardy, Verkooijen, &amp; Fioretta, 2006</xref>). Women of lower SES are more likely to be diagnosed with advanced disease and have a poorer prognosis than their higher SES counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0898264311422744">Vona-Davis &amp; Rose, 2009</xref>). It appears that higher early-life SES, acting indirectly through women’s own higher education, may reduce breast cancer mortality (path <italic>df</italic>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0898264311422744">
<title>Parents’ SES and Women’s Lifestyle in Adulthood</title>
<p>Whereas higher SES of the family of origin may increase breast cancer incidence via delayed childbearing, it may also decrease the risk via women’s lifestyle and health behaviors in adulthood (paths <italic>gi</italic> and <italic>dhi</italic>). Childhood socioeconomic conditions affect preferences for major lifestyle behaviors (path <italic>g</italic>), including smoking, alcohol use, diet, and physical activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0898264311422744">Hayward &amp; Gorman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0898264311422744">Mirowsky &amp; Ross, 1998</xref>). In addition to health socialization, the family of origin may be related to adult lifestyle indirectly by shaping women’s educational opportunities (path <italic>dh</italic>). Just like parents’ SES, individuals’ own education and income are associated positively with healthy lifestyle (path <italic>h</italic>). Compared to persons with low levels of education, well-educated individuals are more likely to exercise, to maintain healthy diet, to consume alcohol moderately, and are less likely to smoke and to be overweight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0898264311422744">Lynch, Kaplan, &amp; Salonen, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0898264311422744">Mirowsky &amp; Ross, 1998</xref>). Research suggests that lifestyle factors may be related to breast cancer incidence (path <italic>i</italic>). Higher early-life SES may reduce breast cancer incidence via exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0898264311422744">Friedenreich &amp; Cust, 2008</xref>), nonsmoking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0898264311422744">Mirowsky &amp; Ross, 1998</xref>), and healthy weight in adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0898264311422744">Reeves et al., 2007</xref>), yet increase breast cancer risk via alcohol consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0898264311422744">Mirowsky &amp; Ross, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Health behaviors are also related to survival among women diagnosed with breast cancer (path <italic>i</italic>). Women who are physically active and maintain a healthy weight after the diagnosis exhibit higher survival rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0898264311422744">Kellen, Vansant, Christiaens, Neven, &amp; Van Limbergen, 2009</xref>), whereas obesity may be associated with decreased survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0898264311422744">Carmichael &amp; Bates, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0898264311422744">Reeves et al., 2007</xref>). These findings suggest that women with higher childhood SES may have lower breast cancer mortality because of their higher levels of exercise and lower body weight.</p>

<title>Summary of Pathways</title>
<p>According to the <italic>critical period mechanism</italic>, SES of the family of origin has a direct effect on women’s risk of breast cancer incidence and mortality, and this effect is not explained by women’s adult characteristics.</p>
<p>According to the <italic>indirect pathway mechanism</italic>, SES of the family of origin shapes women’s characteristics in adulthood, which in turn are associated with breast cancer risk. In other words, the effect of early-life SES is mediated by women’s achieved SES, reproductive behaviors, and lifestyle in adulthood.</p>

<title>Data</title>
<p><italic>The Wisconsin Longitudinal Study (WLS)</italic> is a long-term study of a random sample of 10,317 men and women who graduated from Wisconsin high schools in 1957. Participants were interviewed at ages 17 to 18 (in 1957), 36 (in 1975), 53 to 54 (in 1993), and 64 to 65 (in 2004). Survey data were also collected from a selected sibling in 1977, 1994, and 2005. The overwhelming majority of the WLS participants are non-Hispanic White because very few members of racial or ethnic minority groups graduated from Wisconsin high schools in the 1950s. The WLS sample retention is exceptionally high. The baseline 1957 sample comprised 5,326 women, more than 90% of whom (4,808 women) participated in the 1975 wave. About 90% of the 1975 female participants were reinterviewed in 1993, and 77% of the 1975 women participated in the 2004 interview. In addition, 663 sisters of the main participants were interviewed in all waves between 1977 and 2005. Using the National Death Index (NDI) link, it was established that 51 women participants and 45 sisters had died of breast cancer during the course of the study.</p>
<p>We include both main participants and their sisters in our analysis to maximize the number of breast cancer cases. A sensitivity analysis revealed that the results among main participants only (excluding the sibling subsample) were largely similar to models combining main participants and their sisters. The breast cancer incidence subsample contains women who participated in all waves: 275 women (222 main participants and 53 siblings) who had been diagnosed with breast cancer and were alive as of the most recent wave of data collection in 2004-2005, and 4,000 women who have never been diagnosed with breast cancer. Women who died of breast cancer are not included in the incidence analysis because the age at a breast cancer diagnosis was not established for them. Furthermore, to explore survival after the diagnosis, the breast cancer mortality subsample includes all women known to be diagnosed with breast cancer: 96 women (not included in the incidence sample) who died of breast cancer and the 275 women from the incidence sample who were diagnosed with breast cancer and were alive in 2004-2005.</p>
<p>We conducted detailed analyses to evaluate how sample attrition can potentially bias our findings. Using propensity score matching, we examined how cancer in 1993-1994 affected women’s participation in the 2004-2005 wave. The results (available on request) suggest that women who had cancer at baseline and survived to the follow-up were somewhat more likely to participate in the study than comparable women without cancer. Furthermore, the analysis of characteristics <italic>other than cancer</italic> revealed that our findings may be more representative of women with a higher income and larger families in 1975-1977. Otherwise, there is little evidence that attrition related to cancer or other characteristics can significantly bias our findings. We estimated all our models both with and without propensity score variables derived from the analysis of sample attrition. Because the results from the two sets of models were nearly identical, we report findings from the more parsimonious models without propensity scores.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0898264311422744">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>The two dependents variables are <italic>age at a breast cancer diagnosis</italic> and <italic>age at a breast cancer death</italic> measured in whole years. The age at diagnosis was self-reported by the participant, whereas the year of death was established via the link to the NDI.</p>
<p>All models include <italic>life course biological variables</italic> based on the participants’ self-reports: age at menarche coded in years, age at menopause coded in years, the presence and age of hysterectomy and/or oophorectomy, and family history of breast cancer (coded 1 if a woman’s mother or sister were diagnosed with breast cancer and coded 0 otherwise). We include these biological variables because they may be related both to women’s SES over the life course and to the risk of breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0898264311422744">Erekson, Weitzen, Sung, Raker, &amp; Myers, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0898264311422744">James-Todd, Tehranifar, Rich-Edwards, Titievsky, &amp; Terry, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0898264311422744">Kelsey &amp; Bernstein, 1996</xref>). In addition, all models adjust for <italic>birth year</italic>. All main participants were born in 1939, whereas siblings’ birth year ranges from 1929 to 1950, with the median being 1941.</p>
<sec id="section9-0898264311422744">
<title>Early-life variables</title>
<p>Sociodemographic family background characteristics were reported in 1957 and 1975 by main participants and in 1977 by siblings. Additional information was obtained from Wisconsin tax records in early 1960s. We conducted a within-family comparison of reports of early-life SES. In other words, the reports of the main participant in 1957 were compared to her sister’s reports in 1977. This comparison revealed a high level of within-family consistency. For example, the intraclass correlation coefficient of the reports of father’s education was 0.97. This congruence suggests that the time lag between the reports of main participants and their sisters is unlikely to bias our findings. Sociodemographic characteristics of the family of origin include fathers’ and mothers’ education, fathers’ occupation represented with five mutually exclusive dummy variables (professional/executive, white-collar worker, skilled worker, unskilled worker, and farmer), fathers’ occupational prestige assessed with Duncan’s socioeconomic index, and family income in 1957 measured in US$100s.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0898264311422744">
<title>1975-1977 variables</title>
<p><italic>Education</italic> was assessed as the total completed years of schooling. Women’s <italic>occupation</italic> is represented with several mutually exclusive dummy variables: housewife (reference category); professional occupation; sales, administrative, or service occupation; other occupation (laborer, farmer, operative, etc.). <italic>Household income</italic> reflects total earnings of all family members in US$100s. We took the natural log of the income variable. <italic>Marital status</italic> is coded 1 if a woman was married and 0 if she was unmarried. For women who were married, <italic>age at marriage</italic> is also included. <italic>Parental status</italic> is represented with three variables: a dummy variable coded 1 if a woman had borne at least one child by 1975-1977, age at first birth, and the total number of children.</p>
<p><italic>Health behaviors</italic> were assessed in 1993-1994 based on participants’ self-reports. <italic>Physical activity</italic> is coded as a monthly frequency of vigorous exercise (1 = <italic>three or more times per week</italic>, 2 = <italic>once or twice per week</italic>, 3 = <italic>one to three times per month</italic>, 4 = <italic>less than once per month</italic>). <italic>Smoking</italic> is represented with three dummy variables: current smoker, former smoker, and nonsmoker (reference group). <italic>Alcohol use</italic> is assessed with the number of drinks consumed in a month prior to the interview, with a value of 0 imputed for women who did not drink. <italic>Body mass index</italic> (BMI) is measured as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters.</p>

<p>To predict breast cancer onset and mortality, we use the <italic>Cox regression models</italic>. The outcome in the models predicting breast cancer onset is age at a breast cancer diagnosis, whereas the outcome in the models predicting breast cancer mortality is age at breast cancer death. The models estimate the hazard function, which represents the instantaneous probability that a woman is diagnosed with breast cancer (or dies of breast cancer) at a given age conditional on not having been diagnosed before that age (or being alive at that age). The hazard function for woman <italic>i</italic> is modeled as follows:</p>

<p>In addition to Cox regression models, we use a <italic>decomposition analysis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0898264311422744">Buis, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0898264311422744">Erikson, Goldthorpe, Jackson, Yaish, &amp; Cox, 2005</xref>) to test for mediating effects of adulthood characteristics. Let X denote an early-life variable (e.g., fathers’ education), Z an adulthood characteristic (e.g., women’s own education), and O the odds of breast cancer incidence or mortality. The decomposition analysis estimates an <italic>indirect</italic> effect of X on O through Z. For example, fathers’ education can have a direct effect on O as well as an indirect effect via women’s own education. If these direct and indirect effects are represented as logged odds ratios, then the total effect of fathers’ education is the sum of the direct and indirect effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0898264311422744">Buis, 2010</xref>):</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0898264311422744">Table 2</xref> shows the effect of each early-life socioeconomic characteristic on breast cancer onset and mortality. Although the findings in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0898264311422744">Table 2</xref> are based on the combined sample of main participants and their sisters, models excluding the sibling subsample (not shown) yielded very similar results to those presented here. All models in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0898264311422744">Table 2</xref> adjust for birth year, age at menarche and menopause, the presence and age of hysterectomy or oophorectomy, and family history of breast cancer. Although the table presents hazard ratios for all variables simultaneously, each early-life variable was added to biological risk factors in a separate model to address potential collinearity and examine its gross effect unconfounded by other related variables. In a sensitivity analysis (available on request), we added all early-life variables simultaneously in one model, and the findings were very similar to models including each early-life variable separately. The effects of early-life characteristics on breast cancer <italic>incidence</italic> over the life course are presented in column 1. Women whose mothers had at least a high school diploma had a 23% greater risk of a breast cancer diagnosis than women whose mothers did not graduate from high school (HR = 1.23, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). Similarly, women whose parents’ income was above the median in 1957 had 1.34 times the risk of a breast cancer diagnosis than women with family income below the median (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). Notably, fathers’ education, occupation, and occupational prestige are unrelated to the daughter’s onset of breast cancer.</p>

<p>The incidence analysis excludes women who died of breast cancer because the age at a breast cancer diagnosis was not established for them. In a sensitivity analysis (available on request), we created a binary indicator of breast cancer prevalence coded 1 for breast cancer survivors and breast cancer decedents combined, and coded 0 for women without breast cancer. Results from logistic regression models predicting breast cancer prevalence based on early-life characteristics are largely consistent with findings from the incidence analysis reported in column 1 of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0898264311422744">Table 2</xref>.</p>
<p>Column 2 of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0898264311422744">Table 2</xref> summarizes the effects of early-life SES on breast cancer <italic>mortality</italic>. Fathers’ education is the only significant predictor of women’s hazard of breast cancer death. Women whose fathers had high school education or more faced an 88% lower risk of breast cancer death than women whose fathers did not graduate from high school (HR = .125, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Whereas fathers’ education is not related to breast cancer incidence, having a more educated father is associated positively with breast cancer survival after the diagnosis.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0898264311422744">Table 3</xref> indicates the extent to which the effects of mothers’ education and family income on breast cancer incidence and the effect of fathers’ education on breast cancer mortality are mediated by women’s SES and family formation in adulthood as well as lifestyle in late midlife. A mediation analysis of the 1993-1994 lifestyle variables was done with 172 women who were diagnosed with breast cancer after 1993-1994 and 52 women who died of breast cancer after 1993-1994.</p>

<p>As shown in column 1, 44% of the effect of mothers’ education on breast cancer onset is mediated by women’s own education in 1975-1977. Daughters of more educated mothers were more likely than their peers with less educated mothers to obtain a college degree. In turn, women who had at least a college degree had 1.55 times the risk of a breast cancer diagnosis than women without college education (HR = 1.548, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). Similarly, women’s occupation in 1975-1977 mediates 28% of the effect of mothers’ education on breast cancer incidence. Higher maternal education was associated with a woman’s greater likelihood of being in a professional occupation, and women in this occupational category had a significantly higher risk of a breast cancer diagnosis than housewives or women in other occupations (HR = 1.788, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Furthermore, age at first birth and the number of children in 1975-1977 mediate 16% and 14%, respectively, of the effect of mothers’ education. Women with more educated mothers had, on average, later age at first birth and fewer children than daughters of less educated mothers, and this reproductive pattern is associated with an elevated risk of breast cancer. The mediating effects of women’ education, occupation, age at first birth, and the number of children in 1975-1977 are significant at the .01 level, and adjustment for each of these variables reduces the coefficient for mothers’ education to nonsignificance. In contrast to the 1975-1977 variables, health behaviors assessed in 1993-1994 neither mediate the effect of mothers’ education nor are related to breast cancer onset.</p>
<p>Column 2 of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0898264311422744">Table 3</xref> reveals that significant mediators of the effect of family income on breast cancer onset are the following 1975-1977 variables: women’s own education (22.5%), women’s occupation (18%), age at first birth (10%), and the number of children (7%). Just like with mothers’ education, the 1993-1994 health behavior variables neither mediate the effect of family income nor predict the onset of breast cancer. Unlike mothers’ education, however, the effect of family income is <italic>not</italic> fully explained by any life course variable and remains significant even after adjustment for all study variables simultaneously (not shown).</p>
<p>Column 3 of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0898264311422744">Table 3</xref> indicates that women’s own education mediates 22% of the protective effect of fathers’ education on breast cancer survival. Daughters whose fathers graduated from high school were more likely to obtain a college degree than women whose fathers were not high school graduates. In turn, college-educated women faced a risk of breast cancer mortality that was 50% lower than the risk of women without a college degree (HR = .511, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). The mediating effect of women’s own education is significant at the .01 level, and the effect of fathers’ education becomes not significant after adjustment for daughters’ education. In contrast to education, women’s occupation, income, and family characteristics in 1975-1977 do not mediate the effect of fathers’ education. The 1993-1994 lifestyle variables neither mediate the effect of fathers’ education nor are related to breast cancer mortality.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Using data from the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study, we examine life course mechanisms linking women’s early-life SES to the risk of breast cancer onset and mortality. Consistent with the life course epidemiological perspective, this study reveals the role of early-life social environment in the development of breast cancer in later life. We argue that a life course approach is essential to understanding the etiology of chronic diseases of older age.</p>
<p>Our study provides some evidence that higher SES of the family of origin is a risk factor for breast cancer incidence, but a protective factor for breast cancer mortality. This finding suggests that the relationship between early-life SES and breast cancer is complex because both high- and low-SES of the family of origin are associated with protective and deleterious influences on breast cancer in later life. Distinguishing between breast cancer incidence and mortality is a first step in the exploration of opposing beneficial and negative forces associated with early-life SES. Moreover, disaggregating SES of the family of origin into specific dimensions enables us to further emphasize the complexity of the role of early-life SES and to explore which early-life social characteristics are directly related to breast cancer and which are mediated by the intervening processes of educational and occupational attainment, and family formation. Because our findings show the importance of both direct and indirect pathways linking early-life socioeconomic conditions to breast cancer, we find support both for the critical period and the indirect pathway hypotheses although with respect to different components of early-life SES. Below we summarize and interpret our findings referring to paths in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0898264311422744">Figure 1</xref>.</p>
<sec id="section14-0898264311422744">
<title>Mothers’ Education and the Increased Risk of Breast Cancer Incidence</title>
<p>Women whose mothers graduated from high school have an increased risk of breast cancer compared to daughters of less educated mothers. The effect of mothers’ education is mediated by women’s own education (path <italic>df</italic>), women’s occupation in 1975-1977 (path <italic>df</italic>), women’s age at first birth (paths <italic>bc</italic> and <italic>dec</italic>), and the number of children (paths <italic>bc</italic> and <italic>dec</italic>). This mediation effect is consistent with the indirect pathway mechanism. Compared to women with less educated mothers, daughters of more educated mothers tend to obtain more education themselves, work in professional occupations, start childbearing later, and have fewer children. In turn, these patterns of status attainment and family formation are associated with a greater risk of breast cancer.</p>
<p>Whereas mothers’ education is a significant predictor of daughters’ breast cancer risk, fathers’ education is unrelated to breast cancer incidence. Post hoc analyses (available on request) show that mothers’ education has a <italic>stronger</italic> effect than fathers’ education on the probability that a daughter had borne at least one child by 1975-1977 and was in a professional occupation in young adulthood. Because of a particular closeness between daughters and mothers, women may be more strongly socialized by their mothers than fathers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0898264311422744">Axinn &amp; Thornton, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0898264311422744">Suitor &amp; Pillemer, 2006</xref>). Daughters may be more inclined than sons to view their mothers as role models and more likely to adopt behaviors consistent with their mothers’ preferences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0898264311422744">Axinn &amp; Thornton, 1993</xref>). Thus mothers’ education plays a more important role in the etiology of breast cancer than fathers’ education because mothers’ characteristics may be particularly important for shaping daughters’ preferences for education, career, and childbearing.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0898264311422744">
<title>Family Income and the Increased Risk of Breast Cancer Incidence</title>
<p>Women with higher levels of early-life family income had a greater risk of breast cancer incidence than women from families with less income. Consistent with the indirect pathway mechanism, the effect of family income is partly mediated by women’s own education (path <italic>df</italic>), women’s occupation in young adulthood (path <italic>df</italic>), women’s age at first birth (paths <italic>bc</italic> and <italic>dec</italic>), and the number of children (paths <italic>bc</italic> and <italic>dec</italic>). Yet the effect of family income still remains significant after adjustment for all variables in the study. In other words, part of the effect of family income in adolescence on breast cancer risk is direct and not mediated by women’s characteristics in adulthood, which is consistent with the critical period model (path <italic>a</italic>). Family income may shape the environment that directly affects biological processes, which in turn may have long-term implications for the development of breast cancer.</p>
<p>Although we do not have measures of our participants’ lifestyle in childhood and adolescence, existing research allows us to suggest a mechanism linking early-life family income to breast cancer incidence in adulthood. Research suggests that higher childhood BMI may decrease the risk of breast cancer in later life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0898264311422744">Ruder et al., 2008</xref>). Childhood and adolescent obesity is associated with a significantly lower risk of breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0898264311422744">Magnusson et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0898264311422744">Velie, Nechuta, &amp; Osuch, 2005-2006</xref>). In turn, it is girls from low-income families that are more likely to be obese than their peers with higher levels of family income (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0898264311422744">Lee, Harris, &amp; Gordon-Larsen, 2009</xref>). Because women from higher income families of origin are less likely to be obese than their peers from low-income family background, high early-life income may be directly associated with an increased breast cancer risk. This mechanism needs to be further tested with studies of older adults that have prospective measures of obesity in childhood and adolescence.</p>

<sec id="section16-0898264311422744">
<title>Fathers’ Education and the Decreased Risk of Breast Cancer Mortality</title>
<p>Women whose fathers graduated from high school had lower breast cancer mortality than daughters of fathers without a high school diploma. Yet, the effect of fathers’ education on breast cancer mortality is mediated entirely by women’s own education (path <italic>df</italic>). Our study confirms previous findings that women with more education have higher breast cancer incidence but lower breast cancer mortality than women with lower education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0898264311422744">Bouchardy et al., 2006</xref>). The better survival of more educated women after a breast cancer diagnosis is mostly explained by their regular use of breast cancer screening procedures and healthy lifestyle. Mammographic screening is used more frequently and regularly by women with higher levels of education and income than by lower-SES women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0898264311422744">Halliday, Taira, Davis, &amp; Chan, 2007</xref>). Furthermore, women of low SES are more likely to be obese (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0898264311422744">Schieman, Pudrovska, &amp; Eccles, 2007</xref>), and obesity is related to a later stage at breast cancer diagnosis and higher tumor proliferation, which may adversely affect prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0898264311422744">Vona-Davis &amp; Rose, 2009</xref>). In addition, lower SES women are more likely than their peers with higher SES to be diagnosed with comorbid conditions in combination with breast cancer. Comorbidity, in turn, may be related to poorer survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0898264311422744">Dalton et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Notably, this study shows that fathers’ education is protective against daughters’ breast cancer mortality, whereas mothers’ education is not. A possible explanation may be related to the fact that compared to mothers’ education, fathers’ education is a stronger predictor of women’s attainment of a college degree, at least in this data set. Women in this study who came of age in the 1950s and early 1960s were expected to be primarily wives and mothers; therefore, families placed more emphasis on sons’ than daughters’ education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0898264311422744">Carr, 2004</xref>). It is possible that only educated fathers were inclined to promote their daughters’ education in the time when women were assumed to have lesser needs for education than men. More educated fathers might have instilled in their daughters higher educational aspirations and have encouraged their daughters to achieve college education.</p>

<sec id="section17-0898264311422744">
<title>Limitations and Future Research</title>
<p>An important limitation of this study is that the WLS data are based on a select sample of women who obtained higher levels of education and came from families with higher SES than the average levels for this birth cohort in the population. To speculate how this left-selection of our sample with respect to parents’ and women’s own SES might have affected our findings, we conducted a simulation (available on request) adding the information on women with less than high school education in the Health and Retirement Study to our original WLS sample. The results of this simulation suggest that if the WLS sample contained more women with lower levels of education, the direction of the statistically significant effects reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0898264311422744">Table 2</xref> would likely be the same but the magnitude of the effects would increase slightly. In other words, the WLS probably provides conservative estimates of the effects of early-life socioeconomic characteristics on breast cancer.</p>
<p>Contrary to our expectations, health behaviors measured in 1993-1994 were unrelated to breast cancer incidence and mortality (path <italic>i</italic>). It is possible that health behaviors at earlier life course stages are more important than lifestyle in late midlife, yet the WLS did not assess women’s health behaviors in 1957 and 1975-1977. It is interesting that only two measures of early-life SES were related to breast cancer incidence and only one measure to breast cancer mortality. It is possible that other measures were indeed less important than the aspects of early-life SES for which associations were found. Alternatively, it is also possible that positive and negative influences associated with some early-life SES characteristics counterbalance each other, resulting in the absence of the overall effect. Because we do not have detailed measures of health and lifestyle in early life, we could not explicitly disentangle protective and perilous influences on breast cancer associated with each component of early-life SES. An important direction for future research is to unravel potential countervailing forces associated with specific characteristics of socioeconomic family background using prospective measures of early-life risk factors for breast cancer. Moreover, our data do not have information on parents’ lifestyle. Intergenerational transmission of health behaviors may be one of the ways in which socioeconomic family background is related to breast cancer incidence and mortality. Yet our data do not allow to explore this mechanism. Ideally, future studies of breast cancer should include information about diet, BMI, and physical activity assessed prospectively in childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood as well as information on parents’ lifestyle.</p>
<p>The diagnosis of breast cancer in our study is self-reported; therefore, report bias may potentially present a problem for our analysis. Women may have breast cancer but do not report it simply because they are unaware of it. Yet research linking self-reports of cancer to state cancer registries suggests that individuals accurately report a past diagnosis of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0898264311422744">Bergmann et al., 1998</xref>). In addition, we use Monte Carlo (MC) simulations to examine whether our findings can be driven by differential knowledge of a breast cancer diagnosis resulting from SES differences in screening mammography utilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0898264311422744">Meissner et al., 2007</xref>). Results from MC simulations (available on request) suggest that our findings are robust to the report bias and, thus, are unlikely to be an artifact of SES differences in breast cancer reporting.</p>
<p>This study is based on women who came of age in the 1950s and early1960s. Because women’s educational attainment has been steadily increasing since then, pathways linking early-life SES and breast cancer may be different for women of recent cohorts. Yet, given the age distribution of breast cancer incidence, the WLS women have been at the peak of their breast cancer risk for over a decade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0898264311422744">National Cancer Institute, 2008</xref>). Exploring breast cancer in younger cohorts that have not reached the peak years may be less informative. Moreover, the WLS is representative of well-educated women of their generation and suitable for exploring the causes of breast cancer among women at the higher levels of educational distribution.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the WLS contains only White non-Hispanic participants. Given racial and ethnic differences in SES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0898264311422744">Hayward &amp; Gorman, 2004</xref>), the proposed mechanisms cannot be directly extrapolated to minority women. It is still likely, however, that our findings at least partly reflect the experiences of non-White racial and ethnic groups because research shows that racial differences in breast cancer incidence and progression are mostly explained by SES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0898264311422744">Baquet &amp; Commiskey, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0898264311422744">Gerend &amp; Pai, 2008</xref>). The only differences that seem to be more biological than social are somewhat higher incidence of breast cancer among African American women before 40 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0898264311422744">Baquet &amp; Commiskey, 2000</xref>) and a more biologically aggressive nature of the disease in African American women than in White women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0898264311422744">Gerend &amp; Pai, 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This study suggests that childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood may be important periods for the development of risk factors for breast cancer onset and mortality. Therefore, prevention efforts should focus on earlier life course stages in addition to adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0898264311422744">Colditz &amp; Frazier, 1995</xref>). Consistent with the life course epidemiological framework, this study identifies mechanisms linking social environment early in life to breast cancer decades later. Our findings emphasize the role of social factors, especially, status attainment processes intertwined with reproductive behaviors, in breast cancer incidence and survival. The immediate next step for our research will be to apply the theoretical and analytical frameworks developed in this study to other chronic diseases (in particular, cardiovascular disease and prostate cancer) and to mortality in later life.</p>
