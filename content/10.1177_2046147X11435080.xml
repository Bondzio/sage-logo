<abstract>
<p>The notion that contemporary society as a knowledge economy is undergoing profound transformation has implications for the occupation of public relations, as well as the professional and personal identities of public relations practitioners. With the increasing erosion of once clear demarcations between people, time, space and communication technologies, public relations practitioners experience increasing tensions in their encounters between self and other, private and public, economic and cultural factors. We are interested in how women in public relations undertake identity work as a way of responding to these pressures, notably at the point where their home and work lives intersect. In interviews and focus groups conducted in Perth, Western Australia, women of different ages and career backgrounds related their experiences of juggling multiple roles including worker, mother, partner, friend, parent or grandparent. The findings reveal a set of complex identity constructions that indicate that some women are successful in separating professional and personal identities, while others are unable to resist work as an all-encompassing activity and as the marker of a meaningful identity. To develop as a public relations practitioner involves not only the social expectations of what it means to be a professional coupled with an individual’s presentation of themselves in public relations. It also involves a changeable relationship that expands over the whole life situation, including career trajectories and family life stages. A recognition of this set of circumstances prompts further research questions in relation to public relations and its specific influence on gendered, identity and relationship practices, and has significant implications for the profession more broadly.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The notion that the public and the private operate as discrete spheres has formed the basis for much research into the challenges for professionals when work and home lives intersect. It is not uncommon for individuals involved in knowledge-based or professional work to aspire to an idealized state whereby professional and personal identities are both separate and in equilibrium. In reality, however, few claim to achieve this. Instead, the competing demands of home and career can stimulate multiple coping strategies many of which may result in negative emotional and psychological effects (for example, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2046147X11435080">Haar, 2006</xref>), with undesirable consequences for professional work, such as absenteeism and high turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-2046147X11435080">Kreiner, 2006</xref>). In public relations, there are cases when the professional may even subdue the personal to such an extent that women and men opt out entirely from family obligations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2046147X11435080">Aldoory et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In this article, we explore how women working in public relations negotiate the relationships between the professional and private spheres of their lives. Using the conceptual lens of identity and its relatedness to social context, we expose the practices that women employ to integrate or separate work and home relationships with consequences for the relational, emotional and psychological well-being of public relations practitioners, and implications for the profession itself.</p>
<p>Contesting the thesis that there exist separate spheres and that individuals have separable but coherent identities is the now dominant view of contemporary society as a knowledge economy. This approach, informed by the work of Manuel Castells, advances the idea that social relationships within which technology is embedded have been transformed: ‘internet users (the majority of the population in advanced societies and a growing proportion of the third world) <italic>live</italic> with the Internet’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2046147X11435080">Castells, 2009</xref>: 64; italics in original). Thus, the once clear demarcations between work and home, labour and leisure, and economic and cultural value have been blurred. Individuals increasingly cross and coexist simultaneously across borders that are not only physical and technological but also emotional, psychological, relational, spatial and temporal.</p>
<p>To some extent, these ideas were raised 30 years ago when Kanter, writing in 1977 about work and family in Northern America, alluded to ‘the myth of separate worlds’ (Kanter in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-2046147X11435080">Kreiner et al., 2009</xref>: 704). Since then this inexorable linkage between public–private work and home life has been compounded by the profound changes that have occurred in the way that people work, as Castells and others have noted (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2046147X11435080">Gratton, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-2046147X11435080">Sennett, 1998</xref>). Wireless connections and mobile devices, for example, permit a constant connection between work and home, encouraging work-related notions of planning and control to intrude into non-work lives. The emergence of the boundaryless organization, the virtual office and the so-called flexible workforce have led to multiple forms of employment, as well as different stable and temporary relational threads binding the public and the private.</p>
<p>Arguably, this has led to more complex ways of defining and managing identity. Wenger understands identity ‘as a pivot between the social and the individual’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-2046147X11435080">1998</xref>: 145). He rejects the notion that the two are dichotomous; rather, he draws attention to the centrality of lived experience within particular social milieux. The term ‘multi-membership’ designates individuals’ identities as belonging to and realized through different ‘communities of practice’, which he defines as the specific formal or informal grouping with which we are involved and the various ‘practices, routines, rituals, artifacts, symbols, conventions, stories and histories’ that characterize them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-2046147X11435080">Wenger, 1998</xref>: 6). In turn, multi-membership also constitutes the ‘living experience of boundaries’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-2046147X11435080">Wenger, 1998</xref>: 161). Hence, taking Wenger’s cue, it appears that individuals weave their way within and across the various spheres of their lives that those boundaries (however tenuously or porously) demarcate. Identities and the ‘landscape of practice’ (the different communities in which people participate) both reflect and shape one another, as part of an ongoing process of identity (as becoming). For Wenger, none of this is to suggest the view that individuals have ‘multiple identities’, because this would elide the ways in which participation in different communities of practice (from individuals’ perspectives, as workers, mothers, partners, etc.) ‘interact, influence each other, and require coordination’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-2046147X11435080">1998</xref>: 159).</p>
<p>Our study aligns with the views of Wenger in understanding identity not as a static, monolithic whole or something ‘we turn on and off’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-2046147X11435080">Wenger, 1998</xref>: 159), but as the nexus of multiple identifications with a range of different spheres that individuals may perceive and articulate as relatively discrete, blurred or flexible. How individuals negotiate the spheres of social and personally derived imperatives shapes their identities, which may be multifaceted rather than separable.</p>
<p>In the extensive body of literature that deals with the intersecting spheres of work and home, the notion of identity has been somewhat neglected. Instead, the boundary metaphor (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2046147X11435080">Nippert-Eng, 1995</xref>) has more commonly provided a point of entry for researchers to explore the different life spheres, revealing these to be conflicting or complementary, with subsequent impacts on family lives, work roles and employing organizations. Work–life conflict studies suggest that when employees experience an incompatibility between their life responsibilities and the goals of the organization, they face emotional, psychological and social consequences, while the impact on the organization is often a decline in productivity (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2046147X11435080">Kirby et al., 2003</xref>). Researchers who are more interested in the dynamics of this process rather than the outcomes argue that work–life balance is rarely freely determined. Instead, it is constrained by organizational, sector-specific and national gender cultures as well as labour market opportunities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2046147X11435080">Gregory and Milner, 2009</xref>). When a communication approach is taken to investigate these issues, the notion of ‘identity work’ coupled with the concept of the ‘elastic’ boundary is valuable as a conceptual lens, as in the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2046147X11435080">Cohen et al. (2009)</xref>. They found that there is a dynamic interplay of constraint and agency because individuals are active and relational in making sense of and for their ‘selves’. Subsequently, the borders that demarcate work and non-work spheres are constantly changed, redefined or reinforced. ‘This sense of self, although continuous to us, is segmented into those “selves” appropriate to different people, activities and realms’, creating more or less distinct territories of the self (Nippert-Eng in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2046147X11435080">Cohen et al., 2009</xref>: 240).</p>
<p>We posit that this process – whether empowering or debilitating – of creating mutable identities is accentuated in knowledge work, such as public relations. Public relations is a profession whose very resources and focus share an uncanny resemblance to those with which the notion of identity and the negotiation of work–life boundaries are themselves preoccupied: the relationships between people, time, space and communication technologies. We are interested in understanding the ways in which public relations practitioners, as knowledge workers, are positioned as individual, gendered subjects, and how they are called to respond to the pressures induced by this shifting, complex relational landscape, in both their home and work lives. Therefore, in this study we explore the ways in which public relations practitioners improvise, communicate and negotiate their personal– professional identities and the tensions inherent in encounters between self and other, private and public, economic and cultural. The importance of personal–professional identities is considered alongside questions related to who does public relations work, the approaches that people take to their work, and the implications for the fact that how public relations work is accomplished is central to any understanding of knowledge production and individual well-being in a knowledge economy.</p>

<title>Methodology</title>
<p>We explore these issues through consideration of female public relations practitioners’ various articulations of how they perceive and experience the relationship between the professional and private spheres of their lives. To do this, we focus on how and why women describe how they put together (whether self-consciously or apparently intuitively) certain aspects of their lives into one or more spaces and the extent to which they perceive boundaries around or borders between these spaces.</p>
<p>We chose to focus solely on women in this study based first on the gendered structure of the public relations labour market with the number of women employed to practise public relations outnumbering men, for example, in Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2046147X11435080">De Bussy and Wolf, 2009</xref>), in the UK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2046147X11435080">Gregory, 2011</xref>), Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-2046147X11435080">Zerfass et al., 2009</xref>), Asia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-2046147X11435080">Simorangkir, 2011</xref>) and the USA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2046147X11435080">Grunig et al., 2001</xref>). Second, despite assuming a greater role in the labour force, globally women continue to maintain their primary caregiving and domestic work roles in the home (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2046147X11435080">Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2046147X11435080">Crompton and Lyonette, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2046147X11435080">Drago, 2009</xref>). Women are still primarily accountable both for running the household and for managing the relationship between the home and workplace, and therefore work–life problems for women and men can be quite different (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2046147X11435080">Connell, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>We employed an interpretive approach to investigating, collecting and analysing data iteratively through five stages based on a purposive sample of 35 public relations practitioners based in Western Australia, all women of different ages, in various stages of family life, and at different levels in their professional careers: unmarried, married, with and without children, in junior and senior roles, working in consultancy and in-house. Although not all participants were mothers, almost all defined themselves, at least in part, in relation to the choices they had made or hoped to make about having children as well as a professional life. We approached these women in a variety of ways: through our own professional contact lists, from information about members of the Public Relations Institute of Australia in Perth, via the professional contact list of the PR events manager whom we employed to schedule the interviews and focus groups, and through the lists of names provided to us by other participants.</p>
<p>We began collecting the data by conducting two interviews with senior women, both working in-house, to help us identify some of the key issues related to the interaction of their working life and other aspects of their lives, and to focus our research questions. We then carried out two focus groups with women in their 20s and early 30s. These findings suggested that the issues might differ according to women’s age, seniority and family life-stage. Consequently, we conducted a further focus group with women in their 40s and then, because we considered that our discussions with senior women (mostly in their 50s) might reveal some potentially sensitive information as they reflected on their experiences with both young and now grown-up children, we opted for one-to-one interviews rather than group interviews.</p>
<p>We completed data collection by presenting our findings and nascent interpretations to participants in an informal, social setting, encouraging women to discuss freely their further opinions. This forum acted not only as a member check, allowing us to verify our data and interpretations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2046147X11435080">Daymon and Holloway, 2011</xref>), but also enabled participants to provide further explanations and additional ideas. Through this process, we were able to confirm some of our initial hunches and emergent propositions.</p>
<p>With the exception of the feedback presentation and ensuing discussion, we recorded all interviews and focus groups, transcribing and analysing immediately. Because both authors were involved in all stages of the research process, we were able to discuss our initial reflections immediately after interviewing, and then in more detail after we had read the transcriptions. This enabled us to modify interview questions in the light of these discussions, and also make informed choices about the selection of participants for the next stages of data collection.</p>
<p>We analysed the data thematically according to notions of how identities emerge in the navigation of borders, boundaries and perceptions of life ‘balance’ as revealed in the literature. For example, the literature indicates that positive association between work–life balance and organizational engagement is mediated by wellness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-2046147X11435080">Parkes and Langford, 2008</xref>) so in our readings of the transcripts we coded relevant statements using the terms found in the literature: ‘stress’, ‘burnout’, ‘overload’, ‘health’. We also coded inductively using <italic>in vivo</italic> codes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2046147X11435080">Corbin, 2004</xref>) stemming from the words of participants themselves (in the case of wellness, these were ‘sport’, ‘exercise’, ‘sickness’, ‘tiredness’, ‘hitting the wall’) and also topic codes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-2046147X11435080">Richards, 2005</xref>), that is, terms we ourselves created to describe a phenomenon (for example, ‘physical and psychological seepage’). Our coding, therefore, was both deductive and inductive. As our research progressed, we categorized our various codes into broader categories such as ‘generational differences’ and ‘time’, and eventually into the three broad categories of identity that we named as ‘segmented’, ‘blurred’ and ‘merged’. Therefore, each quotation introduced in later sections of this article represents multiple, similar statements and views.</p>
<p>We began this project because of our personal interest in the topic. As public relations teachers and researchers, we were conscious of the difficulties of defining and managing the different aspects of our selves in relation to our work and home realms, and therefore wondered how women in the public relations industry managed this same process. Little did we realize when we started out how emotionally involved we would become in the research project. Participants’ comments and stories often challenged us to reconsider our own strategies for managing stress, careers, family relationships and commitments to various work roles. On a number of occasions we cried after an interview when a woman had expressed her regrets or anguish about the choices she had made which had affected her children or her career, or when the cultural constraints of her workplace had compelled her to become the victim of work–life conflict and stress. With other participants we experienced a sense of glee when we heard how women’s lives had been enriched and empowered through their successful admission of the identity concerns of one sphere into another. We make no apology for how our subjectivities influenced the social shape and character of the data collected, nor for how we experienced the study. We do note the potential bias in our work. However, we endeavoured to be critically subjective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2046147X11435080">Etherington, 2004</xref>) by engaging in reflective conversations with each other and other academic colleagues after every interview, when we were interpreting the data, and also with participants during the feedback session. Through these efforts we have aimed to use self-reflexivity to reinforce our claim to have presented an honest (and therefore authentic) representation of the experiences and perceptions of women working in public relations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-2046147X11435080">
<title>The research context</title>
<p>Currently there are 21,600 public relations professionals working in Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2046147X11435080">Australian Government, 2011</xref>). Of these, 2216 are members of the Public Relations Institute of Australia (PRIA); 73 percent of them are women (personal correspondence from PRIA, November 2011). In a national survey of both PRIA and non-PRIA members, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2046147X11435080">De Bussy and Wolf (2009)</xref> found a similar proportion of female to male practitioners, that is, 79 percent.</p>
<p>Although there are only 226 PRIA members in Western Australia, the public relations industry in the state can be described as thriving, with multiple consultancies, freelance operators and large in-house departments servicing a range of sectors, most lucrative of which is the booming resources sector. Feeding a global market increasingly dominated by the demands of a fast-growing Chinese economy, the resources sector is a major contributor to the flourishing Western Australian economy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2046147X11435080">Government of Western Australia, 2011</xref>). In comparison with most western economies, Australia as a nation has weathered the immediate aftermath of the global financial crisis relatively well. By 2011, unemployment stood at only 4.9 percent in June (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2046147X11435080">Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2011</xref>) in comparison with 7.7 percent in the UK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-2046147X11435080">Office for National Statistics, 2011</xref>) and 9.2 percent in the USA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2046147X11435080">Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2011</xref>). In Western Australia, in the same year, the employment opportunities for public relations practitioners were plentiful and relatively secure.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, public relations practitioners have been confronted with a range of challenges affecting the relationship between their professional and home spheres. Multinational companies involved in mining for minerals and natural gas, for example, require practitioners to work in both local and global time zones. Even at a regional level, there are time differences, with up to three hours between the zones in the west of Australia and those in the more populated eastern states where the largest cities of Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane are situated. Such time differences can result in work-related concerns intruding into the hours allocated by practitioners for non-work activities such as those associated with home or leisure. These intrusions are accentuated by the type of role in which practitioners engage, such as media relations or corporate spokesperson, when the deadlines and agenda of the media may determine the proportion of time available for work or personal life. Further, the increasing uptake of communication technologies has enabled a greater penetration of work into the home (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2046147X11435080">Gratton, 2011</xref>). Challenges such as these affect men as well as women, but the repercussions are arguably greater for women because of their role in the non-work sphere as the primary homemaker and caregiver.</p>

<sec id="section4-2046147X11435080">
<title>Challenges in the relationship between professional and home life spheres: Negotiating time</title>
<p>In our study, many women in public relations described the demands on their lives as ‘overwhelming’ because of a lack of time in which to do the various tasks properly or in-depth. Perhaps flippantly, one mature participant in the feedback session remarked that ‘There is light at the end of the tunnel and it is death’, a comment at which others in the room laughed out loud. Whether meant seriously or not, it highlights women’s concern with the sometimes unmanageable aspects of their job. It also points to the sense of the relentlessness of work–life pressures. The unpredictable nature and flow of public relations work, including bursts of activity coupled with tight deadlines, results in daily routines that comprise a range of competing and often irreconcilable demands that necessitate a constant juggling by practitioners of the relationship between work and home:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>When the press calls, I drop everything and this is affecting me, like all the other stuff that I have that is deliverable stops and I deal with the press and all that entails.</p>
<p>The work just flows and flows, and flows, and if I work 15 hours, I’d still need more time to do the work. So at some stage, I’ve got to make a conscious decision that that’s what I’ve done today, and that’s what I’ve achieved, and that’s what anybody can expect, and it’s going to be there tomorrow, and I just pick it up and do it again tomorrow.</p>
<p>I find that this job is all consuming … I really find it hard to switch off. And will have the dreams and wake up at two o’clock in the morning.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The participants’ comments indicate that the demands on time involved in public relations work, whether in relation to the media or more generally, affect whether women are able (or unable) to separate themselves from a focus on work or attend to other significant areas (social relationships, family, etc.) of their lives. Therefore, in order to cope, some ‘manoeuvre bits of time’ by choreographing various public and private tasks. For example, if a tight deadline for submission of a report requires extended, after-hours work, a mother might create ‘a chunk of time with [the] children’ by going home early in order to have an early meal with them, and then continuing to write from home when the children have gone to bed. Alternatively, strategic or creative thinking might be done during leisure activities, such as on the treadmill in the gym or in the shower. In reflecting on work in her own consultancy, a practitioner noted that ‘I’d work like a trooper for ten months of the year [then would take two months off to go and help look after grandchildren] … I’ve had to try and manoeuvre bits of time in and around my other work.’</p>
<p>Such time shifting involves not only the moving and acceptance of work-related activities into the private sphere (or vice versa), but also the intermingling of the professional with the psychological and personal realms. In order to more effectively negotiate and manage the different life spheres, others traded time by exchanging extended periods of hard work and long hours for leisure. A participant responsible for the annual report noted that during its production ‘life was manic’ but ‘when the work gets a little bit lighter … then you’re able to spend more time at home’. Others stated that they might work until very late – sometimes 10 or 11 pm – in order to enable them to take time off. One participant stated:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I was just very conscious of working hard so that I could earn the time off when I needed it … you just want to earn the respect [of your colleagues] so if you say ‘I really need to go down to the childcare’ or ‘I really need to do this and be in a bit late today’, there’s no formality about it, they just let you do it.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>There is an interesting metaphorical and causal relationship suggested here between ‘earning’ time (by putting in extra hours) and ‘earning the respect’ of colleagues, which allows the participant to fit ‘other’ non-work chores into her day.</p>
<p>Despite working extensively or very productively, many women were reluctant to admit they sometimes finished work on time. A senior in-house practitioner stated the following:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>To be honest, right now – don’t tell anybody – just this week, not last week – I cleared some major things like our bankable feasibility study, my chapter, which we’d been working on for three months, major announcements that have been in the newspaper, which we’d been working on for two weeks – I’ve seen all of that in the last week and the third thing was putting a whole plan together for this [industry] issue, which is a stakeholder engagement lobbying plan. So this week’s good. You do your plan [then] I’m happy to sneak off and go to the pool at five o’clock. It’s unusual, though.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The notion of ‘sneaking off’ at 5 pm implies a sense of guilt associated with dominant organizational or occupational norms around what it means to be ‘professional’ and to earn collegial respect. Alternatively, personal career goals may necessitate the employment of strategies that regularly displace leisure time with work activities.</p>
<p>On the whole, those who traded time did so on the basis that this gave them licence to achieve some form of flexibility in their professional life. One senior practitioner working long hours in-house described that she coped by:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Mak[ing] sure you never start a job by sitting there at the desk between eight and five consistently, because then the minute you don’t do it, someone will notice. … Always make sure you are out and about [saying to your colleagues] Oh yes, I’ve got to be going here, going there’. It’s amazing what [personal things] you can get done.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Such impression management, which performatively subverts (and inverts) the conventional association of professionalism with visibility, enabled this practitioner to introduce the home into the workplace by undertaking personal chores such as family shopping during work time.</p>
<p>A third strategy for managing time was to ‘draw a line’ around certain activities; in other words, to create boundaries that either defined the public and private spheres, or that separated the psychological from the material. For example, major forthcoming professional activities are entered into personal diaries in order to highlight spaces available for holidays, thus using work to determine the extent and timing of leisure periods. One participant used her iPod with earphones to prevent distractions while thinking and writing. Others chose not to use their telephones or look at emails while on holiday or at home, although the nature of public relations work, global time zones and the strong identification of many practitioners with notions of professionalism, meant that this was often difficult to do:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I never put my Blackberry down. It helps to keep an eye on what’s going on. Watching TV with the Blackberry there and just answering emails or deleting emails.</p>
<p>Eastern states’ times mean you have to keep checking the Blackberry even at home. But sometimes you don’t have to do it, but you still are in the habit of doing it … so it’s just a matter of trying to be disciplined and going ‘You know what? These other tasks can wait. I don’t have to do this right now’.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The sense of both participants’ toggling between exercising agency and lacking agency in relation to their use of technology is represented through their words here. In addition, the choice of the term ‘disciplined’ to describe how one participant resisted use of the Blackberry after hours is telling, given the description of the way in which she has become habituated (disciplined) into checking it continuously.</p>
<p>How practitioners’ relationship with time is negotiated, however, is dependent not only on personal imperatives, such as career or family ambitions and commitments, but also the role, type of organization and sector in which practitioners are employed. Most women made active choices about the type of work that would best enable them to manage their time. It was not uncommon for those with young children or dependent parents, for example, to reject the roles of media relations or events management. Some women with families elected to leave the private sector, especially consultancy, for the public sector in the belief that employing organizations would offer better work–life balance. Others set up their own businesses or opted for freelance or short-term contract work in the belief that this would give them more control and flexibility, although not all agreed that this does occur. For example, a solo operator who chose to work from home to enable her to spend more time with her children highlighted the tensions involved in balancing the demands of family and profession when she related the story of how she took her daughter to swimming lessons during a working day.:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Media, that’s my main job so if I don’t answer a journalist’s call for a client then I miss the opportunity. I remember one time I was actually at swimming lessons with my little girl and there were two missed calls from the [newspaper]. By the time I rang back, they’d found another source.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The decision by this practitioner to conduct leisure or family activities during what is considered by the media and commercial organizations as conventional working hours acted to disadvantage her client by depriving him of valuable media coverage. Thus, although, as with many of our participants, this woman chose to work freelance precisely to enjoy more control in balancing the competing demands of work and home life, her remarks imply that the choices made may well compromise one for the benefit of the other.</p>
<p>Practitioners therefore negotiate different temporalities as they cross the psychological, relational and physical borders between the different, socially constructed spheres of their lives. Women perceive the professional sphere as a space that includes their work and professional practice, and their identifications with this. The private sphere comprises home life, leisure activities, relationships with friends and family, and their relationship to this. It also comprises the personal or internal self, including women’s reflections on themselves. The interconnectedness between the spheres is driven to some extent by professional notions of time related to the planning, controlling and scheduling of public relations work, especially that involving media relations and the servicing of clients, as well as notions concerning the value of communication technologies in the public relations role. Woven together with the social or cultural imperatives associated with the professional community are the personal values and motivations related to practitioners’ membership of the home or non-work community, such as family.</p>

<title>Negotiating the boundaries of different life spheres</title>
<p>Three different categories of identity emerge from the data to illustrate the emphasis that women give as they endeavour to juggle with and cross the borders of the interrelated spheres: segmented, blurred and merged. The categories themselves do not pre-exist women’s practices, and neither do they reify their experiences. Instead, they describe how women improvise, communicate and negotiate their personal–professional identities in specific situations and the tensions inherent in their encounters among self and other, private and public, economic and cultural.</p>
<sec id="section6-2046147X11435080">
<title>Segmented identity</title>
<p>This identity is characterized in its internal composition by defined boundaries and a separation between the professional and non-work spheres. This implies that women make a choice in different situations to prioritize either their professional role or their home role, depending on the situation, thus making a conscious effort to create a separation between the two. While a segmented identity is discernible in all age groups and levels of seniority, it is most pronounced among some young women in the early stages of their careers, or when mothers have young children and have made choices to work part-time for minimal hours, or when senior women have reflected on their careers and opted for a more balanced lifestyle. The segmented identity is (with greater or lesser ease) able to release its attachment to the professional sphere in order to concentrate on the private, and vice versa.</p>
<p>How women define and use psychological and socio-physical boundaries in order to distinguish the different spheres of their lives is exemplified in the following quotations:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>You really have to consciously truncate the week with the weekend.</p>
<p>While you are away [travelling for work], you can completely focus on work.</p>
<p>[Travelling home from work is] a transition … I try to do like this little mini-meditation before I pick up my daughter … so I’m not all angsted up.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Women in this category tend to prioritize home over work, emphasizing their quality of life. One woman who had been employed at the most senior level, internationally, stated:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I’ve done the big corporate jobs, I’ve done the big consultancy jobs, I’ve worked the 15-hour days and I’ve come to the conclusion that I don’t need to do that anymore … My health was more important than the hours and the contribution that I was putting in at work, over the balance of health and life at home.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>She chose instead to write a book and undertake a variety of freelance projects, some in public relations, others within the arts and entertainment fields. Well-being and work–life balance, then, are major influences on the decision to segment lives, including not only reducing the hours of work, or the energy put into building careers, but also in planning extended periods of time out of the profession in order to concentrate on home responsibilities.</p>
<p>The instrumental compartmentalizing of professional and home spheres by public relations practitioners with segmented identities results in their experiencing less conflict between the demands and different temporalities of the public and private spheres. Identification with one sphere or another is determined by the situation as well as women’s self-conscious attempts to retain distinct facets of their identity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-2046147X11435080">
<title>Blurred identity</title>
<p>A blurred identity is characterized by boundaries that are fuzzy, with spheres that are separate in some situations while overlapping in others. As with the previous category, women’s strong identification with both the professional and the non-work spheres indicates their attachment to the expectations, motivations and values of the public relations community, as well as the home or non-work realm and its related roles, for example, mother, wife, partner and friend. Although the majority of women who participated in this study are described as having blurred identities, certain groups are more active in the process of communicating different aspects of their identity simultaneously. These include women who chose freelance work or who set up businesses from home, working as sole operators, in order to spend more time with family:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>At work, I am very organized. But … I’m more spontaneous outside of work and free-flowing and I actually prefer that … I’m just two different people’ … [But] I am always thinking about work … The reality is that work and home have an impact on each other. You make it work, you just juggle – I don’t get stressed about it. If you let people [clients] know you’ve got a sick child or whatever, they are understanding. It’s all about communication.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This public relations consultant and small business owner constructed a border between the professional and the home through the mechanism of discipline at work and relaxation or spontaneity at home. However, she recognized the impossibility of disentangling the spheres. At the same time as her identity was segmented, it also overlapped to some extent. Two women, both working in-house, illustrated the constant oscillation that occurred when the boundaries between work–home spheres became fuzzy, allowing learning from the home sphere to contribute to learning in the professional, and vice versa:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I always say to people ‘You have to be like an elastic band, and you have to be able to stretch, and then you have to be able to come back in. But don’t snap’. But you have to be flexible and you have to be mutable. Because if you come in with black and white and go ‘This is what I’m going to get done today’, you just set yourself up for failure … Just like you have in your household. Things will come out, kids will get sick or something will come out of the blue. You just go with it … I just find if you are flexible, it’s a lot easier.</p>
<p>[When my husband went away for a month and I was on my own with the children], and he said to me when he left, ‘Just don’t run the family like it’s in the army, okay?’ And I said, ‘Oh, I don’t do that.’ And he said, ‘Oh no, but you might if I’m not there to temper you.’</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In the first comment, the participant expresses an acceptance of her need to adapt to different situations, and the inevitable influence that work exerts on home life and vice versa. In the second, the participant, drawing on her partner’s observation of her behaviour suggests the (perhaps less benign) spill-over between approaches to work and home life. The flexibility associated with a blurred identity extends to choices about when and how to work, in a similar way to the segmented identity. In their 30s and early 40s, many women choose to work from home to facilitate their mothering role, but this does require certain predetermined tactics to ensure that the home sphere does not intrude into the hours set aside for work. One woman employed a child minder for her young child in order that she could work undisturbed in the next room. Others tried to develop certain family disciplines so that the bulk of housework, cooking or washing could be shared, releasing time to continue to undertake professional tasks in the home environment. One senior practitioner, working in the public sector, regularly says to her children at the beginning of the evening: ‘Do you want me to help you with something? Because ask me now. If you are going to wait until ten o’clock at night when I need to do my work, I’m not going to be able to help you.’</p>
<p>The separation of spheres and the situational overlapping of aspects of both the professional and non-work spheres is not always by choice, however. Therefore, while there are positive aspects to negotiating a blurred identity, in many cases this is not always the case:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>PR isn’t a nine-to-five job. For most of the time that I have worked, I have been on call 24/7, so I have taken phone calls at 11 o’clock at night, and gone out and picked up newspapers to find out what the news headlines is at 11 o’clock at night when the first edition comes out. I’ve taken calls – mostly around the crisis in media stuff, media calls on weekends – while I’ve been painting the kitchen, and all those kinds of things. So it’s been fairly intrusive on my family life.</p>
<p>[When my child was young] I used to stress during meetings that everything was ok [at home with my child]. So, I’d be in the meeting but all these other thoughts were going through my head. I once had no choice, I had to take her to a meeting, and breastfed whilst taking notes, and the client was very family-friendly and said no [to rescheduling the meeting]. They were fine with it, but I felt very uncomfortable, because I couldn’t focus.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Each participant here talks differently about the normative demands of work in public relations and how these help shape their capacity to commit to or concentrate on domestic or parenting activities. The blurred identity, then, is continually redefined and reproduced as different imperatives are emphasized according to factors such as location, life stage, role and strength of identification with one or other sphere. While flexibility is ingrained in the blurred identity, this characteristic may be less neutral than it at first appears.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-2046147X11435080">
<title>Merged identity</title>
<p>In this category of identity, the professional and non-work spheres are integrated because the boundaries between them have been, either willingly or reluctantly, dissolved. Women may identify with either sphere equally and simultaneously blending the two, or, in contrast, they may privilege or foreground one, so that the other gives way. This orientation towards non-differentiation of the spheres is necessary in order to handle their responsibilities with the rest of their lives. This is discernible in young women intent on establishing their professional credentials before having a family, in many senior women at the peak of their careers, and in single women without family obligations or women without children.</p>
<p>The data indicate that young women who choose not to segment their lives do so because of personal career ambitions. Many work long hours, forgoing a social life and in some cases a partner, because their motivation is to establish a sound financial position and professional reputation before starting a family:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>In five years I’d like to have had a baby and work part-time in PR. I’d like to set myself up financially before then so I can have a few years off with my child.</p>
<p>I plan to slog my guts out whilst I’m still young. So in five years’ time, I don’t plan to be working 14 hour days [like now], but still in the industry.</p>
<p>Once you prove yourself, you have enough scores on the board, you don’t feel so much that sense to really have to hit the big goals. You can afford, by your 30s and 40s, you can back off and get a bit more of a balance.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>What emerges here is the individual young women’s confidence in imagining (or idealizing) an alternative life, one that contrasts significantly with the one they are experiencing now, and in which they assume they will have a greater degree of control and balance. However, when our initial findings were presented back to participants for their comments, older women laughed at what they considered the naïveté of such aspirations and imaginings. Nevertheless, they were admiring of such determination, recognizing themselves at the same life-stage when they too had chosen to allow one sphere to dominate the other.</p>
<p>Where a merged identity was seen positively, women appeared confident about themselves as both professionals and as mothers:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>My life is my work and my work is my life and my family is there with me so it’s just all one. I don’t know how else to [do it].</p>
<p>I’m the same person I am at work as I am at [home]. We always talk [in the office] about what we’re doing, if one of the children is sick, or you’ve got to go [home] because … a parent has to go because a child is sick … sometimes the kids will come in [to the office].</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It appears that the boundary dissolution that leads to a merged identity is the outcome of a subtle interplay of both the personal and social/professional. Certain expectations about the role of public relations and the perception of how it should be conducted influence the manner in which women integrate the professional and home spheres. However, while the term ‘integration’ implies some ease of reconciling or merging different aspects of identity, in fact the women whose identities could be thus described were acutely aware of the way in which they feel disempowered or overwhelmed by this orientation when the professional is foregrounded:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>You can’t set boundaries in PR. That doesn’t work in our profession. It just doesn’t work. But I wonder to what extent that is my capacity not to be able to let go and see if that actually might work.</p>
<p>There is an awful lot of responsibility as you get further along so that the time that you’re thinking about your work away from work is more stressful than creative. It’s more the sense of anxiety about keeping all the balls in the air constantly.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The first participant, in a reflective response, on the one hand asserts the immutability of public relations, while on the other she questions the degree to which this immutability is, to some extent at least, of her own making. The second participant, in her observation that work in a senior position is ‘more stressful than creative’ implies that with increased responsibility comes a loss of the possibility for thinking positively about work. Thus, even though in different ways, each participant suggests the relational dynamic between their identity and their work life. Nonetheless, there is too a sense these are not necessarily mutually enhancing.</p>
<p>The physical, emotional and psychological impact that may be an outcome of a merged identity can drive some to make conscious efforts to segment their lives. Someone who had recently achieved that, described how a ‘light bulb moment’ had led her to change jobs and organizations in order to gain a better working environment:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>[I said to myself] ‘I’m not going to allow this [stress] to happen to myself and I don’t ever want to be that person again … it’s about the right organization, the right opportunity, the right challenges and knowing that I’m going to have these boundaries in place when I’m working in that new position because I will not allow that [stress] to happen to myself again.’</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The determination to protect herself from the debilitating impacts of work-induced stress is emphasized in this practitioner’s words, as is the sense that the situation she previously found herself in was disempowering and destabilizing.</p>
<p>Others considered retiring from public relations altogether, and one woman we interviewed had recently made the decision to do that. ‘When I was younger … I was who I was because of my work not because of me. … now I don’t particularly need to be good at anything, except being happy each day.’ This participant, who during her career had held responsibility in high-level positions, offers a salutary retrospective comment on the relationship between work, identity and emotional well-being.</p>
<p>In summary, all women working in public relations face the challenge of juggling roles as worker, mother, partner, parent or grandparent. The manner in which they construct, communicate and negotiate their identities depends on their life- and career-stage, situation including organization culture, and the personal and socially derived imperatives associated with their multi-membership of different communities (in this case, the professional and home or non-work). Their identification with different spheres determines the nature of their identity: segmented, blurred or merged which is continually renegotiated and redefined.</p>

<sec id="section9-2046147X11435080" sec-type="discussion|conclusions">
<title>Discussion and conclusion</title>
<p>Thus, as our research has found, some women do make a concerted effort to keep their work and home lives separate. This suggests that they attempt to live the different aspects of their identities in sequence rather than concurrently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-2046147X11435080">Wenger, 1998</xref>: 159). Because individuals’ identities are not separable, not processes that can be turned on and off, such an effort to enact identities in sequence can, on the one hand, result in women privileging one sphere over another or, on the other, lead to their sense of the disconnectedness between the different aspects of their lives.</p>
<p>By contrast, and in relation to those women for whom the boundaries of home and work life are fuzzy or overlapping, the different aspects of their identities are active simultaneously (albeit by favouring one or the other in different contexts). Nonetheless, this ‘flexibility’ of identity does require women’s ongoing juggling and negotiating of their different roles and responsibilities in the various spheres of their lives.</p>
<p>Finally, for those public relations women whose lives and identities are characterized by dissolved or non-differentiated boundaries (whether because these are solo women, women without dependent children or women who choose to privilege work over home lives), the pervasiveness of the 24/7 knowledge economy, produced and sustained by various communication technologies makes it much harder to resist work as an all-encompassing activity and as the marker of a meaningful identity.</p>
<p>The communicative, relational, temporal- and context-sensitive demands of the professional environment in which PR women are involved as part of the knowledge economy reinforce or extend precisely those pressures they may feel when negotiating their identities and activities across the different and variously permeable boundaries of work and home life. It seems that PR women’s investment in the industry, where input is usually articulated or measured in clock-time terms and output in dollar value, is significant if they are to regard themselves and be regarded by others as competent and valuable workers. However, because such investment is difficult to represent in the vernacular of a professionally acceptable discourse, in emotional, relational, health and well-being terms, it is often not articulated in the public domain, and therefore remains largely invisible or unrecognized by either employers, clients, or, indeed, prospective public relations women professionals.</p>
<p>In this study, we have argued that identity is constructed from a confluence of the individual’s motivations, values and orientations together with their relationship to the other, notably the social. Wenger’s notion of the social involves multiple community membership, and this points to one of the limitations of our research which is reliant on only two spheres for its scope: the professional and home or non-work spheres. We suggest that further research might investigate individuals’ simultaneous connections to multiple, additional spheres and their associated sources of meaning, as well as the ongoing influence of these spheres one upon the other, and to build theory that that explicitly considers these multiple memberships, or relationships. Such research might therefore ask how women’s involvement in and interaction with the sporting/recreational, religious, friendship or professional organization spheres, for example, produce, sustain and help to modify their identities as industry professionals.</p>
<p>Further, we see promise in exploring perspectives that position identity within its social context, applying these lenses to produce theory and research that studies the ways that people in different societal cultures conceptualize or discursively produce self, other, and the fundamental relatedness of the two in identity negotiation processes. Cultural differences in the discourses of various countries or ethnic groups concerning ‘mother’, ‘wife’, ‘career’, ‘work’ and ‘professional’, for example, may have an impact on the social construction of what it means to do public relations, and therefore whether professional identities exist at all, or the extent to which they are distinctive or blurred.</p>
<p>Finally, a study that compares women’s experiences of identity construction with men’s might make more salient the specifically gendered practices relating to the intersection of work and home lives. Thus, an exploration of how men’s gendered behaviours affect their integration or separation of professional and familial relationships and practices would be worth exploring and then evaluating in light of women’s experiences. Examining those differences across generations of men and women might also be productive in revealing patterns of change in navigating and reflecting on questions of identity.</p>
<p>Our investigation concerns women in the 2010s working in public relations in Western Australia, a location characterized by its geographical isolation and its relative economic prosperity, distinguishing it from other parts of Australia as well as other countries affected by global recession and financial uncertainty. Such factors have an impact on employment prospects and practices, with implications for the transferability of our results. However, the extensive literature on work–life tensions (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2046147X11435080">Kirby et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-2046147X11435080">Kreiner et al., 2009</xref>), boundary crossing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2046147X11435080">Nippert-Eng, 1995</xref>), and identity construction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2046147X11435080">Cohen et al., 2009</xref>) suggests that the issues and dynamics revealed in our data are not necessarily specific to one location. Further, research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2046147X11435080">Aldoory et al. (2008)</xref> of public relations in North America supports our assertion that the relationship between the work and home spheres is both gendered and contested.</p>
<p>Of course, public relations is not the only occupation whose practitioners are involved in the ongoing relational struggle between self and other, private and public, economic and cultural. But it is the reappraisal and renegotiation of this tension that is at the heart of, and impacts upon, the generic and specific practices of public relations. At the same time, the social, economic, cultural and communicative transformations brought about by the processes of globalization are variously affecting not just women in the public relations industry but both women and men in other professions too, as well as local and international communities more broadly. Nonetheless, given our claim above that public relations is a profession whose raison d’être comprises interests central to the processes of identity and the negotiation of work–life balance – that is, the relationships between people, time, space and communication technologies – this study offers the field of public relations in particular some valuable lessons. We draw attention to just a couple of these here, aware that this brief outline requires further and nuanced extrapolation.</p>
<p>First, our study shows that PR approaches and practices are not predetermined and objective. Nor should they be ahistorically defined and applied without consideration of different (individual and collective) identities, temporal contexts and contingencies. (This might include, for example, a resistance to identifying stakeholders and stakeholder groups in objective terms: as reified and separable identities, rather than as always in the making and relational.) Second, we need to develop a keener understanding of the ways in which public relations professionals are disciplined to perform according to the normative demands of particular commercial or market spaces. In other words, which performative identities are resisted or preferred, criticized or respected, and marginalized or granted status by employers, clients and peers? We need to re-evaluate the personal, social and financial value, as well as costs, of such performances. To develop as a public relations practitioner involves not only the social expectations of what it means to be a professional coupled with an individual’s presentation of themselves in public relations. It also involves a changeable relationship that expands over the whole life situation, including career trajectories and family life stages, encompassing the negotiation of personal and socially derived imperatives associated with a range of different spheres. Added to this is the need to adapt to the lightning-paced change of the communications environment in which public relations work is immersed.</p>
<p>Given this broad scenario, how well prepared are individual professionals and the profession of public relations itself to adapt to change at these various levels: personal, professional and communicative? Thus, we suggest that further research might consider the negotiation of relationships and identity as those are pertinent to public relations education, and might help scholars to reimagine in particular the implications for the relationship and relational dimensions of the public relations profession more generally. This might include a focus on the dialectical pull as well as the merging of distinctions between the public and private spheres, as we see in relation to the use and impacts of social media, for example. In addition, it would be worth interrogating the conventional claim of public relations as a ‘feminized’ industry: what exactly does this term mean in terms of women’s real experiences of working in the field and in terms of the meanings of specifically gendered practices? Further, it becomes important to reconsider the various and variable relational, spatial and temporal contingencies that structure identities, and the degree to which these cannot be taken for granted in interpreting and evaluating the profiles or interests of stakeholders, for example. And finally, a sensitivity to the mutability of identities and relationships would enable the profession to respect and respond to the dynamism of public relations endeavours, understanding them in human, relational and emotional terms rather than as merely reducible to matters of management, planning and goal-setting.</p>
