<p>In <italic>Urban Tomographies</italic>, Martin Krieger develops a method of documenting the function and vitality of cities. Borrowing the terminology of tomography from medicine, Krieger suggests that a city’s identity and life can be better understood by examining multiple slices of urbanism, just as medical practitioners can monitor the function and vitality of a human heart or brain by capturing images and videos from multiple perspectives. Instead of using a CAT scan or an MRI machine, Krieger uses wide-angle photography, high-fidelity audio recording, and abundant curiosity to study various aspects of Los Angeles, California, including the city’s industry, labor, infrastructure, and religiosity. The book explores what urban tomographies are and how they might be useful in understanding cities, and Krieger gives detailed accounts of his own exploration and documentation of Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Following theoretical treatises on the significance of the everyday life of cities, urban tomography focuses on the documentation of unexceptional, banal, and ordinary aspects of cities. By amassing catalogues of everyday sensory information about cities in images, audio recordings, and notes, Krieger suggests, one may come to appreciate the richness and depth of everyday life and develop “an encompassing understanding of the whole” (p. 5). In contrast to other theorists and analysts focused on the everyday as a transcendent concept with political power, Krieger is interested in the potential of the sum of particular sets of ordinary urban experiences to form an identity of the city, and he argues that tomograms of cities could represent systematic empirical attempts to study a city’s identity. Urban tomographies, then, represent an attempt to connect philosophies of phenomenology to the empirical study of cities’ histories and identities.</p>
<p>With only 109 pages of text, the slim book is organized into seven chapters, but might best be understood as three distinct sections. In the first section, Krieger draws out the history of urban tomographies, detailing the links between medical practice and research on cities, and connects urban tomography with phenomenological philosophy and archival photography of Paris by Denis Diderot, Charles Marville, and Eugene Atget. Here, Krieger’s familiarity and comfortable recounting of historical photography is striking and impressive, but his adoration for these photographers distracts at times from the focus on the potential of urban tomography as a mode of research. For instance, the author discusses Lee Friedlander’s photographs of U.S. cities and shares his view that Friedlander’s work represents “urban tomography made into art” (p. 20). Without independent knowledge of Friedlander’s work, some readers may be left with only a vague idea of the relationship between the professional photographer and Krieger’s ideas.</p>
<p>In this first section, Krieger also recounts his own method of photographing storefronts and provides a detailed discussion of the equipment used during his studies. At points, Krieger’s stories from the field are charming and rich with detail. For instance, Krieger notes that attempts to photograph laborers and worshipers could have been awkward or uncomfortable for both the individuals being photographed and the photographer, but “often in these situations [Krieger would have] carefully pushed my wide-angle snout into their work space or worship space, using an unobtrusive camera, no flash or tripod, and moving quickly but respectfully” (p. 17). In places, however, the detailed shoptalk of photographic methods may grow wearisome for readers who do not share the author’s serious interest in technical aspects of photography.</p>
<p>The book’s second section contains chapters that serve as examples of urban tomography in contemporary Los Angeles. The chapters focus, respectively, on L.A.’s industrial neighborhoods that mix residential and industrial properties, workplaces, and laborers across the city’s industrial geography, omnipresent inscriptions of infrastructure and engineering, and manifestations of Angelenos’ religiosity in storefront churches. In this section, Krieger’s curious and attentive mind reveals easily overlooked details in sidewalks, signage, and building facades. For example, in his chapter on the development of infrastructure, Krieger explains the meanings of nails driven into sidewalks with surveyors’ markings, spray-painted code from individuals excavating below city streets, and agglomerations of color-coded plastic whiskers signifying the presence of utility lines. After reading this section, this reviewer found himself mentally noting such markings in his regular wanderings through cities. Few nonfiction books on cities could lead to such a shift in one’s consciousness of everyday sights.</p>
<p>Martin Krieger’s affection for his subject matter shines in many passages from <italic>Urban Tomographies</italic>, particularly in the author’s treatment of the layered histories of L.A.’s industrial neighborhoods and in his rich vignettes of workers in L.A.’s port and its garment factories. These are sections, the reader might also note, in which Krieger sets aside technical discussions of his photography and simply recounts his experiences of witnessing the social life of working-class neighborhoods and workplaces. Unfortunately, the coverage and pacing in this section of the book is uneven and inconsistent, and Krieger too infrequently relates what he documents and observes to contemporary planning challenges. Much of the chapter on religiosity in Los Angeles, for instance, details the history of the Pentecostal Church and provides suggestions on where and how other interested individuals might find storefront churches. Relatively speaking, however, descriptions of storefront churches with other religious orientations are inexplicably given a passing, superficial nod, and the chapter closes without commenting on larger geographies of religiosity in the contemporary city or on ways planners might work with charismatic leaders of storefront churches.</p>
<p>For a book about the potential of documentary photography for the scholarship of cities, <italic>Urban Tomographies</italic> has far fewer interesting photographs and other media than one might expect. Krieger and his team of researchers took tens of thousands of photographs of Los Angeles for this project. About one hundred black-and-white images appear in the book, and the vast majority of the photographs are reproduced at a very small (less than one-square inch) size. That so many of the images are either not reproduced or reproduced poorly is a major disappointment. Early on, Krieger makes it clear that this is not a picture book or a photography book. Focusing on the theoretical and analytical sides of this work is reasonable; however, given the focus of the material here, color photography or, at the very least, a link to a well-organized online collection of photographs and recordings would have strengthened the text. (Krieger does link to an online presence at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://tomography.usc.edu/urban">http://tomography.usc.edu/urban</ext-link>, but this website presents limited media in an unattractive and unwieldy format.)</p>
<p>The book’s concluding section includes two short chapters. Krieger discusses the potential for high-fidelity audio recordings to be understood as additional slices in urban tomography, and he closes the text with musings on what researchers might do with a tomogram of a city. Much of the final section reads as a series of broad generalizations and hypothetical statements or reiterations of earlier ideas and claims. In the chapter on sound recording, Krieger outlines the technical aspects of recording the “urban aural sensorium” and ruminates about a recording he captured of a vendor selling tamales in East Los Angeles (p. 94). Krieger posits that high-fidelity audio recordings of everyday city life may serve as a fascinating and useful archive decades in the future, but he does not explore what added value or use such recordings may have at present. The book’s final chapter carries vague notions about how a tomogram of the city might lead to a fuller understanding of a city’s vitality, but few clear answers or unequivocal statements are to be found.</p>
<p>Even after reading <italic>Urban Tomographies</italic> from cover-to-cover and re-reviewing several sections of the book, it is unclear to this reviewer just what kind of text this was intended to be. The opening and closing sections of the book loosely outline how urban tomographies could be used as a pedagogical tool or research method, but Krieger never directly addresses how tomograms might be used to aid urban planning scholarship or practice. The author’s love for documenting everyday life is evident, but the practical applicability of this method for planning receives short shrift next to the author’s musings on the technical sides of photography and audio recording. The middle section of the book includes some fascinating details about easily overlooked traces of engineering in cities as well as a handful of rich vignettes of industrial environments, but the empirical subjects—industrial neighborhoods, workplaces and work, urban infrastructure, and urban religiosity—are far too broad to be covered with any consistent depth in such a short volume.</p>
<p><italic>Urban Tomographies</italic> may be of interest to planning scholars interested in using multimedia as a research tool and to individuals fascinated by visible traces of cities’ histories. In many sections, the writing in the book is tortuous and leans heavily on philosophical and theoretical terminology. Those willing to commit to the book and dig into its ideas will find some compelling stories and novel conceptions of multimedia documentation of everyday urban life.</p>
