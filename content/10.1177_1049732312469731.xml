<abstract>
<p>In this article, I explore how health-seeking behaviors of immigrants are reconstructed and shaped during the adaptation process by comparing the experiences of three Asian Pacific immigrant groups in Hawaii: Filipinos, Koreans, and Marshallese. A total of 91 participants (52 new immigrants, 22 ethnic community key informants, and 17 service providers) completed in-depth interviews. All three groups of immigrants experienced significant changes in their health-seeking behaviors, but in different ways. Koreans experienced a dramatic decrease in seeking both primary and preventive health care after immigration, whereas Filipinos and Marshallese increased their health-seeking behaviors. Coupled with the previous health care experiences in their home country and individual characteristics, the social context of the host country, to a great degree, influenced the formation of health-seeking behaviors after immigration. The study findings suggest that tailored interventions should take into account the source of behavioral change and difficulties that each immigrant group experiences.</p>

<p>Research on immigrant health care shows that immigrants tend to underutilize and delay seeking professional health care services compared with native-born citizens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049732312469731">Carrasquillo, Carrasquillo, &amp; Shea, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049732312469731">Derose, Bahney, Lurie, and Escarce, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049732312469731">Derose, Escarce, &amp; Lurie, 2007</xref>). Immigrants’ individual characteristics (e.g., low socioeconomic status, lack of English proficiency, cultural beliefs) and social structural constraints (e.g., immigrant health policy) influence their health-care-seeking behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732312469731">Choi, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049732312469731">Derose et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049732312469731">Gany, Herrera, Avallone, &amp; Changrani, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732312469731">Hill et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049732312469731">Shin, Song, Kim, &amp; Probst, 2005</xref>). Among immigrant groups, health care behaviors vary by ethnicity and country of origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732312469731">Choi, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732312469731">Portes, Kyle, &amp; Eaton, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049732312469731">Yu, Huang, &amp; Singh, 2010</xref>). Moreover, there are significant differences in health care behaviors by gender, age, socioeconomic status, English proficiency, citizenship, and length of residence in the United States within immigrant groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049732312469731">Derose et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049732312469731">Derose et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049732312469731">Ma, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049732312469731">Shin et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite an improved understanding of immigrant health care behavior and its contributing factors in the literature, researchers have overlooked that immigrants’ health care behavior evolves as they experience the events of immigration, settlement, and acculturation. The immigration process involves physical, social, and cultural relocation to a new environment and requires continuous accommodation to environmental change. As a part of the general process of adaptation, health-seeking behavior might change through learning and interaction with the immigrant’s social, cultural, economic, and political environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049732312469731">Portes &amp; Rumbaut, 1990</xref>). Studies on variations in immigrant health care behaviors by years of United States residence and the level of acculturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049732312469731">Akresh, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732312469731">Leclere, Jensen, &amp; Biddlecom, 1994</xref>) provide partial support that immigrant health-seeking behavior is not a static phenomenon, but a dynamic process of adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732312469731">Leduc and Proulx, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Health-seeking behaviors adapted during the immigration process might be different among and within immigrant groups. According to contemporary theories of immigrant adaptation, values, norms, and behavioral patterns of immigrants develop through dynamic interactions of structure, culture, and agency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049732312469731">Portes &amp; Rumbaut, 1990</xref>). These differences in health care behaviors among immigrants are associated with cultural norms and beliefs, the social contexts of the sending and host countries, and the individual’s socioeconomic standing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732312469731">Choi, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049732312469731">Kasl &amp; Berkman, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732312469731">Portes et al., 1992</xref>). When people immigrate, they bring with them the unique sociocultural norms and behaviors that they practiced in their home country. During the adaptation process, the preimmigration health behaviors might be redefined and reconstructed differently, depending on the social context that each group resides in (e.g., coethnic community, health delivery system, and health policy), as well as an individual’s socioeconomic characteristics. Thus, describing immigrant health care behavior as a “snapshot” might oversimplify a complicated behavior without providing sufficient explanation of how such differences occur.</p>
<p>Asian American and Pacific Islanders have often been categorized to one or two separate groups or included within the “Other” category, despite a growing awareness of their heterogeneity as an ethnic group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732312469731">Ihara, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732312469731">Srinivasan &amp; Guillermo, 2000</xref>). As an aggregate group, Asian American and Pacific Islanders are often stereotyped as a model minority because of their better health and health care, and their socioeconomic achievement compared to other minority groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049732312469731">Barnes, Adams, &amp; Powell-Griner, 2008</xref>); however, the social, economic, political, and cultural experiences of each subgroup differ (Srinivasan &amp; Guillermo). The characteristics of each ethnic community vary across subgroups in terms of history, population size, health care infrastructure, human resources, social capital, and their relationships with their local governments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049732312469731">J. Choi, 2006</xref>). Moreover, there are substantial variations in health care use and health outcomes among Asian American and Pacific Islanders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049732312469731">Barnes et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732312469731">Choi, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732312469731">McCracken et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049732312469731">Yu et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>According to the 2004–2006 National Health Interview Survey on Asian Americans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049732312469731">Barnes et al., 2008</xref>), the percentage of adults with a bachelor’s degree or higher ranged from 70% (Asian Indians) to 29% (Vietnamese). In terms of poverty, Vietnamese (15%) were more than twice as likely as Filipinos (6%) to be poor. In health care, Korean adults were more likely to be without health insurance (36%) and a regular source of care (25%), compared with Japanese (9% and 12%, respectively). The prevalence rates of heart disease ranged from 4% (Koreans) to 9% (Asian Indians), and diabetes rates ranged from 5% (Japanese) to 14% (Asian Indians). The mortality rate from liver cancer was 54.3% for Vietnamese in California, compared with 9.3% for Japanese (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732312469731">McCracken et al., 2007</xref>). Despite considerable subgroup differences among Asian American and Pacific Islanders, research attention remains focused on aggregates of ethnic groups. This lack of empirical research on subgroups might lead to overgeneralizations about immigrants’ health care needs and foster homogenized health care approaches while overlooking subgroup differences.</p>
<p>This study stemmed from the rejection of two common approaches used in the health care behavior literature: addressing immigrant health care behavior as a “snap-shot” and looking at immigrants from Asia and Pacific regions as an aggregated group without paying attention to heterogeneity across subgroups. The purpose of this study was to explore how health-care-seeking behaviors of immigrants are reconstructed and shaped in the early immigration stage. In the study I used a qualitative, comparative analysis of the experiences of three Asian Pacific immigrant groups in Hawaii: Filipinos, Koreans, and Marshallese. These groups belong to one broad Asian American and Pacific Islander category, but they are different from each other in terms of health care systems in their home countries, preimmigration health care behaviors and practices, culture, and postimmigration characteristics, including ethnic community, state health policy, socioeconomic status, and English proficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732312469731">Choi, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In this study, the specific focus was on new immigrants who were marginalized in the receipt of federal assistance for the first 5 years of United States residency under the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) of 1996. The PRWORA restricts legal immigrants who came to the United States on or after August 22, 1996, from using public-funded benefits and services such as Medicaid during their first 5 years of immigration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049732312469731">Committee of Ways and Means, U.S. House of Representatives, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732312469731">Kaushal &amp; Kaestner, 2005</xref>). However, the state of Hawaii grants a different entitlement of its state health insurance (Hawaii QUEST), which provides health coverage to low-income Hawaii residents, for new immigrants in each group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732312469731">Hawaii Department of Human Services, 2011</xref>). For example, Marshallese immigrants are eligible for QUEST during the first 5 years of residency, whereas Filipinos and Koreans are not. This research was an extension of the two previous studies on Marshallese immigrants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049732312469731">Choi, 2008</xref>) and Korean immigrants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732312469731">Choi, 2012</xref>), with the inclusion of Filipino immigrants. A comparison of the three groups provides a new understanding of how health-seeking behaviors are adapted and reconstructed differently in each group, as well as how immigrants respond to the social context of the host country during their early immigration stage.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>The study included three groups of participants in Hawaii: (a) new immigrants from the Philippines, Korea, and the Republic of Marshall Islands; (b) key informants from the ethnic communities; and (c) service providers. The selection criteria for immigrant participants were limited to legal immigrant adults (older than 18 years) who had lived in the United States for less than 5 years at the time of interview. This allowed observation of their behavioral adaptation in the early stages of immigration and the effects of state policy on their health-seeking behaviors. Key informants comprised community leaders in various areas in each ethnic community. Service providers included physicians, public health nurses, bilingual staff, outreach workers, and program directors who served ethnic minorities and immigrants in local community health centers, safety net clinics, nonprofit/nongovernmental organizations, and state government programs.</p>
<p>With a purposive snowball sampling method, I identified participants to ensure maximum variation in the sample rather than to represent the target population. The sampling procedure was as follows: The first step was identification of a few health care and social service providers working with immigrants and key informants of each local ethnic community through direct contact with programs, organizations, and associations in the respective communities. The identified service providers and key informants served as a source of contact and assisted in the identification of and contact with other service providers and key informants. The Hawaii Department of Health’s Easy Access Project (EAP) was the primary source for the recruitment of potential immigrant participants. Based on an established recruitment guideline, the EAP and other service providers identified and referred potential immigrant participants. Those interviewed also identified other immigrants as potential participants.</p>
<p>The demographic characteristics of the immigrant participants varied considerably: adult ages ranged from 19 to 67 years, and included men and women; the employed and unemployed; those with English proficiency and those without; the sick and the healthy; those who had experienced the health care system; and those who had lived in the United States from 6 months to less than 5 years (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1049732312469731">Table 1</xref>). Efforts to include immigrants with various individual characteristics increased the scope of the observations and allowed the documentation of a wide range of health care experiences. A total of 52 adult immigrants (15 Filipinos, 17 Marshallese, and 20 Koreans), 22 key informants (6 Filipinos, 10 Marshallese, and 6 Koreans), and 17 health care and social service providers participated in the study.</p>

<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>The use of different semistructured interview instruments satisfied the specific purposes of interviews with the immigrants, service providers, and key informants, respectively. Interviews with new immigrants provided detailed information about how and why their behaviors changed in seeking health care during the early stages of their immigration. The interview questions centered on health-care-seeking behaviors and health care experiences in their home countries and in the United States, including: sources of health care and perceptions about health care providers and services in their local and coethnic communities; health insurance status and their experiences as they sought insurance; their knowledge of and familiarity with the United States health care system and services; their sources of information and tangible support for health care; their decision-making processes; the challenges they faced; and the facilitating factors in seeking health care.</p>
<p>Interviews with key informants of each ethnic community helped with the understanding of the characteristics of each respective community, including their health and health care issues, cultural characteristics, community organizations and available resources, communication and information channels, social ties, and the relationship with the local community and state government programs. Interviews with service providers focused on the identification of the health and health care issues of immigrants in general, the perceived health care needs of each immigrant group, and the challenges associated with providing services to immigrants.</p>
<p>The primary data collection method was face-to-face, in-depth individual interviews. Two focus group interviews with service providers and ethnic community leaders occurred to supplement individual interviews. Service providers who could not participate in either the individual or focus group interviews because of scheduling conflicts completed written surveys. Interviews of immigrants and key informants were conducted in English or the native language of the respective participants (Tagalog, Ilocano, Korean, and Marshallese) with the assistance of trained bilingual translators, following participant preference. English was the primary language used in interviews with service providers. The average hour-long interviews were audio-recorded with each participant’s consent. For reasons of confidentiality, I did not retain participant names. The Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects at University of Hawaii at Manoa approved the research.</p>

<sec id="section4-1049732312469731">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>The collected interview data were transcribed, and each interview was summarized. An inductive analysis of the data allowed for identification and characterization of patterns of behavioral changes in the health care of the three immigrant groups. Analysis was an iterative process of reading, coding, and recoding the data. A review of the transcripts and summaries generated a list of broad codes and led to the identification of themes and issues in the preimmigration and postimmigration health care experiences of the three groups. Specific codes within the broad code were identified and included in the final list of codes.</p>
<p>The coding process allowed identification of three major conceptual categories of the preimmigration health care experience: health care behaviors, barriers, and the facilitators of seeking health care. The postimmigration health care experience included changes in health-care-seeking behaviors; barriers to and facilitators of seeking care; sources of care and alternative care; experiences in obtaining health insurance; experience with health care delivery systems; ethnic health care resources; cultural beliefs about health and health care; social networks and support; and sources of health care information. I identified several subcodes under each code, and reviewed the transcripts again based on the final list of codes. Selection of quotes from the transcripts that supported the major findings then followed.</p>

<title>Rarely seeking professional health care in the home country</title>
<p>Marshallese immigrants rarely sought primary and preventive care in their home country. Both Marshallese immigrants and informants revealed that they often waited until their symptoms eased and mainly depended on folk/home remedies or traditional healers when they were sick. If the health condition became serious, they commonly sought professional health care outside their country, such as in Guam or Hawaii. Many Marshallese immigrants expressed that they were reluctant to see a doctor in their home country regardless of affordability because of the lack of trustworthy and qualified doctors, as well as the poor health care technologies and facilities available. A Marshallese immigrant disclosed,
<disp-quote>
<p>In Marshall, when I was sick, I usually ignored minor pains, waiting to get better. . . . I was told that I might have diabetes, but I was afraid to see a doctor in the clinic. You know, the doctors in the Marshall [Islands] didn’t care much about us. I saw that the doctor in the clinic just amputated my friend’s one leg, who had diabetes. I didn’t want to be like that. That’s why I came to Hawaii to get treatment.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another Marshallese informant said,
<disp-quote>
<p>Health care technology and facilities are poor. Moreover, many Marshallese don’t want to see a doctor there. They don’t trust doctors there. So, if they are sick, they try to go to Guam or Hawaii for medical treatment through the government referral program or with their own expenses. Many Marshallese in Hawaii came for medical treatment.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Moreover, most Marshallese immigrants had never received any kind of regular checkups, screenings, or overseas health examinations before immigration.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1049732312469731">
<title>Increase in seeking curative health care after immigration</title>
<p>After immigration, Marshallese immigrants sought professional health services—particularly for primary care and treatment for advanced illnesses—on a remarkably increased basis. Most Marshallese immigrants disclosed that they tended to seek more professional health services for primary care as well as for the treatment of chronic diseases such as cancer and diabetes in Hawaii. The increase in seeking health care was closely related to more available health facilities and services, the presence of advanced medical technology, higher quality of services, and the motivation for immigration to Hawaii, which was medical treatment for themselves or their family members. A Marshallese immigrant said,
<disp-quote>
<p>I came to Hawaii to have kidney dialysis five years ago because there was no health facility that provided kidney dialysis in the Marshall [Islands]. For a while I regularly received dialysis [in Hawaii]. . . . After all, I found a donor for a kidney transplant. Now I am fine, but I still have to see a doctor on a regular basis for checkup. So I and my husband decided to stay in Hawaii.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The state’s health insurance was identified as a significant enabling source for professional health care in Hawaii. Most Marshallese immigrants reported having health insurance or were in the process of obtaining insurance from the state at the time of interview. An outreach service provider disclosed,
<disp-quote>
<p>Immigrants, in general, cannot receive public assistance for the first five years of immigration, but Marshallese are different. They are eligible for many government programs including QUEST, housing, and welfare. It doesn’t matter when they came and how long they have been, stayed. As far as they meet the income criteria, they can receive state assistance. . . . I am not sure of the exact number of Marshallese covered by QUEST, but it is very high. I think that about seventy to eighty percent of those insured get from QUEST.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Marshallese immigrants expressed difficulties in seeking professional health services because of their low income and their lack of (a) English proficiency, (b) transportation, (c) health service information, and (d) familiarity with the health care system; however, social support from their extended family, friends, church members, and outreach health workers (e.g., public health nurses, social workers, and Marshallese bilingual services) buffered those difficulties. Marshallese immigrants and informants reported that the extended family and church networks provided health service information about local community and government programs, as well as various types of tangible support for health care. The tangible support included making physician appointments, filling out applications for health services, arranging transportation and translation services, and providing financial support. A Marshallese immigrant disclosed,
<disp-quote>
<p>I heard about QUEST from my sister. She has lived in Hawaii more than three years. She speaks English and knows where to go. She helped me to fill out the applications for welfare and QUEST. . . . If I receive letters from these programs, she tells me what it says. . . . She is the one who always goes with me whenever I have to see a doctor.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For Marshallese immigrants, outreach workers were an important source of social and health care service information, and direct assistance to obtain primary health care and state health insurance. Some outreach workers collaborated with Marshallese church leaders and established a liaison system to help Marshallese immigrants more effectively. An outreach health worker said,
<disp-quote>
<p>I have worked with Pacific islanders for a long time. Marshallese is one of them. I have provided a wide range of services such as vaccinations, filling out the forms for welfare and QUEST, making and reminding doctor’s appointment, giving a ride to doctor’s office, visiting their home and checking whether they took medication, educating how to cook a balanced meal, and so forth. However, I couldn’t do all by myself. So, I started having a regular meeting with Marshallese church leaders and health service providers who are interested in helping Marshallese or currently serve this population to find ways to help them. Also I talked to several church leaders to start a liaison system to help more people. I educated liaisons in each church. Then, those liaisons helped their church members or other people in their community to get social and health services, for example filling out the application forms to government programs and other things.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Despite increases in seeking professional health care after immigration, Marshallese immigrants delayed seeking primary care and underutilized preventive care regardless of their age, gender, and educational attainment. Most Marshallese immigrants did not receive a regular checkup or screening in Hawaii. The exceptions were those with serious medical conditions that required regular treatment or monitoring. They were not aware of the importance of or the need for early intervention and preventive care. The strong cultural definitions of health and illness and the lack of preventive health care experiences in their homeland contributed to delays in their health care seeking and underutilization of preventive care. A Marshallese informant explained:
<disp-quote>
<p>Screening or regular checkup is a “foreign concept” for them. There is no concept of preventive care such as regular checkup or screening. In their perception, health or wellness means “no pain” or “not having discomfort.” Thus, it is hard to bring them into the screening program. . . . Thus, most of the patients came to the clinics or hospitals at the very late stage of illness.</p>
</disp-quote></p>

<sec id="section9-1049732312469731">
<title>Concentration on local, Western health care services</title>
<p>Marshallese immigrants rarely sought health care services in their coethnic community in spite of their preference for coethnic doctors. Their primary sources of health care were safety net clinics and hospitals in the local community. Immigrants and key informants explained that the lack of health care providers and services within the Marshallese community led them to seek local health care providers. One Marshallese immigrant said, “It would be good if I can see a Marshallese doctor for diabetes. But we don’t have here. I don’t have other options.” A Marshallese informant revealed,
<disp-quote>
<p>Marshallese community is very small. There is no ethnic organization except churches. . . . With respect to heath care, there is no doctor’s clinic in our community. As far I know, there is only one Marshallese doctor and a few nurses and nurse aids in this island. I don’t know where they work. . . . Marshallese don’t have options like other immigrants. They have to go to see local doctors for treatment and medication.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Despite the strong cultural beliefs regarding health and illness, the majority of Marshallese immigrants primarily sought Western health care services rather than using the services of traditional health practitioners. The limited availability of traditional health practitioners in Hawaii was associated with decreases in traditional health care sought. The relatively weak belief in the efficacy of traditional medicine was a notable reason for not using traditional health care. A Marshallese informant explained that this was a natural consequence of selective immigration of Marshallese citizens. He said,
<disp-quote>
<p>Based on their belief on traditional medicine and Western medicine, there is a wide spectrum of health-seeking behaviors in the Marshall Islands. People who have strong belief in traditional medicine live mostly in outer islands, while those who believe in Western medicine live in the major islands. One of the important things is that those who do not believe in Western medicine don’t come to the U.S. for their medical treatment. They’d rather stay. They don’t spend thousands of dollars for the treatment that they don’t believe [in]. Thus, those who migrated to Hawaii have trust and belief in Western medicine and American doctors.</p>

<title>Limited professional health care in the home country</title>
<p>Filipino immigrants had limited experience in the use of professional health services in their home country, except for those who lived in the cities and had sufficient wealth to acquire those services. Many Filipino immigrants disclosed that they depended on traditional health practitioners for health care, and it was difficult to see a medical doctor in their home country because of high medical costs and the concentration of professional health services in the big cities. They also shared that health insurance was available only for certain groups of people (e.g., government workers, teachers) in the Philippines, and they depended mostly on their private resources for health care. A Filipino immigrant said,
<disp-quote>
<p>It was very expensive to see a doctor in the Philippines. I had to spend more than half of my daily wage to see a doctor, just to see a doctor. When I needed medicine, oh no, I don’t want to talk about it.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another Filipino immigrant reflected,
<disp-quote>
<p>It was too expensive. I was a government employee and had health insurance. I still had to pay a lot. I just couldn’t afford. . . . Instead, I used a lot of herbs and went to see a traditional healer because they were much cheaper.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Filipino immigrants’ preventive health care experiences in their home country were very limited. Only a few immigrants had received preventive care in the Philippines. Those who were aged, less educated, and from rural areas, in particular, reported that they never received preventive health services before immigration other than immunizations and overseas health examinations required for entry to the United States.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1049732312469731">
<title>Increase in seeking both primary and preventive care after immigration</title>
<p>There was a significant increase in seeking both primary and preventive care among Filipinos after immigration. Filipino immigrants revealed that they tended to seek more primary care services and preventive care particularly after obtaining health insurance. A Filipino immigrant admitted,
<disp-quote>
<p>In the Philippines, I could not see a doctor when I was sick. It was too expensive. Health checkup? Never had it in the Philippines. . . . Oh, I had it when I took immigration process because the U.S. government required it. . . . Here? I have my doctor. . . . Also, I received my first regular checkup last year. At that time, I got my job and they provided health insurance. So I had my checkup.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Filipino immigrants shared that available health care facilities and services, as well as health insurance, enabled them to seek more professional health care in Hawaii. Safety net clinics in local and Filipino communities, in particular, were an important source of care for those who had recently immigrated, did not have a job, and were uninsured. After obtaining health insurance, they tended to shift to a doctor’s offices and hospitals. According to one Filipino immigrant,
<disp-quote>
<p>Even when I didn’t have health insurance, I could see a doctor. They [a community health center] provided me free consultation and even free medication for my high blood pressure. After I got my health insurance from my work, everything becomes easier. Now I can go to see my doctor for checkup and medication.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although health insurance in the United States was considered a facilitating factor for their increased health care utilization after immigration, obtaining health insurance was still a major concern. Both Filipino immigrants and informants disclosed that the provision of health insurance was a significant consideration in the choice of a job. A Filipino informant said,
<disp-quote>
<p>Many Filipinos have more than one job for health insurance. Even if one job pays low but provides health insurance, they still keep the job for health insurance. Then, they have another job or have family business for money. That’s why many Filipinos in Hawaii have two or three jobs sometimes.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Filipino immigrants stated that their unfamiliarity with the federal health care system, limited financial resources, and lack of English proficiency were barriers to their seeking health care in Hawaii. At the same time, they shared that informational and tangible support from their coethnic networks and community lessened the negative impact of those barriers. Families and relatives provided various types of tangible aid for health care, such as making doctor appointments, providing transportation, helping with translation, and offering financial support in addition to housing and food. Information about the health care system and various free or low-cost health services were available in the family/relatives and friend networks, organizations, and media within the Filipino community.</p>
<p>The presence of safety net clinics and doctors’ offices within the Filipino community and the large numbers of Filipino health care providers in local health care facilities helped Filipino immigrants access health services without many cultural and language difficulties that other immigrants faced. A Filipino immigrant shared,
<disp-quote>
<p>Wherever I go, I see Filipinos. When I went to the health center for TB [tuberculosis] test, I met a Filipino staff there. She talked about free services. She spoke Ilocano. . . . My English is not good, but I don’t worry much because I can easily find Filipinos in the clinics, hospitals, or other social service places. Sometimes, they are not doctors or nurses, but I can easily find someone who can speak Ilocano or Tagalog.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Despite the considerable increase in health care utilization after immigration, untimely care and underuse of preventive care remained common among Filipino immigrants, particularly among the poor, aged, uninsured, and those from rural areas in the Philippines. Accounts from Filipino immigrants revealed that cultural beliefs and responses to illnesses partly influenced such health-seeking behavioral patterns, coupled with their limited experiences of preventive care in the Philippines. A Filipino immigrant said,
<disp-quote>
<p>I believe that I am sick when my body lost balance for some reasons. And pain and certain symptoms are the signals that I am sick. So no pain or symptom means that I am okay. It is how we were created. If I am not sick, I don’t have to see a doctor. The less you seek a physician, the better. It is better to follow the natural way. I try to regain my balance with the natural way, rather than seek a physician.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1049732312469731">
<title>Western health care from various sources</title>
<p>Although Filipino immigrants preferred ethnic-affiliated doctors because of cultural and language concerns, they sought health services from various sources including clinics, hospitals, and safety net clinics in both local and Filipino communities. The structural characteristics of the Filipino community and the local health care system were closely related to this pattern. Filipino immigrants and informants revealed that a considerable number of health professionals and facilities in the Filipino community provided a setting for new Filipino immigrants to receive necessary primary care services without seeking health care outside their ethnic community. Many Filipino doctors were available to poor and uninsured immigrants by providing low-cost or free health services through involvement in nonprofit, community-based Filipino health care organizations such as the Bayanihan Clinic Without Walls (BCWW).</p>
<p>As a health care safety net, doctors in the BCWW provided financially affordable as well as culturally and linguistically accessible services to the Filipino immigrants. Moreover, the large numbers of Filipino doctors, nurses, and other service providers in local clinics, community health centers, and hospitals helped Filipino immigrants seek health services outside of their ethnic community while affording them a certain level of comfort. A service provider remarked,
<disp-quote>
<p>There are so many Filipino doctors and nurses in the Hawaii. . . . Filipino doctors started the BCWW to help poor, uninsured, new immigrants. It provides free medical services [to] those immigrants. Although the BCWW has expanded their services to uninsured immigrants in the local community, this is particularly beneficial for Filipino immigrants because the services are provided mostly in either Filipino or English. Also you can easily find Filipino nurses in the clinics and hospitals. As far I know, about eighty percent of nurses in Hawaii are Filipinos. I think it helps Filipino immigrants a lot to get health care.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Filipino immigrants primarily depended on Western health professionals for most of their health care, regardless of the fact that they commonly practiced popular folk remedies for minor symptoms or nonthreatening illnesses. Some reported seeking Western doctors and traditional health care practitioners. Very few immigrants exclusively sought traditional medicines or practitioners. A Filipino immigrant said,
<disp-quote>
<p>I usually take some home remedies when I don’t feel good. But if it doesn’t work, I go to see a doctor. . . . No, I don’t go to traditional healers. I heard that there are some healers in Hawaii, but I’ve never used them.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Despite cultural beliefs regarding health, Filipino immigrants exhibited relatively weak confidence in traditional health practitioners. The limited availability of traditional practitioners in Hawaii and the availability of Western doctors resulted in a decrease of traditional health care use after immigration. One Filipino immigrant revealed, “I often sought traditional healers in the Philippines, but not in here. It is very difficult to find a good traditional healer in Hawaii. Rather I see doctors. There are so many good doctors and hospitals. I trust them.”</p>

<title>Primary and preventive care in the home country</title>
<p>Korean immigrants enjoyed primary and preventive health care and traditional Korean medicine within the official health care system in Korea. They reported that primary and preventive care were accessible and affordable in Korea because of the national health insurance program and the close proximity of health care facilities and services. A Korean immigrant recalled,
<disp-quote>
<p>In Korea, I could see a doctor when I needed to. The doctor’s offices are everywhere. Many places accept walk-in patients, and I didn’t have to wait long. Also it was cheap. I usually paid about two dollars to see a doctor. I spent another two to three dollars for the prescribed drug in a drug store. So, I didn’t hesitate to see a doctor. Everything was so simple and cheap.</p>

<title>Decrease in seeking professional health care after immigration</title>
<p>Korean immigrants experienced a dramatic decrease in seeking both primary and preventive health care after immigration to the United States. They reported that after immigration they were more likely to procrastinate seeking care, underuse primary care, and practice self-treatment based on popular folk remedies. Their health-seeking behaviors shifted to more curative and emergency-oriented health care. A Korean immigrant shared,
<disp-quote>
<p>Last year, I was sick for almost two months. I already could have seen a doctor if I were in Korea. But I could not afford to see a doctor here. . . . I just waited getting better, but I didn’t get better. After all, I had to go to an ER [emergency room].</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another Korean immigrant recalled, “I had annual checkups once a year or at least every other year in Korea. I even had cancer screenings. It was not that expensive. . . . I haven’t had any since I came here.”</p>
<p>After immigration, a change in the health insurance system was the most crucial factor that diminished their health-care-seeking behavior. Most Korean immigrants did not have health insurance at the time of their interviews, and identified the lack of health insurance as the primary barrier in seeking health care in the United States. A Korean immigrant said,
<disp-quote>
<p>Everything is changed. I can’t see a doctor when I am sick. I can’t even think about getting a health checkup. As I said, in Korea, I had those. I went to see a doctor when I didn’t feel good. I got a checkup every year. . . . Health insurance is the one that made the change. After immigration, I don’t have health insurance, and I can’t afford it. I just have to find other ways to survive when I am sick, instead of seeing a medical doctor.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Korean immigrants disclosed difficulties in obtaining health insurance in the United States, compared to their experience in Korea. Most Korean immigrants and their family members were self-employed or were temporary/contract workers in a service industry or a small business in a Korean enclave. They did not get health insurance through their employment or their family members. Expensive health insurance premiums and the long waiting period for insurance approval required for new individual buyers prevented them from purchasing health insurance. A Korean immigrant disclosed,
<disp-quote>
<p>I didn’t have to worry about health insurance in Korea. Everybody has a health insurance. If anyone in my family had a job, I could be covered. Those who are poor or not covered by their family members can easily get it from the community or from the government. Compared to here, it is really cheap and easy to get.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Lack of familiarity with the United States system and the limited information about available health services were related to behavioral changes. Korean immigrants admitted their limited knowledge and information about health insurance, the health delivery system, and available health services. Coupled with the lack of English proficiency, such limited knowledge contributed to feelings of fear or reluctance in seeking health care. A Korean immigrant said,
<disp-quote>
<p>To be honest with you, I don’t know where to go when I am sick. I don’t understand the system. It is really complicated. I learned that the service coverage depends on types of health insurance, and dental and eye cares requires separate insurances. I have health insurance, but I am not sure how much it is covered. So I am nervous to see a doctor even if I have insurance. I am not sure whether my understanding is correct or not, but I have to see a doctor in the network of my insurance coverage. Otherwise, I won’t be covered. Also I heard that I have to see my primary doctor first to see a specialist. It is really complicated. I am so confused. And my English is not good. I am afraid. I haven’t seen a doctor since I came to Hawaii.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Korean immigrants were in a predicament regarding health care information. Although their family/friend networks and coethnic community organizations were major sources of health information and support, they revealed that their networks and ethnic organizations were just as uninformed about the health care system and services and could not help with navigating the system. A Korean immigrant remarked, “About half year ago, I was really sick. I didn’t know where to go at that time. I asked my friends and relatives where to go. But they didn’t know either.” A Korean informant admitted that information about the health care system and services was limited in Korean community organizations and was not provided by the organizations. A Korean informant explained:
<disp-quote>
<p>I think the limited information about the health care system and services is partly related to indifference toward recent immigrants within the Korean community. I think we, as a community, are not interested in new immigrants and don’t much pay attention to their needs. . . . Such indifference makes [it] difficult for immigrants to get support from the community to meet their needs.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1049732312469731">
<title>Concentration on coethnic, Western health care services and alternatives</title>
<p>Korean immigrants sought health care within their ethnic community and rarely used local health services. They presented a strong preference for ethnic-affiliated doctors because of their cultural and linguistic concerns and the conveniently available information about Korean doctors in the coethnic media and business directory. A Korean immigrant stated,
<disp-quote>
<p>I feel more comfortable to see a Korean doctor. With American doctors, I don’t think that I can explain clearly my symptoms and ask questions, even with an interpreter. With them, I feel that something is missing. . . . I don’t know whether it is English or culture. . . . You know some symptoms we, Koreans, understand, but Americans don’t.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>At the same time, limited information about local health services and a lack of English proficiency hindered Koreans from seeking local health services. A Korean immigrant disclosed,
<disp-quote>
<p>When I am very sick, I go to see a Korean doctor whom I found in the Korean business directory. In fact, I don’t know any other places. I don’t know where to get the information about local health care or doctors.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Trips back to the home country for health care were a unique health care pattern that was not found in the other two groups. Korean immigrants revealed that they often used a trip to Korea to meet their health care needs. The services they sought varied, and included diagnoses, treatments, prescriptions for chronic diseases, dental care, eye examination/care, general checkups, and specific disease screenings (e.g., cancer). This pattern was prevalent regardless of health insurance status and health status, but it was more prominent among the uninsured with chronic health conditions. Some Korean immigrants made a special trip to Korea for their chronic conditions or simply for dental care. A Korean immigrant reported,
<disp-quote>
<p>Yes, I have it [health insurance], but it doesn’t cover much. I still have to pay a lot from my own pocket. Also my dental is not covered. Health care is much cheaper in Korea. When I go to Korea, the first thing that I do is making appointments for a regular checkup and dental and eye cares.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Korean immigrants shared feelings of fear and anxiety related to their unmet health care needs and the consequent financial burdens associated with illness in the United States. They stated that a trip to Korea for health care was a feasible alternative to meet their health care needs, while also alleviating homesickness. However, such trips often resulted in untimely health care. Some Korean immigrants reported that they delayed seeking care until they found the time and money to visit Korea, except for urgent medical conditions. This often took a few months, or even a few years. A Korean immigrant revealed,
<disp-quote>
<p>About a year ago, I went to Korea for root canal . . . . I had health insurance, but it didn’t include dental. . . . I decided to go to Korea during summer time to have treatment. I had to wait about three months, but it was a much better deal. Think about it. It was cheaper to go to Korea than get treatment here, even including my flight ticket and treatment cost in Korea together. Also, I can see my parents.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Health services that Korean immigrants sought in the ethnic enclave mainly concentrated on Western medicine. They rarely sought traditional medicine or practitioners. This pattern related to their selective beliefs in the efficacy of Korean traditional medicine as a supplemental care, rather than necessary care; the relatively high cost of traditional health care; and a lack of confidence in the traditional health practitioners trained and licensed in Hawaii. A Korean immigrant remarked,
<disp-quote>
<p>I believe that traditional medicine works for specific such as muscle ache, ankle sprain, and promotion of my health. But I don’t have to have it. In Korea, I sometimes went to see traditional doctors for herbal tonics and acupunctures, but they are expensive here. I cannot afford it.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>A comparison of the experiences of three Asian and Pacific Islander immigrant groups in Hawaii demonstrates that reconstructing health-care-seeking behaviors occurs during the adaptation process as they negotiated a new social and cultural environment. All three groups experienced significant changes in their health-seeking behaviors, but in different ways. Filipino and Marshallese immigrants, who had limited access to professional health care in their home countries, experienced a notable increase in seeking professional health services after immigration, with an increase in primary health care, but procrastinated when seeking care and underused preventive care. In contrast, Korean immigrants, who had universal health care in their home country, experienced a dramatic decrease in seeking primary and preventive care after immigration. Each immigrant group developed unique seeking patterns to meet their health care needs with respect to the source of care. The social context of the host country of each immigrant group had a critical influence on the formation of postimmigration health-seeking behaviors, interacting with individual characteristics and the previous health care experiences in their home countries.</p>
<p>Preimmigration experience influenced immigrants’ perceptions regarding the health care system of the host country and postimmigration health-seeking behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732312469731">Leduc &amp; Proulx, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732312469731">Portes et al., 1992</xref>). The three groups all used their preimmigration experiences as sociocultural referents to compare the characteristics of health care systems (i.e., cost, accessibility, availability, affordability, and quality of services) in the host country, consistent with Leduc and Proulx’s findings. Although recognizing the structural barriers in the system, Filipino and Marshallese immigrants who had experienced more severe structural barriers to health care in their home countries viewed the United States health care system and services as more positive and encouraging for seeking health care.</p>
<p>In contrast, Korean immigrants who experienced universal health coverage in their home country perceived the U.S. health care system as complex, inaccessible, and unaffordable. These negative assessments became psychological barriers, including frustration and fear in seeking health care, and led Korean immigrants to underutilize health services. Nevertheless, their preimmigration experiences with primary and preventive care did influence their future intentions to use health services. If the structural barriers to health insurance were lessened, Korean immigrants were more willing than the other two groups to use primary and preventive care.</p>
<p>Immigrants in the three groups experienced difficulties in seeking health services because of a lack of health insurance, high medical costs, limited English proficiency, cultural beliefs regarding health and illness, unfamiliarity with the health insurance and health care delivery system, and insufficient information about health services, as found in other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732312469731">Leclere et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732312469731">Leduc &amp; Proulx, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049732312469731">Ma, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732312469731">Wang, Rosenberg, &amp; Lo, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049732312469731">Yu et al., 2010</xref>). However, the extent of the effects of those barriers on immigrant health care behaviors varied by the social contexts (e.g., immigrant health policy, health care delivery system, ethnic community, and social networks) where each immigrant group resided (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732312469731">Choi, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049732312469731">Kasl &amp; Berkman, 1983</xref>; Leclere et al.; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732312469731">Portes et al., 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>Health insurance is a major barrier to immigrant health care, and state health policies substantially influence immigrants’ health insurance status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732312469731">J. Choi, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732312469731">S. Choi, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732312469731">Hill et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732312469731">Leclere et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049732312469731">Shin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049732312469731">Yu et al., 2010</xref>). Marshallese immigrants who were eligible for the state-assisted health insurance as soon as they immigrated did not identify health insurance as the major barrier in seeking health care; it was an important source of health care. Conversely, Filipino and Korean immigrants who were marginalized by the state-assisted health insurance program for the first 5 years of residency tended to be less insured. For them, a lack of health insurance was a major concern in their seeking health care. Korean immigrants in particular experienced the most difficulty in obtaining health insurance because they were self-employed or worked in small businesses. The lack of health insurance resulted in behavioral changes in seeking health care. In comparison, Filipino immigrants quickly adapted to the American health care system and sought health insurance from their employers; the availability of employer-sponsored health insurance facilitated their seeking professional health care.</p>
<p>The impacts of other health care barriers on seeking health care were different across the three studied groups by resources and characteristics based on their ethnic community and social networks. The ethnic community and immigrant networks played a critical role in seeking health care by providing health services information and help with navigating the health care system, consistent with findings of other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732312469731">Choi, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732312469731">Leclere et al., 1994</xref>). For example, information about available and affordable health services, navigation of health insurance and delivery systems, and tangible support within the ethnic communities and networks of Filipino and Marshallese immigrants buffered the negative effects of those health care barriers. Unlike those two groups, the ethnic community and network of Korean immigrants lacked information about the health care system and services, and did not function as a reservoir of appropriate health care information and help in navigating the system. Such community and network characteristics, coupled with limited English proficiency, truncated Korean immigrants’ potential choices and limited their seeking formal health care.</p>
<p>The level of understanding by ethnic community leaders and health care providers regarding new immigrant health care issues influenced the availability of affordable health care resources for immigrants and the provision of health care interventions. For example, local service providers and Marshallese key informants had a relatively good understanding of Marshallese health care issues. Their knowledge helped service providers and community leaders to find various ways (e.g., active outreach health services, a liaison system in Marshallese churches) to provide tailored interventions for new Marshallese immigrants to obtain health care. The Filipino group demonstrated a similar pattern: community leaders and health care providers offered various health services (e.g., information and free health care services) based on their understanding of new Filipino immigrants’ health care issues. In contrast, new Korean immigrants did not receive similar support. Most service providers did not consider that Korean immigrants were in need of assistance to obtain health care, and Korean community leaders were indifferent to the new Korean immigrants and their health care issues.</p>
<p>The culturally distinctive, normative patterns of health and illness definitions and responses shape decisions concerning whether or when to seek primary and preventive care, but operate in different ways among immigrants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049732312469731">Gany et al., 2006</xref>). The cultural definition of health as an absence of pain or symptoms and the perceptions of preventive care remained strong among Marshallese immigrants and influenced their health-seeking patterns: treatment-oriented health care and retention of seeking timely primary and preventive care. Filipino immigrants also had relatively strong cultural governance of their illness definitions and perceptions, but their primary and preventive care increased after immigration, responding to the improvement of structural conditions related to health care. In the case of Korean immigrants, seeking primary and preventive health care after immigration was considerably constrained by structural factors and available resources rather than by cultural beliefs held about health and illness.</p>
<p>Language, culture, and ethnic affiliation intertwined to influence the choice of health care provider in the host country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732312469731">Leduc &amp; Proulx, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732312469731">Wang et al., 2008</xref>). Although all three groups had a strong preference for ethnic affiliated doctors, the three immigrant groups’ health-seeking patterns demonstrated that health care infrastructure and resources within the coethnic communities and the cultural competence of the local health care systems were crucial factors in their decision to seek ethnic, local, or both ethnic and local services. For example, health care facilities and health professionals within the Filipino community and the large number of Filipino health professionals in the local health care facilities offered Filipino immigrants an array of both ethnic and local health care opportunities. In contrast, health care resources provided within the Korean community enabled Korean immigrants to seek health care within their ethnic community. A lack of cultural competence in the local system, coupled with limited local health care information and lack of English proficiency, led Korean immigrants to seek health care within their ethnic community or to use travel to their home country as a strategic alternative to meet their health care needs.</p>
<p>Despite their lack of cultural competence with the local health system and their limited English proficiency, Marshallese immigrants sought health care services solely in the local community because of the scarcity of health resources and services within their ethnic community. Moreover, the exhaustive efforts of community health outreach workers who collaborated with Marshallese community leaders, as well as the informational and tangible support of social networks, helped Marshallese immigrants to use local health services.</p>
<p>All three groups decreased their search for traditional health care. Common reasons included a lack of confidence and limited availability of traditional health care practitioners, a belief in the selective efficacy of traditional medicine, and relatively high costs, consistent with findings in other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732312469731">Hill et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732312469731">Zhang &amp; Verhoef, 2002</xref>). For Marshallese immigrants, their selective immigration also contributed to this pattern, given that a considerable number of Marshallese immigrants originally came to Hawaii for medical treatment for themselves and family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732312469731">Greico et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>In each immigrant group in this study, health-seeking behavior patterns were slightly different by individual characteristics, in line with other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049732312469731">Huang, Yu, Liu, Young, &amp; Wong, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049732312469731">Shin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049732312469731">Yu et al., 2010</xref>). Overall, those who were older, less educated, uninsured, and from rural areas were less likely to seek primary care. However, among Korean immigrants the difference in health-seeking patterns was more prominent by health insurance status. For Filipinos and Marshallese, the notable patterns were based on age and previous residence in their home country. With respect to preventive care, there were no distinctive patterns by gender, age, and education in the three groups. Health insurance was a crucial factor in seeking preventive care for Filipinos and Koreans, whereas the experience of a critical medical condition was important for the Marshallese.</p>
<p>There are several implications from this study that apply to new immigrants subject to the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) of 1996 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049732312469731">Committee of Ways and Means, 1996</xref>). State health policies developed in response to federal regulations determine the fundamental basis for who can access health care services in Hawaii. Significant progress in immigrant health care is unlikely to occur without improvement in the availability of health insurance. Furthermore, the ethnic community is the primary public space that most newcomers inhabit and where they seek help and support without cultural and linguistic barriers. The development and mobilization of health resources within the ethnic community are important to improve health care for economically and linguistically disadvantaged immigrants, particularly during the early stages of immigration. In addition, establishment of close collaboration between an ethnic community and outreach workers in local health centers and the government health department afford greater benefits for immigrants in seeking health care. Finally, mobilization and the use of social networks would provide an effective starting point to disseminate information about health services and develop interventions to reduce barriers for immigrants, because a majority of new immigrants rely on their immigrant social networks as a primary source of health care information.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Most immigrants experience an adaptation process in their health-seeking behaviors and share similar difficulties in seeking health care after immigration, but these difficulties often stem from different sources. For some groups, reducing the structural barriers to health insurance would lead to timely and appropriate health-care-seeking behaviors. For others, cultural intervention and information dissemination through formal and informal social networks would be more efficient. Therefore, tailored interventions seem a reasonable approach that would take into account the unique characteristics of each immigrant community.</p>
