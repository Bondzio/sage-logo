<p>In his magisterial <italic>Church, Society and Religious Change in France 1580–1730</italic> (2009), which did much to synthesize a vast mass of French studies, Joseph Bergin provided a remarkable panorama of the French Church in the long seventeenth century, albeit one which has still left many areas for investigation. Bergin emphasized that the period was one of innovation and experiment and, indeed, a relative failure to assess an evolving situation was a certain weakness of the previous historiography. A notable exception was Alison Forrestal’s <italic>Fathers, Pastors and Kings: Visions of Episcopacy in Seventeenth-Century France</italic> (Manchester 2004), which examined the crystallization of ideas on the episcopate in terms of an ongoing dialectic between opposed parties in the Church. Now Anthony Wright, a leading authority on early-modern Catholicism whose previous publications have been more particularly on Italy and Italo-Spanish connections, has entered the field of French studies to investigate one major shift. He demonstrates the growing divisions within the strongly networked French <italic>dévot</italic> or zealot Catholic reform movement in the 1630s. After the Peace of Alais between the Crown and the Huguenots of 1629, groups within the French Church were perhaps more inclined to indulge in the luxury of internecine rivalries and <italic>odium theologicum</italic>. There were the tensions between bishops, more than ever conscious of their pastoral vocation, and the regular orders which were largely exempt from episcopal control; bishops often appreciated the Jesuits, but relations could be strained. There were rivalries between religious orders and the new congregations of priests (quasi-orders, not exempt from episcopal control); these included rivalries between Jesuits and Dominicans, between Jesuits and the Congregation of the Oratory, and between the latter and the Capuchins. Pastoral control over nunneries, socially and spiritually significant institutions as they often were, was one key issue. By contrast with the Jesuits, the Oratorians, who were primarily dedicated to seminary education and schooling, put themselves fully at the disposal of bishops. The position of the Jesuits in France was delicate. From the start, their establishment in France had been viewed with mistrust by the sovereign court of the <italic>Parlement</italic> of Paris, and the Sorbonne regarded their colleges as rivals. They fell under suspicion whenever there were failed or successful attempts on the life of the king. The writings of some non-French <italic>confrères</italic>, indeed, exposed them to accusations of espousing a papal right to depose monarchs and of favouring insubordination among subjects, even assassination. Their indulgent policy for the confessional was controversial. They were heavily dependent on the favour of the monarchy and also of Richelieu personally. They usually provided the royal confessors, but this only exposed them to attack. And the Jesuits themselves were far from being a tightly disciplined militia; loose-cannon controversialists in their ranks prejudiced their position. Wright downplays the relative significance in the 1630s of the impact in France of the controversies over divine grace in which the Jesuits were enmeshed in the Belgian university of Louvain, and likewise the polemic over confessional practice between the Jesuits and <italic>les Messieurs de Port Royal.</italic> He sees the multiple tensions within the French Church as tending to resolve themselves into a major division between the Jesuits and their sundry categories of opponent. This was even before the controversy over Cornelius Jansen’s <italic>Augustinus</italic> (first published in 1640), in which the Jesuits took the lead in aggression. Interwoven with this story is that of the strains in the <italic>dévot</italic> group caused by France’s entry into war with the Habsburgs from 1629, a policy which was peculiarly Richelieu’s. This was a major factor in detaching Richelieu from the <italic>dévot</italic> milieu to which, as a significant reforming bishop, he had originally belonged. This war policy was opposed by leading <italic>dévots</italic>, but the Jesuits, so often associated with the Habsburgs, dependant as they were on Crown favour in France, here took a stance of loyalty to the monarchy. The direction of the account of the development of the <italic>dévot</italic> party and its internal connections in the earlier part of the volume is somewhat unclear, but the more argued account of its breakdown in the second half is worth waiting for.</p>
