<abstract>
<p>Statin use has been advocated to prevent atheromatous complications in lupus patients and may be widely prescribed for these patients in future. Statin-induced lupus has also been described, though the risk is not confirmed. The goal of this study was to detect a safety signal regarding statin-induced lupus. We conducted a case/non-case study in the French PharmacoVigilance Database from January 2000 until December 2010. Cases were drug-induced lupus reports. Non-cases were all reports of other adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Exposure to statins at the time of ADR was screened in each report. Among 235,147 ADR reports, 232 were drug-induced lupus. Exposure to statins was present in 17 (7.3%) cases and in 10,601 (4.7%) non-cases. Reporting odds ratio (ROR) for statin exposure associated with lupus erythematosus was 1.67 (95% confidence interval 1.02–2.74). The ROR was &gt; 1 for each statin but fluvastatin. This pharmacoepidemiological study suggests a link between statin exposure and lupus induction. The benefit-to-risk ratio of statin therapy in lupus patients should be evaluated through randomized controlled trials.</p>

<p>Statins have immunomodulatory properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961203312436861">1</xref></sup> They may have interesting effects in lupus patients, preventing both atheromatous complications and perhaps disease flares.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203312436861">2</xref></sup> Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing pertinent clinical events (cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality, disease flares) are eagerly awaited. Two RCTs comparing atorvastatin (40 mg daily) versus placebo and assessing intermediate endpoints have been conducted. At one year, atorvastatin significantly decreased coronary calcification progression (but not myocardial perfusion), lipids and C-reactive protein levels in the first trial.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961203312436861">3</xref></sup> At two years, the benefit of atorvastatin on carotid intima-media thickness was statistically significant in a post-hoc analysis of the second trial.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961203312436861">4</xref></sup> In both studies, there was no change of the SLEDAI score on atorvastatin, but the trials were not designed to assess disease flare prevention. As a result, these drugs may be widely proposed to lupus patients in future. On the other hand, statin-induced subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE) or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) has been rarely described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961203312436861">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203312436861">6</xref></sup> Several mechanisms have been recently reviewed to explain statin-induced lupus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203312436861">6</xref></sup> First, statins may emphasize apoptosis, leading to exposure of auto-antigens and auto-reactive cell stimulation. Furthermore, statins modulate T-lymphocyte activation, due to changes in the cholesterol content of membrane lipid rafts. Eventually, exposure to statins results in a shift toward a T-helper 2 immune response, which emphasizes the production of autoantibodies by B-cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961203312436861">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203312436861">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Some drug-induced lupus reports are very convincing because of a positive rechallenge. However, those are rare and statins are widely used. So many cases may be fortuitous. We present the results of a study aimed at identifying a signal for a link between exposure to statins and lupus using a case/non-case design in the French National PharmacoVigilance Database (FNPVD) over 10 years.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-0961203312436861" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title>
<p>We included all statin-induced lupus cases recorded from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2010 in the FNPVD. This database has been previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961203312436861">7</xref></sup> Briefly, it registers all adverse drug reaction (ADR) spontaneous reports since 1984 in France. According to the law, French physicians must report ‘serious’ or ‘unexpected’ ADRs to their regional pharmacovigilance centre, of which there are 31 in France. Then, all suspected ADRs are reviewed by a college of pharmacologists and clinicians and then registered in the FNPVD. They request all the necessary information from the health practitioner who has reported the case and from the physician who ascertained the diagnosis (here for lupus, a dermatologist, rheumatologist or internal medicine physician). ‘Serious’ ADRs are those lethal, life threatening, leading to hospitalization (or prolongation of hospitalization) or persistent or significant disability or incapacity, or (since 2007) those judged clinically relevant by the physician who reports the case.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961203312436861">8</xref></sup> ‘Unexpected ADRs’ are ADRs not listed in the drug monograph. For each report, information about the patient (age, gender, medical history) and drug exposure is recorded. A detailed summary of the clinical description is then added at the end of each case report. ADRs are coded according to the MedDRA terminology.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961203312436861">9</xref></sup> Drugs are coded using their international generic name and according to the ATC classification.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0961203312436861">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>The case/non-case design is suitable for discovering safety signals and a potential causal link between a given drug and an adverse event after it has been suspected through rare case-reports and pharmacological assumptions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0961203312436861">11</xref></sup> Cases are defined by all reports of the ADR of interest, here lupus erythematosus. We selected the cases using the MedDRA high level term code ‘lupus erythematosus (including subtypes)’ and then excluded duplicates. Non-cases are all other ADRs reported in the database during the same period of time, here all ADRs but lupus erythematosus. Duplicates were also identified and excluded. Exposure to a given drug is defined by the presence of the drug at the time of the ADR, whether this drug is suspected or not. We searched for the exposure to statins in cases and non-cases using the ATC codes C10AA (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors), C10BA (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors in combination with other lipid modifying agents) and C10BX (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, other combinations). In order to assess the risk associated to each statin, the search was then renewed using the generic drug names. The strength of the link between exposure to statins and lupus erythematosus notifications was quantified by the reporting odds ratio (ROR). The 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were also calculated using the Woolf method. The ROR is the odd of the exposure to statin in cases divided by the odd of the exposure to statin in non-cases. The null hypothesis is lack of difference in statins exposure between cases and non-cases. The null hypothesis is rejected if the ROR 95% CI excludes the value 1.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec3-0961203312436861" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title>
<p>Among 235,147 ADRs reported to the FNPVD from 2000 to 2010, 232 had been encoded ‘lupus erythematosus (including subtypes)’. Among them, exposure to statins was found in 17 (7.3%). Cases are described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0961203312436861">Table 1</xref>. Pravastatin was involved in seven cases (37%), atorvastatin and simvastatin in four cases each (21%), rosuvastatin in three cases (16%) and cerivastatin in one case (5%). In one report (case 4), the patient had been successively exposed to atorvastatin, pravastatin and cerivastatin. He developed a cutaneous lupus on each exposure, which resolved after each statin withdrawal. In nine reports, the patients were exposed to other potential lupus-inducers concomitantly to statins. Cutaneous features were the most common (14 cases) and consisted predominantly in a photodistributed erythemato-papulous rash or a diffuse annular-polycyclic rash. Alopecia was also reported. Systemic symptoms were present in two cases. Antinuclear antibodies were present in 11 cases (data available in only 13 patients), anti-dsDNA antibodies in five cases and anti-SSA antibodies in six cases. Anti-histone antibodies were reported in one patient. Evolution was quoted in eight reports: statin withdrawal led to full recovery in all but one cases. Association of statin exposure with lupus reports is reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0961203312436861">Table 2</xref>. Exposure to statins was more frequent among lupus erythematosus notifications than among controls (ROR: 1.67; 95% CI: 1.02–2.74). The ROR was increased for each statin but fluvastatin (no lupus case reported). The increase was statistically significant only for pravastatin (ROR: 2.27; 95% CI: 1.07–4.82).

This pharmacoepidemiological signal on this rare ADR necessitates further validation by other methods. Of note, the increased ROR does not reflect the true risk ratio when exposed to a given drug. Under-reporting and selective reporting can heavily influence the results of such studies leading to under- or over-estimation of the risk. We think that in our study, the ROR may have been underestimated as there is no reason for selective reporting and because statin-induced lupus is not well known. Moreover, statin-induced lupus may not be evoked when occurring after years of exposure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961203312436861">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203312436861">6</xref></sup> and this would also lead to under-reporting. Our cases differ on several points from the 13 published cases reviewed by Noël in 2007. In Noël’s study, mean patient’s age was comparable but 61% were male and most cases were SLE, only three being SCLE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203312436861">6</xref></sup> One cannot exclude a publication bias favouring SLE cases. In our series, most patients seem to have suffered from subacute cutaneous features. This may reflect the non-exhaustivity of reports in the FNPVD. Moreover, we could not verify whether these patients fulfilled – or not – the ACR criteria for SLE due to lack of information on important biological data and a short patient follow-up at the time of ADR reporting. So there may be misclassifications among the cases. In the published cases, cutaneous features (6/13) were similar to those described in the FNPVD reports: a photodistributed, scaly, often annular and polycyclic maculo-papular erythematous rash. In the published cases, anti-dsDNA was quoted in three cases, anti-histone autoantibodies were detected in 4/5 and anti-Ro-SSA in 2/3 cases. In our survey, anti-histone antibodies were rare and anti-Ro/SSA antibodies frequent. This seems to correspond to the immunological characteristics of cutaneous drug-induced lupus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961203312436861">12</xref></sup> Statin was the sole drug suspected in 8/17 lupus reports. Unfortunately, it was impossible to restrict the statistical analysis to the cases and controls where statins were the sole lupus inducers due to technical difficulties to select such controls. Nevertheless, it does not cast doubt on our results because the case/non-case survey is valid whatever the drug imputation in cases and non-cases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0961203312436861">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Concomitantly to our study, a same approach was conducted in the World Health Organization Uppsala Monitoring Centre (WHO-UMC) database.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0961203312436861">13</xref></sup> From its creation (1968) to 2009, the authors investigated 3362 cases matched to 27,092 non-cases (1:5 matching). Statin exposure was found in 144 (4.3%) cases and 725 (2.7%) non-cases. The crude ROR was 1.55, 95% CI 1.28–1.86. Nevertheless, this study presents some limitations. First, this worldwide database records reports from 90 countries in which reporting can sometimes be done by patients themselves. Almost 60% of the suspected statin-induced lupus cases have been reported by consumers or health practitioners other than physicians or dentists. These cases have not been secondarily validated by a college of pharmacologists as it is systematically assessed in the FNPVD. As a result, some ‘lupus’ cases may be doubtful. However, the authors made a sensitivity analysis restricted to cases and non-cases reported by physicians and the crude ROR was 1.61, 95% CI 1.15–2.27, which is close to our estimation. Of note, our national study should not be considered as a sub-study of the WHO study. Indeed, France is weakly implicated in the WHO registry,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0961203312436861">14</xref></sup> so most French statin-induced lupus cases are probably not reported in this database. So, our results confirm in an independent cohort the results of the WHO-UMC. Interestingly, most statins seem to be associated with an increased ROR, although the risk was significant only for pravastatin. The study power was low for detecting a significant ROR increase considering each statin. No case has been reported on fluvastatin, and the strength of the signal was weak on atorvastatin (ROR: 1.03). In a previous case-control study, we also found that the risk of statin-induced chronic muscle disease (including polymyositis/dermatomyositis) may be higher on simvastatin or pravastatin (respectively, OR 5.48, 95% CI 0.96–30.7 and OR 2.56, 95% CI 0.74–7.87) than on atorvastatin or fluvastatin (OR: 1).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0961203312436861">15</xref></sup> In the WHO-UMC survey, lovastatin (not marketed in France), simvastatin and pravastatin were also the most frequently involved.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0961203312436861">13</xref></sup> So it is possible that some statins (such as fluvastatin and atorvastatin) do not induce lupus.</p>
<p>Overall, these results add strong argument about an increased risk of lupus on statin therapy. The risk to develop or to worsen lupus on statins is probably low, though it has not yet been rigorously assessed. So it is important to keep in mind to perform further pharmacoepidemiological studies as well as properly powered prospective clinical trials to detect a potential increased risk of lupus flare on statins. Practically, our results bring to light that statin withdrawal should be discussed in patients exposed to these drugs who experience development or worsening of lupus. Whether lupus-induction by statins is a class effect or not is another important unsolved question. Our results may indicate a reassessment of the treating of all lupus patients with statins, though the ability of statins to induce a disease flare in systemic lupus erythematosus patients remains unknown. The benefit-to-risk ratio of statin therapy in lupus patients should be further evaluated through randomized double blinded trials properly powered to detect a potential increased risk of lupus flare on statins.</p></sec>
