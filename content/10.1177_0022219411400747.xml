<abstract>
<p>Many college students receiving accommodations for specific learning disability (SLD) do not meet objective criteria for the disorder. Furthermore, whether students meet criteria depends on the diagnostic decision model used by their clinician. The authors examined whether the relationship between diagnostic model and likelihood of meeting objective criteria is moderated by students’ postsecondary institution. They administered a comprehensive psychoeducational battery to 98 undergraduates receiving accommodations for SLD at 2-year public colleges, 4-year public universities, and 4-year private colleges. Most 4-year public university students failed to meet objective criteria for SLD. In contrast, most 4-year private college students met objective criteria based on significant ability–achievement discrepancies, and most 2-year public college students met objective criteria based on normative deficits in achievement and cognitive processing. Students who met objective criteria also differed significantly in degree of academic impairment. The authors’ findings indicate qualitative differences in SLD across postsecondary settings and have implications for the identification and mitigation of SLD in college students.</p>

<body>
<p>There is currently no consensus regarding an operational definition for specific learning disability (SLD) in college students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022219411400747">Fletcher, Lyon, Fuchs, &amp; Barnes, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022219411400747">Gregg, 2003</xref>). The Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022219411400747">IDEIA, 2004</xref>) and corresponding regulations, which provide guidelines for the assessment of SLD in children, do not apply to individuals enrolled in college (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022219411400747">Gregg, 2009a</xref>). The <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders–Fourth Edition</italic> (<italic>DSM-IV</italic>; American Psychiatric Association [APA], 1994) diagnostic criteria for learning disorders do apply to adults; however, they include the presence of ability–achievement discrepancies, which appears to lack validity as a means of identifying SLD in children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022219411400747">Hoskyn &amp; Swanson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0022219411400747">Stuebing et al., 2002</xref>) and adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0022219411400747">Swanson, 2009</xref>). Most recently, comprehensive neuropsychological models of SLD have been developed, which include the presence of normative deficits in academic achievement, underlying cognitive processing problems, and a history of academic impairment in their criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022219411400747">Flanagan, Ortiz, Alfonso, &amp; Dynda, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022219411400747">Goldstein &amp; Schwebach, 2009</xref>). However, these models have not gained widespread use among clinicians.</p>
<p>This lack of consensus has reduced the reliability of SLD identification in college students. Two students, assigned the same SLD label and awarded the same academic accommodations, may have different patterns of academic and cognitive ability, educational histories, and degrees of impairment. Two other students, one with and the other without SLD classification, may show similar levels of cognitive functioning and academic achievement. Indeed, recent research indicates that whether a college student meets objective criteria for SLD, and is given academic accommodations for this condition, depends largely on the assessment method and underlying operational definition of SLD used by his or her clinician (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0022219411400747">Proctor &amp; Prevatt, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0022219411400747">Sparks &amp; Lovett, 2009b</xref>). The presence or absence of the disorder, therefore, depends less on the characteristics of the individual student and more on the conceptualization of the clinician assigning the diagnostic label.</p>
<sec id="section1-0022219411400747">
<title>Reliability of SLD Identification Among University Students</title>
<p>Two large studies have documented the lack of reliability in SLD identification among college students. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0022219411400747">Proctor and Prevatt (2003)</xref> tested 170 college students referred to a university-based clinic for academic problems. They found that the percentage of students meeting criteria for SLD varied as a function of the diagnostic decision model that was used. Specifically, 46.5% of students displayed a simple (1 <italic>SD</italic>) ability–achievement discrepancy, 24.7% showed a significant (1.3 <italic>SD</italic>) discrepancy, and 33.1% had normatively low standard scores (i.e., &lt; 85) on at least one achievement domain. Similar results were obtained by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0022219411400747">Sparks and Lovett (2009b)</xref>, who reviewed the psychological evaluation documentation of 378 university students diagnosed with SLD. In their study, 41.9% of students showed a simple (1 <italic>SD</italic>) discrepancy, 23.8% showed a significant (1.5 <italic>SD</italic>) discrepancy, and 6.9% met <italic>DSM-IV</italic> criteria (i.e., significant discrepancy and normatively low achievement). In both studies, agreement among diagnostic models was low; different interpretative models identified different students as having SLD.</p>
<p>Furthermore, many college students receiving accommodations for SLD meet no objective criteria and display no normative deficits in academic achievement. In an early study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022219411400747">Ferri, Gregg, and Heggoy (1997)</xref> found that college students diagnosed with SLD showed no normative deficits in achievement; standard scores on measures of reading, spelling, and math fell within the normal range (<italic>M</italic> = 90–106). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0022219411400747">Sparks and Lovett (2009b)</xref> found that the majority (54.8%) of students receiving accommodations for SLD met no objective criteria for the disorder and earned average to above average standard achievement scores (<italic>M</italic> = 90–119). In all, 60% had no history of SLD before beginning college. In their review of the empirical literature, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0022219411400747">Sparks and Lovett (2009a)</xref> found that college students diagnosed with SLD showed no normative deficits in reading (<italic>M</italic> = 97.5, <italic>n</italic> = 994), math (<italic>M</italic> = 97.7, <italic>n</italic> = 830), or written language (<italic>M</italic> = 90.7, <italic>n</italic> = 776) overall.</p>
<p>These findings indicate that the diagnostic label <italic>SLD</italic>, when applied to college students, depends greatly on the diagnostic decision model used and may have little relationship to normative deficits in academic skills. Many college students classified with SLD appear to meet no criteria and show little objective evidence of impairment. However, these conclusions are based largely on samples of students enrolled in 4-year public universities. Is it possible that academic and cognitive functioning might be different for students enrolled at other types of postsecondary institutions?</p>

<title>SLD in Students Attending Community and Private Colleges</title>
<p>Most high school students with SLD who attend college enroll in 2-year public institutions rather than 4-year colleges or universities. Data from the National Longitudinal Transition Study–2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022219411400747">Gerber, 2009</xref>), which reflect a nationally representative sample of adolescents with disabilities, indicate that 33% of youth with SLD attend college within 2 years after high school graduation. Most (66%) students with SLD enroll in 2-year colleges rather than 4-year institutions. At least three factors might explain this apparent self-selection to 2-year colleges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022219411400747">Gregg, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022219411400747">2009b</xref>). First, the prevalence of SLD is significantly higher among elementary and secondary school students from low socioeconomic backgrounds than among middle-class students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022219411400747">Child Trends Data Bank, 2010</xref>). Adolescents from less affluent families who attend college may be more likely to enroll in community colleges, which are typically less expensive than 4-year universities. Second, most secondary students with SLD have histories of academic problems and current academic deficits. Furthermore, their scores on standardized entrance exams tend to be below average (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022219411400747">Gerber, 2009</xref>). These students may be more likely to enroll in 2-year colleges, which typically have lower admissions standards than 4-year universities. Third, adolescents with SLD may be more attracted to the smaller class sizes or support services for students with disabilities at 2-year colleges compared to 4-year institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022219411400747">Gregg, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022219411400747">2009b</xref>).</p>
<p>It is possible that students with SLD who attend 2-year public colleges might display a different pattern of cognitive ability and academic achievement scores than their counterparts at 4-year colleges and universities. Specifically, they may be more likely to meet objective criteria for SLD overall, to meet criteria based on normative deficits in academic achievement, and to have histories of academic problems beginning in childhood or adolescence.</p>
<p>A second group of students, largely ignored in the research literature, is those enrolled in highly selective, private, 4-year colleges. Although high school students with SLD disproportionately enroll in 2-year public colleges, the percentage of students receiving accommodations for SLD is greatest at 4-year, private liberal arts colleges. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0022219411400747">Vogel and colleagues (1998)</xref> analyzed data from a nationally representative survey of disability directors at postsecondary institutions. The overall prevalence of identified SLD among students was 0.7%; however, prevalence varied significantly by type of institution. Specifically, the prevalence of students receiving accommodations for SLD ranged from 0.65% at public universities to 1.27% at community colleges to 3.01% at highly selective, private colleges. Indeed, the prevalence of SLD approached 10% of the student body at some of the private liberal arts institutions.</p>
<p>Students attending highly selective private colleges may earn higher average cognitive ability scores than students attending other institutions. These higher cognitive ability scores might increase the likelihood that students would show significant discrepancies between their overall ability and academic achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022219411400747">Gregg, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022219411400747">Gregg, Coleman, &amp; Knight, 2003</xref>). Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022219411400747">Lovett and Sparks (2010)</xref> found that college students with above average cognitive ability scores (47.1%) were almost 3 times as likely to show significant ability–achievement discrepancies as students with cognitive ability scores within the average range (16.2%). Students receiving accommodations for SLD, who attend private colleges, may be described as both “gifted and learning disabled” (G/LD), a term usually reserved for students with above average cognitive ability and relative (but not normative) deficits in academic achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022219411400747">Mather &amp; Gerner, 2008</xref>). These students often earn achievement scores within the normal range and are not diagnosed until after beginning college, when coursework demands overtax their ability to compensate for their learning problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022219411400747">Gregg, Coleman, Davis, Lindstrom, &amp; Hartwig, 2006</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section3-0022219411400747">
<title>The Current Study</title>
<p>Emerging evidence, therefore, indicates a relationship between students’ likelihood of being diagnosed with SLD and the decision model used. Students attending predominantly 4-year public universities are more likely to meet criteria using the discrepancy model than approaches involving normatively low achievement. However, many university students do not meet any objective criteria whatsoever. The purpose of this study is to examine whether institutional setting might moderate the relationship between students’ likelihood of meeting objective criteria for SLD and the diagnostic decision model employed.</p>
<p>Like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0022219411400747">Sparks and Lovett (2009b)</xref>, we recruited students previously diagnosed with SLD and receiving academic accommodations for this condition. In this manner, we excluded from our study students experiencing academic difficulties for other reasons, such as psychosocial stress or other disabilities. Like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0022219411400747">Proctor and Prevatt (2003)</xref>, we administered the same psychoeducational battery to all students. In this manner, we could compare the same test scores across students and reduce measurement error as the result of instrumentation differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022219411400747">Kazdin, 2003</xref>). We also administered a comprehensive achievement battery to students to assess those domains of academic achievement identified in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022219411400747">IDEIA (2004)</xref> as areas of potential disability. Finally, our study extends previous research by including students from three different postsecondary settings: 4-year private liberal arts colleges, 4-year public universities, and 2-year public colleges.</p>
<p>As in previous studies, we expected a relationship between students’ likelihood of meeting objective criteria for SLD and the diagnostic decision model used. Furthermore, we expected institutional setting to moderate this relationship. Specifically, we expected students at 4-year private colleges to be most likely to meet criteria for SLD based on significant ability–achievement discrepancies. In contrast, we expected students at 2-year public colleges to be most likely to meet criteria for SLD based on assessment models whose components include normatively low achievement, cognitive processing problems, and a history of academic difficulties. Finally, we expected students at 4-year public universities to earn test scores falling somewhere between those of students at the other institutions, making them less likely than 4-year private college students to meet criteria based on ability–achievement discrepancies and less likely than 2-year public college students to meet criteria based on low achievement, processing problems, and history of impairment. Consequently, most students enrolled in 4-year public universities would fail to meet any objective criteria for SLD. Such findings would indicate qualitative differences in SLD across institutions.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>A total of 98 full-time undergraduate students (54% female) participated in this study. Ages ranged from 18 to 27 years. The mean age was 22.02 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 3.9 years). Ethnicities included White (78.6%), African American (13.3%), Asian American (5.1%), Latino (2.0%), and Native American (1.0%).</p>
<p>All students had been previously identified as having SLD and were receiving academic accommodations through their institution’s disability services office. Specifically, 34% had been diagnosed with reading disorder (RD) only, 31% with RD and disorder of written expression (DWE), 20% with mathematics disorder (MD) only, 13% with RD and MD, and 2% with DWE only. Of the students, 30% had also been diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.</p>
<p>Students were enrolled in (a) one of two highly selective, private liberal arts residential colleges (<italic>n</italic> = 33), (b) one of two public 4-year universities (<italic>n</italic> = 33), or (c) one of two public 2-year nonresidential (i.e., community) colleges (<italic>n</italic> = 32). All postsecondary institutions were located in Ohio. Average undergraduate enrollment was 1,943 for the private liberal arts colleges, 29,757 for the public 4-year universities, and 16,737 for the public 2-year (community) colleges. Average annual tuition and fees at the three types of institutions was $37,770, $8,793, and $3,337, respectively. Average acceptance rates at the three types of institutions were 34.5%, 70.0%, and 100.0%, respectively. Average composite ACT and SAT scores at the 4-year private colleges were 29 and 1,283, respectively. Average composite ACT and SAT scores at the 4-year public universities were 25 and 1,158, respectively. ACT and SAT scores were not required for 2-year public college students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0022219411400747">National Center for Education Statistics, 2010</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0022219411400747">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>Participants completed the <italic>Woodcock–Johnson III Tests of Cognitive Abilities and Achievement–Extended</italic> (WJ III; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0022219411400747">Woodcock, McGrew, &amp; Mather, 2001</xref>) as a measure of cognitive and academic functioning. The WJ III is an individually administered, norm-referenced psychoeducational battery frequently used to identify SLD. The extended Tests of Cognitive Abilities yield an overall measure of General Intellectual Ability (GIA) and composites that reflect seven components of cognitive processing included in the Cattell–Horn–Carroll (CHC) model: Comprehension-Knowledge (Gc), Long-Term Retrieval (Glr), Visual-Spatial Thinking (Gv), Auditory Processing (Ga), Fluid Reasoning (Gf), Processing Speed (Gs), and Short-Term Memory (Gsm). The extended Tests of Achievement yield a Total Achievement Index and composites that reflect the five possible areas of SLD recognized by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022219411400747">IDEIA (2004)</xref>: Basic Reading Skill, Reading Comprehension, Mathematics Calculation, Mathematics Reasoning, and Written Expression. The WJ III also permits discrepancy analysis between participants’ extended GIA and each dimension of achievement. All scores have means of 100 and standard deviations of 15.</p>
<p>Considerable data support the reliability and validity of the WJ III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022219411400747">Flanagan, Ortiz, Alfonso, &amp; Mascolo, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0022219411400747">McGrew &amp; Woodcock, 2001</xref>). Internal consistency estimates for composites fall above .90. One-year temporal stability estimates exceed .80 or .90 for all composites. Interrater reliability on subtests requiring examiner judgment ranges in the upper .90s. Factorial validity is supported by exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis indicating a relationship between composite scores and the CHC model. Evidence of convergent validity comes from correlations with other standardized measures of cognitive ability and academic achievement.</p>

<sec id="section7-0022219411400747">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Participants were recruited by disability directors at each institution. Inclusionary criteria were (a) previous diagnosis of RD, MD, and/or DWE, (b) documentation on file with disability office, (c) receiving academic accommodations for disability, and (d) full-time student status. Documentation of SLD varied by postsecondary institution; however, all institutions required a recent (i.e., within the previous 3–5 years) evaluation conducted by a qualified professional (e.g., psychologist, educational specialist) consisting of a comprehensive psychoeducational test battery. Furthermore, the report of the evaluation had to specify the diagnosis of SLD and include norm-referenced test scores. These requirements are consistent with principles outlined by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022219411400747">National Joint Committee on Learning Disabilities (2007)</xref>. Exclusionary criteria included any conditions that might interfere with standardized test administration (e.g., limited proficiency in English, visual impairment).</p>
<p>The percentage of undergraduate students receiving accommodations for SLDs was 5.3% at the private 4-year colleges, 1.1% at the public 4-year universities, and 2.4% at the public 2-year colleges. All students meeting criteria for the study were solicited by email, in writing, or in person by disability directors.</p>
<p>Participants were administered the WJ III by one of five research assistants trained by the first author, a licensed psychologist. Training consisted of formal instruction in standardized testing and scoring, practice administrations, and test protocol review (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0022219411400747">Wendling &amp; Mather, 2001</xref>). Test administration occurred at each participant’s college or university, in the disability office, testing center, or private study room in the library. Students were paid for their participation.</p>
<p>Each participant’s test scores were examined to determine whether he or she met criteria for SLD using three diagnostic decision models: (a) the discrepancy model, (b) the <italic>DSM-IV</italic> model, and (c) the comprehensive cognitive model of SLD.</p>
<sec id="section8-0022219411400747">
<title>Discrepancy model</title>
<p>Participants met criteria for SLD according to the discrepancy model if their score on any of the five achievement composites was at least 1.5 <italic>SD</italic> lower than their GIA extended standard score. This procedure reflects the traditional notion of ability–achievement discrepancy required by most school districts prior to IDEIA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022219411400747">Mather &amp; Schrank, 2003</xref>) and is the most commonly used method for identifying SLD in college students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022219411400747">Madaus &amp; Shaw, 2006</xref>). GIA extended scores reflect a weighting of cognitive subtest scores based on principal component analysis. GIA scores, therefore, are believed to provide a relatively unbiased estimate of general intelligence (g). GIA extended scores correlate from .71 to .76 with other cognitive ability composites that do not rely on such weightings, such as composites obtained from the <italic>Wechsler</italic> and <italic>Stanford–Binet</italic> intelligence tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0022219411400747">Schrank, Miller, Wendling, &amp; Woodcock, 2010</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0022219411400747">
<title>DSM-IV model</title>
<p>Participants met criteria for SLD according to the <italic>DSM-IV</italic> model if they (a) showed a significant ability–achievement discrepancy as defined by the discrepancy model and (b) earned a standard score less than 85 (16th percentile) on any of the five achievement composites. This procedure reflects the <italic>DSM-IV</italic> (APA, 2000) diagnostic criteria for learning disorders, namely, the presence of both significant ability–achievement discrepancy and significant impairment in at least one achievement domain. Although <italic>DSM-IV</italic> does not explicitly require a normative deficit in achievement, this criterion has been used by previous authors to operationally define the <italic>DSM-IV</italic> “impairment” criterion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022219411400747">Lovett &amp; Sparks, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0022219411400747">Proctor &amp; Prevatt, 2003</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0022219411400747">
<title>Comprehensive cognitive model</title>
<p>Recently, Flanagan and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022219411400747">Flanagan, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022219411400747">Flanagan, Ortiz, Alfonso, &amp; Dynda, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022219411400747">Flanagan, Ortiz, Alfonso, &amp; Mascolo, 2006</xref>) have developed an operational definition of SLD that incorporates many components of contemporary cognitive assessment and is based on CHC theory. Unlike other assessment approaches, their model does not include ability–achievement discrepancy as a criterion.</p>
<p>To be classified with SLD, participants must display a significant academic skill deficit in at least one achievement domain. According to the model, an absolute, not relative, deficit in achievement is a necessary component of SLD; without normative deficits in achievement, there is no objective evidence of disability and no need for academic accommodation. In this study, a standard score less than 85 on at least one of the five achievement composites meets this criterion.</p>
<p>Second, participants must show a significant cognitive deficit or processing problem that is theoretically or empirically related to their achievement deficit. Including the presence of an underlying cognitive processing problem in the criteria for SLD has a long history; it is based on the conceptualization of SLD as a psychological processing disorder and is a component of many contemporary approaches to SLD identification. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022219411400747">Flanagan, Ortiz, Alfonso, and Mascolo (2006)</xref>, problems with language development and lexical knowledge (Gc), phonological awareness and processing (Ga), and rapid automatic naming (Glr) are most often associated with reading and writing deficits. In contrast, problems with fluid reasoning (Gf), working memory (Gsm), and perceptual speed (Gs) are most often associated with mathematics deficits. However, the authors acknowledge that other cognitive processing problems can underlie these disorders. Indeed, subsequent research has identified other associations between cognitive processing and achievement deficits in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022219411400747">Dehn, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022219411400747">Goldstein &amp; Schwebach, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022219411400747">Gregg, 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0022219411400747">Semrud-Clikeman &amp; Fine, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0022219411400747">Swanson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0022219411400747">Wolf, Schreiber, &amp; Wasserstein, 2008</xref>). Consequently, in this study, a standard score less than 85 on any cognitive ability composite would indicate a cognitive processing problem and meet this criterion.</p>
<p>To meet the third criterion, participants must show a pattern of academic and cognitive functioning that is consistent with SLD. Specifically, normative deficits in achievement and cognitive processing must be circumscribed, that is, they must exist within an otherwise normal cognitive profile. This criterion differentiates individuals with circumscribed cognitive deficits (i.e., SLD) from individuals with pervasive cognitive deficits (e.g., mental retardation). In this study, participants meet this criterion if the majority of their cognitive composite scores are within normal limits (≥ 85).</p>
<p>Finally, participants must display “significant or substantial academic failure or other restrictions/limitations in daily life” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022219411400747">Flanagan, Ortiz, Alfonso, &amp; Dynda, 2006</xref>, p. 823). In clinical settings, college students with SLD typically show real-world impairment in academic achievement, as evidenced by poor school performance or a history of academic difficulties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022219411400747">Gerber, 2009</xref>). In this study, students meet this criterion if they reported an onset of any academic difficulties prior to beginning college. Evidence of academic difficulties might include (a) repeating a grade, (b) failing a course because of reading-, writing-, or math-related difficulties, (c) being referred for psychological testing to rule out suspected learning disabilities, or (d) receiving special education or other academic instruction outside the regular classroom environment because of academic deficits.</p>
<p>In summary, individuals meet criteria for the comprehensive cognitive model only if they display all four components of the model: low achievement, underlying cognitive processing problems, circumscribed deficits, and a self-reported history of academic difficulties. Exclusionary criteria include sociocultural factors or physical and psychiatric conditions that might better account for the individual’s learning problems.</p>

<title>Demographic Differences Across Institutions</title>
<p>We conducted a series of analyses, using SPSS, examining differences in demographic variables as a function of institution type.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The purpose of our study was to examine the possibility that institutional setting might moderate the relationship between college students’ likelihood of meeting objective criteria for SLD and the decision model used to identify the condition. Such evidence would suggest qualitative differences in students classified with SLD across postsecondary institutions.</p>
<p>As in previous studies, we found a significant overall relationship between diagnostic model and the number of students meeting objective criteria for SLD. The greatest percentage of students was classified using the discrepancy model (36.7%), followed by the comprehensive cognitive (23.5%) and <italic>DSM-IV</italic> models (14.3%). The discrepancy model may have been most likely to identify college students as having SLD because, by definition, it requires students to show only a relative (not normative) deficit in academic skills and favors students with average or above average cognitive ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022219411400747">Gregg, 2009a</xref>). Operational definitions that include normative deficits in academic ability identify fewer college students with SLD because students who evidence such normative deficits may be less likely to attend college (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022219411400747">Gerber, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Our results are also consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0022219411400747">Sparks &amp; Lovett, 2009a</xref>) suggesting that many college students classified with SLD do not meet any objective criteria for the disorder. Specifically, 46.9% of students in our study showed neither a significant ability–achievement discrepancy nor normative deficits in achievement. These findings indicate that many clinicians may base their diagnosis of SLD on factors unrelated to these objective criteria, such as inspection of intraindividual discrepancy scores, use of profile analysis, or reliance on clinical judgment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022219411400747">Gregg, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022219411400747">Hagin, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0022219411400747">McCoach, Kehle, Bray, &amp; Siegle, 2004</xref>). Use of intraindividual discrepancy scores and profile analysis has been criticized for their lack of reliability and inability to differentiate individuals with and without learning problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022219411400747">Fletcher et al., 2007</xref>). Although clinical judgment certainly plays a role in diagnosis, its overreliance can compromise the reliability of SLD identification. To the extent clinicians rely on unreliable diagnostic approaches or minimize objective criteria in reaching diagnostic decisions, the SLD label loses its ability to aid in professional communication, to guide interventions, and to facilitate evidence-based research.</p>
<p>Our study extends our knowledge of SLD in college students by demonstrating differences in the number of students meeting objective criteria for SLD across postsecondary settings. Students enrolled in 4-year private (63.6%) and 2-year public colleges (62.5%) were more likely to meet criteria for SLD than students enrolled at 4-year public universities (33.3%). More importantly, our tests of moderation indicate that the effect of assessment method on the number of students classified with SLD depends on institutional setting.</p>
<p>Students receiving accommodations at 2-year public colleges were most likely to meet objective criteria for SLD using the comprehensive cognitive model. Approximately one half (53.6%) showed normative deficits in academic achievement and underlying cognitive processing problems, but comparatively few displayed significant ability–achievement discrepancies (18.8%).</p>
<p>The magnitude of these academic deficits was generally one standard deviation below the mean, at approximately the 16th percentile. Achievement scores on the WJ III within this range correspond to academic skills similar to those evidenced by students enrolled in the 6th through 8th grades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0022219411400747">McGrew &amp; Woodcock, 2001</xref>). Consequently, these students likely experience significant difficulty performing college-level academic tasks without accommodations. Furthermore, most of the 2-year college students displayed cognitive processing problems in addition to normative deficits in achievement. Finally, almost all (93%) of the 2-year public college students receiving accommodations for SLD reported experiencing academic problems in childhood or adolescence. Although self-report data are susceptible to cognitive biases and distortions in recall, the available data suggest that most of these students had a history of academic difficulties before college.</p>
<p>In many ways, the 2-year public college students who met objective criteria for SLD in our sample reflect the traditional scientific and legal conceptualizations of SLD. First, SLD has always been understood as a disorder characterized by learning impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022219411400747">Flanagan, Ortiz, Alfonso, &amp; Dynda, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022219411400747">Gregg, 2009b</xref>). Although experts disagree whether the learning deficit should be relative or normative, this impairment should interfere with daily life activities and, in the case of students, academic achievement. Consequently, evidence of learning deficits that interfere with functioning is a component of many contemporary models of SLD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022219411400747">Brueggemann, Kamphaus, &amp; Dombrowski, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022219411400747">Flanagan, Ortiz, Alfonso, &amp; Dynda, 2006</xref>). The community college students in our study who met criteria for SLD clearly experienced difficulty performing academic tasks. Furthermore, their impairment was relative to the general population of young adults, not to other high-achieving college students.</p>
<p>Second, both professional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022219411400747">Learning Disabilities Roundtable, 2002</xref>) and legal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0022219411400747">Taymans, 2009</xref>) standards attribute the academic deficits shown by individuals with SLD to underlying cognitive processing problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022219411400747">Dehn, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022219411400747">Mather, 2009</xref>). Adults with SLD use different and more inefficient cognitive processing strategies than adults without SLD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022219411400747">Gregg et al., 2008</xref>). Furthermore, the existence of cognitive processing deficits appears to differentiate adults with and without SLD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0022219411400747">Swanson, 2009</xref>). The existence of one or more cognitive processing deficits, therefore, is necessary to identify SLD as a disorder of “basic psychological processes” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022219411400747">IDEIA, 2004</xref>) and differentiate it from other causes of low academic achievement such as impoverished educational experiences or socioeconomic disadvantage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022219411400747">Hale, Kaufman, Naglieri, &amp; Kavale, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022219411400747">Kavale &amp; Spaulding, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0022219411400747">Semrud-Clikeman &amp; Fine, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Third, the academic and cognitive deficits shown by the community college students in our study were circumscribed. From their first conceptualization, learning disabilities have been viewed as “specific” to a limited number of cognitive domains; they do not reflect pervasive deficits in cognitive functioning. For this reason, SLD is often viewed as a disorder characterized by “unexpected underachievement,” the existence of circumscribed cognitive deficits in the presence of otherwise intact processing integrities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022219411400747">Kavale, Kaufman, Naglieri, &amp; Hale, 2005</xref>). Although the average cognitive ability scores of community college students meeting objective criteria were rather low, this average reflects the wide range of circumscribed deficits shown by individual students who met criteria for SLD according to the comprehensive cognitive model.</p>
<p>Finally, SLD is usually conceptualized as a developmental disorder, which typically emerges during childhood or early adolescence and can compromise academic achievement over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022219411400747">Dombrowski, Kamphaus, &amp; Reynolds, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0022219411400747">Semrud-Clikeman &amp; Fine, 2008</xref>). Although it is possible that SLD might not be identified until late adolescence or early adulthood, especially among individuals with well-developed compensatory strategies, most individuals with SLD report an onset of academic problems earlier in life. For example, adults with SLD typically report the onset of their reading or mathematics problems sometime during elementary school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022219411400747">Krueger &amp; Grafman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0022219411400747">Sherman, 2008</xref>). The community college students in our study reported this early onset.</p>
<p>In contrast, the students in our study who were enrolled at private liberal arts colleges were most likely to meet objective criteria for SLD based on a significant ability–achievement discrepancy. Approximately 64% of these students showed a significant discrepancy, but comparatively few displayed normative deficits in academic skills necessary to meet criteria outlined in the <italic>DSM-IV</italic> (12.1%) or comprehensive cognitive (3.0%) models. Indeed, the average achievement scores of these students were within the normal range (Total Achievement = 101, 53rd percentile), indicating no evidence of normative impairment. In contrast, average cognitive ability scores were generally within the high end of the normal range (GIA = 112, 79th percentile), indicating well-developed cognitive skills.</p>
<p>The combination of their relatively high cognitive ability scores and relatively low academic achievement scores would lead many clinicians to consider these students as G/LD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022219411400747">Lovett &amp; Sparks, 2010</xref>). Although G/LD is not an official diagnostic category in any nosological system, several researchers have described individuals with characteristics of both giftedness and learning disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022219411400747">Brody &amp; Mills, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0022219411400747">McCoach, Kehle, Bray, &amp; Siegle, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0022219411400747">Nielsen, 2002</xref>). Although it is relatively rare, there are instances of adults who show both above average cognitive ability (FSIQ &gt; 120) and normative deficits in at least one achievement domain. However, the G/LD label is most frequently assigned to individuals who earn above average cognitive ability scores and show relative deficits in academic skills. Some authors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022219411400747">Gregg, Coleman, Lindstrom, &amp; Lee, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022219411400747">Mather, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022219411400747">Mather &amp; Gregg, 2006</xref>) argue that these individuals need not display normative deficits in achievement; by relying on their strong cognitive abilities, hard work, and perseverance, these individuals can compensate for their learning problems and develop academic skills within the normal range. Like most of the liberal arts students in our study, many individuals classified as G/LD are not identified until after beginning college, when “the academic demands begin to exceed (their) ability to compensate” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022219411400747">Brody &amp; Mills, 2004</xref>, p. 77).</p>
<p>Critics argue that SLD classification should not be given to adults who demonstrate academic skills in the normal range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022219411400747">Gordon, Lewandowski, &amp; Keiser, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022219411400747">Lovett, Gordon, &amp; Lewandowski, 2009</xref>). First, critics argue, federal legislation requires the presence of normative, not relative, deficits in academic functioning. According to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022219411400747">Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (2008)</xref>, disability refers to “a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of an individual.” Guidelines provided by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022219411400747">Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (2002)</xref> further state that the limitation must “amount to a significant restriction when compared to the abilities of the average person in the general population.” Relative deficits, which do not impair the major life activities of most people, do not meet this standard.</p>
<p>Critics also argue that relative deficits in achievement are not sufficient to justify the provision of academic accommodations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022219411400747">Gordon et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022219411400747">Lovett &amp; Lewandowski, 2006</xref>). Given the scarcity and cost of academic support services, their provision to students who show relative deficits might mean the restriction of services to students with normative deficits, that is, students who need these services to successfully complete college-level work.</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that the <italic>DSM-IV</italic> model yielded the most consistent prevalence rates across postsecondary institutions. Although the discrepancy model favored students with higher cognitive functioning, and the comprehensive cognitive model favored students with lower cognitive functioning, the <italic>DSM-IV</italic> interpretative model was less influenced by students’ cognitive ability. However, many professionals would likely consider the <italic>DSM-IV</italic> model too conservative; approximately 80% of students in our sample receiving accommodations for SLD would not meet criteria according to this model. Furthermore, the <italic>DSM-IV</italic> model is based on the presence of significant ability–achievement discrepancies, a criterion that may have limited validity as a means of identifying SLD in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0022219411400747">Swanson, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Although professionals do not agree on an operational definition of SLD in college students at this time, adoption of such a definition would likely result in considerable changes to the prevalence of SLD at some institutions. An operational definition based on significant ability–achievement discrepancy would likely decrease the number of students at 2-year public colleges with SLD. Furthermore, exclusive reliance on the discrepancy criteria to identify SLD would deprive most individuals who show normative deficits in academic achievement and cognitive processing the accommodations they need to complete their degrees. In contrast, an operational definition based on normative deficits in academic achievement and underlying cognitive processing problems would virtually eliminate SLD classification among students at selective colleges and universities.</p>
<p>At the very least, professionals may wish to specify whether the deficits shown by students classified with SLD are normative or relative. Specification might help clinicians and disability directors at postsecondary institutions identify accommodations and plan interventions to improve students’ academic functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022219411400747">Dehn, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022219411400747">Gregg, 2009a</xref>). For example, interventions designed to improve the cognitive processing of college students with SLD might be particularly useful for individuals who meet criteria according to the comprehensive cognitive model but may be ineffective for students who show significant ability–achievement discrepancies but no cognitive processing problems. In contrast, academic skill development workshops may be especially useful for students with SLD based on ability–achievement discrepancies, to help these individuals acquire the skills necessary to achieve their academic potentials.</p>
<p>Specification would also allow researchers to identify more homogeneous groups of college students with SLD for their studies. For example, studies involving children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0022219411400747">Swanson &amp; Hoskyn, 1999</xref>) and adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0022219411400747">Swanson, 2001</xref>) indicate that the magnitude of the discrepancy between cognitive ability and reading achievement moderates the efficacy of treatment; youth with larger discrepancies show lower effect sizes in treatment whereas youth with circumscribed deficits in both ability and reading achievement respond most favorably to interventions. Similar research, involving homogeneous groups of adults with SLD, is necessary to identify possible Ability × Treatment interactions in this population.</p>
<p>Of course, professionals can continue to rely on the myriad operational definitions of the disorder and corresponding assessment strategies, which would likely ensure that the number of students who receive accommodations for SLD, yet meet no objective criteria for the disorder, remains high. This practice would also perpetuate the problem of low reliability in SLD classification among college students and open clinicians and postsecondary schools up to criticism that the SLD label offers unfair advantages to students with the sophistication and financial resources to seek out and acquire SLD classification.</p>
<p>Our study is limited by its reliance on relatively few students from each of the three institutions who participated in testing. Although the percentage of participants who met objective criteria for SLD was similar to those obtained in previous studies involving larger samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0022219411400747">Proctor &amp; Prevatt, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0022219411400747">Sparks &amp; Lovett, 2009b</xref>), it is possible that our findings would be different if we were able to administer comprehensive psychoeducational batteries to more students.</p>
<p>Our study is also limited by the fact that we examined the components of students’ cognitive abilities assessed by only the WJ III. Although the domains we assessed reflect many components of the CHC model, we did not assess some dimensions of cognitive processing (e.g., rapid naming) believed to be relevant to all learning problems (e.g., basic reading skills; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022219411400747">Daniels, 2008</xref>). It is possible more students would have shown cognitive processing problems if we could have assessed cognitive skills not included in the WJ III. Ideally, our methods would have resembled the assessment approach used by clinicians who select tests based on each student’s presenting academic difficulties. By relying on a common psychoeducational battery, we sacrificed flexibility in assessment for standardization. Finally, we did not assess disabilities related to oral language. Although none of our participants reported a history of oral language problems, it is possible that some might have met objective criteria for SLD in the areas of listening comprehension or oral expression.</p>
<p>A third limitation concerns external validity. Although our study extends the research literature on college students with SLD by examining students at three different postsecondary institutions, we do not know whether the institutions that we included in our study represent other 4-year private, 4-year public, and 2-year public colleges, respectively. Furthermore, we cannot be certain that the students who participated in our study from these institutions are representative of other students with documented or undocumented SLD at their respective schools. A final limitation lies in the lack of a nondisabled comparison group at each institution. In future studies, students with SLD not only could be compared across institutions but also could be compared to their classmates without SLD to provide additional control.</p>
<p>As it stands, professionals have erected a veritable “Tower of Babel” in the field of SLD research involving college students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022219411400747">Flanagan, Ortiz, Alfonso, &amp; Dynda, 2006</xref>). The term <italic>SLD</italic> does not convey the same meaning to all (or perhaps even most) researchers and clinicians. Students assigned the same diagnostic label across institutions appear to have different cognitive and academic abilities, histories, and degrees of impairment. If the science of learning disability research and the practice of SLD identification and mitigation are to advance, a common understanding of this disorder must be developed. Our research provides a first glimpse of the repercussions such a common definition might have on the prevalence of SLD at various postsecondary institutions.</p>
