<p>New Labour’s distinctive variant of the restructuring of UK public service employee relations is worthy of serious reappraisal. Two volumes on this subject have now appeared virtually simultaneously, and from the same publisher. Each is a valedictory examination of the nature and tenacity of changes wrought on the public sector by the 1997–2010 Labour governments, with the embryonic changes being introduced by the Conservative-Liberal Democrat Coalition since 2010 affording opportunities for counterpoint and reflection. Extrapolating the implications of Coalition policy is necessarily tentative, with Corby and Symon’s text incorporating developments to the end of 2010 and Bach and Kessler to spring 2011. However, the two books are really trying to fulfil rather different functions, so superficial similarities would prove deceptive. Corby and Symon is closer to a ‘traditional’ analysis of key employee relations developments and themes in the New Labour era. Bach and Kessler use Labour’s reform of the state sector as an illustrative backdrop to integrate theory on the relationships between employee relations, broadly defined, and public service change.</p>
<p>To take Corby and Symon first, this edited volume can be regarded as a successor to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0950017012458020">Corby and White (1999)</xref>, which benchmarked the opposite end of the New Labour project in power and with which Corby and Symon’s text shares a structure focusing on public sector contexts, key issues and actors. As one would expect, topics such as trade unions, public service pay, the equalities agenda and the economic environment facing public services receive due airing. Within the three themes, there are some differences in content from the earlier volume, reflecting more recent areas of development. Notably, for example, public service employment relations in the UK are set in international comparison with other West European countries (by Gold and Veersma); Cunningham investigates the implications of increased third sector involvement for employee relations in public services; Bach ponders the contradictory implications of New Labour’s expansion of assistant supporting roles in services such as education, health and the police; Graham provides a stimulating discussion of the neglected topic of using consultants in government.</p>
<p>The chapters vary in tone and approach; while all provide overviews of their topics, some also draw on primary research and, in several cases, contributors raise prescient considerations for policy. Corby makes a convincing case that New Labour’s equality goals were unlikely to be achievable without more widespread resort to positive discrimination policies. Cunningham emphasizes the third sector’s somewhat woeful employment relations record and voluntary organizations’ dependence on the state: both factors are rather ominous in view of the ‘Big Society’ agenda. A highlight is Shaoul’s caustic dissection of Labour’s public finance policies, of which the long-term costs to public sector bodies (and to all UK citizens) of reliance on funding new projects through the Private Finance Initiative and the even larger sums involved in socializing the risks to the finance sector from 2007 onwards are the most astounding.</p>
<p>The space permitted the authors in edited volumes of this type to develop their themes often proves too compressed to do justice to the subjects covered. To some extent, this is true here. For example, it might have been useful to develop analysis further on the international dimensions of austerity. Also, more scrutiny is deserved of the implications for fragmenting workforce structure of the ‘shadow state’: a hidden, but expanding, world of outsourced functions and predominantly unorganized workers. By contrast, valuable space disappears in some chapters recapping largely familiar pre-1997 public sector history, such as in relation to pay or trade unions, when pages might have been devoted to exploration of more contemporary developments. Nevertheless, this text encapsulates succinctly the main employee relations innovations in the state sector during Labour’s years in power.</p>
<p>Bach and Kessler have rather different motives for analysing New Labour’s reforms, using them as an exemplar to facilitate combining the concerns of public management and employee relations literatures. For the authors, ‘employee relations’ is an umbrella term, encompassing three domains of industrial, employment and work relations. ‘Industrial relations’ is used in its traditional sense to refer to collective relationships, ‘employment relations’ denotes work organization and job and role design, while the term ‘work relations’ refers to the institutional regulation of employment relationships, through such mechanisms as reward strategies and the management of performance or equalities, for example. Bach and Kessler’s precision in usage of key terms often deployed as synonyms exemplifies their attention to detail in this book. The authors develop a model of ‘upstream’ pressures for change in public services leading New Labour to pursue a distinctive ‘downstream’ employee relations agenda, taking in reforms to the triumvirate of industrial, employment and work relations. Bach and Kessler’s model may be too uni-directional, and might reasonably incorporate more scope for feedback loops or mutual interactions. Thus, for example, the Conservatives’ introduction of competitive tendering into public services in the 1980s could be interpreted <italic>primarily</italic> as an industrial relations policy to cow public sector authorities and unions in the absence (initially) of significant ‘upstream’ commercial pressure for marketization.</p>
<p>Bach and Kessler disagree with those who interpret the New Labour ‘modernization’ project as mere neo-liberal restructuring. Labour’s changes incorporated a particular model of public management, influenced by network governance, political imperatives to retain key groups of voters’ attachment to the welfare state and a perceived need to repair the causes of significant examples of service failure. For the authors, Labour’s willingness to underpin the sums expended on reform in the three domains through construction of new institutional architectures, including bodies to oversee far-reaching changes to equalities, training, performance management, pay-setting and so on, marks it out as genuinely distinctive. Bach and Kessler document in considerable detail the variable extents and effectiveness of reform in the three domains. They draw out well the deleterious impacts for engagement of the public sector workforce of Labour’s simultaneous pursuit of ‘soft’ and ‘hard’ approaches towards staff. Some reforms proved too rushed to be effective, although the authors could arguably have given greater emphasis to the baleful cumulative impact of constant organizational restructurings. A useful concluding review of the Coalition Government’s active forays into further public sector change permits the authors to assess the essential fragility of some of Labour’s reforms. Overall, Bach and Kessler have produced an important book, which extends theoretical development in public sector employee relations and successfully blends literatures on managing service and workforce change. All will have to engage with this text as a reference point, whether or not they agree with its thesis.</p>
<p>A number of observations apply to both volumes. Each tends to treat the Labour period as a block, with few distinctions being drawn between the Blair and (admittedly short-lived) Brown administrations. There were certainly different accentuations between the two, not least in the two premiers’ emphases on ‘choice’ and ‘competition’ in public services and a much more restrictive financial framework under Brown’s leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0950017012458020">Griffiths, 2009</xref>). Perhaps more significantly, regional devolution – one of Labour’s more successful innovations – has diversified public services and employee relations increasingly, but the greater heterogeneity resonates little here. More could be said about the contradictions of, and comparisons between, different narratives of public service reform between regional and central authorities that emerged in the Labour era. Some of the organizational and policy changes discussed by Bach and Kessler do not apply beyond England. Corby and Symon’s text notes in passing, for example, the impetus of regional assemblies to the public sector equality duties (p. 113) and evidence of new union alliances with the devolved authorities (p. 198), but these themes are not developed further. In the future, texts on change within the UK state will need to be more sensitive to the partial fragmentation that is unfolding.</p>
<p>These volumes, although differing in style, approach and intention, can be recommended as analyses of the employee relations consequences of New Labour for the public services. Both books are well written, although I noticed in each a small number of proof-reading and referencing errors that might make one query the closeness of editorial checking being exercised at Palgrave Macmillan. A danger for both volumes – more so for Corby and Symon – is that they may date relatively quickly as the Coalition rushes into a new restructuring – more accurately, de-structuring – trajectory. Hopefully, the publisher will permit both sets of authors the opportunity to refine their analyses in new editions to take account of the swiftly changing environment.</p>
