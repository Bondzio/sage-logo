<abstract>
<p>In the past years, there has been growing awareness about childhood onset multiple sclerosis (MS) and the relevance of psychosocial aspects such as cognitive disturbances, fatigue and depression in this population. We describe a case of a 16-year-old patient with relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) who presented at our clinic with severe fatigue symptoms and who underwent repeated neuropsychological examinations. A sudden significant slowing indicated a new relapse while neurological examination did not. This case highlights the high sensitivity and clinical relevance of neuropsychological testing in patients with juvenile MS even in the context of treatment decisions.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Children and adolescents with multiple sclerosis (MS) constitute approximately 5% of the overall MS population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458512450355">1</xref></sup> Similarities to but also differences from adult MS have been reported regarding the development of clinical symptoms, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) abnormalities as well as psychosocial aspects such as cognition, fatigue and mood.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458512450355">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458512450355"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1352458512450355">3</xref></sup> Cognitive impairment in domains well known to be affected in adult MS was previously reported in 41% of patients with paediatric MS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1352458512450355">3</xref></sup> In addition, some 30% of those patients were diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458512450355">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458512450355">4</xref></sup> These psychosocial abnormalities are of high clinical relevance in a population where the brain is still developing, when myelination has not yet completed and personality is consolidating. Cognitive functioning is one major prerequisite for normal intellectual development and success in school. We here report the case of a 16-year-old boy with relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) in whom a structured neuropsychological assessment indicated a relapse which may have been missed otherwise. We will discuss the clinical implications of such neuropsychological findings.</p>

<title>Case report</title>
<p>A 16-year-old MS patient was assessed at our clinic to clarify whether MS-related fatigue contributed to his school problems and an extreme form of exhaustion. First symptoms indicating a demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system (CNS) occurred at the age of 11 when he experienced an extreme form of physical and mental exhaustion accompanied by severe headache for three weeks. During this time he was unable to attend school and stayed in bed most of the time. After a severe relapse at the age of 15, the boy experienced weakness in his right leg leading to a fall at school. Further, he reported weakness of his right hand and paraesthesia in his right extremities. Again, an extreme form of physical and mental exhaustion accompanied the symptoms, which lasted for three months. Brain MRI showed multiple as well as contrast-enhancing lesions indicating an active demyelinating CNS disorder. At this time a treatment with Interferon-Beta-1a was started. During six months of treatment, he experienced three new relapses accompanied by gait ataxia, dysarthria and exhaustion. Brain MRI showed a significant increase in lesion load and new contrast-enhancing lesions left parietal. Multiple new lesions were also found in the spinal cord but were at the time of MRI examination not contrast enhancing. At this time his Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score was 4.0. Due to the persistent disease activity, relapses and disease progression in terms of his EDSS score, he was switched to Natalizumab. After one year, the clinical situation had stabilized, he had experienced no further relapses and his EDSS score was 3.0.</p>
<p>Since severe exhaustion was remaining and actually affecting school performance, he was referred to our clinic to test whether he suffered from MS-related fatigue. A neuropsychological examination was performed including quality-of-life instruments, depression and fatigue scales as well as several tests for cognitive functioning and intelligence. A detailed description of the applied test-battery is provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1352458512450355">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<p>No pathological findings were detectable in the assessed cognitive domains memory, attention, information processing speed, executive functioning and mental flexibility. Intelligence was high with a score at the 77th percentile. Self-reported quality of life was below the normal range and fatigue was considerably increased, indicating clinically relevant results. The depression score was high but below the usual cut-off indicating clinically relevant results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1352458512450355">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Due to the high depression and fatigue scores, the boy was re-examined two weeks later. At this follow-up visit, he self-reported not feeling well and having minor balance problems.</p>
<p>The neuropsychological profile of the follow-up visit (parallel versions were applied if available) revealed a non-significant performance decrease in verbal short-term memory, but a clinically meaningful decline in the performance of the alertness test, a measure for basic attention and information processing speed. Here, a decrease in performance was found, indicating severe slowing (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1352458512450355">Figure 1</xref>). In addition, fatigue and depression symptoms worsened compared to baseline.</p>

<p>The striking cognitive slowing together with the self-report of not feeling well and being extremely exhausted prompted a neurological referral. The neurological examination showed a stable EDSS of 3.0. Due to the cognitive abnormality, an MRI was performed showing three new T2 hyperintense lesions as compared to the previous MRI four months earlier, but no contrast-enhancing lesions.</p>
<p>Due to the acute change in alertness performance, the obvious subjective feeling of not being well and minor balance problems, we decided to consider the new symptoms as a clinically meaningful relapse and treated the patient with a three-day course of intravenous methylprednisolone. Three weeks later, the EDSS proved to be stable and the patient reported a subjective improvement of his physical and mental condition. This was confirmed by disappearance of balance problems and by stabilisation of his cognitive profile. However, alertness performance remained deficient and depression as well as fatigue symptoms did not improve. The boy was followed up neuropsychologically after three months. While all cognitive domains were back to normal, a total recovery of alertness performance was not reached after three months.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The initial neuropsychological examination of the boy revealed normal intelligence, normal cognitive performance, but clinically relevant fatigue and depression. Re-examination two weeks later revealed that almost all cognitive parameters remained stable except the performance in the alertness task. This task consists of a “tonic” and “phasic” part. The tonic aspect measures sustained attention and speed of response (button press when target cue appears). The phasic aspect measures the ability to profit from a cue before the target appears to facilitate a faster reaction. Both conditions focus on response speed. When we re-examined the patient, he showed a relevant increase in reaction times when performing this basic attention test. We considered this result together with the balance problems as an indication of an acute relapse. The MRI performed the same day, however, did not show contrast-enhancing active lesions. However, the fact that three new lesions had developed within a follow-up period of only four months indicated disease activity. The patient reported physical and cognitive improvement after corticosteroid pulse therapy, which was reflected by a stabilisation of his cognitive performance.</p>
<p>In accordance with the literature on adult MS,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1352458512450355">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1352458512450355">7</xref></sup> processing speed seems to be one of the most vulnerable and sensitive cognitive domains in paediatric MS as well. Of importance to mention is that performance on the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) was not pathological, pointing to the necessity of choosing a test measuring pure information processing speed without aspects of working memory. Of clinical interest and relevance is the time frame of recovery in this cognitive domain. The boy was not yet back to normal after three months, indicating that recovery on the cognitive speed component may take longer.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this case report demonstrates the utility of neuropsychological testing in children and adolescents with MS even in the context of guiding treatment decisions.</p>
