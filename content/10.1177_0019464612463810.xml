<p>For quite some time, historians have shown an interest in studying the growth and development of international trade between Europe and Asia since the early modern period. The preoccupation seems to be with Europe’s expanding trade networks in Asia pointing to the hegemonic influence of European trade on the Indian economy. Contrasting perspectives of Indian historians like Sushil Chaudhuri, Ashin Dasgupta and others have indicated Indian merchants’ (and Bengal merchants’) competitive role in the overland trade of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. However, scant attention has been given to the Asiatic dispensation in which the Indian merchants also played a collaborative role.</p>
<p>Only recently did this approach change. A selective section of historians have focussed on ‘colonies of Indian merchants’ in Central Asia and the Trans-Caucasus that was the pivot of imperial geopolitics in the nineteenth century. Arup Banerji shares this view and retraces patterns of early contacts along obscure locations in British Indian north-western territories and extensive networks in Russian Central Asia in his book <italic>Old Routes-North Indian Nomads and Bankers in Afghan, Uzbek and Russian Lands</italic> (Gurgaon: Three Essays Collective), 2011. The book deals with the theatres and actors in this Asiatic trade, especially in the trans-Himalayan region in which the principal participants were India, Russia, the khanates of Bukhara, Khiva and Kokand and Persia. While the senior group of India’s economic historians, whose ideas Banerji adopts, have shown the <bold>bifurcation</bold> of India’s oceanic trade in the direction of Delhi-Agra and the Gangetic coast, Banerji shows that India’s overland trade <bold>trifurcated</bold> in three directions: (a) north western frontier, covering Sind, Baluchistan, Punjab and conducted via Kandahar, Kabul and Kashmir (b) north eastern frontier covering Awadh, Bengal, Assam and ties with Nepal, Tibet, Sikkim and Bhutan and (c) eastern frontier, beyond the frontiers of Burma and further with western China, Siam, Shan and Karen states.</p>
<p>Major attention has been given to the indigenous mechanisms of trade and the activities of Indian traders and bankers that often took the form of inter-personal manoeuvrings across British India’s northern and western frontiers. Banerji takes a northern gaze to show the engagement of Indian merchant communities like the Khatris and Shikarpuris from Multan and the Afghan Pashtun tribal groups, that is, the Powindas in trading ventures <bold>across</bold> northern and western sectors. Their mercantile missions were often patronised by the British India Company for specific reasons—that is, military expansion in the Sind which led to ‘situating’ of the Multanis as commercial actors in the towns of the Central Asian khanates. Banerji’s book not only reconfirms the extensive research on Shikarpuris and Multanis done by Stephen Frederick Dale, Claude Markovits and others, but also brings in the third community under closer scrutiny, that is, the Powindas as Afghan carriers of trade.</p>
<p>The description of the activities of Lohani horse traders who were involved in Indo-Central Asian commerce since the time of Emperor Babur leaves a lasting impression. By the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, Indian merchant communities became permanent residents in Tashkent, Orenburg and Astrakhan, thriving on high-interest loans, grain-trade, trade in gems, textiles and horses which resulted in inflow of bullions to South Asia’s advantage and by deploying bills of exchange (<italic>hundi</italic>) as credit. The generic name ‘Multani’ not only refers to merchants from Punjab, but also <italic>banias</italic> from Rajasthan and Gujarat. Banerji’s book is filled with numerous data about such intricate business connections, pointing to the success stories of Shikarpuri bankers who, originally belonging to a hunting (<italic>shikar</italic>) retreat of the Dauputra clan of 1617, functioned through their own middlemen and networks spread all over their western and southern marts in the north-western sector. How these thriving communities began to disappear in the late nineteenth century due to protectorate arrangements or establishment of Soviet control are intriguing and tragic episodes of a success story that have not been dealt with in the book.</p>
<p>Banerji’s book deals with collaborative networks between the East India Company and its Indian interlocutors, analyses how the Company’s trade ambitions and geopolitical interests resulted in special expeditions which Banerji describes as ‘commercial intelligence catering to military and trade expansion in the Indus’. Specific cases that Banerji deals with are the Mohanlal expedition in Kandahar, Burnes’ Kabul expedition and Richard Burton’s expedition in Sind and Gujarat. The description of the evolution of a partnership between British Political Agent Arthur Connolly and Herat’s horse trader Muhin Shah is very engrossing. As partners in trade, the two men became travelling companions in their journey between Herat and Delhi and also made an entry into the provincial politics of Bengal. Accounts of these strange liaisons bring to full view the intricacies of Indo-Central Asian trade in the colonial period.</p>
<p>Banerji’s book indicates the importance of the Indus sector for British commercial and political interests. The Indus basin was a prominent access zone for the British into Persia and the Central Asian khanates via Kabul and Kandahar where Indian merchant communities were strongly entrenched since the Mughal period. Their presence had resulted in what has been called the ‘commercialisation of Punjab’. The British government took advantage of their experiences to gather information about Russian presence and influence in the Central Asian heartland.</p>
<p>The book talks about uncommon routes of access in the Turan-Iran sector dating back to the fifteenth century, especially the caravan trade route that had brought about close diplomatic negotiations between the Romanov and Mughal courts. The principal functionaries of this caravan trade were the Khatris, who found Iran’s accessibility from India attractive. The riverine tract of the Indus was an efficient waterway to transport goods upto the Caspian marts via Afghanistan. The advantages of specific locales in the Sind region for commercial purposes (Mithenkot, for example) were evident. These locales became important checkpoints for Indian businessmen who traded their wares between Kabul, Orenburg and Astrakhan. These local sites had a crucial role to play in the commercial flows between British Indian territories, Russian Central Asia and Trans-Caucasus, Persia and Afghanistan.</p>
<p>It would have been good to read a concluding chapter on the signs of rupture. It is possible that subsequent dispensations, i.e. the protectorate arrangement in Russian Central Asia and the revolutionary dispensation of 1917, sealed the fate of Indian mercantile communities in Central Asia.</p>
