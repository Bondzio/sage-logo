<abstract>
<p>Pellagra is a rare condition that has been known for many years to be related to niacin deficiency. Clinically known as the 4 “D” symptoms for dermatitis, diarrhea, dementia, and even death, skin changes remain one of the most important features of this pathology, leading frequently to the diagnosis. Pellagra is mostly seen in poor populations with a deficient diet; still, it is sporadically observed in developed countries, usually in association with digestive disorders. We report a new case of pellagra in a 29-year-old woman in whom the diagnosis of megaduodenum was made. Megaduodenum is a rare condition that can be idiopathic or secondary to visceral myopathy or neuropathy. Parenteral supplementation with niacin has resulted in a quick response of dermatological and psychiatric symptoms. To our knowledge, no case of pellagra due to megaduodenum has been reported in literature.</p>

<body>
<p>Pellagra, first described by Casal in 1735 in Spain, is a nutrition disorder caused by niacin deficiency. Clinically, pellagra is characterized by photosensitive dermatitis, gastrointestinal (GI) disorders, and neurologic and psychiatric manifestations. It can even lead to death in ultimate cases. Nevertheless, the current knowledge of its pathogenesis has significantly improved the prognosis thanks to niacin supplementation.</p>
<p>Nowadays, pellagra remains a health problem in the poorest countries of Africa and Asia, where malnutrition is still endemic, especially in the most vulnerable communities. In the developed world, most cases occur sporadically due to an inadequate diet or a digestive disorder.</p>
<p>In this article, our aim was to study the clinical features of pellagra, discuss the different etiologies, and highlight the impact of niacin supplementation through a case of pellagra associated with megaduodenum in a young woman. Finally, we provide a literature review of other cases of pellagra.</p>

<title>Case Report</title>
<p>A 29-year-old woman was referred to our department of dermatology with a 5-month history of erythema of the sun-exposed areas associated with diarrhea and vomiting and neuropsychiatric disorders consisting of a depressive mood and paresthesia of both legs.</p>
<p>Skin examination revealed a scaly erythematous eruption symmetrically involving the dorsa of the hands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0884533612464783">Figure 1A</xref>), the forearms, and the dorsa of feet. Skin lesions were well defined, limited to sun-exposed sites and clearly demarcated from the normal skin. The face had a crusty erythematous rash with a crumpled grayish skin. Mucosal involvement consisted of a squamous cheilitis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0884533612464783">Figure 1B</xref>) with an erosive stomatitis and cracked swollen tongue, as well as 2 anal fissures; genital mucosa was not affected.</p>

</fig>
<p>The patient described episodes of postprandial vomiting with nausea and watery diarrhea for at least 5 months. These symptoms resulted in an undetermined weight loss. Her body mass index on admission was of 17.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (−16.36% of her ideal body weight). No history of drug intake, alcohol use, or specific diet was reported.</p>
<p>Neuropsychiatric manifestations consisted of permanent unexplained sadness and fatigue and paresthesia of both legs. Neurological examination showed apathy and depressed mood without signs of peripheral neuropathy or walking trouble. Specialized psychiatric examination revealed objective depressive symptoms with loss of appetite but no evidence of anorexia nervosa.</p>
<p>Laboratory screening revealed hypoproteinemia (6.6 g/dL) and hypoalbuminemia (3.485 g/dL; normal, 4–4.7g/dL). Serum iron, ferritin, phosphate, magnesium, and calcium were within normal values. Other biologic tests, including complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, hepatic and renal functions, serum electrolyte levels, vitamin K–dependent coagulation, and immunologic study (antinuclear, anti–Sjögren’s syndrome A [SSA], and anti–Sjögren’s syndrome B [SSB] antibodies) showed no abnormalities. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) serology was negative.</p>
<p>Cutaneous biopsy showed acanthosis and parakeratosis of the epidermis, compatible with the diagnosis of pellagra.</p>
<p>According to the association of dermatologic, digestive, and neuropsychiatric disorders in the patient, as well as a compatible histology, the diagnosis of pellagra was established.</p>
<p>Gastric endoscopy showed gastric stasis; after gastric suction, the diagnosis of megaduodenum was made. Histological examination of duodenal and gastric biopsies was normal. Esophageal manometry showed hypotonic lower esophageal sphincter with normal peristaltism. Colonoscopy was normal. Serology of celiac disease was also negative.</p>
<p>The patient was treated by intravenous administration of nicotinamide 200 mg daily, associated with a multivitamin complex—Cernévit (Clintec Parenteral Sa; Maurepas, France) 1 bottle 4 times a day (1 bottle contains ~50 mg of nicotinamide, folate, and vitamins B<sub>1</sub>, B<sub>2</sub>, B<sub>6</sub>, B<sub>12</sub>, etc)—for 5 days. Supplementation was then continued by an oral poly-vitamin therapy, including niacin at 36 mg/d, magnesium, other B vitamins, zinc, and folate.</p>
<p>Improvement was noted within 5 days, especially on dermatologic and neuropsychiatric symptoms: significant attenuation of erythema and photosensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0884533612464783">Figure 1C</xref>), absence of leg paresthesia, recovery of the appetite, and regression of depressive mood perceived by the patient. Interestingly, we noted the appearance of a white band in the proximal half of the finger nail.</p>
<p>The patient was then referred to a gastroenterology specialist for further explorations of the megaduodenum etiology.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In our report, pellagra was diagnosed in a patient with intestinal malabsorption due to a megaduodenum. In fact, pellagra is sporadically reported in our country; most cases are associated with secondary diseases.</p>
<p>The relation between pellagra and diet deficiency was first reported by Joseph Goldberger in the early 19th century. In 1937, Conrad Elvehjem finally proved that niacin deficiency is the cause of pellagra.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0884533612464783">1</xref></sup> Ten years later, niacin dietary supplementation was discovered to be effective in the treatment and prevention of pellagra, leading to its common addition to staple foods in many countries.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, pellagra is still endemic in poor underdeveloped nations. In 2004, the World Health Organization reported the highest death rates from pellagra in South Africa, with 2.28 deaths per 1 million people secondary to pellagra, followed by Venezuela and Brazil.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0884533612464783">2</xref></sup> Pellagra rates seem to be higher in famine and war zones. In 1990, it was detected in 6.3% of Mozambican refugees in southern Malawi; most cases were seen in women and increasing with age.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0884533612464783">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>In some countries, diet consisting mainly of maize or jowar (Indian millet) has led to pellagra as well. Those cereals are not deficient in niacin; maize has rich but unusable forms of niacin, and jowar contains high quantities of leucine, which interferes with the enzymatic conversion of tryptophan to niacin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0884533612464783">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>In developed countries, pellagra is usually secondary to an underlying disorder. Wan et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0884533612464783">1</xref></sup> have recorded all the causes of pellagra and divided them according to their pathological mechanism into 4 groups: pellagra due to an inadequate diet, to digestive malabsorption, to a metabolic disorder, and to drug-induced pellagra. Intestinal malabsorption is observed in various conditions, including Crohn’s disease, celiac disease, jejunoileitis, severe ulcerative colitis, prolonged diarrhea, gastrectomy, or tuberculosis of the GI tract.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0884533612464783">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0884533612464783">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0884533612464783">6</xref></sup> Currently, alcoholism seems to be the most common cause of pellagra in developed countries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0884533612464783">7</xref></sup> Chronic alcoholism is often associated with a nutritionally poor diet and malabsorption. Pellagra may also be a complication of anorexia nervosa, in which there is a deficient intake of niacin and/or protein, as well as a deficiency of riboflavin and/or pyridoxine, with both coenzymes implicated in the conversion of tryptophan to niacin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0884533612464783">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0884533612464783">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Buchman et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0884533612464783">10</xref></sup> suggested that anorexia-associated GI motor dysfunctions are a consequence, not the cause, of the generalized protein-calorie malnutrition associated with anorexia nervosa and is due to a reversible dysfunction of neural regulation.</p>
<p>Recently, pellagra has been observed in some diets rich in high-leucine/low-tryptophan foods (gelatin, yogurt, beef, high-protein diet) in persons seeking to lose weight.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0884533612464783">11</xref></sup> In addition, many drugs have been reported to induce pellagra, including antitubercular chemotherapy, 5-ﬂuorouracil, 6-mercaptopurine, anticonvulsants (hydantoin, ethionamide, phenobarbital), azathioprine, and chloramphenicol.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0884533612464783">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0884533612464783"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0884533612464783"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0884533612464783">15</xref></sup> In HIV patients, massive plasma tryptophan and niacin deficiency has been observed to lead to pellagra.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0884533612464783">16</xref></sup> Niacin deficiency may complicate the carcinoid syndrome since up to 99% of tryptophan is “stolen” from niacin synthesis to be catabolized to serotonin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0884533612464783">1</xref></sup> The most frequent causes of pellagra in developed countries are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0884533612464783">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<p>In our patient, pellagra was most probably secondary to megaduodenum. Megaduodenum is a rare idiopathic condition that can be characterized by duodenal aganglionosis or is secondary to other diseases, including superior mesenteric artery syndrome, congenital duodenal atresia, annular pancreas, systemic sclerosis, or visceral myopathy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0884533612464783">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0884533612464783">18</xref></sup> Clinically, it can remain asymptomatic or lead to a severe pseudo-obstruction in some patients. Surgical treatment seems to be required in most cases. Pseudo-obstruction may explain the vomiting and the malabsorption, which led to pellagra in our patient.</p>
<p>Niacin, also known as vitamin B<sub>3</sub>, is a water-soluble vitamin. Nicotinamide is also a water-soluble vitamin but does not reduce cholesterol or cause flushing. Niacin and nicotinamide (a natural derivative of niacin) are essential components of NAD or coenzyme I (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) and NADP or coenzyme II (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate), both indispensable for oxidation reduction reactions and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production. It seems that tissues with high metabolism such as the brain, the skin, or the intestine are mostly altered by niacin deficiency.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0884533612464783">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0884533612464783">19</xref></sup> Niacin is found in variety of foods, including liver, chicken, beef, fish, cereal, peanuts, and legumes, and is also synthesized from tryptophan, which is found in meat, dairy, and eggs. Normally, niacin is absorbed in the stomach and upper small intestine,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0884533612464783">20</xref></sup> which may explain the occurrence of pellagra in our patient. Furthermore, niacin is a water-soluble vitamin; its digestive absorption may also be reduced by diarrhea. The endogenous synthesis from amino acid tryptophan requires the presence of vitamins B<sub>2</sub> and B<sub>6</sub>; 60 mg of tryptophan is considered equivalent to 1 mg of niacin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0884533612464783">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>The pathogenesis of photosensitivity in pellagra is still unclear. Several hypotheses have been proposed, including deficiency of NAD; accumulation of kynurenic acid, which may act as a photosensitizer when present in high amounts; or the deficiency of urocanic acid, which reduces the protection of skin against UVB radiation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0884533612464783">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>The term <italic>pellagra</italic> is derived from the Italian words <italic>pelle agra</italic>, meaning rough skin, which highlights the importance of skin disorders in the diagnosis of this disease. In fact, pellagra is traditionally reported as the 4 “D” disease: dermatitis, diarrhea, dementia, and ultimately death.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0884533612464783">4</xref></sup> The most characteristic feature of pellagra is erythematous rash affecting symmetrically the sun-exposed sites. Initial skin lesions are swollen erythema covered with vesicles or bullae resembling sunburn. After this acute phase, skin becomes thickened, scaly, and pigmented. Dorsal surface of the hands is mostly affected (77%–97%),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0884533612464783">11</xref></sup> as well as the face, neck, arms, and feet. Cheilitis, angular stomatitis, and glossitis are also common in pellagra. Skin changes are the most frequent manifestations of pellagra, present alone in 33% of patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0884533612464783">23</xref></sup> The nail involvement described in our patient is singular. It is most commonly reported in patients with chronic renal disorder, associations with Behçet disease, yellow nail syndrome, and citrullinemia. We did not detect any systemic pathology in our case except pellagra. A review of published cases showed that only Cakmak et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0884533612464783">24</xref></sup> reported such nail changes with pellagra. We do not know the pathogenesis of half-and-half nail in pellagra.</p>
<p>GI anomalies are loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea, leading to a malabsorptive state that may increase the niacin deficiency.</p>
<p>Neuropsychiatric changes include headache, anxiety, hallucinations, depression, and encephalopathy and may lead to coma and death. Peripheral neuritis also has been reported.</p>

<p>The diagnosis of pellagra is clinical, based on the 4 “D” symptoms and the rapid response to niacin supplementation. No chemical tests are specific. Nevertheless, dosage of niacin, tryptophan, NAD, and NADP in the serum may help in the diagnosis. Low urinary excretion of N-methylnicotinamide and N-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide were reported to be strongly suggestive of niacin deficiency.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0884533612464783">4</xref></sup> Unfortunately, those tests are not a common practice in our country, and they could not have been performed in our patient.</p>
<p>Histology is not specific to pellagra. Typically, it shows hyperkeratosis and parakeratosis. In acute lesions, vesicles, bullae, and inflammatory reaction may be present.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0884533612464783">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Pellagra responds quickly to the administration of nicotinamide 100–300 mg/d in 3–4 doses. In patients with intestinal malabsorption, parenteral administration of the treatment is needed. Concomitant administration of riboflavin, pyridoxine, zinc, and magnesium may be required.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0884533612464783">25</xref></sup> Neuropsychiatric anomalies disappear within 24–48 hours and skin lesions after 3–4 weeks. Improvement of the skin rash was observed after only 5 days of niacin supplementation in our patient. Upper limit for men and women is 35 mg/d (Recommended Dietary Allowance [RDA] is 14–16 mg/d), and flushing episodes (usually 15–30 minutes) should be monitored.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Even though pellagra is not frequently observed in many countries, this diagnosis should be kept in mind in patients with photodermatosis. Early supplementation with niacin concludes to a dramatic improvement of this disease, which can be lethal if untreated.</p>
