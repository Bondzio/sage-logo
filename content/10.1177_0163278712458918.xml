<abstract>
<p>Adverse events within health care settings can lead to two victims. The first victim is the patient and family and the second victim is the involved health care professional. The latter is the focus of this review. The objectives are to determine definitions of this concept, research the prevalence and the impact of the adverse event on the second victim, and the used coping strategies. Therefore a literature research was performed by using a three-step search procedure. A total of 32 research articles and 9 nonresearch articles were identified. The second victim phenomenon was first described by Wu in 2000. In 2009, Scott et al. introduced a detailed definition of second victims. The prevalence of second victims after an adverse event varied from 10.4% up to 43.3%. Common reactions can be emotional, cognitive, and behavioral. The coping strategies used by second victims have an impact on their patients, colleagues, and themselves. After the adverse event, defensive as well as constructive changes have been reported in practice. The second victim phenomenon has a significant impact on clinicians, colleagues, and subsequent patients. Because of this broad impact it is important to offer support for second victims. When an adverse event occurs, it is critical that support networks are in place to protect both the patient and involved health care providers.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In 2000, the Institute of Medicine’s report “To Err is Human” estimated that errors cause 44,000 to 98,000 deaths annually in the United States, with a total cost of between $17 and $29 billion each year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0163278712458918">Kohn, Corrigan, &amp; Donaldson, 1999</xref>). In that same year, Reason explained how medical errors can be caused by active failures and latent conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0163278712458918">Reason, 2000</xref>). Active failures occur at the “sharp end,” in direct contact with the patient, whereas latent failures occur at the “blunt end,” more distal to the patient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0163278712458918">Denham, 2007</xref>). Since 2000, there has been a notable increase in the number of publications relating to patient safety and quality improvement but recent findings show that health care is still unsafe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0163278712458918">Altman, Clancy, &amp; Blendon, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0163278712458918">Classen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0163278712458918">Landrigan et al., 2010</xref>). In October 2010, the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) published a white paper on “Respectful Management of Serious Clinical Adverse Events” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0163278712458918">Conway, Federico, Stewart, &amp; Campbell, 2010</xref>). This report revealed that many health care organizations do not have a planned response for adverse events. When there is an adverse event, the organization has three specific priorities. The first priority is to care for the patient and his or her family members who are the direct victims of the adverse event. The second priority is to care for frontline clinicians involved in or exposed to the event. These individuals can be referred to as second victims, a term first introduced by Wu in 2000. Often, the health care professional is at the sharp end of an error created elsewhere, and he or she can also suffer from it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0163278712458918">Denham, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0163278712458918">Parker &amp; Lawton, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0163278712458918">Reason, 2000</xref>). The third priority of the response plan is to address the needs of the organization, which can also suffer a potential loss from the incident, becoming a third victim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0163278712458918">Conway et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0163278712458918">Denham, 2007</xref>). The focus of this review is the second victim. The following research questions are posed: (1) What definitions of second victims have been described in health care literature? (2) What is the prevalence of second victims? (3) What is the impact of the medical error/adverse event on the second victim? and (4) What are individual coping strategies used by second victims?</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section3-0163278712458918">
<title>Data Sources</title>
<p>Searches in Medline, Embase, and Cinahl from the start of each database were conducted through September 2010. Language was restricted to English.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0163278712458918">
<title>Selection of Articles</title>
<p>This systematic review employed a three-step search strategy. First Medline, Embase, and Cinahl searches were conducted by exploring the following search terms: “second victim,” “medical error” OR “adverse event” AND “psychology” OR “emotions” OR “feelings” OR “burnout” OR “depression” OR “empathy” OR “attitude of health personnel,” “medical error”[MeSH] AND “Burnout, Professional”[MeSH] OR “Depressive Disorder”[MeSH] OR “Empathy”[MeSH].</p>
<p>The second step was a manual review of reference lists from relevant articles identified in step one. Two of the authors (D.S. and E.V.G.) performed this independently in September and October 2010. If no consensus was reached, a third researcher (K.V.H.) was contacted.</p>
<p>The following inclusion criteria were used:<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>Studies that provided a definition of second victim in health care settings.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Studies that assessed prevalence of medical errors/adverse events on health care providers.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Studies that reproduced the impact of a medical error/adverse event on the health care provider.</p>
</list-item>
</list>Studies that described coping strategies for health care providers within the context of a medical error/adverse event and identified changes in clinical practice.</p>
<p>We excluded studies not published in English, conference reports, newspaper stories, and personal stories of health care professionals in a scientific journal.</p>
<p>The final step of the search strategy was a detailed review of the identified articles by three experts in the area of second victim phenomenon: S.D.S. who published the definition of second victim and described a six-stage recovery trajectory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0163278712458918">Scott et al., 2009</xref>), J.C., the first author of the IHI white paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0163278712458918">Conway et al., 2010</xref>), and A.W.W. who initially introduced the term second victim in medical literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0163278712458918">Wu, 2000</xref>). The expert panel also referred to the Medically Induced Trauma Support Services (MITSS) tool kit of second victim resource materials as an additional resource (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0163278712458918">MITSS, 2011</xref>). All the final included papers are based on a consensus meeting by the authors.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 207 potentially relevant studies were identified and an abstract review was conducted. Of these, 65 studies met at least one of the inclusion criteria. The panel of experts identified an additional 13 articles. The expert panel also suggested a review of the MITSS tool kit of second victim resource materials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0163278712458918">MITSS, 2011</xref>), and added a case study. Forty-one studies were found to provide a specific answer to one of the research questions. In total 32, research articles, one editorial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0163278712458918">Wu, 2000</xref>), one commentary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0163278712458918">Levinson &amp; Dunn, 1989</xref>), two reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0163278712458918">Conway et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0163278712458918">Wolf, 2005</xref>), three systematic reviews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0163278712458918">Goldberg, Kuhn, Andrew, &amp; Thomas, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0163278712458918">Schwappach &amp; Boluarte, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0163278712458918">Sirriyeh, Lawton, Gardner, &amp; Armitage, 2010</xref>), one book chapter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0163278712458918">Wu, Sexton, &amp; Pham, 2008</xref>), and one ethical article (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0163278712458918">Berlinger &amp; Wu, 2005</xref>) were included in this systematic review.

<italic>Research Question 2</italic>: What is the prevalence of second victims?</p>
</list-item>
</list>The prevalence of second victims in health care is estimated in three studies and varies from 10.4% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0163278712458918">Lander et al., 2006</xref>) over approximately 30% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0163278712458918">Scott et al., 2010</xref>) to 43.3% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0163278712458918">Wolf, Serembus, Smetzer, Cohen, &amp; Cohen, 2000</xref>). The study of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0163278712458918">Lander et al. (2006)</xref> reported the lowest prevalence of second victims. The otolaryngologists in this study were not asked about their emotional reaction when making an error, but they were asked whether an error had occurred during the last 6 months. If an error had occurred, they described this error. Thirty percent of the medical students, physicians, and professional nurses in the study of Scott et al. reported personal problems within the past 12 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0163278712458918">Scott et al., 2010</xref>). In the study of Wolf , Serembus, Smetzer, Cohen, and Cohen(2000) 40.8% of respondents reported that the error had a moderately severe harmful effect and 2.5% describing a severe impact on their personal lives.<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Research Question 3:</italic> What is the impact of the error on the second victim?</p>
</list-item>
</list>The second victim is troubled about the impact of the error on the first victim. Feelings of guilt, anger, frustration, psychological distress, and fear are the most common psychosocial and physical symptoms of the second victim following an adverse event. In addition, the error can have an impact on both the personal and professional life of the second victim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0163278712458918">Aasland &amp; Førde, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0163278712458918">Schelbred &amp; Nord, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0163278712458918">Sirriyeh et al., 2010</xref>). This response can disrupt the therapeutic relationship with the first victim and leave the patient, family, and caregiver to suffer alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0163278712458918">Bell, Moorman, &amp; Delbanco, 2010</xref>). The reactions of second victims are influenced by the outcome of the error and their degree of personal responsibility for the adverse event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0163278712458918">Engel, Rosenthal, &amp; Sutcliffe, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0163278712458918">Levinson &amp; Dunn, 1989</xref>). Poor patient outcomes and greater perceived personal responsibility were associated with more intense reactions and greater personal anguish among resident physicians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0163278712458918">Engel et al., 2006</xref>). Female second victims tend to report significantly more distress than males, are more afraid of losing their confidence, are more concerned about receiving blame, and experience more loss of reputation from their colleagues. They are more motivated to discuss the error to learn whether colleagues would make the same decision and are more likely to attend training programs. Regardless of the outcome, they are more likely to feel guilty and fear all repercussions in nearly every situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0163278712458918">Kaldjian et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0163278712458918">Muller &amp; Ornstein, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0163278712458918">Wu, Folkman, McPhee, &amp; Lo, 1991</xref>). Students can also be deeply affected by errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0163278712458918">Martinez &amp; Lo, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Second victims can respond emotionally, cognitively, and behaviorally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0163278712458918">Fischer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0163278712458918">MITSS, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0163278712458918">Wolf, 2005</xref>). Both emotional and cognitive responses can influence physical and psychosocial symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0163278712458918">MITSS, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0163278712458918">Scott, Hirschinger, &amp; Cox, 2008</xref>). The perceptions of other people, for example colleagues, can influence feelings of guilt. For example, fear by the second victim that their peers think they provide poor quality of care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0163278712458918">Christensen, Levinson, &amp; Dunn, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0163278712458918">Levinson &amp; Dunn, 1989</xref>). Several studies reveal that second victims blame themselves or feel ashamed of their individual responses to the clinical event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0163278712458918">Newman, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0163278712458918">Schwappach &amp; Boluarte, 2009</xref>; Wu, Sexton, &amp; Pham,, 2008). Second victims may feel guilty because of their errors and harm they caused to the patient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0163278712458918">Bell et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0163278712458918">Gallagher, Waterman, Ebers, Fraser, &amp; Levinson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0163278712458918">MITSS, 2011</xref>). There are no significant differences in empathy scores (individual’s concern for the feelings of others) and cognitive empathy scores (an individual’s ability to understand the perspective of another person about his or her circumstances) between residents who did or did not report an error (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0163278712458918">West et al., 2006</xref>). In some circumstances, the second victim can have continued emotional distress and can develop posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0163278712458918">Rassin, Kanti, &amp; Silner, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0163278712458918">Schelbred &amp; Nord, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0163278712458918">Scott et al., 2008</xref>). Symptoms may include insomnia, nightmares, reliving the incident repeatedly, loss of trust by their colleagues, lack of self-confidence, and fear of making another error (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0163278712458918">Schelbred &amp; Nord, 2007</xref>). Besides PTSD, the second victim can experience burnout and/or depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0163278712458918">Fahrenkopf et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0163278712458918">West, Tan, Habermann, Sloan, &amp; Shanafelt, 2009</xref>). In a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0163278712458918">West et al. (2006)</xref>, 60% of the residents who reported an error had a positive screen for depression. The emotional response in the aftermath of the error is significantly related to reported changes in practices and can be correlated with the error severity and personal responsibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0163278712458918">Arndt, 1994a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0163278712458918">Meurier, Vincent, &amp; Parmar, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0163278712458918">Wu et al., 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>A secondary response, besides the emotional and cognitive response, might be a behavioral response, which includes taking responsibility, disclosure, and reflection about the case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0163278712458918">Fischer et al., 2006</xref>). Professionals have a strong sense of personal responsibility, and the degree of personal responsibility for an event is linked to taking responsibility for the medical error (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0163278712458918">Engel et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0163278712458918">Goldberg et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0163278712458918">Penson, Svendsen, Chabner, Lynch, &amp; Levinson, 2001</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0163278712458918">Wu, Folkman, McPhee, and Lo (1993)</xref> recommended that house officers should be encouraged to accept responsibility for the mistake and discuss the mistake and should be discouraged from forgetting or avoiding thinking about it. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0163278712458918">Engel, Rosenthal, and Sutcliffe (2006)</xref> found that residents who are confronted with serious adverse events and/or felt personal responsibility for these are inherently motivated to change their future practice behavior. However, this may challenge their emotional well-being. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0163278712458918">Meurier, Vincent, and Parmar (1998)</xref> found that different factors are related to accepting responsibility like self-blame or importance of the error. Disclosure of the error to the patient is stressful and has a significant impact on the second victim. Disclosure may help both the patient and the physicians to deal with the consequences of an error, but some may not disclose because of legal implications, psychological distress, or uncertainty about the cause of the error (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0163278712458918">Lander et al., 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0163278712458918">Lander et al. (2006)</xref> suggested that the failure to deal with emotional need hampers completion of the necessary steps to deal with an error. Respectful disclosure should contain support, resolution, learning, and improvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0163278712458918">Conway et al., 2010</xref>).

</list-item>
</list>Every second victim has his or her own way of coping, but <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0163278712458918">Scott et al. (2009)</xref> described a six-stage general recovery trajectory for second victims: Stage 1: chaos and accident response; Stage 2: intrusive reflection characterized by “what if” questions; Stage 3: restoring personal integrity by looking for support to tell their experience or understand the impact on them personal and professional; Stage 4: enduring the inquisition from others, and wondering about the impact of their mistake; Stage 5: obtaining emotional “first aid”; and Stage 6: moving on or dropping out, surviving, or thriving. For the later stages, institutions provide some emotional support but for the earlier stages frontline supervisors and peers could be trained in providing more immediate support.</p>
<p>Two major coping strategies, problem-focused strategy and emotion-focused strategy, were found in the literature. These are important to the individual achieving an effective coping strategy by dealing with the error, analyzing, and learning from it either alone or with colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0163278712458918">Aasland &amp; Førde, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0163278712458918">Arndt, 1994b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0163278712458918">Chard, 2010</xref>). The “Ways of Coping Scale,” by Folkman and Lazarus, is used for measuring the two major forms of coping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0163278712458918">Chard, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0163278712458918">Christensen et al., 1992</xref>; Wu , Folkman, McPhee, &amp; Lo1993). In problem-focused coping, the individual tries to cope with the problem that causes distress and tries to determine what transpired. In this strategy, the clinician is trying to learn from the mistake, which includes information seeking, problem solving, and attempting to deal with the problem itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0163278712458918">Chard, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0163278712458918">Christensen et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0163278712458918">Wu et al., 1993</xref>). Sometimes discussing details with medical colleagues was experienced as unhelpful because the involved doctor felt that colleagues minimized the mistake and were avoiding the emotional concerns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0163278712458918">Christensen et al., 1992</xref>). In the second strategy, emotion-focused coping, the individual copes by managing the emotional distress caused by the error (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0163278712458918">Chard, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0163278712458918">Christensen et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0163278712458918">Wu et al., 1993</xref>). This strategy can include accepting responsibility for the mistake and recommending practice changes to reduce future errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0163278712458918">Goldberg et al., 2002</xref>). Meeting the patient or family has been identified as an important way for reducing the negative impact of event for physicians. However, it is not a guaranteed method for obtaining relief or absolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0163278712458918">Aasland &amp; Førde, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0163278712458918">Berlinger &amp; Wu, 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0163278712458918">Engel et al. (2006)</xref> found that talking with family and friends is less important in the coping process than talking with medical colleagues. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0163278712458918">Table 4</xref> presents an overview of coping strategies.</p>

<p>Making changes in practice is another identified coping strategy. These changes can be defensive or constructive. A common defensive tactic is to keep the error to oneself. A common constructive reaction is to solicit insights from a colleague regarding alternative response approaches. Defensive and constructive practice changes are described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0163278712458918">Table 5</xref>. In 1984, Mizrahi described three defensive mechanisms: denial process, discounting, and distancing. Defensive changes, such as distancing and escape or avoidance, are also associated with perception of job overload as cause for the mistake and the perception that the institution responded judgmentally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0163278712458918">Meurier et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0163278712458918">Wu et al., 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0163278712458918">1993</xref>). The second change in practice is making constructive changes and includes accepting responsibility and planful problem solving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0163278712458918">Chard, 2010</xref>). Most of the participants in the study of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0163278712458918">Penson, Svendsen, Chabner, Lynch, and Levinson (2001)</xref> agreed that discussion of the error was beneficial. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0163278712458918">Meurier et al. (1997)</xref> reported that emotional responses and coping strategies used in the aftermath of an error were significantly related to report changes in practice. In this study, accepting responsibility and planful problem-solving strategies were related positively to constructive changes. There are some relationships between the coping strategies and the changes in practices. The coping strategies of seeking social support and planful problem solving were significant predictors of constructive changes in practice. Significant predictor of defensive changes in practice are accepting responsibility for the error and using self-control. There is also a relationship between coping and emotional distress. A strong and significant relationship was found between escape or avoidance and emotional distress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0163278712458918">Chard, 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The term second victim was introduced by Wu in 2000, and a specific definition was posed by Scott et al. in 2009. Attention was paid to the emotional impact of adverse events on physicians as early as 1984 by Mizrahi. Since then, there have been numerous reports about the negative impact of errors on second victims. Individual clinicians can respond behaviorally by taking responsibility, ensuring disclosure, and careful reflection of the adverse event and/or emotionally or cognitively, with burnout or depression. Because of the strong potential impact of adverse clinical events on a second victim, there is an identified need for specific support. The specific form of support may need to differ by gender, since women tend to react differently to an adverse event and are more motivated to discuss the error and learn whether colleagues would make the same decision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0163278712458918">Lander et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0163278712458918">Muller &amp; Ornstein, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0163278712458918">Wu et al., 1991</xref>). It should be taken into account that students can also be deeply wounded by adverse events and become second victims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0163278712458918">Martinez &amp; Lo, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The research articles in our review were diverse. Qualitative (<italic>n</italic> = 15), quantitative (<italic>n</italic> = 15), and mixed studies (<italic>n</italic> = 2) were included. Only 10 of the research articles describe the definition of the reported adverse event. Most of the studies analyzed the impact or the coping strategies for health care professionals (<italic>n</italic> = 17). In 15 articles, it was stated that after an adverse event constructive changes were made, 10 studies stated defensive changes. A fundamental limitation is the fact that the included studies did not use the same type of adverse event and the same definition or description of second victim which makes synthesis difficult. For example, some studies used “medication errors” as type of event, while others used “serious adverse events.” Another limitation of this review is the exclusion of personal stories. Personal reflections and stories relating to a second victim experience may provide valuable insights regarding the impact of the error on the second victim.</p>
<p>The prevalence rates of second victims in our study varied from 10.4% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0163278712458918">Lander et al., 2006</xref>) up to 43.3% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0163278712458918">Wolf et al., 2000</xref>). A more recent study shows that 46% of the respondents described being second victim of an incident (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0163278712458918">Edrees, Paine, Feroli, &amp; Wu, 2011</xref>). It is estimated that nearly half of the health care providers could experience the impact as a second victim at least once in their career. The performance of second victims can be impaired and thereby create additional safety hazards. They can disclose the error to the patient, but this may cause additional stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0163278712458918">Waterman et al., 2007</xref>). Some may find dysfunctional ways to deal with their error and when they do not employ adaptive ways of coping, they may take solace in alcohol or drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0163278712458918">Goldberg et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0163278712458918">King, Cockcroft, &amp; Gooch, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0163278712458918">Wu, 2000</xref>). A question that follows is what is likely to be the net effect on the quality of care? Disclosure of the mistake can lead to a better patient outcome, better patient professional relationship, and improved health care delivery systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0163278712458918">van Pelt, 2008</xref>). Disclosure can have a positive impact on the emotional stress of the second victim and reduces the likelihood of future mistakes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0163278712458918">Smith &amp; Forster, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0163278712458918">Wu, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0163278712458918">Wu et al., 1991</xref>). Fear for loss of reputation or loss of patients are barriers for not discussing the error with the patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0163278712458918">Fisseni, Pentzek, &amp; Abholz, 2008</xref>). The impact of the second victim can increase when the health care provider receives a patient complaint. A patient complaint also has an emotional impact on the health care provider and an impact on their personal life. The health care provider can loose confidence in his job and the doctor–patient relationship can be affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0163278712458918">Ashok &amp; Ogden, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0163278712458918">Cunningham, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>After an adverse event, organizations have the responsibility of trying to understand what happened and why it happened. Adverse events should be used to improve quality of care and to prevent future harm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0163278712458918">Conway et al., 2010</xref>). However, organizations also need to support their health care providers when an adverse event does occur. The need for support is not limited to the person who committed an obvious error but may extend to other frontline health care staff. Organizational leaders in health care need to establish resources to help clinicians deal with the emotional impact of the adverse event and assure that they are treated respectfully and compassionately (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0163278712458918">Conway &amp; Weingart, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>A final consideration is that the health care organization can also be victim of the adverse event (third victim). The impact of the adverse event on these third victims depends on the response and behavior of the organizational leaders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0163278712458918">Denham, 2007</xref>). Based on the increased trend to openly discuss and learn from adverse events, it is likely that the number of second and third victims has been underestimated. The financial impact on the whole health system is also likely to be considerable, but this has not been examined. Organizations need to consider institutional support strategies to aid all of the victims of adverse events. These support mechanisms should be culturally dependant and need to take into account immediate, middle long and long-term support needs of the health care clinician who becomes a second victim. Future research is necessary to identify support mechanisms that have a significant impact on outcomes including burnout, distress, and loss of confidence.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0163278712458918">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Health care leaders need to be aware of the high prevalence of second victims within their organizations and should provide supportive interventions in the aftermath of adverse events. Most second victims struggle in isolation, both personally and professionally. This also has a negative impact on their colleagues, supervisors, managers, patients, and organization. Addressing the needs of health care’s second victims needs to become part of national and local patient safety and quality improvement initiatives. In the words of Don Berwick, former administrator for the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), “health care workers who get wrapped up in error and injury, as almost all someday will, get seriously hurt too. And if we’re really healers, then we have a job of healing them too. That’s part of the job. It’s not an elective issue, it’s an ethical issue” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0163278712458918">Denham, 2007</xref>).</p>
