<abstract>
<p>The literatures on public values (PV) and public service motivation (PSM) both address whether public service delivery is driven by something more than self-interest. They have developed separately, although they can benefit from insights developed by the other, and this article discusses conceptual and empirical relationships between them. Based on a survey of 501 public managers, we find that PSM and PV are associated empirically, but not in a manner allowing total integration. The conceptual discussion reveals how the two concepts cannot be totally separated, as values can be motivating and motivation is often oriented toward something desirable (e.g., values). This suggests that neither total separation nor integration is a fruitful strategy. Given that the concepts are related, the literatures may benefit from more awareness of the conceptual overlaps and differences.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Public Administration literature is increasingly focusing on theories that go beyond self-interest. For example, the research on public service motivation (PSM) and public values (PV) addresses whether public service delivery is driven by more than self-interest, and both streams of research are currently flourishing. The PV literature focuses on normative ideals in the public sector such as honesty, integrity, efficiency, and the rule of law, whereas PSM concerns the motivation of individuals to do good for others and society through public service delivery. These two literatures have developed separately with few cross-references (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0275074012440031">Maesschalck, Wal, &amp; Huberts, 2008</xref>, p. 157; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0275074012440031">Perry &amp; Hondeghem, 2008</xref>, p. 305). However, both literatures may benefit from insights developed by the other. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0275074012440031">Rainey, Koehler, and Jung (2008</xref>, p. 10) have pointed out, “To have a value is not the same as exerting effort to fulfill it.” Thus, we may well stand to gain a more complete picture of values and motivation in the public sector by considering them jointly.</p>
<p>This article contributes to the process of bringing the two research areas closer together by discussing the conceptual and empirical relationships between PV and PSM. As we do not suggest the integration of PV and PSM theories, there is no unified theory from which hypotheses can be derived and tested. Instead, the purpose of the empirical analysis is to see how data can illuminate the conceptual discussion. Thus, the empirical analysis is driven by neither data nor theory; rather, it is conceptually motivated.</p>
<p>The next section presents the existing literatures on PSM and PV followed by a joint discussion of how PSM and PV are conceptually and theoretically linked. Whether and how empirical relationships between PV and PSM exist and how these relationships support the conceptual discussion is then explored in a study of 501 Danish public managers. Based on these results and the initial theoretical discussion, we present suggestions as to how research on PSM and PV can be related in the future.</p>

<title>Public Value Theory</title>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0275074012440031">Bozeman (2007)</xref>, public values specify “the rights, benefits and prerogatives to which citizens should (and should not) be entitled, the obligations of citizens to society, the state and one another; and the principles on which governments and policies should be based” (p. 13). The latter institutional element in the definition is important, as it indicates how values are the basic building blocks of the public sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0275074012440031">Beck Jørgensen, 1999</xref>, p. 581). Or, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0275074012440031">Kernaghan (2003)</xref> has argued, the notion of public values is at the heart of good governance. In sum, public values can be seen as the ideals, coined as principles, to be followed when producing a public service or regulating citizens’ behavior, thus providing direction to the behavior of public servants.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0275074012440031">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>PV research often equates public values with “classic values,” such as public interest, political loyalty, accountability, impartiality, professionalism, integrity, and honesty. Such values have been recommended in a number of strategic documents, such as the report from the Nolan Committee on Standards in Public Life and codes of good governance issued by the United Nation, the European Council, the OECD, and many countries around the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0275074012440031">Beck Jørgensen &amp; Sørensen, 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>Apart from these classic values, however, many other values are relevant as “public.” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0275074012440031">Beck Jørgensen and Bozeman (2007)</xref> registered the public values referred to in the relevant academic literature,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0275074012440031">2</xref></sup> categorizing 72 values in seven value constellations. Each constellation focuses on certain aspects of the public sector toward which the value in question is related or directed. Examples include values concerning the public sector’s contribution to society and values concerning the relationship between public administration and the citizens. This value inventory outlines the important multidimensionality of the public value universe, thereby demonstrating the great variety of possible directions given by public values.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0275074012440031">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>A highly important question in PV research is how values can be safeguarded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0275074012440031">De Bruijn &amp; Dicke, 2006</xref>). Here, it is important to note that values can be expressed and safeguarded on several organizational or systemic levels: (a) strategic documents such as mission and value statements, formal rules, and leadership speeches, (b) organizational structures and regulatory instruments, (c) decisions and actions, (d) rituals and patterns of action, (e) employees’ mindsets, and (f) buildings and artifacts.</p>
<p>One widely discussed option for safeguarding values is the application of modes of governance. Using varying labels, several researchers have pointed out basic forms such as hierarchy, clan, network, and market (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0275074012440031">Beck Jørgensen, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0275074012440031">De Bruijn &amp; Dicke, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0275074012440031">Dunleavy &amp; O’Leary, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0275074012440031">Hood &amp; Schuppert, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0275074012440031">March &amp; Olsen, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0275074012440031">Ouchi, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0275074012440031">Williamson, 1975</xref>). Theoretically, each of these modes of governance is expected to advance a certain set of values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0275074012440031">Beck Jørgensen &amp; Vrangbæk, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0275074012440031">Vrangbæk, 2009</xref>). Hierarchy is based on Weberian bureaucracy with a strong orientation to rule-following, due process, and neutrality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0275074012440031">March &amp; Olsen, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0275074012440031">Olsen, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0275074012440031">Weber, 1991</xref>). The classical bureaucrat is expected to be loyal to superiors, neutral regarding political interests, and to respect budgetary limits. Clan implies that government is based on the internalization of goals and establishment of norms within a given group. Professions are often seen as the prime example of the clan mode of governance because of specialized theoretical knowledge and intraoccupational norms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0275074012440031">Mintzberg, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0275074012440031">Ouchi, 1980</xref>) and independent professional standards is a key value. In the network perspective, public sector organizations are parts of complex networks of different interest organizations and social groupings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0275074012440031">Kickert, Klijn, &amp; Koppenjahn, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0275074012440031">Pierre, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0275074012440031">Rhodes, 1997</xref>). The state constitutes an arena while at the same time acting as a player in such networks. This means that important values are balancing societal interests, reaching consensus or compromise, securing fair conditions for all groups, and connecting various groups. Finally, the market is supposed to foster a stronger orientation toward users (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0275074012440031">Hood, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0275074012440031">Pollitt &amp; Bouckaert, 2000</xref>). To succeed in a market, services must be demanded by the potential customer and supplied in a cost-efficient manner.</p>
<p>As most public organizations are directed by more than one mode of governance, value conflicts are a recurrent phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0275074012440031">Beck Jørgensen &amp; Vrangbæk, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0275074012440031">Steen &amp; Rutgers, 2011</xref>). In contrast, values are supposed to relate harmoniously to each other within the individual mode of governance. As previous empirical research has shown, however, this is not always the case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0275074012440031">Andersen et al., 2012</xref>). Consequently, studying value conflicts and how they are handled is an important part of PV research.</p>
<p>Summing up, public values specify the normative principles on which governments and policies should be based and thus provide direction to the behavior of public servants. public values can be expressed and safeguarded on individual as well as systemic levels. The conflicts between values represent a key topic in PV research.</p>
<p>In the context of this article, PV research is marked by two shortcomings. First, the concept of direction requires development, as values provide direction with varying accuracy. For example, the common good and accountability are quite ambiguous values compared with user orientation. Second, PV research has not developed a measurement instrument as PSM. For the purpose of the analysis in this article, we have taken a first step elsewhere toward the development of a PV measurement instrument (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0275074012440031">Andersen et al., 2012</xref>). This measurement instrument is based on the aforementioned four modes of governance for two reasons: First, key public values can be related theoretically to the modes of governance. Second, these modes of governance can be considered basic to our understanding of the functioning of the public sector, thus enabling linkages between PV research and other PA literature.</p>

<title>Public Service Motivation Theory</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0275074012440031">Perry and Wise (1990)</xref> initially defined PSM as “an individual’s predisposition to respond to motives grounded primarily or uniquely in public institutions and organizations that might drive individuals to perform public service” (p. 368). We argue that the “public” element in PSM is not merely about the production of a specific type of service but also about doing something good for a larger public as opposed to egoistic motives. In line with this, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0275074012440031">Rainey and Steinbauer (1999)</xref> see PSM as a “general altruistic motivation to serve the interests of a community of people, a state, a nation or humanity” (p. 23). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0275074012440031">Perry and Hondeghem (2008)</xref> touch on the same, viewing PSM as “an individual’s orientation to delivering services to people with a purpose to do good for others and society” (p. vii). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0275074012440031">Vandenabeele (2007)</xref> defines PSM as “the belief, values and attitudes that go beyond self-interest and organizational interest, that concern the interest of a larger political entity and that motivate individuals to act accordingly whenever appropriate” (p. 549). In line with Perry and Hondeghem, we understand PSM as the orientation to do something good for others and society in the delivery of public services.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0275074012440031">Perry and Wise (1990)</xref> suggest that PSM derives from three types of reasons: rational, affective, and normative (p. 368). First, rational reasons have been understood as self-interested, but that appears to be inconsistent with the basic idea of PSM as prosocial motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0275074012440031">Wise, 2000</xref>). Rational reasons may thus be better understood as instrumental, that is, based on an understanding of how means and measures can be combined to contribute to public service delivery. Using this reasoning, doing good for others and society may mean working to produce public services, participating in the policy process and community activities, or participating in activities for social development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0275074012440031">Kim &amp; Vandenabeele, 2010</xref>, p. 703). Second, affective bonding with others is the emotional basis for serving others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0275074012440031">Knoke &amp; Wright-Isak, 1982</xref>). Identification is the core of affective reasoning. People identify with others, such as the disadvantaged, the public, community, society, and their country. The sense of oneness with those they identify with brings a willingness to do good for the identified objects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0275074012440031">Kim &amp; Vandenabeele, 2010</xref>). Thirdly, norm-based reasoning refers to compliance with values and norms. Being members of public organizations and society as a whole, individuals are likely to internalize social norms and values regarding the appropriate behavior and societal contributions expected of them when participating in the delivery of public services. Therefore, they feel satisfaction when they contribute to realizing these values, resulting in a commitment to the public interest. Thus, recent discussions have addressed whether this aspect of PSM should alternatively be labeled “value-based motives” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0275074012440031">Kim &amp; Vandenabeele, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast to PV theory, the literature on PSM has developed and tested a specific measurement instrument resting on these three theoretically derived reasons. At the outset, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0275074012440031">Perry (1996)</xref> included four dimensions in the empirical PSM construct. First, Commitment to the Public Interest denotes the desire to serve society based on values and duty. Second, Compassion covers the emotionally based motivation to do good for others based on identification and empathy. Third, Attraction to Policy Making denotes the motivation to improve public services though the political system. Fourth, Self-Sacrifice measures the willingness to bypass one’s own needs to help others and society. Commitment to the Public Interest, Compassion, and Attraction to Public Policy Making, respectively, correspond to the norm-based, affective, and rational/instrumental foundation of PSM. Self-Sacrifice can be seen as the footing on which the other dimensions rest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0275074012440031">Kim &amp; Vandenabeele, 2010</xref>), because doing good for others and society in the delivery of public service often requires self-sacrifice, and the dimension specifically concerns the willingness to substitute service to others for tangible personal rewards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0275074012440031">Perry, 1996</xref>). The key is whether individuals are willing to sacrifice private interests because they are motivated (for affective, normative, or instrumental reasons) to do good for others and society. Self-Sacrifice can therefore be seen as a footing (or accelerator) underlying the other PSM dimensions.</p>
<p>The PSM construct is first-order reflexive and second-order formative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0275074012440031">Kim &amp; Vandenabeele, 2010</xref>), meaning that the construct consists of underlying dimensions adding up to an aggregated construct. In some analyses, it makes sense to use the unified construct, while the dimensions should be used individually when the dimensions are expected to have different causes and consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0275074012440031">Kjeldsen, 2012</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section5-0275074012440031">
<title>Interweaving and Overlapping Concepts and Ideas</title>
<p>The review of the two literatures shows how PSM and PV developed separately and with some distinct features. Public values are regarded as providing direction and studied at all levels, from the individual to the societal level. PSM concerns the orientation to deliver public service to do something good for others and society and is mainly studied at the individual level; and in contrast to PV, PSM has developed a specific measurement instrument used for empirical analysis.</p>
<p>Differences apart, the two basic concepts are interwoven in a number of ways. From a PV perspective, values can be motivating. Some PV researchers consider values important, because they are expected to (a) form our perceptions of reality; (b) give identity to individuals as well as organizations; (c) guide behavior; (d) give meaning to public service; and (e) be necessary for the maintenance of communities and societies (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0275074012440031">Kluckhohn, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0275074012440031">Lawton &amp; Rose, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0275074012440031">Maguire, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0275074012440031">Verdikommisjonen, 1999</xref>). Value importance is likewise assumed in widely accepted definitions of value. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0275074012440031">Kluckhohn (1962)</xref> defines value as “the desirable” (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0275074012440031">Van Deth &amp; Scarbrough, 1995</xref>), and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0275074012440031">Rokeach’s (1973)</xref> definition points to the “personally or socially preferable.” Values can even be defined as a conception “. . . which influences the selection from available modes, means, and ends of action” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0275074012440031">Kluckhohn, 1962</xref>, p. 395). According to this definition, a value with no effect on behavior is not a value.</p>
<p>From the PSM perspective, the issue of values is basic to the theoretical underpinnings of the PSM construct. First, values are connected to PSM through the norm-based type of motivation. Here, the central mechanism is that complying with norms and values is satisfying and therefore motivates. Second, the dimensions in the empirical PSM construct include values to a varying degree. Commitment to the Public Interest denotes serving society based on values and duty. Looking after the public interest can be seen as a public value, but we obviously need more concrete values specifying what serving society should include. Furthermore, the Self-Sacrifice dimension is associated with altruism (a value), and the Compassion dimension associates with being emphatic (a value). Moreover, in some research, concepts such as user orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0275074012440031">Andersen &amp; Pedersen, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0275074012440031">Vandenabeele, 2008</xref>) are treated as a motivational dimension, although it is traditionally referred to as a public value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0275074012440031">Beck Jørgensen &amp; Bozeman, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite―or exactly because of―this interweaving and overlapping of the two concepts, the theoretical and empirical connections between them remain unclear. What are the consequences of values and motivations being somewhat interchangeable and reinforcing? Is the most fruitful strategy to keep the two concepts “clean” and separate? Or is it more fruitful to merge value theory and motivation theory, that is, to define and measure PV and PSM as a single concept?</p>
<p>The review of the respective literatures indicates that conceptual <italic>separation</italic> is difficult. Or to put it more strongly: overlapping is unavoidable as well as necessary. It makes no sense arguing that values cannot motivate. That would deprive values of their normative appeal, undermine the notions of “the desirable” and “the preferable,” and also ruin the norm-based reasons for motivation, meaning that values cannot be an integrated part of the PSM construct. Furthermore, if PSM is deprived of the inclusion of some public values, PSM is not concerned about public service motivation; only motivation. In the same vein, Commitment to the Public Interest needs public values to specify what public interest is.</p>
<p>Is conceptual <italic>integration</italic> then an option? Three issues suggest that the answer is negative. First, the PSM construct should then include all possible values, which is in itself neither practical nor appropriate given the number of possible values and that the salience of public values may vary over time and across policy sectors and countries. Moreover, a high number of public values increase the likelihood of conflicting values, introducing a serious complication to the additive nature of the PSM construct. Conversely, the investigation of value variations and conflict is an explicit ambition in public value research. Conflicts between different Public values in public organizations are a rule rather than an exception, just as well as individuals within an organization may hold different conceptions of PSM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0275074012440031">Brewer, Selden &amp; Facer, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0275074012440031">Gailmard, 2010</xref>). Conflicts may vary in type and magnitude and involve different actors; they can be stimulating or create deadlocks. Conflicts can occur between management and employees or between different groups of employees. Again, the PSM construct cannot capture all of these variations, indicating the need for separate investigations of values and motivation.</p>
<p>Second, motivation concerns the individual, whereas values can also be identified on systemic levels. Public value can, for example, be expressed and safeguarded in strategic organizational documents such as mission statements and even in the construction of buildings. It cannot be taken for granted that individuals’ PSM is correlated with the public values of their organizations or the public values they think their organizations or its employees <italic>should</italic> have. This is an empirical question. If individuals have double or inconsistent standards (for themselves and for the organization, respectively), integrating PV and PSM will lead to the loss of important insights.</p>
<p>Third, the study of public values addresses topics other than motivation with links to, for example, political theory, ethics, research in trust and corruption, administrative history, and public management. It would be awkward to adapt PV concepts to one single field only (i.e., PSM). Likewise, there is more to PSM than PV. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0275074012440031">Vandenabeele (2007)</xref>, for example, relates PSM to identity, institutions, and other types of autonomous motivation.</p>
<p>What then? We agree with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0275074012440031">Maesschalck et al. (2008)</xref> on the need for empirical knowledge regarding the relationships between actual public values and public service motivation before getting more specific on how PV and PSM research should be linked. We therefore proceed to an explorative empirical analysis aimed at mapping the possible relationships between specific values and PSM. As we have not suggested a unified PV-PSM theory from which hypotheses can be derived and tested, the empirical analysis is explorative. However, based on our conceptual discussion and the existing literature (especially <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0275074012440031">Kim &amp; Vandenabeele, 2010</xref>), we expect (a) that PV is not related to Self-Sacrifice as the latter (as mentioned) is the footing on which the other PSM dimensions rest and therefore does not include much direction and (b) that PV is most strongly related to Commitment to the Public Interest, as it is the PSM dimension with the greatest focus on values. Although we place emphasis on these two PSM dimensions, we still include all of the traditional PSM dimensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0275074012440031">Perry, 1996</xref>) in the empirical analysis due to its explorative character.</p>

<title>Data and Measurement</title>
<p>The relationships between individuals’ public values and their PSM are investigated using survey data from a sample of Danish public managers. The questionnaire was sent to 811 public managers employed in central or local government, self-governing public institutions, and elsewhere, who completed master’s degree programs in public governance at Aarhus University or the University of Copenhagen between 2009 and 2011. We received 501 responses, corresponding to a 62% response rate. The participants in the programs typically have a degree in teaching, nursing, engineering, or the equivalent, and the master’s degree program is designed to support them theoretically in their current positions as a public manager.</p>
<p>PV research has no authoritative classification of values. However, as the aforementioned values typology based on modes of governance―hierarchy, clan, network, and market―have previously been used successfully in empirical research in the Danish context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0275074012440031">Andersen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0275074012440031">Vrangbæk, 2009</xref>), we made this as our starting point for the measurement of public values.</p>
<p>Empirically, the public managers were therefore asked to evaluate the importance of different specific values (e.g., accountability, due process, professionalism, productivity, user democracy) which are theoretically associated with the four modes of governance (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0275074012440031">Table 1</xref>). The importance of each value was evaluated in relation to either the public managers’ organization in general, the competences of their staff, or the motivation of their staff on a 1-to-5 scale, where 5 is maximum importance (the table note in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0275074012440031">Table 1</xref> contains the wording of the questions). In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0275074012440031">Andersen et al. (2012)</xref>, an explorative principal components analysis resulted in seven consistent and meaningful PV dimensions consisting of the value questions shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0275074012440031">Table 1</xref> (the table note tells which of the three levels, organization, staff competences or staff motivation, each question belongs to). This PV measurement instrument is validated in a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) below. Alternatively, we could have investigated the associations with PSM for each of the many values, but parsimony points toward reducing complexity when possible.</p>

<p>In contrast to PV research, the past two decades of empirical research in PSM have centered on a well-known classification and measurement instrument consisting of 24 Likert-type scale questions developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0275074012440031">Perry (1996</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0275074012440031">Wright, 2008</xref>). Our measurement of PSM was therefore based on this instrument. More specifically, we used a translated version of the abbreviated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0275074012440031">Perry (1996)</xref> scale tested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0275074012440031">Coursey and Pandey (2007)</xref> combined with items measuring Self-Sacrifice. These Coursey-Pandey items have previously proved successful in creating consistent indexes in the Danish context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0275074012440031">Andersen, Pallesen, &amp; Pedersen, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0275074012440031">Andersen &amp; Pedersen, 2012</xref>), but the Self-Sacrifice items have not previously been tested in the Danish context. Thus, we decided to test a nearly full version of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0275074012440031">Perry’s (1996)</xref> scale (seven out of eight possible items).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0275074012440031">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Two CFA offered support for the validity of the seven PV dimensions and four PSM dimensions. Due to the ordinal nature of the data, where several of the items have severely skewed the distributions, the CFAs used the distribution-free diagonally weighted least squares estimation (DWLS or robust WLS) as opposed to a standard maximum likelihood (ML) estimation based on sample covariance matrices from a multivariate normal distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0275074012440031">Coursey &amp; Pandey, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0275074012440031">Diamantopoulos &amp; Siguaw, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0275074012440031">Jöreskog &amp; Sörbom, 1993</xref>). However, this approach requires a sample of a certain size―although the exact requirement is unclear. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0275074012440031">Jöreskog and Sörbom (1996)</xref> suggest a sample size of at least 1.5 <italic>p</italic> (<italic>p</italic> + 1) for <italic>p</italic> &gt; 12 (where <italic>p</italic> is the number of items included in the analysis). In our case, this would amount to a sample size of 513 for the public values CFA and 434 for the public service motivation CFA. In contrast, recent simulations have found that DWLS performs reasonably well with sample sizes as low as 200 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0275074012440031">Flora &amp; Curran, 2004</xref>) or 400 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0275074012440031">Nye &amp; Drasgow, 2011</xref>). Our current sample of 501 public managers should thus be sufficient.</p>
<p>Using LISREL 8.80, the results of the two CFAs are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0275074012440031">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0275074012440031">3</xref> (correlations between the PSM indexes and between the PV indexes are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0275074012440031">Table A1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0275074012440031">A2</xref>, respectively). Evaluating the lambda coefficients (factor loadings) and corresponding <italic>t</italic>-values, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0275074012440031">Table 2</xref> shows the seven factor solutions derived in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0275074012440031">Andersen et al. (2012)</xref>. Calculations of the discriminant validity of the measurement instrument (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0275074012440031">Anderson &amp; Gerbing, 1988</xref>) showed that no single interfactor correlations had confidence intervals containing the maximum value of 1.00. The same goes for the CFA for PSM reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0275074012440031">Table 3</xref>. However, here we had to remove the item PSM24: “I have little compassion for people in need who are unwilling to take the first step to help themselves (reversed)” (intended to measure Compassion) from the measurement instrument, as it showed a factor loading and <italic>t</italic>-value of 0.04 and 0.28, respectively, which is clearly insignificant. As seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0275074012440031">Table 3</xref>, this means that the Compassion dimension only consists of two items, and conclusions involving this dimension should therefore be treated carefully.</p>

<p>Aside from the Self-Sacrifice dimension, all of the PV and PSM dimensions barely meet the conventional 0.7 threshold for the Cronbach’s alpha reliability measure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0275074012440031">Robinson, Shaver, &amp; Wrightsman, 1991</xref>, p. 13). Most of our dimensions only consist of two to four items, and Cronbach’s alpha depends on the number of included items. Therefore, we report an additional measure of reliability for each latent dimension, Jöreskog’s rho (also denoted composite/construct reliability), which is used more widely in CFA analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0275074012440031">Diamantopoulos &amp; Siguaw, 2000</xref>, p. 90; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0275074012440031">Fornell &amp; Larcker, 1981</xref>, p. 45). Here, the threshold of 0.6 is fulfilled for almost all of the PV and PSM dimensions―again, however, with special caution concerning the Compassion dimension. Nonetheless, the measurement instruments for PV and PSM overall perform well, as the fit indicators reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0275074012440031">Table 4</xref> meet the conventional cutoff points (above 0.90 for the comparative fit index (CFI), below 0.1 for the standardized root mean residual [SRMR], and equal to or below the cutoff point<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0275074012440031">5</xref></sup> for the root mean square error of approximation [RMSEA] indicator), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0275074012440031">Bentler, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0275074012440031">Hu &amp; Bentler, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0275074012440031">Jöreskog &amp; Sörbom, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0275074012440031">Kelloway, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0275074012440031">Schumacker &amp; Lomax, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0275074012440031">Williams, Vandenberg, &amp; Edwards, 2009</xref>).

<p>The analysis mapping the possible relationships between the PSM and PV indexes includes three control variables. First, we include the public managers’ gender, as one could imagine different values on some PSM and PV dimensions for female managers than for males (e.g., emphasis on Compassion and User Focus compared with Attraction to Policy Making and Budget Keeping). Second, we include the age of the public managers, as previous studies have shown that as individuals get older, they tend to develop more altruistic values and motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0275074012440031">McAdams &amp; de St. Aubin, 1992</xref>, p. 1005; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0275074012440031">Pandey &amp; Stazyk, 2008</xref>). Finally, we also controlled for organizational task―that is, the self-reported main task of the organization where the public manager is employed―as “the place you sit” has been shown to have a significant influence on motivation and possibly also values (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0275074012440031">Steinhaus &amp; Perry, 1996</xref>). Organizational task was coded into a dummy variable where 1 = <italic>service delivery organizational task</italic> (social welfare/care, health, education, culture) and 0 = <italic>regulative/administrative task</italic> (energy/environment, infrastructure, business/trade, foreign relations, tax/trade regulation, other economic or juridical tasks).</p>

<p>Concerning the first finding, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0275074012440031">Table 5</xref> shows that there are no significant correlations between any of the value dimensions and Self-Sacrifice PSM (this is also the case for the bivariate correlations). Self-Sacrifice is the PSM dimension with the least direction; hence, it is not surprising that it is uncorrelated with the different value dimensions that conceptualize varying specifications of what the desirable is. In other words, Self-Sacrifice represents pure energy without specified direction.</p>
<p>Concerning the second finding, there are four robust correlations in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0275074012440031">Table 5</xref>. These correlations are highly significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) when controlling for gender, age, and organizational tasks, and Pearson’s <italic>r</italic> is higher than 0.1 for all of them. Three of them involve Commitment to the Public Interest, thus indicating that we were right to expect that PV was most strongly related to this PSM dimension. The four associations are as follows:</p>
<list id="list1-0275074012440031" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Rule Abidance values are positively correlated with Commitment to the Public Interest PSM.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The Public at Large values are positively correlated with Commitment to the Public Interest PSM.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Professionalism values are positively correlated with Commitment to the Public Interest PSM.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Balancing Interests values are positively correlated with Attraction to Policy Making PSM.</p></list-item></list>
<p>Apart from these associations, there are significant correlations at a 0.05 level with a Pearson’s <italic>r</italic> around 0.1 between (a) Efficient Supply values and Commitment to the Public Interest PSM, (b) User Focus values and Compassion PSM, (c) Budget Keeping values and Attraction to Policy Making PSM, and (d) Balancing Interests values and Compassion PSM (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0275074012440031">Table 5</xref>). These correlations are, however, not as robust as the abovementioned four correlations. Especially the associations involving the PSM dimension Compassion should be carefully interpreted due to weak measurement validity. Accordingly, only the four first-mentioned robust associations will be discussed in greater detail.</p>
<p>Rule Abidance values are part of a hierarchical mode of governance (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0275074012440031">Table 1</xref>). We find that managers with these values tend to have higher levels of Commitment to the Public Interest than managers who find these values less important. These managers do not seem to see rules as red tape, that is, as having a negative effect on organization performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0275074012440031">Bozeman &amp; Feeney, 2011</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0275074012440031">Christensen et al. (2011)</xref> argue that it is not unrealistic for managers to improve the delivery of public goods by using an approach to public administration relying on law-based priorities and processes, and the managers with high Commitment to the Public Interest may either see due process and loyalty to rules as desirable end goals or as ways to ensure the well-being of the relevant “public.” As there is no terminological overlap between the PV and PSM dimensions, Rule Abidance clearly indicates direction and can be interpreted as a specification of “public interest” in the PSM dimension.</p>
<p>Managers attaching high importance to the values summarized in The Public at Large dimension tend to have higher levels of Commitment to the Public Interest, meaning that managers who view accountability, public insight, and transparency as desirable also tend to be motivated by Commitment to the Public Interest. This is hardly surprising, as this PSM dimension theoretically and operationally concerns the motivation to obtain outcomes which (seen by the respondent) best serve the long-run survival and well-being of a social collective construed as a “public” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0275074012440031">Bozeman, 2007</xref>, p. 17). All in all, The Public at Large and Commitment to the Public Interest are terminologically and operationally very close. It is therefore surprising that the association is not stronger than we see it in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0275074012440031">Table 5</xref> (Pearson’s <italic>r</italic> = 0.131).</p>
<p>Professionalism is the last value dimension positively correlated with Commitment to the Public Interest PSM. This result corresponds very neatly with the functionalist approach within the sociology of professions, as professionals are expected to be committed to a service ideal focusing on the common good and high service quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0275074012440031">Freidson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0275074012440031">Goode, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0275074012440031">Parsons, 1954</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0275074012440031">Graaf (2011</xref>, p. 295) puts it: “Professionalism is important and that doesn’t just mean knowledge, it also means that you behave decently and follow the rules of the game. Your behavior should be guided by the public interest.” The normative ideal for strong professions is that professional norms―rather than empathy or political decisions―should guide behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0275074012440031">Andersen &amp; Pedersen, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0275074012440031">Kjeldsen, 2012</xref>). In line with this, it would have been surprising if public managers subscribing to Professionalism values were motivated by either Compassion or Attraction to Policy Making. As there is no terminological overlap between the PV and PSM dimensions, Professionalism clearly indicates a direction and can be interpreted as a specification of “public interest” in the PSM dimension.</p>
<p>Managers who find Balancing Interests values important tend to have higher levels of Attraction to Policy Making. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0275074012440031">Perry and Wise (1990</xref>, p. 368) explicitly mentioned advocacy for special interests as a motive behind PSM and argued that this advocacy, where individuals believe that their choices assist special groups, facilitates the inclusion of a range of policy perspectives in pluralistic societies. This may contribute to making participation in the process of policy formulation exciting and therefore motivating. The positive correlation between Balancing Interests values and Attraction to Policy Making motivation thus indicates that the managers who see mediating and balancing societal interests as desirable are at the same time motivated to participate in policy making themselves. At first glance, one may suggest the existence of a terminological overlap between the PV and PSM dimensions. When considering the items more closely, however, the overlap disappears. Balancing Interests thus indicates direction and may be interpreted as a specification of Attraction to Public Policy Making.</p>
<p>Especially regarding the relationship between The Public at Large and Commitment to the Public Interest―but also the other three discussed relationships between public values and PSM dimensions―it is surprising that the correlations are not stronger. It is also noteworthy that only The Public at Large, Professionalism, and Balancing Interests values have significant and positive correlations with the overall PSM construct (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0275074012440031">Table 5</xref>). Part of the reason may be methodological, as the concepts were measured differently due to the conceptual difference between values (which, as “desirables,” are more or less important) and PSM (measured by Likert-type questions where respondents agree/disagree to statements concerning motivation).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0275074012440031">
<title>Separation, Integration, or Constructive Interplay?</title>
<p>The previous analysis has shown how values and motivation to some extent are conceptually overlapping and empirically related. What consequences does this have? As mentioned earlier, different strategies can be pursued: concept separation (e.g., keeping the two concepts clean and apart) or integration (e.g., including a measure of PV in the PSM construct).</p>
<p>Let us first consider a situation in which motivations and values are kept separate. This seems useful at first glance, not least because keeping the concepts separate facilitates empirical investigations of the relationship between them. However, absolute separation is hardly fruitful. First, removing the motivational aspect completely from a value makes little sense. If values could by definition not motivate, it would not be possible to speak of strong values, and we would be left with cold, “academic” values with no appeal to pride and obligations. Second, the PSM concept implies direction, namely providing meaningful public service. Both the theoretical definitions of PSM and the operational measures include allusions to (public) values such as altruism and civic duty. It is also difficult to imagine a person being public service motivated without holding any public values. Empirically, we do find that Self-sacrifice is uncorrelated with all of the PV dimensions, indicating that separation is possible, but the four robust associations between PV dimensions and the remaining PSM dimensions indicate that besides the discussed conceptual overlaps, there are empirical correlations.</p>
<p>Does this mean that we should pursue the second strategy, integration? One way of doing so is to include a PV dimension in the PSM construct. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0275074012440031">Kim and Vandenabeele (2010)</xref> suggest that Commitment to Public Interest must be redefined as Commitment to Public Values and that it needs to focus more on a personal disposition to pursue public values. As expected, we find that Commitment to the Public Interest is the one PSM dimension which has significant positive correlations with most PV dimensions: The Public at Large, Rule Abidance, Professionalism, and (although less robustly) Efficient Supply, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0275074012440031">Table 5</xref>, indicating that the dimension already captures a <italic>general</italic> disposition to pursue public values. Our results do, however, also suggest that the integration of PV in the construct can be expected to raise a number of problems, as some PV dimensions are uncorrelated (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0275074012440031">Table A2</xref> in the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0275074012440031">appendix</xref>) or can even be negatively correlated. When controlling for the tendency to declare all values as highly important, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0275074012440031">Andersen et al. (2012)</xref>, for example, find negative correlations between Professionalism values and Societal Interest values. Next, an important question would be which values to include in a joint measure of PSM and PV. This study included 18 values, and the empirical analysis could indicate that values related to The Public at Large, Rule Abidance, Professionalism, and Efficient Supply should be included in a new Commitment to Public Values PSM dimension. However, we cannot be certain that another empirical analysis will show the same correlations. Note also, that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0275074012440031">Beck Jørgensen and Bozeman (2007)</xref> listed more than 60 values in their PV inventory, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0275074012440031">van der Wal (2008)</xref> constructed a set of 20 organizational values extracted from several hundred values. Moreover, integrating public values in the PSM construct may cement values which are relevant today but which could change over time. Finally, we cannot investigate the relationship between PV and PSM empirically if it already exists by definition (i.e., if public values are included in the PSM definition).</p>
<p>In sum, integration appears as the least satisfying solution, and despite conceptual overlap we suggest that “public value” and “public service motivation” are kept analytically distinct as providing direction and energy respectively, that is, distinguishing between what is most desirable (among different values) and whether one wants to act on this. This suggestion is also supported by the fact that it is not always possible to act to obtain the desirable because of practical restrictions or conflicting values. If individuals hold mutually inconsistent values, such as values related to User Focus and Rule abidance, they must choose between them. Moreover, values can be identified on systemic levels whereas motivation concerns the individual, implying that conflict may exist between the values at the organizational and individual levels. Thus, keeping public values and PSM analytical distinct allows for a constructive interplay, that is, separate but related and obviously needed empirical investigations.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Until now, the respective literatures have primarily investigated the concepts of PSM and PV separately. This article contributes to the debate by investigating them simultaneously, conceptually as well as empirically.</p>
<p>The conceptual discussion reveals how the two concepts cannot be totally separated, as values can be motivating, and motivation is often oriented toward something desirable (e.g., values). Though largely complementary, we must therefore accept that the two concepts overlap. Conversely, the discussion also revealed severe drawbacks connected to integrating values and motivation into a single construct. For example, values are numerous and often conflicting and cannot easily be integrated into the PSM construct.</p>
<p>The empirical illustration concerning public managers shows how PSM and public values are associated empirically in a manner suggesting that the approaches should pay attention to each other but which does not allow total integration. The PSM dimension Self-sacrifice is not associated with any of the value dimensions, but four of the value dimensions are robustly correlated with a PSM dimension in a theoretically comprehensible way, although the correlations are generally weaker than could be expected given the conceptual affinities. In sum, we suggest that values and motivations as associating to direction and energy are kept analytically distinct allowing for separate empirical investigations.</p>
<p>The measures of public values and PSM in this article can be discussed, and the low reliability of the Compassion measure means that the findings relating to this dimension should be carefully interpreted. The generalizability of a study of Danish public managers is also limited, especially because they all attended similar master’s degree programs, but it increases the internal validity of the studied associations, because many potential confounders are constant. Finally, other value typologies, for example, the seven value constellations in the Beck Jørgensen-Bozeman typology, may also prove useful in future PV-PSM research.</p>
<p>Despite these limitations, the exploratory empirical analysis serves to show how research in PV and PSM may proceed in the future. To be certain, the two concepts can be analyzed completely separated if it is plausible to assume that “the other concept” is approximately constant. For instance, if a group of employees can be expected to hold similar values, the relationship between their PSM and performance can be analyzed without including values in the analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0275074012440031">Brewer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0275074012440031">Perry &amp; Wise, 1990</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0275074012440031">Alonso and Lewis’s (2001)</xref> study of the link between PSM and job performance among 35,000 federal, white-collar employees offers an example of such a study. Similarly, it is possible to analyze how different values affect behavior for individuals without including motivation in the analysis if miniscule variations in their motivation can plausibly be assumed.</p>
<p>However, these assumptions are seldom realistic, and in a number of cases it is highly relevant to investigate both PV and PSM. First, the correlations between Commitment to the Public Interest and the PV dimensions suggest that studies in PV may help specifying what is actually associated with the rather vague term <italic>public interest</italic>. Also, PV studies may help identifying values related to other PSM dimensions. The identified associations are theoretically comprehensible, and patterns like these might by very interesting to analyze if the different combinations also lead to different behaviors. As such, we already know that PSM can affect public service behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0275074012440031">Alonso &amp; Lewis, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0275074012440031">Brewer, 2008</xref>), but similar studies are missing regarding the behavioral implications of different public values. Second, PV-PSM studies may help identifying situations where values indicate direction but there is no energy because of practical restrictions or, conversely, situations where motivation is high but left without much direction. Self-sacrifice is an interesting special case here. Third, combined studies in PV and PSM may identify different types of conflicts and their consequences. Motivation is related to the individual level in contrast to values which very often are expressed and safeguarded at systemic levels (e.g., strategic documents, legislation, organizational rules, rituals, etc.), and tensions may arise between values at the systemic level and PSM at the individual level. Of interest are also studies of the impact of conflicting organizational values on PSM, the impact of inconsistent individual values on PSM, and relationships between conflicting values and inconsistent PSM profiles.</p>
<p>Altogether our conceptual and empirical discussion points toward a constructive interplay in which separate empirical measures of PV and PSM are used together or apart, depending on an active choice based on an awareness of the conceptual overlaps and differences. More empirical work is, however, required to clarify the various ways that PV and PSM can interact in practice.</p>

<p>The cutoff point for RMSEA is much debated in the literature, but most scholars rely on values below 0.06.
