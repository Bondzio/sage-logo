<abstract>
<p>Pharmaceutical products are commonly relied upon by professionals, and correspondingly patients, within a wide range of healthcare contexts. This dependence, combined with the inherent risk and uncertainty surrounding both medical practice and the drugs it harnesses, points towards the importance of trust in the pharmaceutical industry – a subject which has been much neglected by researchers. This article begins to address this deficiency by mapping out a conceptual framework which may form a useful basis for future research into this important topic. The often negative portrayal of the pharmaceutical industry in the public sphere belies a state of <italic>apparent</italic> confidence in its products. The role of prescribing professionals as ‘mediators of trust’ amid a faceless system of production and, alongside regulators, as bases of assurance in the quality of drugs goes some way towards explaining this contradiction. Recent policy moves towards fostering increased patient ‘expertise’ and responsibility for illness management, a widening of over-the-counter medication availability and a growing market of products (mainstream and illicit) via the Internet suggest this role of ‘facework’ in facilitating trust may be becoming more marginal. This heightened requirement for trusting amid the unfamiliar, and an apparent willingness to do so, underlines the need for further research into trust in the industry – both mainstream and underground – and its products. Within this discussion an agenda for furthering our understandings of the political-economy of the pharmaceutical industry becomes apparent, one which might be most effectively approached by way of a broader political-economy of hope and trust.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Medicine has been seen by many as one of the central pillars of the enlightenment dream (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1363459309360783">Porter, 1995</xref>), with the pharmaceutical industry playing a vital part in this <italic>progress</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1363459309360783">1</xref></sup> Indeed, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1363459309360783">Brockliss (1995)</xref> points out, the separation between the domains of physicians and apothecaries – or more lately, medicine and pharmacy<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1363459309360783">2</xref></sup> – is far from a natural one and it is quite conceivable that events may have at one point united them (as with surgery and medicine), in a return to the unity of classical times. However the division remains to the present, with the expanding ability of clinical medicine to counteract morbidity and mortality crucially dependent on the development of more effective and refined pharmacological interventions.</p>
<p>One characteristic that these two domains share is that of uncertainty, in that therapeutic treatment provided by medical professionals, as with the pharmacological interventions often harnessed by them, are both intrinsically and unavoidably dealing with degrees of the unknowable. The magnitude of the risk linked to this uncertainty should not be underestimated – indeed adverse drug reactions cause ‘considerable morbidity, mortality, and extra costs’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1363459309360783">Pirmohamed et al., 2004</xref>: 15). It is within such a context that the pharmaceutical industry works to develop and justify the safety, efficacy and ‘need’ of its products beyond reasonable doubt. The increasing awareness of such uncertainty within late-modernity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1363459309360783">Alaszewski and Brown, 2007</xref>), and concurrently the expanded use of products of largely anonymous corporations and associated abstract systems of knowledge, forms the background context of this article.</p>
<p>Although the bulk of newly marketed medicines are in fact replicas of existing ones (‘me too’ products), the industry has nonetheless been seen as expanding the potential for increasingly effective interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1363459309360783">Henry and Lexchin, 2002</xref>: 1590) in a wide range of areas such as heart disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1363459309360783">Konstam, 2003</xref>) or cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1363459309360783">Charatan, 2001</xref>). This success, and the future prospects it points towards, is one of the factors explaining the heightened attention paid to ‘big pharma’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1363459309360783">Law, 2006</xref>) and their influence on society, governments, healthcare systems, professionals and patients. Alongside this more positive interest however are a range of concerns and fears over the safety, commercialization and societal impact of these same interventions:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Clearly pharmaceuticals have an important role to play in the alleviation of human suffering and the saving of lives. They are also, however, the source of much controversy, contestation and conflict, not simply in terms of their development, testing and marketing, but in terms of their very meaning and consumption. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1363459309360783">Williams et al., 2008</xref>: 813)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>To unpick these concerns more neatly (if somewhat schematically), they can be seen as revolving around economic, political and social impacts. Economically, the pharmaceutical industry is highly profitable and therefore concerns about how much drugs cost healthcare systems such as the English NHS (£7 billion annually – as of 2005 – of which 80 per cent is spent on products under patent) are associated with criticisms that the pricings of drugs are over-inflated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1363459309360783">House of Commons Health Committee, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1363459309360783">Moynihan, 2003</xref>). The converse argument is that the testing and trialling of new products is financially very risky and therefore that profits are vital incentives which promote the discovery of new treatment breakthroughs. The industry also argues that expensive products may still offer value-for-money by reducing the need for more costly hospitalization of patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1363459309360783">Office of Health Economics, 2008</xref>: 82).</p>
<p>The financial and corresponding political might of the industry enables it to consolidate this highly profitable, oligopolistic supplier position and influence decision making in its favour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1363459309360783">Abraham, 2002</xref>). A Parliamentary investigation into the effects of the pharmaceutical industry on the NHS suggests its influence is insidious, pervasive and, at times, underhand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1363459309360783">House of Commons Health Committee, 2005</xref>). This impact is held to extend to society more widely:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>What has been described as the ‘medicalisation’ of society – the belief that every problem requires medical treatment – may also be attributed in part to the activities of the pharmaceutical industry. While the pharmaceutical industry cannot be blamed for creating unhealthy reliance on, and over-use of, medicines, it has certainly exacerbated it. There has been a trend towards categorising more and more individuals as ‘abnormal’ or in need of drug treatment. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1363459309360783">House of Commons Health Committee, 2005</xref>: 4)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This situation which the parliamentary Health Committee describes makes evident the salience of trust within the debates outlined thus far. That society, government, healthcare systems, professionals and patients are at once ever more dependent on pharmacological interventions, and yet that the motives of those behind these drugs are increasingly questioned, points towards a potential crisis of confidence, or trust. That is not to say that these intricate and multifaceted relationships are reducible to trust, but rather that trust, as a process of acting through inferred knowledge in the face of the inherent uncertainty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1363459309360783">Möllering, 2001</xref>) already described, is an important element within this complexity. Quite how significant is a vital empirical question in itself which must not be simply assumed away. However there is a growing literature on trust in relation to healthcare (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1363459309360783">Brownlie et al., 2008</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1363459309360783">Calnan and Rowe, 2008</xref> for recent summaries) which points towards the likely salience of trust in this area – given the prevalence of risk, vulnerability and uncertainty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1363459309360783">Luhmann, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1363459309360783">Möllering, 2006</xref>) among the relationships existing between the industry and society, government, healthcare systems, professionals and patients.</p>
<p>While trust in relation to medical systems and in professionals has received substantial academic interest and analysis, trust around the pharmaceutical industry and its products is a relatively neglected area. There is a range of studies which address or reflect notions of trust within their analysis or history of key issues relating to the pharmaceutical industry (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1363459309360783">Abraham, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1363459309360783">Church and Tansey, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1363459309360783">Moynihan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1363459309360783">O’Neill, 2002</xref>), yet there exists a paucity of analysis explicitly mapping out the conceptual terrain around the process of trust in this regard. The article that follows will first outline an understanding of the concept of trust itself before going on to consider the theoretical application and practical research possibilities pertaining to patients/public, professionals and government institutions (especially the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence) and their respective trust in the pharmaceutical industry. A fourth and final section will consider social and policy changes which may be heightening the extent to which consumption of pharmaceutical products occurs in the absence of ‘facework’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1363459309360783">3</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1363459309360783">Giddens, 1991</xref>) – and the ramifications for vulnerability and associated political economies of trust and hope. The analysis presented here relates in a specific sense to the UK context, for example in terms of a publicly funded system which drives particular perceptions of profit making third-parties. The concepts raised are nonetheless likely to be transferable, although their relative import and context-specific manifestations may of course vary.</p>

<title>Trust, confidence and ‘facework’</title>
<p>If vulnerability and uncertainty are the conditions in which trust becomes necessary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1363459309360783">Möllering, 2006</xref>), its functioning can be understood as a process of constructing knowledge to bridge over this future uncertainty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1363459309360783">Möllering, 2001</xref>). Essentially this is done by ‘assuming away’ the unknowable through building a framework of inferred knowledge based on that which is known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1363459309360783">Möllering, 2001</xref>). Central to these assumptions are beliefs about the trustee (upon which one is dependent and to which one is vulnerable to) – especially regarding benevolent motivations and competencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1363459309360783">Poortinga and Pidgeon, 2003</xref>). This immediately raises questions over the trustworthiness of drug manufacturers – in that their <italic>motivations</italic> are prioritized towards shareholders rather than the best interests of patients, professionals or healthcare institutions. Moreover public perceptions, developed most readily through the mass media, of failures in safety (thalidomide and, more recently, Vioxx) or uncertain effectiveness (Prozac – see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1363459309360783">Robinson, 2008</xref>) of certain drugs may elicit further doubts over the <italic>competence</italic> of the industry – and indeed its regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1363459309360783">Abraham, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>It should be clarified that although trust is often negotiated <italic>in relation to</italic> systems of expertise (and knowledge thereof), people do not actually trust <italic>in</italic> these broader systems or institutions. For as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1363459309360783">Luhmann (1988</xref>: 98) elucidates – ‘trust is only required if a bad outcome would make you regret your action’. It is in this sense that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1363459309360783">Luhmann (1979</xref>: 50) distinguishes between generalized confidence in, or beliefs about, systems (‘systems trust’) and the communicative process by which people trust within specific temporal and spatial scenarios (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1363459309360783">Jalava, 2001</xref>). It is only by the latter, very much socialized, process where people can be let down and therefore where trust becomes relevant – as ‘a solution for specific problems of risk’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1363459309360783">Luhmann, 1988</xref>: 95). More expressly, medication users are not at risk from ‘the industry’ or ‘Medicine’ as abstract entities, but only from specific drugs – which are prescribed, recommended or described by a community of actors (professional and lay) with whom the user communicates in negotiating trust. Yet beliefs about the pharmaceutical industry may still be crucial to the perceptions of safety or risks around the consumption of certain medicines. This confidence, or lack thereof, in the industry (again located around motivations and competencies) contributes background knowledge on which perceptions of risk, and therefore a need to trust, are made.</p>
<p>It may be the case though that the consumer does not even consider the possible risk of a particular medicine (this will depend on awareness of factors such as possible side-effects, e.g. Roaccutane, or addictive properties, e.g. tranquilizers). In this sense they are in a state of confidence and trust is irrelevant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1363459309360783">Luhmann, 1979</xref>). Such confidence is based on continued positive experience of the same system (on many levels akin to ‘system-trust’), by which this ongoing affirmative ‘feedback’ dispels conceptions of risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1363459309360783">Luhmann, 1979</xref>: 50). Where this positive feedback breaks down to a greater or lesser extent, trust becomes necessary as risk becomes apparent. And yet even where negative feedback develops, perceptions of risk (and thus need for trust) are very much subjective phenomena (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1363459309360783">Kierkegaard, 1957</xref>). For example, negative information might go unnoticed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1363459309360783">Kierkegaard, 1957</xref>), be explained away as an anomaly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1363459309360783">MORI, 2004</xref>) – and therefore irrelevant to future expectations – or be disassociated from the person’s own particular situation. This latter notion of attribution will be returned to in the next section.</p>
<p>Although conceptually distinct, there exist many commonalities between assumed knowledge and beliefs about systems (and corresponding system-trust) on the one hand, and <italic>trust</italic> as a communication-based, interactive process of dealing with risk on the other. As suggested already, fundamental to both are perceptions of motivations and competencies; interests and capabilities. Both involve assumptions that the trustee, or system, is willing and able to put their interests first and has no agenda to the contrary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1363459309360783">Williams, 2007</xref>). And both are subjective in that their assumptions are based on what the actor chooses to focus upon or, more or less wittingly, disregard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1363459309360783">Kierkegaard, 1957</xref>). For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1363459309360783">Giddens (1991)</xref>, ‘system-trust’ is extended as one key form of knowledge into situations where trust is required. Thus where trust is the socialized process of bridging uncertainty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1363459309360783">Möllering, 2001</xref>), knowledge about abstract systems provides necessary (if not sufficient) building blocks in this constructive enterprise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1363459309360783">Schutz, 1972</xref>). For example the interests and capabilities of certain systems/institutions may be perceived as having a profound impact on the likely competence and care (i.e. trustworthiness) of the individuals working within them.</p>
<p>Concurrently though, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1363459309360783">Schutz (1972)</xref> suggests that understandings of abstract systems or institutions are very much inferred through instances of contact with those elements which are more visible and/or tangible to us. Hence the anonymous becomes conceivable, and able to be appraised, via certain more direct experiences. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1363459309360783">Giddens (1991)</xref> similarly notes the association of ‘faceless’ systems of abstract knowledge (such as medicine) with more direct, interpersonal instances of ‘facework’. The interaction between a professional and service-user is one example of such an ‘access point’ into the abstract system – ‘the meeting ground of facework and faceless commitments’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1363459309360783">Giddens, 1990</xref>: 83) – where the competence of medical expertise is embodied in the caring professional, thus engendering trust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1363459309360783">Brown, 2008</xref>). That these communicative instances are so vital for trust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1363459309360783">Brown, 2008</xref>), and yet seemingly becoming less likely through social and policy developments, is of fundamental concern to this article. These concerns will be returned to in the final main section.</p>

<title>Mediating the faceless system</title>
<p>Of the various ‘systems’ involved in the provision of late-modern healthcare, it is the pharmaceutical industry which arguably faces the biggest challenge in terms of public confidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1363459309360783">Fontanarosa et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1363459309360783">PWC, 2006</xref>). Other abstract systems, such as that of medical knowledge, are embodied for the public through medical professionals – thus providing access points for the lay person through which ‘facework’ (communication) can bring about trust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1363459309360783">Giddens, 1991</xref>). In contrast the industry is largely faceless and therefore unable actively to win trust. What little is known about the industry – which may contribute to system (mis)trust – is through media reflection, either factual or fictional, which is often of a negative disposition.</p>
<p>Drug manufacturers devote significant resources to generating and controlling information relating to their products as a means of influencing patients, the public and healthcare professionals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1363459309360783">Abraham, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1363459309360783">Collier and Iheanacho, 2002</xref>). Preferences among editors of scientific journals, and the newspaper journalists and editors who they influence, for positive findings (Entwistle, 1995) assist this process which results in a profusion of stories relating to important ‘breakthroughs’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1363459309360783">4</xref></sup> Yet this affirmative coverage is tempered by more negative depictions of an industry putting ‘Profits Before Patient Safety’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1363459309360783">Ennis and Slattery-Moschkau, 2006</xref>), making victims of ordinary people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1363459309360783">Gabe et al., 1991</xref>) and compromising the well-being of those taking part in trials – such as occurred at Northwick Park (a hospital in Greater London where six men suffered multiple organ failure while taking part in drug trial in March, 2006). The following newspaper excerpt, quoted by Stobbart and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1363459309360783">2007</xref>: 567), highlights the multifaceted questioning of trust which media coverage of the event raised:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>We should examine the extent to which the public can trust all the parties involved. Do we trust TeGenero whose chief scientific officer has been very open with the media, yet which has never brought a product to market before? Do we trust the research company Parexel, still recruiting healthy volunteers for other trials? Do we trust the research ethics committee that agreed this study could take place? And do we trust the motives of the NHS in allowing such a contract research organisation to exist on NHS premises – for gain?</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Such is this multi-dimensionality that a key component in understanding the implications of Northwick Park for trust in the pharmaceutical industry is that of attribution – which actor(s) are perceived as decisive for positive outcomes (the trustees). Analysis of media coverage underlines the significance of incidences being typified in a particular light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1363459309360783">Stobbart et al., 2007</xref>) – for example focusing on scientists and medics rather than the manufacturer and the conductor of the trial.</p>
<p>This notion of attribution raises important empirical questions around system-trust in the pharmaceutical industry more generally – in terms of the multiple foci on which trust is built, the extent of this multidimensionality, and the interaction between, and relative effect of, different dimensions. As set out above, ‘system-trust’ has been conceptualized as relating to the belief that the interests and capabilities of the system/institution are congruent with putting the interests of the ‘truster’ first – where apparently alternative agendas would undermine this (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1363459309360783">Williams, 2007</xref>). Yet while titles such as ‘Profits Before Patient Safety’ highlight the alternative agenda of prioritizing shareholders, the picture is evidently not as straightforward as an aggregation of negative media portrayals implies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1363459309360783">
<title>The multi-dimensionality and obscurity of trust</title>
<p>General perceptions (positive and negative) of the industry thus constitute just one dimension of the multi-layered trust-constructs involved. The possibilities for developing a more complete picture of trust are hindered somewhat by the imperfect nature of market communication – in terms of information flows regarding products to the consumer, and moreover demand signals between consumer and manufacturer. Prima facie where system-trust, and therefore trust, is problematic, concerns should be voiced and/or the market exited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1363459309360783">Hirschman, 1970</xref>). Although preference for complementary or alternative medicine approaches due to concerns around side-effects (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1363459309360783">Calnan et al., 2005</xref>) would be one clear indicator of such a shift in demand, the profitability of the industry already referred to seemingly suggests only a modest level of exiting occurs.

Therefore the issue of real choice (as presented by the professional) – and thus trust – fails to emerge where the latter risks are considered sufficiently large.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>At a conceptual level, these loose ‘hypotheses’ suggest the salience of choice, confidence and attribution – all of which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1363459309360783">Luhmann (1979)</xref> posits as bearing decisively on trust. More practically, four of the five statements underline the vital role of the prescribing professionals in influencing and/or understanding trust in pharmaceutical products.</p>
<p>Choice is in many senses essential for trust to be enacted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1363459309360783">Luhmann, 1979</xref>: 24) – risk and thus contingency must exist in order for there to be a prospect of being let down (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1363459309360783">Luhmann, 1988</xref>: 98). Where perceptions suggest there is nothing to lose, then the lack of necessary choice negates trust. Thus failure is an explicit possibility of trust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1363459309360783">Dunn, 1988</xref>), as opposed to confidence where negative consequences are not consciously considered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1363459309360783">Luhmann, 1979</xref>). A distinction between trust and confidence is furthermore useful in considering why trust may be entirely irrelevant for some consumers of prescribed drugs. For if the possibility of adverse side-effects or more serious longer term consequences of taking a particular drug is not consciously entertained then trust is extraneous – consumers live instead in a state of risk-unaware ‘confidence’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1363459309360783">5</xref></sup></p>

<title>The role of professionals as a basis for attributing trust</title>
<p>It is within considerations of confidence that the importance of attribution becomes apparent. For as much as an individual may view the motives of the industry as circumspect, and note the history of tragic unforeseen consequences (as was the case with thalidomide and Vioxx), these perceptions are not necessarily connected with the anti-inflammatory medication he/she is prescribed by the family doctor. Such a lack of association between the bigger picture of the pharma ‘system’ and the lived individual experience of illness and certain specific medications may be crucial in explaining instances where trust is relatively unproblematic.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1363459309360783">6</xref></sup> Attribution drives trust in this sense by determining those aspects which the truster chooses, or rather is encouraged, to focus upon – or disregard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1363459309360783">Kierkegaard, 1957</xref>: 55).</p>
<p>At the very heart of trust is an inferential construction of knowledge, and attribution is also apparent here: in the choice of which known and/or familiar objects are to be used to infer assumptions about that which is unknowable/uncertain. Hence greater or lesser degrees of uncertainty and risk may be perceived towards a certain medication, and system-trust in the pharmaceutical industry may be compromised – yet the inference that it is necessary, appropriate and safe may be arrived at through trust based on the doctor. The trust or confidence in the medical professionals who typically prescribe more powerful, and therefore risky, medication (than over-the-counter sources) may in this way act as an ‘inoculation’ against the uncertainty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1363459309360783">Elliott, 2004</xref>: 73) surrounding system-trust in the industry – due to the way that interactions with individuals are more decisive for trust than views of wider institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1363459309360783">Calnan and Sanford, 2004</xref>). Regardless of the financial motives of the companies making the product, its potential effect on the safety and health of the patient may be seen as being ‘regulated’ or ‘checked’ by the prescriber.</p>

<title>Tensions across a dual role: professionals as trustees and trusters</title>
<p>It is in this light that the long-established separation between the pharmaceutical industry and physicians referred to in the introduction becomes quite crucial. It is the impartiality of prescribing professionals which enables them to be seen as both willing and able to ensure the best interests of the patient, regardless of the interests of those involved in manufacturing the pharmaceutical basis of the intervention. Though of course inherent to this trustworthiness is the trust and checking enacted by professionals themselves in pharmaceutical manufacturers and their products – as applied in appraising the validity of reported research and further information gleamed through contact with representatives of the industry. So long as this latter professional trust remains ‘backstage’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1363459309360783">Goffman, 1959</xref>), or that the employment of such trust is considered to be well informed and highly conditional, then there exists the potential for the profitability of the pharmaceuticals market to be seen in a positive light – due to the competing alternatives open to the prescribing professional in ensuring the optimum path of treatment for the patient.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1363459309360783">7</xref></sup> The role of the professional as both trustee (for patients) and a truster in the knowledge and pharmaceutical products they apply is nonetheless unavoidable yet precarious.</p>
<p>Were the impartiality (or trust judgements) of professionals to be called into question regarding their prescribing function, then their pivotal role as trustees would be decidedly compromised. For then there would exist other interests besides those of the patients which were being prioritized, and rather than an independent custodian over the quality of medication, the physician would instead be an agent of the pharmaceutical industry. Hence the notion of drug company representatives and their interactions with doctors is another feature of the industry which has attracted increased concern (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1363459309360783">Breen, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1363459309360783">Katz et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1363459309360783">Moynihan, 2003</xref>): ‘Critics argue that a culture of industry gift giving creates entitlements and obligations for doctors that conflict with their primary obligation to patients’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1363459309360783">Moynihan, 2003</xref>: 1189). There is increasing evidence that the industry’s promotional tactics do influence prescribing habits, at least in the short term (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1363459309360783">Watkins et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1363459309360783">Wazana, 2000</xref>), and are partially visible to patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1363459309360783">Katz et al., 2003</xref>). While some professionals avoid these interactions with industry (suggesting their lack of trust), and the culture of hospitality and gifts is increasingly questioned (RCP, 2009), there are still myriad ways in which drug manufacturers can, and do, influence prescribing.</p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1363459309360783">Breen (2004)</xref> argues, there is a general lack of reflexivity among the medical profession towards this insidious influence, with most clinicians believing that they are not affected by their interactions with industry representatives, in spite of evidence to the contrary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1363459309360783">Kassirer, 2005</xref>). Moreover the equally insidious effects of sponsored trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1363459309360783">Helmchen, 2004</xref>) and drug samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1363459309360783">Adair and Holmgren, 2005</xref>) are also influential in the passage of drugs from ‘bench to bedside’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1363459309360783">House of Commons Health Committee, 2005</xref>). While these practices and influences occur very much within the ‘backstage’ of medicine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1363459309360783">Goffman, 1959</xref>) and therefore are unable to undermine esteem in the competence and care of the clinician, the increased attention being paid to the influence of the industry may be making a lack of consistency between backstage machinations and the front-stage presentation of the physician more palpable, which in turn could be decidedly problematic for trust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1363459309360783">Fugelli, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>The techniques noted above, while approached with contrasting levels of reflexivity by professionals, are nonetheless more clearly industry-imbued and therefore make such reflexivity – and a conditional trust – possible. A much more innate action of professionals, and therefore one which is much more likely to be approached via confidence (in the absence of doubt) rather than trust, is their keeping up-to-date with evidence of effective treatment approaches and prescribing. This may occur through the following of guidelines as produced by NICE (see following section) and other professional bodies, but is also performed on an individual or collective basis through the assimilation of evidence via journal articles.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1363459309360783">Angell (2005)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1363459309360783">Horton (2004)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1363459309360783">Smith (2005)</xref> are (or were recently) editors of three of the most prominent and respected journals in the field<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1363459309360783">8</xref></sup> and all note the pervasive and manipulative effects of the industry, the latter two underlining not just the (less subtle) issue of advertising in journals but particularly the influence over original studies such as clinical trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1363459309360783">Smith, 2005</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1363459309360783">Jefferson et al., 2009</xref>). The relatively blind trust or confidence placed in these findings (by professionals) and the correspondingly unwitting nature of the misinformation of course does not suggest the motives of professionals are at fault. Yet the conditionality/reflexivity of trust applied in published data is nevertheless an important issue worthy of investigation in itself, especially as a future emergence of these ‘back-back-stage’ machinations and their incompatibility with a front-stage presentation of well-informed competence could be especially damaging for trust in the broader institution of medicine.</p>

<title>Trusting the regulators and appraisers: the MHRA and NICE in the front-line of the trust chain</title>
<p>Although it has been suggested that patients and the public may access certain information about the pharmaceutical industry more directly (for example via the media), a chain of trust has become apparent thus far in the analysis whereby the expert professional acts as a trustee (the key actor being depended upon by the patient), who is in turn reliant on accurate information and safe, effectual products. The role of regulation of pharmaceutical products (performed by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency – MHRA) and moreover the appraisals of their effectiveness (carried out by the National Institute for Clinical and Healthcare Excellence – NICE) are thus vital to the ability of professionals to be trustworthy. For reliable information about effective decision-making professionals trust colleagues, journals, education and other sources<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1363459309360783">9</xref></sup> – but increasingly over the past decade many professionals have also come to rely on NICE.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1363459309360783">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>The financial and political might of the industry ensures that the regulating mechanisms of the MHRA, by which the public are protected from drugs which are ‘unsafe, ineffective, or unnecessary’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1363459309360783">Abraham, 2002</xref>: 1498), lack sufficient teeth to keep the practices of the industry in check (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1363459309360783">Abraham, 2002</xref>). Hence while increasing scrutiny of the trustworthiness of the medical profession, in the wake of various scandals in the late 1990s, has ensured a preoccupation among policy-makers with increased external regulation of the profession (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1363459309360783">Checkland et al., 2004</xref>), drug manufacturers have remained relatively unchallenged – instead the ‘organisation, process and techniques of the MHRA are focussed on bringing drugs to market fast’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1363459309360783">House of Commons Health Committee, 2005</xref>: 103).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1363459309360783">Abraham (2009)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1363459309360783">Comanor (1986)</xref> underline the need to study the political-economy of the industry and its interactions with state institutions and healthcare systems in order to develop a more complete and insightful analysis of the nature and extent of its influence. That regulation currently tends towards speed of approval rather than safety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1363459309360783">Fontanarosa et al., 2004</xref>) would suggest that the balance between control/checking and trust (in the ability of the companies to regulate the safety of their own drugs) is skewed towards the latter. It is policy-makers and institutions within and around government who ultimately decide how much trust (as opposed to regulation) they place in drug manufacturers or medical professionals and – as discussed above – decisions around trustworthiness are inherently rooted in the subjective gaze of the decision-maker. While the mass media have apparently centred the attention of policy-makers on the fallibility of clinicians, the ‘closeness’ of the relationship between the industry and central government ensures risks around pharmaceutical regulation remain relatively overlooked.</p>
<p>The status quo may not pose significant challenges to patient trust because of the largely hidden and backstage nature of political manoeuvrings. Yet, as with the confidence placed in prescribing information by professionals, the apparent lack of checks and reflexivity among government institutions towards the industry points towards a potential ‘dark-side’ of trust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1363459309360783">Connell and Mannion, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1363459309360783">Gilson, 2006</xref>). The tension between the far from altruistic motives of the industry and the amount of trust which it is afforded by those in power suggests an overly ‘cosy relationship’ which may lead to dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1363459309360783">Connell and Mannion, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1363459309360783">Gilson, 2006</xref>). Were such dysfunctions to garner sufficient media attention then the confidence of patients would be acutely undermined.</p>
<p>The MHRA’s influence, though significant in deeming products safe and utilizable, is less visible (and more backstage) for professionals. Whereas the role of NICE – in recommending which drugs NHS professionals are obliged to prescribe (either unreservedly or within limitations) as well as producing influential guidelines which are often applied within clinical situations – has come to bear prominently on the decisions of prescribers and therefore on the profitability of drug manufacturers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1363459309360783">Abraham, 2009</xref>). The status of NICE (alongside prescribers) as a de facto gate-keeper to demand, underlines the extent to which the profitability of manufacturers is dependent on the decision-makers within the Institute. Yet this reliance is far from uni-directional in that NICE is in many senses dependent on reliable information about particular products in order to make valid decisions, with the predominance of industry-funded trials rendering their influence unavoidable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1363459309360783">Brown and Calnan, 2010</xref>). This mutual dependency – suggesting a vulnerability to the other’s actions – combined with the general levels of uncertainty involved underlines the potential relevance of a reciprocated trust (Mollering, 2006).</p>
<p>In a not dissimilar sense to professionals, NICE is accordingly placed in a highly sensitive ‘trust’ position – trusted by professionals (and thus indirectly by patients) while required to trust manufacturers in order to carry out its function. Yet while trust is prima facie essential to relations between NICE and manufacturers – there are a number of factors which make it unlikely. As already discussed, the evidence-base by which NICE would make reliable decisions is skewed by the industry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1363459309360783">Lexchin et al., 2003</xref>). Once formulated, NICE recommendations may be undermined or circumvented by the pharmaceutical industry (e.g. beta interferon, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1363459309360783">Crinson, 2004</xref>). How these phenomena are perceived and acted on, and the way in which these organizations consequently interact with, and (mis)trust, one another are thus of vital interest. In spite of the political sensitivity surrounding such topics, they are of great significance for both NICE itself as well as professionals and the public.</p>

<title>An increasingly vulnerable and yet faceless consumption of medicine: expert patients, over-the-counter drugs and the Internet</title>
<p>The influence and visibility of NICE in the eyes of the industry and the public has heightened scrutiny of its decisions and led to increasing efforts to influence these. So while direct-to-consumer advertising for prescription medicine is prohibited in the UK, the industry has been able to influence demand less directly but nonetheless effectively through ‘sponsoring’ patient-groups to lobby on their behalf (e.g. Herceptin – see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1363459309360783">Alt, 2003</xref>). Claims making, whether through direct advertising or lobbying, is essentially a means of shaping knowledge and consciousness of conditions and typifying them in a certain social or ‘medical’ light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1363459309360783">Cohen, 2002</xref>). By constructing and emphasizing the problematic nature of a condition and the efficacy of its pharmaceutical solutions, the industry is able to heighten simultaneously the subjective vulnerability of sections of the population (and correspondingly the requirement for trust) and put their product forward as the most concrete solution to this constructed problem. This creation of a ‘need to trust’, by moving people from a position of relative confidence to one where they are more profoundly aware of a certain risk/illness, and exacerbating this vulnerability which makes trust easier to win, is seemingly a highly profitable marketing tool.</p>
<p>Notions pertaining to a political economy of hope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1363459309360783">Novas, 2006</xref>) or trust may be useful in understanding such empirical contexts where the financial utility, and/or political power, of consumer aspirations or expectations may be used and abused. Trust is rooted in perceptions of the trustee yet the active subjectivity of the truster is also vital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1363459309360783">Kierkegaard, 1957</xref>), with a ‘will to trust’ decisive to the process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1363459309360783">Möllering, 2006</xref>). Because trust is a means of dealing with vulnerability and uncertainty – where actors experience increased awareness of uncertainty and risk, and where they are made to feel more vulnerable, the incentives (and potentially the willingness) to trust are amplified. Even where possibilities of future positive outcomes are so remote as to make trust unlikely, <italic>hope</italic> may in any case act as a potent tool in applying political pressure and expanding marketability through a prospective value. The political-economic effect of ‘what could be’, as expressed by patient groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1363459309360783">Novas, 2006</xref>) among others, may be highly salient in understanding industry influence in a number of contested domains – for example in ‘cost-sharing’ neuropsychotherapeutic interventions for Alzheimer’s disease. It is such novel products which represent both the greatest hope for the public as well as the greatest profits (via patents) for the industry.</p>
<p>If the pharmaceuticalization of society, alongside more positive contributions, inculcates the vulnerability and uncertainty which make trust more necessary – tendencies towards an increasingly independent consumption of medication also render trust more problematic. Trust is most effectively won through communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1363459309360783">Brown, 2008</xref>), familiarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1363459309360783">Luhmann, 1979</xref>) and ‘demonstrable warmth and openness’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1363459309360783">Giddens, 1990</xref>: 121). Conversely recent policies which promote the ‘expert patient’, self-management and consumer choice are in certain senses reducing the facework commitments of professionals and therefore the communication on which trust is based. Given the difficulties and ambiguities in understanding prescribing decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1363459309360783">Britten et al., 2000</xref>), and the importance of good communication for quality outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1363459309360783">Makoul et al., 1995</xref>), this may be a problematic development.</p>
<p>The discussion thus far has focused entirely on the consumption of prescribed medication and the trust relations around this vast market which are importantly influenced by the prescribing professional. But if the consumption of these drugs, especially by people with long-standing chronic illnesses, is becoming more faceless – there are also growing patterns of consumption which exist largely outside the spheres of interaction with the medical profession. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1363459309360783">Abraham (2009</xref>: 114) has noted that the Department of Health ‘adopted the concept of expert patient uncritically as it agreed in 2004 to double the number of drugs to be reclassified from prescription-only-medicine (POM) to over-the-counter (OTC) status’. In the absence of a prescriber, important research questions emerge as to the role of pharmacists, the effectiveness of their facework in comparison to doctors and moreover how consumers combine this basis for trust with the facework of other trustees (close acquaintances, broader social networks and self-judgement).</p>
<p>Further removed from the facework of professionals – the Internet has significant and wide-ranging implications for trust related to the pharmaceutical industry and its products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1363459309360783">Depuits, 2002</xref>). First, consumers may buy medicine from the websites of mainstream pharmacies (as regulated by the Royal Pharmaceutical Society in the UK) – a faceless market which also harnesses a system-trust through familiarity with the vendor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1363459309360783">Gefen, 2000</xref>). Alongside other mass media, the Internet may, second, act to empower consumers by providing easily accessible information on the availability and effectiveness of particular medicines – though the effects of this information on behaviour should not be overstated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1363459309360783">Baker et al., 2003</xref>). Third, the Internet represents a means by which an underground pharmaceuticals industry (separate from the main manufacturers) can advertise and sell ‘fake drugs’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1363459309360783">Newton et al., 2002</xref>) or disseminate products to a wider market than would normally be prescribed them (for example sildenafil, Viagra).</p>
<p>This latter face of ‘pharmaceuticalization’ extends across liminalities between the ‘medical’, in terms of treating morbidity, and the domain of the ‘healthy’. For example there is a growing Internet market selling products to enhance physical or cognitive performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1363459309360783">Easton, 2007</xref>). The sale of these latter forms of ‘smart drugs’ raises important ethical concerns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1363459309360783">Rose, 2002</xref>), not least in terms of the possibly adulterated compounds and unapproved drugs for sale through the Internet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1363459309360783">WHO, 2006</xref>) and the pressures within late-modern work that drive their consumption. These of course represent a very different form of vulnerability to those relating to ‘illness’, yet nevertheless are open to potentially lucrative exploitation by a quite different industry – whose market requires trust.</p>

<title>Conclusion: towards a research agenda</title>
<p>A recent Royal College of Physicians report describes an ‘endemic’ loss of trust in the pharmaceutical industry and contends that ‘trust has to be restored if progress is to be made in harnessing the best of industry, academia and the NHS’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1363459309360783">RCP, 2009</xref>: xiv). The report has been criticized as being insufficiently patient-centred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1363459309360783">Collier, 2009</xref>) and in contrast this article has sought to develop a conceptual framework which begins with the potentially problematic nature of patient trust in medicines and their manufacturers, and understands issues of professional and institutional (e.g. NICE) trust in manufacturers in relation to their continuing ability to assure their trustworthiness for patients. The value of research in all three areas (patient, professional and institutional) has been underlined: with regard to patients we have described tendencies which suggest trust is increasingly vital yet challenged; and in relation to professionals and institutions we have noted the spectre of a ‘dark-side’ to confidence and/or trust which is placed unwittingly or with insufficient reflexivity or conditionality. The gap between a front-stage ‘presentation of self’ as competent and independent and a backstage laden with assumptions and industry-influence has been held to represent a significant risk for trust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1363459309360783">Fugelli, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Furthermore we have noted basic difficulties in elucidating the extent and causality of patient trust in medicines based on existing studies/data – due to the complexity and multi-dimensionality of the lattice of knowledge and assumptions applied, as well as the ambiguities and imperfections of the market. Our analysis suggests the utility of research which examines how the nature and extent of trust may vary markedly depending on subjects (trusters) and objects (trustees), for example because of the levels of vulnerability experienced, uncertainty perceived and/or attributed links between the product and the industry. Investigation is also necessary into how the level and type of facework involved may bear on trust. This in turn may be partially determined by whether the drug is POM or OTC, the role of professional, pharmacist and/or other social influences and whether the drug is consumed legally or through illicit routes. It is hoped that the concepts and initial theorizations articulated above will provide useful tools through which research can progress to analyse and clarify the nature and decisive tendencies within patient trust – as well as to understand how the role of professionals and institutions can best protect and strengthen this in their respective roles as access points to wider systems of knowledge.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1363459309360783">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>At the centre of our analysis has thus been an understanding of a ‘chain’ or framework of different bases of trust, which together produce knowledge and assumptions in which patient trust is grounded. The relationship between the prescriber, the system (NHS/private insurer), the regulator, NICE and the manufacturer in the construction of knowledge around certain drugs is thus a key starting point for trust analyses. Certain research already exists which begins to illuminate this area, most notably in relation to vaccines such as MMR (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1363459309360783">Brownlie and Howson, 2005</xref>). Comparative research between different medical conditions and pharmacological interventions may shed light on the ways in which constructions of knowledge are formed, or indeed whether patients instead remain in a state of confidence where they do not doubt. Given the complexity described, and the nuanced variations between trust and confidence, it is likely that qualitative research may be most effective in unpicking the influence of systems and their access points on trust.</p>
<p>The premise of the recent RCP working party and their report was the need to ‘redefine the terms of engagement’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1363459309360783">RCP, 2009</xref>: 8) between various actors and the pharmaceutical industry. The role and of trust in these various relationships – particularly between patients, professionals, NICE and manufacturers – is integral to their effective functioning. Improved understandings of trust in this domain – in terms of the people, systems and epistemologies around which decisions are constructed – would provide some important markers in orientating how these terms of engagement should be reconsidered.</p>
