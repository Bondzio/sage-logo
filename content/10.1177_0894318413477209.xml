<p>Nursing is an incredible journey filled with numerous instances grounded in caring. Through shared human experiences, situations may make a dramatic difference in the delivery of healthcare. Caring occurs within the interaction between nurse and patient. Throughout these interactions, both parties experience a between in which nurturing and caring flourish. A linear thought process guides the nurse and patient through a shared experience, creating great strength and connectivity. The beauty that forms within such a relationship involves a dynamic interaction of caring.</p>
<p>In this caring relationship, <italic>a between</italic>, becomes foundational to the nurse-patient situation and serves to change all parties involved. This experience is person-focused. What happens within this context of the nursing situation represents the between. In this between resides the central caring essence. The essence of caring explored in the following story of a nursing situation from the author’s practice is: entering the between through being when called upon.</p>
<p>The genesis of this work came with an invitation to recall a treasured story of caring in nursing practice. The following story is situated within the nursing theoretical framework of Paterson and Zderad’s humanistic nursing, a beautiful expression that recognizes and emphasizes the compassion underlying nursing as a profession. Within this framework, nursing is described as an art that elicits calls between nurse and patient. The response to these calls accentuates uniqueness. Relevant selections from the literature provide thematic insights into the meaning of caring as lived in this story from nursing practice.</p>

<title>The Between: Hearing Jane’s Call for Nursing</title>
<p>Grace is an individual who has always wanted to make a difference in the world. When she obtained her nursing license she knew she had achieved an amazing goal. Not only had she secured her future in a career that would feed her family, but Grace had found a role that would feed her spirit. Armed with her new license, she could provide care to those in need and make an impact each and every day.</p>
<p>There are certain standards of care that should be upheld despite the sometimes chaotic scenes played out within the walls of hospitals. Patient centered approaches are key to successfully touching the lives of others. In reconnecting with a personal nursing situation that serves as the foundation for this study of caring in nursing, the author recalls a young mother, referenced here as Jane.</p>
<p>Jane was a young woman who suffered from metastatic cancer. The very first time Grace entered her room she thought that Jane was beautiful. She could not understand why someone so young and so needed in the world would have to endure such a drastic circumstance. Immediately Grace’s heart opened with compassion for Jane and her family.</p>
<p>Jane’s admission status was long term, requiring numerous interventions for nausea, vomiting, and pain. Her husband came every day with the children and they sat at her bedside completing their school assignments. The family had filled her room with pictures lining the windowsill, personal blankets from home, and a small bottle of perfume that Jane wore every day. The fragrance was delightful and the environment was saturated with love.</p>
<p>As her condition worsened the case manager pushed for a hospice consult. Jane’s husband appeared to be in complete denial and adamantly refused. He firmly expressed his desire to take his wife home. He tended to hold onto the slightest change in her laboratory reports and brief periods without nausea. To him, these minute circumstances indicated that she was not dying.</p>
<p>One day, when the family was gone Grace sat with Jane. She wanted Grace to help her put on some make up and fix up what little hair she had left. Jane’s father was coming from across the country to see her and she wanted to look nice. As Grace applied soft powder to her face, Jane told her that she knew that she was going to die soon. Grace listened in silence, as it was the only therapeutic technique that she could utilize to hold back her own emotion. Jane talked about her own personal desire to see her family and to spend her last days surrounded by them. Grace combed through her hair as she asked her if there was anything that she wanted her to do. Jane looked straight into Grace’s eyes and said, “Get me out of this place.”</p>
<p>Grace went home that night and hugged her husband and her son a little tighter. As she fell to sleep, she could not stop thinking of Jane. The next morning, as she spoke with the oncologist, she told him of her time with Jane the previous day. Collaboratively, the team decided that Jane could go home with a nasogastric tube and various prescriptions to control her pain. Case management was consulted and arrangements were made for a home health nurse to stay with her around the clock. Grace entered the room to tell the news to the family and one would have thought that she had told them that they had won the lottery. There was so much joy in the room; everyone was hugging and crying. Grace looked at Jane and Jane winked at her. The moment, Grace described, as one that she will never forget.</p>
<p>Two days later Grace reported to work to find Jane’s husband and her youngest son waiting in the lobby of the unit. Jane’s husband had red and swollen eyes and he did not need to say a word. Grace approached slowly and wrapped her arms around him. He just broke down. The two spoke for a long while; a conversation filled with compliments and graciousness for the care that Grace had provided to his lovely wife. Grace told him that Jane would never leave her thoughts. As they turned to leave, Jane’s little boy pulled out a small bottle of perfume. As he handed it to Grace he said, “This was my mommy’s. She said that you love it, I want you to have it.” As Grace embraced him and thanked him for the gesture, she looked up at Jane’s husband and he nodded his head in approval. At that moment she knew that she had made a strong impact on this family through the simple essence of caring. Their expression of gratitude, Grace described, was one of the most rewarding experiences of her life and is certainly one of the reasons that she believed she has the greatest job in the world.</p>

<title>The Theoretical Perspective</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0894318413477209">Paterson and Zderad’s (1976)</xref> humanistic nursing theory emerged from a desire to offer responses to calls of human needs in nursing. The theorists explained that calls for nursing may be heard through the senses and are not always readily available in the form of verbal cues. Nurses are prompted to respond to health-related concerns through entering the world of another and being in that world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894318413477209">Kleiman, 2010</xref>). The authors employed and even coined numerous terms in which to describe entering the between through being when called upon. From Patterson and Zderad, gestalt represented “all that the particular human being is, includes all past experiences, all current being, and all hopes, dreams, and fears of the future that are experienced in one’s own space-time dimension” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894318413477209">Kleiman, 2010</xref>, p. 341). Each person is perceived as existing “all at once” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894318413477209">Kleiman, 2010</xref>, p. 341). Noetic locus involved the nurse’s value of self as a “knowing place” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894318413477209">Kleiman, 2010</xref>, p. 344). “In the process of interacting with patients, nurses interweave professional identity, education, intuition, and experience with all their other life experiences, creating their own tapestry, which unfolds during their responses” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894318413477209">Kleiman, 2010</xref>, p. 342). Angular view represented standpoints that take into account the gestalt of unique human experience and involved perception, bias, and prejudice. These standpoints must be bracketed, in that the nurse consciously remains neutral and inhibits superimposing expectations or opinions within the experience of another. This approach “helps one to be open to the authentic, to the true experience of the other” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894318413477209">Kleiman, 2010</xref>, p. 343). Both parties come to realize their own self-actualizing potential and embrace dynamics of being through change. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0894318413477209">Paterson and Zderad’s (1976)</xref> humanistic nursing theory “emphasizes the lived experience of nursing” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894318413477209">Kleiman, 2010</xref>) and builds on the “affirmation of being and becoming of both the patient and nurse, who are actualized through the choices they make and the intersubjective relationships in which they engage” (p. 339). Call and response suggests that nursing is transactional. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894318413477209">Kleiman (2010)</xref> pointed out that the “and” in call and response represents the between, that is nursing” (p. 339). She further elaborated that “ through the relationship engendered and nurtured in intersubjective dialogue, there arises the possibility for persons to become all that they can be in particular lived situations” (p. 342). The process of being heard and acknowledged represents humanization through the nursing situation. It is the incorporation of all of these concepts that allow for the between to occur through being when called upon.</p>

<sec id="section4-0894318413477209">
<title>Humanism: A Person-Centered Perspective</title>
<p>Humanism centers on acknowledgement of the individual with respect toward personal experience, or gestalt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0894318413477209">McCabe &amp; Holmes, 2007</xref>). McCabe and Holmes suggested that incorporation of humanistic philosophy may serve as an effective form of implementing caring principles within all levels of nursing and may steer away from illness-focused approaches. The effect allows for the between to occur through an alternative approach, one that is person-focused. “Humanism is rooted in a person-centered perspective that emphasizes growth and respect for persons, a feature that resonates within nursing in the relationships between patients and caregivers” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0894318413477209">McCabe &amp; Holmes, 2007</xref>, p. 18). In the nursing situation with Jane, the focus did not center on the alleviation of her symptoms, but rather became focused on her personal desires with the incorporation of her thoughts and hopes. Only this approach allowed for a humanizing experience. Jane’s desire to go home was significant for her world and afforded her a more peaceful closure to life. Her call was for help to return home to die and the response came as a result of hearing that call. While not necessarily verbalized, utilization of the senses occurred in the between, resulting in an understanding that affirmed her needs and created a caring and nurturing reply. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0894318413477209">McCabe and Holmes (2007)</xref> indicated that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0894318413477209">Paterson and Zderad’s (1976)</xref> theory:
<disp-quote>
<p>envisioned the nursing role as one that involves increasing possibilities for patients to make decisions and described a methodology for nursing, which they termed phenomenological nursology. They posited that by employing this method, the nurse can begin to understand a multitude of situations (realities), which will allow for a deeper look into a specific situation rather than focusing on the surface issues. (p. 19)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>It is within this <italic>deeper look</italic> that the between occurs.</p>

<sec id="section5-0894318413477209">
<title>The Courage to Enter the Between with an Open Heart</title>
<p>Entering the between requires the humility of taking an angular view and a bracketing of one’s own perception of the situation. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0894318413477209">Tyler-Ball (2007)</xref>, entrance into a nursing situation requires courage and will intensely influence those who “dare to enter into them with a heart open to the experience” (p. 82). The author also elaborated on self-actualizing potential. “Although the motivation for caring is to assist the other to grow and actualize their personhood, an outcome of actively participating in the caring process includes personal growth and actualization for the one giving care” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0894318413477209">Tyler-Ball, 2007</xref>, p. 81).</p>
<p>The nursing situation with Jane allowed for the between to emerge as Jane called for nursing and Grace responded. The open-hearted acknowledgement of Jane’s personal desires enabled empowerment and growth within the nurse and lead to a more fully developed noetic locus. “Expressed in this theory is a call to nursing that leads to a dialogue/interaction between participants that, in turn, leads to a response” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0894318413477209">Tyler-Ball, 2007</xref>, p. 82). What occurs within the situation explored in this column is the between. As Jane expressed a longing for the comfort of her own home and familiar surroundings, the nurse was prompted to respond to such needs through recognition and receptivity. The interaction took place on many levels so that full verbal exploration was not necessary. In the time spent observing Jane and her family together, one could quickly conclude that their time was valuable and precious. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0894318413477209">Tyler-Ball (2007)</xref> suggested that becoming involved compounds previous experiences with the current situation to create a new gestalt. In living well-being and more-being within her situation, Jane had come to know that death was a close reality. Through evaluation, she explored the meaning of her personal life and she began to see the importance of being at home with those she loved.</p>

<title>Evolving Gestalt: A Unique Expression of Individuality</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0894318413477209">Vassallo (2001)</xref> introduced the gestalt of the terminally ill and suggested that death often provokes thought patterns that prompt search for <italic>true self</italic> and sparks an “inward journey to answer questions of human existence” (p. 19). This view supports the idea of an evolving gestalt as a unique expression of individuality. Jane spent months in the hospital setting, calling for nursing responses to her health-related needs. Through the between of their interaction, the nurse was able to draw from a noetic locus, synthesizing the objective and subjective in the effort to appropriately respond to Jane’s calls. In death and dying, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0894318413477209">Vassallo (2001)</xref> expressed that nurses should use “caring behaviors” rather than “curing” (p. 20). Jane was no longer interested in curing and the nurse came to realize this call through the between. “An effective dialogue involves listening to and understanding the message of the dying person, both the verbal and nonverbal, while promoting clarification and insight of feelings, problems, goals, and objectives” (p. 24). Hearing the calls for nursing through the senses afforded the nurse clarity and insight into Jane’s innermost desires. Her hospital room was full of family, photos, and personal reminders of her life. It was obvious that Jane yearned to be a part of their existence and the hospital walls constituted a barrier to that possibility. “Words are not always needed to transmit emotions. Simply being present can convey deep feelings of ‘I care,’ without ever uttering a word” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0894318413477209">Vassallo, 2001</xref>, p. 27). This powerful expression communicates the significance of the between; Jane was crying out for help through every intricate detail of her surroundings. Her message was clear and the nurse’s response was enabled through the beautiful experience that unfolded within <italic>the between</italic>.</p>

<sec id="section7-0894318413477209">
<title>Authentic Presence: Understanding Fullness of Personhood</title>
<p>Presence is a key element to achieving the between in call and response. Presence occurs in doing with and being with, as opposed to doing for (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0894318413477209">Minicucci, 1998</xref>). “Presence is inhibited when nurses focus only on the patient’s body or behavior and fail to respond to the fullness of the patient’s personhood” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0894318413477209">Minicucci, 1998</xref>, p. 11). In the nursing situation with Jane, a nurse who lacked an understanding may have continued attempting to alleviate Jane’s symptoms by providing medical interventions. Instead, armed with a noetic locus of the call and response, combined with a caring and open presence, the nurse entered the between authentically, attuned to Jane’s underlying need, the need to meet death with peace as found in her home.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>A systematic understanding of presence highlights the importance of knowing patients phenomenologically, that is, relationally and holistically in their social, familial, and cultural contexts. From this perspective, isolating the patient from such contexts inhibits the nurse’s ability to fully understand the patient’s being or humanity. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0894318413477209">Minicucci, 1998</xref>, p. 11)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This quotation eloquently captures the between as described through <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0894318413477209">Paterson and Zderad’s (1976)</xref> humanistic nursing perspective.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0894318413477209">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>“Humanism in nursing is authentic presence of a ‘knowing’ nurse who dwells in the existence of another with an evident or anticipated health need in order to ameliorate or improve that person’s human condition or help him/her face death” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0894318413477209">Kleiman, 2005</xref>, p. 14). This dwelling represents the between in call and response and here initiated an appropriate effort to allow Jane to face death in her own way. Her calls for nursing were met with open response, affording Jane the opportunity to achieve happiness and fulfillment within her last moments of life.</p>
<p>The essence of caring captured in entering the between through being when called upon aided in the creation of a beautiful nursing experience as represented in the situation with Jane. There is simply no other way to exist within the realm of nursing as described in the perspective of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0894318413477209">Paterson and Zderad (1976)</xref>. The journey of being and becoming in nursing is filled with numerous experiences grounded in caring that make a dramatic difference in the delivery of healthcare. More importantly, the result is person-focused and allows the human spirit to fly freely.</p>
