<p>The topic of sacrifice seems boundless in its capacity to fascinate both scholars and non-scholars alike. Numerous works in nearly every academic discipline in the humanities and social sciences—not to mention examples from the popular media—testify to an abiding, if unresolved, meditation on sacrifice in the West. To this topic Michel Despland, an accomplished scholar of religious studies, has brought unmatched erudition and analytical scope. Examining French religious and cultural history from 1520 to 1920, <italic>Le recul du sacrifice</italic> brings to bear Despland’s vast knowledge of issues and texts relating to sacrifice, knowledge that extends beyond this time frame in both directions. Despland is not interested in determining an essence or developing a general theory of sacrifice; rather, he is interested in exploring how people spoke about sacrifice during these centuries—that is, how sacrifice acted as a means of communication, providing the symbolic framework and content for particular modes of social action. Ranging from treatises of theology, morality, and philosophy to political and social tracts and works of theatre, other literature, and painting, this is an impressive work of scholarship. </p>
<p>Far from presenting “a simple catalogue of opinions,” Despland seeks to bring to light a more underlying and persistent conflict between two larger ways of thinking about sacrifice, a conflict that since World War I no longer possesses the sway it once did over thought or deed. Subtle and careful analyses of texts, perspectives, and debates make clear, however, that this is not a simple matter of two relatively stable views linked to particular enduring constituencies battling each other across centuries. Rather, what we see over this time are “new configurations, re-formations of two nebulous entities that always, and again, differ with and oppose one another” (224). It is these “variable polarizations” that Despland describes and that help him trace the manner in which, as his subtitle indicates, the issue of sacrifice gave rise to four centuries of polemics in France. </p>
<p>With the Reformation, as Despland notes, a new civilization was emerging, one that was built on a radical division between God and humans. The effects of the Reformation reinforced the perspective of humanism, reverberating beyond theological debates to alter society, economy, and politics. A new attention—indeed, a new dignity—was brought to earthly affairs, which were no longer seen (at least by a growing number) in terms of cosmic analogy. Importantly, Despland underscores, these shifts created the conditions for the emergence of the “ethical subject,” namely, a redirection of concern away from the self and (now disputed) human capacities to ensure or contribute to salvation, and toward others. The new emphasis on the responsibilities of the self towards others, Despland says, was more evident within Calvinism than in other varieties of Protestantism, and thus of special pertinence to French history. As Catholic theology and civilization were intimately connected to “the social system of reciprocal gifts”—that is, a hierarchical system of asymmetrical reciprocity (Despland eschews the word “feudalism”) that obligated receivers and givers alike within a network of social privileges and obligations—attacks on its ideology could open the door to new modes of individual autonomy and forms of egalitarianism.</p>
<p>Much of the conflict of the European religious wars, of course, was concentrated in the battle over the Eucharist, or more generally, over the Mass itself as a sacrifice. Reformers found justification of their positions in the writings of Augustine as well as in the Jewish prophets of the Old Testament. A multi-pronged set of attacks linked Catholic notions of sacrifice (in both theological and social terms) to horrible and bloody pagan sacrifices, despised and unneeded by God, whose sacrifice alone could redeem; and also uncovered hypocritical and power-seeking motives behind ostensibly sacrificial acts. Indeed, by the seventeenth century, such critiques of sacrifice had spread well beyond narrow theological circles. In connection with this, if in France Jansenism did not flourish as doctrine, it did, as Despland recounts, defeat the Jesuitism of the Counter-Reformation there, ensuring ever more widespread acceptance of the idea that the sole sacrifice agreeable to God is the pure interior act of renunciation. As the basis of social life shifted from the social game of gift, the “sacrificial synthesis” eroded and suspicion of the interests that lay behind acts of sacrifice segued easily for many to the belief in the presumed durability, and ultimate moral acceptability, of interest, or egotism, as underlying this-worldly life, at least in its public aspects. Worldly life based on now acceptable interest was, however, opposed to the generosity of moral sacrifice accessible to all persons, whatever their station. </p>
<p>In France, with the Edict de Nantes, Protestants became defenders of royal absolutism, but Protestants and Catholics alike would nevertheless increasingly advocate a separation of Church and State. Indeed, the movement undermining the sacrificial synthesis was leading toward the abolition of the monarchy’s social basis itself. In the era of the limited sovereign, this process would promote a new concern for victims, as in the Enlightenment campaign against torture, often portrayed by opponents in terms of sacrifice. Yet, while the eighteenth century was infused by a new sacrificial configuration of sublime self-abandon, “denunciation of priestly fanaticism and the evocation of sublime hearts [had] changed mentalities but did not frontally confront the heavy edifice of the social order” (159). In Despland’s view, such a confrontation awaited Rousseau and his new principles of the human condition. Social life and political life were no longer to be seen as relations of force but first of all as forms of morality. “The law accords rights to all individuals and guarantees recognition of these. The entire former edifice of recognitions based on reciprocity, all the hierarchies made from gifts and protections, collapses” (162). With Rousseau, then, the norm is no longer interest, but duty and conscience. </p>
<p>Despland concludes with a chapter devoted to a wide-ranging discussion of the historical and theoretical implications of this history for our post-sacrificial world. In terms of the historical argument, however, the story ends basically with World War I. For Despland, World War I is both a moment and a means, though this is a World War I preceded in France by the French Revolution and the Dreyfus Affair. If, after 1789, as he writes, traditional sacrificial ideology had been dispensed with, there was as yet no other workable means of establishing peaceful social relations. In this context, Joseph de Maistre would be able to re-invoke the bloody image of expiatory sacrifice in the efforts of the Counter-Revolution. However, over the next century Catholics and non-Catholics would increasingly link sacrifice instead to philanthropic devotion to the social and public good. At the end of the nineteenth century, the Dreyfus Affair simplified the persisting polarization. With the victory of the Dreyfusards, sacrifice was tied firmly to Republicanism and it was no longer possible to deploy a notion of sacrifice that depended on “cosmico-religious assurances” or “historico-political necessities.” Sacrifice would have to be submitted to morality. A new equilibrium, in a sense, had been reached. World War I may have tested this new configuration, but in the end it only confirmed that the old meanings and relations of sacrifice had been exhausted. </p>
<p>
<italic>Le recul du sacrifice</italic> is not an introductory work. While those without a familiarity with French history or the history of the idea of sacrifice in the West will surely benefit from its insights, readers with more background will find it an even more masterful and subtle guide to a complicated history, one that the author carefully and astutely opens up to the reader in its complexity. Despland knows that this history is neither linear nor uniform; and he explores the new departures, detours and dead-ends, the repetitions, reversals, and advances. Unlike some contemporary analyses that lack the scope of this work, and that have at times made precipitous claims about the contemporary viability of the old sacrificial thinking, Despland’s explorations are more rigorously historical. While he knows, for example, that fascism did re-deploy sacrificial ideology (the term he uses for this re-deployment is “mutation”), he appreciates how very different from and even opposed to the past understandings of sacrifice fascism is. </p>
<p>There is thus little to fault in the way of research: Ivan Strenski’s work does not appear to be mentioned; and in terms of editing, Natalie Zemon Davis’s surname is misspelled in a few locations. These are minor quibbles. The book may perhaps be subject to the complaint often levelled at other intellectual histories, namely that there is a lack of explicit assertions of causality vis-à-vis how shifts in ideas or language occur. But Despland does connect his readings and discussions to multiple historical contexts. Should any reader be prompted to pursue further issues, numerous paths for new investigation have been suggested by this important work of historical and religious scholarship. </p>
