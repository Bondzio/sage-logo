<abstract>
<p>Reliable and cost‐effective inspection of rail tracks is of paramount importance to ensure the safety of rolling stock operations. In this paper alternating current field measurement (ACFM) sensors are used to carry out experiments on artificially induced rail surface defects at various speeds using testing configurations that simulate actual inspection conditions found in the field. From the obtained results it can be clearly seen that the ACFM sensors can detect the artificially induced rail surface defects even when relatively significant lift-off is involved, i.e. ∼5 mm and that the effect of increasing speed on the amplitude of the <italic>Bx</italic> signal, which is directly related to the depth of the crack, is negligible. However, clustered defects cannot be easily resolved and the overall amplitude is related to the spacing of the defects within a cluster. The order of clustered defects also significantly influences the maximum amplitude of the recorded <italic>Bx</italic> signal. The validity of the results obtained from the tests on artificially induced defects was verified by conducting further ACFM tests on a rail sample removed from service that contained mild rolling contact fatigue cracks.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0954409712444840" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Rail inspection is commonly carried out using a variety of ultrasonic testing (UT) instruments that range from hand-held devices, through dual-purpose road/track vehicles to test fixtures towed or carried by dedicated rail cars. Test trains and hi-rail vehicles are used to identify the location of potential defects. Detected defects are then verified and sized using hand-held devices by appropriate personnel. The performance of manual UT inspection using conventional instruments such as hand-held UT walking sticks is generally satisfactory with respect to the current operational standards employed by the rail industry. However, manual UT inspection is a labour-intensive and time-consuming process which requires experienced personnel with proven ability to interpret the acquired signals. Moreover, manual UT inspection needs to be carried out either when the line is closed for maintenance purposes or during night time when rolling stock traffic is minimal.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954409712444840">1</xref></sup> Thus, although manual UT inspection produces fairly reliable results in the field, it is not a cost-effective process and requires significant human resources with relevant technical expertise to be readily available throughout the year.</p>
<p>The increase in traffic density currently being experienced in the rail industry has resulted in high-speed rail inspection becoming increasingly important for rail infrastructure managers. Special test trains carrying UT and magnetic flux leakage (MFL) instruments capable of operating at speed have been available for some time now.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954409712444840">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954409712444840">2</xref></sup> Recent developments on test trains have led to inspection speeds of up to 80 km/h being reported, albeit at significantly lower resolution than that achieved during manual inspection.</p>
<p>Since defects can be located in various parts of the rail, UT interrogating beams are transmitted at several different incident angles in order to maximise the probability of detection (POD) of any detrimental features present in the rail.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954409712444840">2</xref></sup> The UT transducers are contained either within a liquid-filled tyre, known as a roller search unit or a sled carrier. Sled carriers can achieve the highest speed of the two techniques since the distance that the emitted ultrasonic beam has to travel from the transducer down to the rail and back is smaller than that in a wheel probe. On the other hand, sled carriers are more difficult to deploy and require relatively complex deployment mechanisms to control their position and minimise vibrations during operation. In addition, the presence of corrugation adversely affects the performance of sled carriers.</p>
<p>One of the major problems during high-speed UT inspection is the adjustment of the signal threshold and the position of the time window. Since the signal amplitude of any reflections detected together with when they occur in time is fundamentally related to the presence of a defect it is very important that the correct parameters are set prior to the inspection. If the signal threshold is set too high, the system will miss surface and near-surface cracks whereas if it is set too low it will generate too many false alarms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954409712444840">2</xref></sup> Similarly, if the time window is set too close to the origin (i.e. to correspond to the rail surface) then the detector will be prone to excessive noise. On the other hand, if the time window is too far from the origin then surface and near-surface cracks will go undetected. Fine-tuning of UT equipment in test trains is quite challenging and despite the fact that there have been substantial improvements in this area over the years, the problem has never been fully addressed, particularly with increased inspection speeds.</p>
<p>In general, ultrasonic test trains perform relatively well in detecting large deep surface-breaking and internal defects, particularly in the railhead and web. Unfortunately, due to the aforementioned reasons moderate and even heavy rolling contact fatigue (RCF)-related defects are usually very difficult to detect with high-speed UT systems. This is due to the fact that with increasing inspection speed the resolution of the inspection decreases making it more difficult to detect RCF cracks which are very small in individual size but are usually found in clusters. In order to avoid excessive amounts of noise the time window is set further away from the origin (i.e. in this case the surface of the rail head) causing smaller surface and near-surface-breaking RCF cracks to be missed. Undetected smaller surface defects can also shadow critical internal defects and thus result in poor evaluation of the structural integrity of certain rail sections.</p>
<p>To overcome the limitations of UT inspection, some hi-rail (i.e. road vehicles with additional flanged steel wheels for running on rails) and railbound vehicles incorporate MFL or eddy current sensors as a complement to the UT equipment. MFL and eddy current sensors have a better performance in detecting surface and near-surface defects at speed. Although MFL is not usually applicable at speeds above 30 km/h, eddy current sensors have been used for the detection of surface-breaking defects at speeds that can exceed 80 km/h as long as the lift-off between the sensor and the railhead is maintained fairly constant and at no more than 2 mm.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954409712444840">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954409712444840">3</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954409712444840">5</xref></sup> Satisfactory lift-off control can be difficult depending on the quality of the surface of the track (e.g. presence of corrugation and profile variations).</p>
<p>In contrast to eddy current sensors that are required to be placed at a close and constant distance from the inspected surface, a maximum operating lift-off of 5 mm is possible with tolerable reduction in the signal when using alternating current field measurement (ACFM) probes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954409712444840">6</xref></sup> This is due to the fact that the defect signal strength diminishes with the square of the lift-off, not with its cube which is the case for eddy current sensors. In eddy current testing the change in the impedance of the current inducer or coil is used to gain information about the surface and near-surface condition of the component under inspection, whereas in the ACFM method a constant-current source drives the inducer to ensure a constant incident field and a magnetic field sensor is used to monitor the surface magnetic field variations. The advantage of the ACFM technique over eddy current sensors is that in ACFM testing the signal represents the actual magnetic field perturbations and not a global variation. The ACFM technique is capable of both detecting and sizing (length and depth) surface-breaking cracks in metals based on the thin-skin theory developed by Lewis et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954409712444840">7</xref></sup> Under certain conditions ACFM can be applied for the detection of near-surface defects, however, this strongly depends on the electromagnetic properties of the metal under inspection.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0954409712444840"><title>ACFM theory</title>
<p>The ACFM technique is based on the principle that an alternating current (AC) can be induced to flow in a thin skin near the surface of a conductor. By introducing a remote uniform current into an area of the component under test, when there are no defects present the electrical current will be undisturbed. If a crack is present the uniform current is disturbed and the current flows around the ends and down the faces of the crack. Because the current is an AC it flows in a thin skin close to the surface and is unaffected by the overall geometry of the component. Associated with the current flowing in the surface is a magnetic field above the surface which, like the current in the surface, will be disturbed in the presence of a defect. An important factor of the ACFM technique is its ability to relate measurements of the magnetic field disturbance to the size of the defect that caused that disturbance. The development of the method came from a combination of research studies, which provided mathematical modelling of the magnetic field rather than electrical fields, and advances in electronics and sensing technology.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954409712444840">8</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954409712444840">17</xref></sup> Despite the fact that the magnetic field above the surface is a complex three-dimensional field, it is possible, by choosing suitable orthogonal axes, to measure components of the field that are indicative of the nature of the disturbance and which can be related to the physical properties of any present cracks. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954409712444840">Figure 1</xref> presents a plan view of a surface-breaking crack where a uniform AC current is flowing. The field component denoted by <italic>Bz</italic> corresponds to the poles generated as the current flows around the ends of the crack introducing current rotations in the plane of the component. These responses are principally at the crack ends and are indicative of a crack’s surface length. The field component denoted by <italic>Bx</italic> corresponds to the reduction in current surface density as the current flows down the crack and is indicative of the depth of the defects. Generally, the current is introduced perpendicular to the expected direction of cracking. In practice, special probes have been developed which contain a remote field induction system, for introducing the field into the component, together with special combined magnetic field sensors that allow accurate measurement of the components of the magnetic field at the same point in space. The probe requires no electrical contact with the component and can therefore be applied without the removal of surface contaminants.

<p>ACFM probes are available as standard pencil probes and multi-element array probes. These probes can be customised to optimise inspection of particular structural components and maximise the POD of critical-sized defects. ACFM pencil probes can detect surface-breaking defects in any orientation. Nonetheless, in order to size defects, they need to lie between 0° and 30° to the direction of travel of the probe. This drawback is overcome in ACFM arrays by incorporating various field inducers to allow a field to be introduced within the inspected surface in other orientations. This is particularly useful in situations where the crack orientation is unknown or variable. In this case, additional sensors, denoted by <italic>By</italic>, are also incorporated in order to take full advantage of the additional input field directions.</p>

<sec id="sec3-0954409712444840"><title>ACFM as part of the INTERAIL integrated rail inspection platform</title>
<p>INTERAIL is a European collaborative research project which is led jointly by ISQ (Portugal) and the University of Birmingham with financial support from the European Commission The project launched officially in October 2009 and will result in the demonstration of a novel integrated high-speed inspection concept. The INTERAIL consortium partners are currently involved in the development and implementation of an integrated high-speed inspection system based on a modular design, which will enable the fast and reliable inspection of rail tracks at speeds up to 320 km/h depending on the system’s mode of operation. The INTERAIL system combines the use of automated visual inspection with ACFM and UT probes into a single high-speed inspection vehicle. Each module provides information on different aspects of the condition of the rail track. The automated visual inspection module provides information on the levels of corrugation, railhead profile irregularities, missing parts and defective sleepers. The ACFM module detects and evaluates the severity of RCF damage including head checks, gauge corner cracking and squats, while the ultrasonic module detects and evaluates any internal defects that may be present in the rail. Integration of these three modules will allow the reliable assessment of the condition of the rail track in a single run, resulting in a noteworthy reduction in inspection times when compared with conventional inspection procedures. The schematic in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954409712444840">Figure 2</xref> shows a simplified outline of the concept of the INTERAIL inspection platform. The technical results presented in this paper are associated with the development of the ACFM module as part of the INTERAIL system.

<sec id="sec4-0954409712444840"><title>Small-scale high-speed ACFM laboratory tests</title>
<p>The main purpose of the laboratory tests was three-fold:
<list id="list1-0954409712444840" list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item><p>to evaluate the ACFM probe response with increasing speed;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>to evaluate the ACFM signal deterioration with increasing lift-off;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>to assess the ability of the ACFM technique to obtain information regarding the severity of the detected defects.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>In order to achieve these objectives, tests were carried out initially at a relatively slow speed of 4.5 km/h or 100 r/m and a 0.8 mm lift-off. The inspection speed was increased progressively up to 121.5 km/h or 3000 r/m while maintaining a constant lift-off.</p>
<p>The small-scale high-speed ACFM tests were carried out with a turning lathe used to spin a customised rotary sample with artificially induced surface defects at its edges. The test configuration is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954409712444840">Figure 3</xref>. The rotary test piece was manufactured from 0.9 wt % C steel to ensure that the electromagnetic properties (relative magnetic permeability and electrical conductivity) are similar to those exhibited by conventional 260 rail steel grade (typically 0.7–0.8 wt % C). Both steel alloys also have a predominantly pearlitic microstructure. The physical dimensions of the rotary test piece were a 23 cm diameter and a 6 cm thickness with a bore in the centre with a 19 cm diameter and a 5 cm depth. Four transverse notches (2 x 2 mm and 2 x 4 mm deep with a flat profile) were spark eroded at the centre of the 20 mm wide rim of the sample at <italic>X–Y</italic> axis anti-symmetric positions. Each notch was 10 mm long and 0.5 mm wide.
<fig id="fig3-0954409712444840" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Experimental setup for the turning lathe tests using the rotary test piece.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954409712444840-fig3.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>A high-speed single-channel micro pencil probe manufactured by TSC Inspection Systems was employed for these tests. The pencil probe was operated at a frequency of 50 kHz and driven by a commercial TSC AMIGO instrument. The measurements were performed using customised software and the data were logged on a PC which incorporated a single-channel high-speed data acquisition board. The data acquisition rate during tests was 1 MHz. The purpose of these tests was to assess the efficiency of the ACFM sensors with increasing speed at various lift-off values. Since data could be acquired at high speed only for one channel the ACFM data plots reported in this paper relate to the <italic>Bx</italic> component which is related to the depth of the defects.</p>
<p>The sample was rotated at various constant speeds between 100 and 3000 r/m. The rotational speed of 1 r/m for this experimental setup corresponds to the equivalent of a surface speed of 0.0405 km/h at the centre of the notch (i.e. 10 mm away from the edge of the rim) and hence at 3000 r/m the surface speed of the sample at the centre of the notches was 121.5 km/h. The ACFM probe was positioned opposite to the centre of the notches and at a 0° angle with reference to their surface orientation. The initial constant lift-off of the ACFM probe with regards to the surface of the rotating sample was 0.8 mm. Tests were carried out with lift-off values of up to 8 mm in order to evaluate the effect on the ACFM signal of increasing the distance between the surface of the inspected sample and the probe. During experiments, the data (ACFM probe signal, i.e. analogue to digital conversion of probe voltage, with time) were logged on a PC and then plotted using customised software.</p>
<p>The plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954409712444840">Figure 4</xref> shows the changes in the probe signal caused by the presence of the notches as a function of time at low and high inspection speeds. It is clear that the ACFM signals are consistent throughout the tests. Both the signal amplitude and signal-to-noise ratio remain constant regardless of the speed. Furthermore, the signal amplitude arising from the presence of a 2 mm notch can be clearly distinguished from that of a 4 mm notch; thus, it can be used to assess the severity of the detected defects, at least qualitatively, at this stage of development.
<fig id="fig4-0954409712444840" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>ACFM signal data as a function of time at 9 km/h and 121.5 km/h with 0.8 mm probe lift-off.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954409712444840-fig4.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Using the same setup, further tests were carried out by gradually increasing the probe lift-off from 0.8 to 2 mm and then up to 8 mm in 1 mm increments. The same speed range (4.5–121.5 km/h) was used during each set of tests. The lift-off tests showed an approximately square reduction in the ACFM defect signal amplitude as expected for each millimetre of lift-off added. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954409712444840">Figure 5</xref> the signal amplitude arising for a 2 mm notch at 0.8 mm lift-off is comparable to that arising from a 4 mm notch at 2 mm lift-off. Similarly, the signal acquired due to the presence of a 4 mm notch at a probe lift-off of 3 mm is comparable to the signal obtained for a 2 mm notch at a probe lift-off of 2 mm. The artificial slots remained detectable up to 7 mm even though the signal-to-noise ratio was significantly lower making defect assessment unreliable and thus it very difficult to distinguish which signal was associated with the 2 mm defects and which with the 4 mm. A change in the level of the background ACFM with lift-off was also observed, with the background ACFM signal strength decreasing as lift-off increased. At 8 mm lift-off, it was almost impossible to confirm the presence of the slots based on the plotted response of the ACFM probe as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954409712444840">Figure 6</xref>.

<p>These tests prove that the ACFM technique can be used to detect and evaluate surface-breaking defects in rails at inspection speeds which exceed 100 km/h. Even with significant lift-offs the ACFM sensor can detect minute defects although the assessment of the severity of the detected defects becomes increasingly unreliable with respect to the lift-off variation involved. Therefore, it is of profound importance that during inspection in the field the ACFM probe lift-off is controlled and maintained as constant as possible in order to reliably assess the severity of the detected defects.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0954409712444840"><title>Experiments on BS113 rails under simulated conditions</title>
<p>To assess the operational efficiency of the ACFM techniques under conditions that closer resemble the actual rail inspection process at speed in the field, a 3.6 m diameter spinning rail rig capable of rotating at speeds between 1 and 80 km/h (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954409712444840">Figure 7</xref>) was used. The rig incorporates a special set of eight curved BS113 rails of 1.41 m length that contain artificial notches induced using spark erosion, including half-face slots machined normal to the railhead surface, clusters of angled slots and pocket-shaped defects more typical of actual RCF defects. The shapes, sizes and angles of the induced defects were chosen in such a way as to enable their use as calibration samples for various non-destructive testing techniques. The depth of the notches varies between 2 and 15 mm, and for more realistic representation of RCF cracking certain notches were angled with respect to the surface normal and the rail edge and the railhead surface. RCF head checks detected in rails are often inclined to the surface, penetrating initially at a shallow angle of approximately 15–30° until they reach a characteristic depth and turn down into the railhead at an angle of approximately 60°.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954409712444840">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0954409712444840">19</xref></sup> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954409712444840">Figure 8</xref> shows a planar view schematic of sample rails and induced notches (not to scale). The induced artificial pocket-shaped defects contained in rail samples designated rails 7 and 8 are the ones that more closely resemble actual RCF cracks. The pocket-shaped defects had some residual opening from the spark erosion process which would make their detection at speed potentially easier than real life RCF.

<p>ACFM tests were initially carried out manually with a 5 kHz micro pencil probe (inspection speed approximately 0.1 km/h) at 0 and 2 mm lift-offs to verify that the ACFM system could detect every notch induced on the test rails. The data ploted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954409712444840">Figure 9</xref> shows the signal amplitude at 0 mm lift-off. It can be seen that the acquired signals for the two smaller semi-elliptical defects (2 and 4 mm deep, respectively) in rail 7 are very weak. Nonetheless, the system successfully detected all the artificial defects during the manual scan. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954409712444840">Figure 10</xref> shows the ACFM signal after repeating the manual test at 3 mm lift-off. Although all the acquired signals are weaker than those of the first test without any lift-off, the artificial defects are still detectable and qualitatively the responses correspond between the two tests.

<p>From the analysis of the data in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954409712444840">9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954409712444840">10</xref> it can be seen that the depth, angle and shape of the inspected defects influences the resulting signal amplitude. Of particular interest are the signals obtained for the case of the clustered defects in rails 4 and 5. Rail 4 contained three groups of clustered notches (notches with depths 2, 10 and 4 mm) as shown earlier in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954409712444840">Figure 8</xref>. Each clustered group of notches had a different spacing between the notches of the cluster of 5, 10 and 15 mm, respectively. Similarly, rail 5 contains three clusters of three artificial defects with depths of 4, 2 and 10 mm with the same in-between cluster distances as in rail 4, i.e. 5, 10 and 15 mm, respectively.</p>
<p>The data plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0954409712444840">Figure 11</xref> shows the ACFM signal for rail 4 at 0 mm lift-off. It can be seen that for the cluster with a defect spacing of 5 mm the individual defects cannot be resolved and a single strong response is obtained for all three defects which is dominated by the largest defect. However, as the spacing increases to 10 and 15 mm the presence of the individual defects becomes more evident as there are three corresponding indications in each trough to the size of the individual defects belonging to the cluster. This is not so clear for the case of the 10 mm spaced cluster but becomes quite evident in the case of the 15 mm spaced cluster. Another interesting feature in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0954409712444840">Figure 11</xref> is that the overall amplitude arising from the clusters is related to the spacing of the defects with the maximum amplitude being seen for the 5 mm spaced cluster and the lowest for the 15 mm spaced cluster. A similar response is seen for rail 4 during testing at 3 mm lift-off (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0954409712444840">Figure 12</xref>). This is an important finding since in real life RCF cracks on rails are found in the vast majority of cases in the form of clusters rather than individually and this will influence the analysis of the ACFM data.

<p>Tests on rail 5, which also contained clusters of defects but in different order yielded similar results. However, it should be noted that the order of the defects significantly influences the maximum amplitude of the signal as can be seen in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0954409712444840">13</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-0954409712444840">14</xref>. This is more obvious in the ACFM plot at 3 mm lift-off. Therefore, it can be safely concluded that the ACFM signal is also affected by the size order of the clustered defects which can lead to underestimation or overestimation of RCF damage. It remains to be seen whether ACFM array-based probes are equally influenced by these factors.

<p>During the high-speed ACFM tests with the spinning rail rig, the same micro pencil probe used for the turning lathe tests was installed on a customised trolley as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-0954409712444840">Figure 15</xref> (left). Note that the direction of spinning of the rig is opposite to that of the manual tests so the test rails are being inspected from right to left. The probe was set at a lift-off of approximately 1 mm from the surface of the rail. The probe was positioned in such a way that the induced current flowed in the longitudinal direction of the railhead. Therefore, the notches inspected were at a 0° or 35° surface angle with respect to the probe orientation and 90° or 25° to the railhead surface. Although this experimental configuration worked fairly well up to 30 km/h, at higher speeds severe upward movement and vibrations became an issue, resulting in lift-off variations in excess of 7 mm during tests at 48 km/h. The lift-off variations were assessed visually using snapshots from the videos recorded during the tests (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-0954409712444840">Figure 15</xref>). The trolley did not use a spring suspension system to keep the weight of the test rig as low as possible during tests as a precaution. However, this meant that at some points where the trolley wheel to which the probe holder was attached was forced upwards, the probe lift-off increased accordingly. The probe was forced upwards resulting in high lift-offs at the separations between the individual test rails. Since the test rails were not exactly even in height, when the wheel travelled over the separation the height variation caused the trolley to jump. Bowing of the test rails at their centre and vibrations from the rig itself also contributed to lift-off variations being observed during tests at speeds above 30 km/h. These lift-off issues are not expected in real life rail inspection.

To minimise lift-off variation during rotation the probe holder was placed next to the deployment wheel (left). However, since no suspension was used to avoid putting too much weight on the rig, during tests at speeds above 30 km/h substantial lift-off variation could be seen in some places (right).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954409712444840-fig15.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The plots in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16-0954409712444840">16</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17-0954409712444840">17</xref> show the filtered data obtained for rails 3 and 4 at speeds of 1.5 and 48 km/h, respectively. The effect of lift-off variation at high speed can be clearly seen by the changes in the overall ACFM signal plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17-0954409712444840">Figure 17</xref>. However, the induced defects were clearly detected in both rails despite the lift-off variation. The individual defects in the clusters could not be resolved in the signal. The results of the low-speed test resemble those obtained during manual inspection due to better lift-off control. Nonetheless, even at this low speed, the individual defects in the clusters still could not be resolved and it is likely that closely clustered defects can only be resolved at very low speeds.

<p>Following the tests on the rail rig, ACFM measurements without any probe lift-off being involved were carried out on a 50 cm long rail section which had been removed from service and contained mild RCF cracking. The photographs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig18-0954409712444840">Figure 18</xref> show the typical surface length of the inspected RCF cracks.

All defects were successfully detected and it is evident that the largest cracks give rise to a stronger signal than smaller cracks. It should also be noted that the largest defects seem to give a very similar response particularly in <italic>Bx</italic> which is associated with the projected length of the cracks inside the material. This is probably due to the fact that the actual projected length of the cracks is indeed very similar, a fact which will be verified by cutting the cracks open and measuring them.

<sec id="sec6-0954409712444840"><title>Conclusions and future work</title>
<p>This study has investigated the applicability of the ACFM technique for the detection and evaluation of the severity of surface-breaking RCF defects as part of an integrated rail inspection platform under development through the INTERAIL project. Small-scale high-speed laboratory tests with a turning lathe which was used to spin a specially designed rotary sample up to 3000 r/m showed that the probe could successfully detect and rank the artificially induced surface-breaking defects at speeds up to 121.5 km/h. The signal-to-noise ratio remained largely unaffected by the increases in speed under constant lift-off. The turning lathe tests also proved that the defects remained detectable at significant lift-offs exceeding 5 mm although ranking the severity of the defects became more complicated as lift-off increased. Tests using different lift-off values indicated that the intensity of the signal obtained for a given notch was reduced by the square of the lift-off as expected. Actual rail inspection conditions at high speed were simulated using a special spinning rig at the University of Birmingham. Manual tests with a 5 kHz ACFM micro pencil probe showed that all the artificial defects induced on the test rails were detectable. However, ranking became quite complicated when clustered defects were concerned: the ACFM signal amplitude being affected by both the order of the defects as well as the spacing between them. This is an important finding since RCF cracks are predominantly found in the form of clusters. The efficiency of ACFM arrays in resolving individual defects at speeds is currently under investigation.</p>
<p>The ACFM probe used for the turning lathe tests was installed on a special trolley. Unfortunately, this experimental configuration could not prevent lift-off variations that occurred during the spinning rail rig tests at higher speeds due to safety precautions that limited the efficiency of the trolley. Analysis of the obtained results showed that the ACFM sensor successfully detected all artificially induced defects at low speeds and a qualitative indication of their severity was obtained. However, as the speed increased, lift-off variations became significant reaching and exceeding 7 mm during tests. At 48 km/h only some of the defects could be successfully detected and reliable ranking of the detected defects was not possible. Tests were also performed on a rail sample removed from the network which contained real life mild RCF cracks. The ACFM technique was capable of detecting all RCF cracks successfully.</p>
<p>On-going work has focused into ACFM array-type probes containing several sensing elements. Further tests are being planned on the Portuguese rail network under actual conditions and a special deployment mechanism which will be installed on a test train owned by REFER is currently being designed.</p>
