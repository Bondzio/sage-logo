<p>Diversity programming in the manufacturing sector faces the particular challenge of confronting deeply gendered notions of physical strength that are tested directly in everyday situations involving heavy physical work. Increasingly in the United States, this type of diversity must be accomplished in the context of lean manufacturing, a production model that relies upon intensive work in small teams. Yet, this theoretically and empirically important phenomenon is one about which we have little sociological knowledge. Darina Lepadatu and Thomas Janoski address this lacuna in their carefully researched book, taking us into the everyday life of diversity programming in an auto transplant of a major Japanese automaker, dubbed “Kaizen Motors” by the authors. Based on 400 interviews with workers in the plant, Lepadatu and Janoski explore how workers respond to diversity programming that aims to be inclusive on the basis of gender, race, age, and temporary or permanent status. Their findings build especially on our understanding of team organization, gendered work, and the prominent divide between temporary and permanent workers, the latter an understudied distinction in the existing diversity literature.</p>
<p>The authors’ portrayal of Kaizen Motors supports the idea that the organizational principles of lean manufacturing can support broad diversity aims, even though the multifaceted effects of team-centric production may be quite unexpected. When management assigns a diverse team to interrelated tasks that lead to a common goal, an intensive working environment emerges in which women and minorities feel strongly supported and empowered by their critical positions in their teams. But there is a flipside to this heightened sense of commitment to an interdependent team at work: workers who may be furthering the diversity aims of their firm may also have strained family lives, tending to date those they are working with and spend less time with their families. These findings raise a number of intriguing possibilities about how any organization—not just manufacturing firms—can manage diversity: can team-centric approaches that arrange purposely diverse teams simultaneously achieve efficiency, diversity, and increased commitment from workers? At what point might such an approach destabilize the home lives of those workers? Might the same approach have different outcomes if, for example, there was not mandatory overtime in the firm, as there is at Kaizen?</p>
<p>Much of this book focuses on issues related to the women workers of Kaizen, whom the authors call, the “queens of the line.” By and large, Lepadatu and Janoski find that women working at the plant experience an overwhelmingly positive identity transformation. The authors report that women feel valued as workers, feel better about their physical strength, fitness, and attractiveness, and enjoy the status they derive from their secure jobs and high incomes. This finding, however, does not mean that a gendered division of labor has fallen away entirely at Kaizen; some tasks, such as chassis work, remain strongly male-dominated. In such areas where there might be few or only one woman in a team, women enjoy their token status as a privilege rather than as a burden. Men value women for bringing a kind of team cohesion to the line, for chatting to break up the boredom of assembly line work, and for drawing attention to safety that men might overlook in an effort to appear macho. These findings suggest that the model of diversity that has emerged in conjunction with lean manufacturing promotes positive career opportunities for women, while also improving safety and social outcomes for their male peers. At the same time, this study suggests that even the most successful diversity programs do not dispel entirely gendered constructions of physically demanding work. At Kaizen, women are valued most for the interpersonal skills they bring to the line and their attention to quality. Those skills constructed as inherently feminine, however, seem to be given equal value as compared to work like heavy lifting, constructed as inherently masculine.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most significant and interesting finding of the study is that temporary workers do not experience the same positive effects of intensive team interaction in comparison with their permanent counterparts. In this inquiry, the authors dig beyond the “visible diversity” of race, gender, and age to examine how the powerful sense of belonging that brings together diverse individuals fails to work its magic for temporary workers. Temps are a necessary part of a lean manufacturing system, and make up 11 percent of Kaizen’s workforce. They not only fill in for regular workers when they are sick or injured, they also protect the jobs of regular workers during recessions. But at Kaizen, temps are marked as temps. Their t-shirts usually display the name of their temp firm, signaling to regular workers that they are not a part of the regular team. Emotionally, they are not well-integrated into the regular team due to persistent feelings of insecurity: temps become the target of criticism from team leaders, and are more likely than regulars to be fired for errors, despite their two-year contracts. Although temps seemed to be largely content with the opportunity they had at Kaizen, they also perceived themselves as an underclass within their teams. The pervasive feelings of marginalization among temps offer us insight into the fundamental contradiction that pervades the lean production system. Intensive, long-term teamwork fosters diversity agendas across gender, race, and even age divisions, but stops short of including those who are not long-term employees, no matter how vital those temps are to the long-term functioning of the firm as a whole.</p>
<p><italic>Diversity at Kaizen Motors</italic> contains a treasure trove of interesting data on a timely topic of interest to sociologists in many subfields. The kind of access the authors were able to gain is remarkable, as is the depth and number of interviews they were able to conduct. From an analytical perspective, though, the authors could have pushed their theoretical and conceptual engagements further. In most of the book, they take at face value what their interviewees tell them, without probing further why it might be, for example, that their informants articulated “race-neutral” answers to their questions. Rather than using interview data as a jumping-off point for understanding the narratives about diversity that circulate among employees, the authors assume that the words of their informants reflect the “real” social microcosm of the factory they study. This assumption limits the analytical power of the story they are telling, making the book read more like a report than an interpretative study. Still, the impressive dataset the authors bring to bear, as well as the striking findings that emerge from their interviews, offer an important contribution to a burgeoning sociological literature on diversity that has largely overlooked the manufacturing sector.</p>
