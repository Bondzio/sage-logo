<abstract>
<p>Studies have shown that the application of semipermeable membranes to the skin of premature newborns (NBs) can aid in protecting the skin, reduce disturbances in fluid and electrolyte levels, and decrease neonatal mortality. The aim of this study was to verify the effect of using semipermeable membranes in low-birth-weight preterm newborns (PTNBs). A randomized controlled trial was carried out in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) with 42 NBs split evenly into an intervention group (IG), in which semipermeable membranes were used to cover large areas of the skin for the first 7 days of life, and a control group (CG), which received normal care. The variables investigated for the study were weight, hydration status, urinary density, glycemic control, sodium concentration, and daily hydration quota. The following variables displayed significant daily variation: weight, hydration quota, and sodium concentration. Statistically significant individual effects by day and by group were found only for sodium concentration. In the overall analysis of the intersubject effects, sodium concentration, alone, proved to be significant (<italic>p</italic> = .055). Significant effects by group in relation to the sodium concentration were found, with the IG showing a lower average sodium concentration than the CG. Thus, the use of semipermeable membranes reduced fluid loss in premature NBs in the current study, confirming the findings of previous studies. Guidelines for practice may now be warranted.</p>

<body>
<p>Neonates have a higher risk of mortality than other children. Due to the rapid changes that take place immediately after birth, it is crucial to maintain the fluid balance necessary for the maintenance of adequate functioning of vital bodily systems in these infants. This challenge is more serious in preterm newborns (PTNBs) because of the immaturity of their organ systems. Thus, hydroelectrolytic disturbances, especially in extremely premature newborns (NBs), can contribute to neonatal morbidity and mortality.</p>
<p>After birth, water loss occurs through various mechanisms, including the renal system. One of the most important organs for maintaining hydroelectrolytic equilibrium is the skin, which has yet to develop completely in NBs and is susceptible to transepidermal water loss (TEWL). TEWL occurs through the respiratory, digestive, and integumentary systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1099800411423097">Mancini, Sookdeo-Drost, Madison, Smoller, &amp; Lane, 1994</xref>). The degree of TEWL depends on gestational age, postnatal age, weight, thickness of the epidermis and the stratum corneum, blood flow, and environmental factors. During the first day of life, evaporation through the skin is quite significant. In an infant born at 25 weeks' gestational age, TEWL can be up to 15 times greater than in a term NB. In fact, TEWL is responsible for 20% of the energy expended by PTNBs of less than 30 weeks' gestational age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1099800411423097">Walker, Down, &amp; Gomez, 2005</xref>). The increase in TEWL in PTNBs compared to term NBs is due to the thinner skin and reduced stratum corneum, greater cutaneous blood flow, greater percentage of body weight comprised of fluids, higher rate of respiration, and greater body surface area in relation to weight in the PTNB. Increasing the risk of TEWL is the occurrence of lesions that break the cutaneous barrier against evaporation, resulting in a significant loss of heat for the NB. These lesions are related to the removal of adhesives, installation of monitoring mechanisms, exposure of the skin to disinfectant solutions, and congenital skin defects such as those found in omphalocele, gastroschisis, and neural tube defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1099800411423097">Bhandari, Brodsky, &amp; Porat, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1099800411423097">Bustamante &amp; Stelow, 1989</xref>). High levels of TEWL result in complications such as hypernatremia, defined by a plasma sodium level ≥ 150 mEq/L. Investigators estimate that approximately 10–15% of PTNBs in intensive care show some type of possible neurological morbidity related to plasma hyperosmolality, with a risk of peri- and intraventricular hemorrhage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1099800411423097">Agren et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1099800411423097">Lorenz, 2003</xref>). Though TEWL is related more to the body surface area than to weight, clinicians use weight more widely to assess the condition than surface area because weight is easier to measure on a daily basis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1099800411423097">Costarino &amp; Baumgart, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>PTNBs are most at risk of TEWL effects in the first week after birth. Skin maturation occurs quickly after birth and, at the end of the first week of life, the PTNB’s transdermal losses are equal to those of a term NB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1099800411423097">Fanaroff, Hack, &amp; Walsh, 2003</xref>). Advancements in neonatal care have meant significant increases in the rates of NB survival, especially for very low-birth-weight babies. One such advancement is the semipermeable membrane used to protect the skin of PTNBs. The main objective of this membrane is to reduce TEWL. The covering is permeable to vapor and oxygen and impermeable to microorganisms. Once applied, it provides an effective barrier to external contamination and reduces the loss of water vapor by the exposed tissue, producing a humid environment on the cutaneous surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1099800411423097">Bhandari et al., 2005</xref>). The membrane can work as an artificial epidermic barrier helping to prevent dehydration, hyperhydration, and hypernatremia as well as heat loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1099800411423097">Knauth, Gordin, Mcnelis, &amp; Bumgart, 1989</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1099800411423097">Vernon, Lane, Wischerath, Davis, and Menegus (1990)</xref> applied a semipermeable covering of polyurethane over the anterior thoracic region of premature neonates for a period of 2 weeks immediately after birth. They found that, in addition to reducing TEWL in the regions it covered, the membrane did not cause an increase in the number of bacteria below the covering, nor was there any Malassezia furfur dandruff when compared with the noncovered regions. Their findings demonstrate that the semipermeable membrane works as a second skin on PTNBs, creating an atraumatic surface barrier that serves to reduce TEWL while allowing the skin to breathe and mature normally.</p>
<p>However, a number of authors have expressed concerns that there are still few controlled studies analyzing the efficacy of this covering, especially regarding its application on more extensive areas of the body, to draw strong conclusions about the advisability of its use in PTNBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1099800411423097">Bhandari et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1099800411423097">Castellanos et al., 2000</xref>). In particular, they want to see a larger accumulation of evidence concerning the contribution of the semipermeable membrane to reduce weight loss in low-birth-weight NBs. In the present study, we aimed to verify the effect of the semipermeable membrane on TEWL in low-birth-weight PTNBs.</p>
<sec id="section1-1099800411423097" sec-type="materials|method">
<title>Materials and Method</title>
<p>We performed a randomized controlled trial at a maternity hospital in Fortaleza, Brazil. The study population comprised of PTNBs hospitalized in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), who weighed ≤1,500 g and were at a gestational age of ≤32 weeks. We excluded NBs with congenital defects such as gastroschisis, spina bifida, and omphalocele as well as those with neonatal birth injuries. The institution’s Ethics Committee authorized the study, and we obtained written informed consent directly from the parents.</p>
<p>We randomly distributed 42 PTNBs between the intervention group (IG) and control group (CG) using a simple drawing using sealed envelopes containing either the words “intervention group” (IG) or “control group” (CG). After being admitted to the NICU, PTNBs participating in the study were placed in a double-wall incubator and supplied with intravenous hydration, remaining on enteral or parenteral feeding, and ventilatory support. Study personnel assessed each PTNB continually over the course of 7 days. The clinical protocol included mechanical ventilation (MV), continual positive airflow pressure (nasal CPAP), helmet or halo (oxyhood), hydroelectrolytic therapy, antibiotic therapy, and the collection of lab samples for the assessment of clinical status.</p>
<p>For PTNBs in the IG, we placed thin semipermeable membranes composed of 6 ×7 cm polyurethane film on intact skin in the abdominal, thoracic, and dorsal regions and on the inferior extremities. If the skin showed signs of excessive secretions, we cleaned it with distilled water before applying the membrane. This process took place in the second hour following birth, and the membranes remained on the skin for 1 week. There was no need to use adhesives for attaching the membrane because polyurethane adheres naturally to the skin of NBs. We assessed the condition of the skin daily via visual inspection through the membrane. We applied mineral oil to the skin when removing the membrane after the 7th day in order to reduce the chance of injury.</p>
<p>Outcome measures in this study included the following, all measured during the first week after birth: weight measured on a daily basis using a neonatal digital scale, serum glucose level and sodium concentration measured daily each morning, hydration quota measured by water balance and calculated according to the daily record of all fluids ingested and excreted (i.e., difference between intake [intravenous therapy and medication] and output [vomit and urine] of fluids) and urinary density obtained using urine collectors and measurement with a previously calibrated densimeter. We also recorded the date and time of birth, anthropometric measurements (weight, height, cephalic, and thoracic circumference), gestational age (calculated using ultrasound data and the Ballard method), date and time of the application of the semipermeable membrane, type of intravenous therapy, nutrition support used, type of ventilatory support (oxyhood, nasal CPAP, and/or MV), use of an incubator, radiant heat cradle (RHC), and/or type of phototherapy.</p>
<p>We present the data as absolute values and percentages. For quantitative variables, we show the mean and standard deviation as well as the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test results. We used this test to verify the hypothesis of normally distributed data, which are necessary for effective mean comparison. We used Pearson’s chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test to compare baseline clinical variables and interventions implemented during the treatment of NBs in either group in order to verify the association between two qualitative variables. We selected Fisher’s exact test when expected frequencies ≤5 were identified in the contingency tables. We used the <italic>t</italic> test to compare mean differences between groups. This test allows the researcher to verify the existence of statistical differences between two groups in relation to the means of quantitative variables. The application of <italic>t</italic> tests requires verification of the equality of variance between the groups being compared, which we accomplished using Levene’s test.</p>
<p>In order to identify differences between the IG and the CG in terms of the effects of the semipermeable membrane, we performed an analysis of repeated measures. We tested all of the variables as to their normality, equality of variance, and sphericity. These three conditions are necessary for the application of repeated measures analysis. We applied the two initial assumptions during execution of the Kolmogorov–Smirnov and Levene’s tests, respectively. We used the Mauchly test to verify the assumption of sphericity. To compensate for violations of the assumption of sphericity, we used the Greenhouse–Geisser correction when performing the repeated measures analysis. Next, we calculated Pillai’s trace to measure the effects by isolated day and by day and group. This test represents an overall measure of differences in each variable when comparing the intervention and CGs, considering the intra- and intergroup variation. In addition, we present separate measures for intra- and interindividual effects. Measures of intraindividual effects represent differences that occur when comparing the values of each individual with his or her other values. The effect measures represent interindividual differences when comparing the values of each individual with those of other individuals. Finally, we present the partial eta squared (η<sup>2</sup>) as a summary measure of the percentage of influence of each variable on the total variability observed.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>We found no significant statistical differences in baseline clinical interventions implemented or clinical measures between the groups (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1099800411423097">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1099800411423097">2</xref>). The clinical variables of birth weight, height, cephalic circumference, thoracic circumference, and gestational age showed normality and equal variances. The majority of the PTNBs in both groups underwent parenteral and enteral feeding with ventilatory support as well as intravenous hydration and bilispot. In addition, the majority of infants in both groups weighed &lt;1,100 g, were &lt;37cm in length, had cephalic circumference of &lt;27 cm and thoracic circumference &lt;23 cm, and were &lt;30 weeks' gestational age. All of the PTNBs were placed in incubators.</p>

We tested the measurements obtained for weight, hydration quota, sodium concentration, glycemia, and urinary density as to normality of each of the assessment days. Pillai’s trace showed that the variables of weight, hydration quota, and sodium concentration had significantly isolated effects by day. Upon comparison of the effects by day and group, sodium concentration did not show a statistically significant global effect (<italic>p</italic> = .072). The same three variables showed significant intraindividual effects by day according to the Greenhouse–Geisser method. We found significant intraindividual effects by day and by group for sodium concentration only (<italic>p</italic> = .023). In the overall analysis of interindividual effects, sodium concentration, alone, proved to contribute by day and group (<italic>p</italic> = .055). Thus, we found significant individual effects by group for sodium concentration, with the IG having a lower mean than the CG. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1099800411423097">Table 3</xref>, there were differences of up to 5 mEq/L in sodium concentration by day and group.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the present study, we found that application of a semipermeable membrane to the skin of PTNBs immediately following birth led to reduced serum sodium concentration during the first week of life as compared to PTNBs without the skin covering. Sodium concentration showed significant individual effects by day and by group of infants, with the IG displaying a lower average than the CG. This finding implies that the membrane successfully reduced TEWL among infants in the IG.</p>
<p>The clinical team caring for an NB, particularly a low-birth-weight or preterm NB, must carefully monitor the intake and output of liquids and electrolytes with an awareness of the adaptive physiological processes that take place during the neonatal period. Sodium is the electrolyte that is found in greatest concentration in NB plasma. Accordingly, one of the main complications related to excessive loss of fluids is hypernatremia (sodium concentration ≥ 150 mEq/L), which, in conjunction with other electrolytic disturbances, can increase the risks of intracranial hemorrhage and hypothermia due to evaporation of water through the skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1099800411423097">Lund et al., 2001</xref>). The clinical team must establish that the serum sodium concentration is controlled at 12-hr intervals on the first day of life and, subsequently, once per day or with less frequency, depending on the stability of the hydroelectrolytic balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1099800411423097">Darmstadt &amp; Dinulos, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1099800411423097">Omar, 2000</xref>). Clinicians must be particularly vigilant with low-birth-weight infants, who exhibit elevated TEWL and run the greatest risk of hypernatremia. In general, in addition to low birth-weight, NBs at increased risk of hypernatremia exhibit tachycardia, hypertension, reduced urinary output, and metabolic acidosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1099800411423097">Omar, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>One reason for the elevated sodium concentrations in PTNBs is likely the rapid loss of fluids they experience. During the early stages of fetal development, a large proportion of the body consists of water. At 24 weeks' gestation, water represents 90% of total body weight, with approximately 65% in the extracellular compartment and 25% in the intracellular compartment. As the fetus develops, the volume of extracellular liquid drops, and at the end of gestation water comprises 75% of total body weight, with water in the extracellular and intracellular compartments contributing 40% and 35%, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1099800411423097">Yosipovitch, Maayan-Metzger, Merlob, &amp; Sirota, 2000</xref>). Thus, it is possible that the increase in serum sodium concentration in the infants in the CG in the present study was more specifically related to loss of liquids caused by the immaturity of the skin. In this respect, the use of the semipermeable membrane can help minimize these infants' susceptibility to complications related to excessive fluid loss. In fact, in one experimental study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1099800411423097">Bhandari, Brodsky, and Porat (2005)</xref> found that PTNBs treated with the semipermeable membrane were less at risk of hypernatremia during the entire first week of life as compared to the group in which the skin covering was not used. These data support our findings in the present study, in which the sodium concentration was, on average, significantly lower in the IG.</p>
<p>In addition to reporting the positive effect of the semipermeable membrane on serum sodium concentration, it is important to note that we found no dermatological alteration or presence of infection while the membrane remained intact on the infants' skin. When, on rare occasions, it was necessary to remove the membrane, we took preventive measures to protect the skin (such as the use of distilled water or mineral oil). Thus, the semipermeable membrane appears to be a dermatologically safe treatment for PTNBs.</p>
<p>One of the limitations of the present study was the fact that we were not able to measure TEWL directly because we lacked access to the appropriate device due to cost. Rather, we assessed fluid losses over the 7-day period using the proxies of glycemic control, weight, diuresis, hydration quota, urinary density, and sodium concentration. It is also important to note that PTNBs have specific features, such as thermal instability, digestive and respiratory disturbances, and neurological alterations, which can make precise analysis of data difficult. Unfortunately, the scarcity of recent articles relating to the use of semipermeable membranes and measurement of TEWL in NBs prevents comparison of our results to those of others. In addition, though our findings confirm the efficacy of this membrane in maintaining sodium levels, they do not present similar evidence for the other variables studied. Finally, because our study was among at-risk NBs, the sample size could also have affected our ability to identify other statistically significant differences.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Currently, hydration therapy is an important aspect of the care of NBs at risk of TEWL, especially for those who have very low birth weight, due to the increased frequency of parenteral fluid administration. However, given the physiological complexity of PTNBs, there is also a need to create guidelines for caring for the skin of PTNBs in order to reduce the amount of TEWL and minimize its effects. Development of professional codes of conduct and validation of protocols for using the semipermeable membrane may help reduce the risk of complications arising from fluid loss in these vulnerable infants.</p>
