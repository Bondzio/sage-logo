<p>This book is a reminder of the need from time to time for a sustained in-depth critique of exiting bodies of literature and research in a given area. It is perhaps the strength of this book that it critically engages with much of the existing Western literature on sport, race and politics. Its goal is to address the making and subsequent remaking of racial discourse, and the audience is, by and large, the academic community of scholars who are contributing in a particular way to an understanding of what we know about sport, race and racism today. It is a contemporary study and evaluation of, at worst, a theoretical body of knowledge and, at best, a theoretically applied body of knowledge about race, sport and politics.</p>
<p>Each chapter is built around a number of social and political arguments that raise some questions but also suppress others. The key arguments are (i) that sport has become an important if somewhat overlooked arena for the making and remaking of race beyond its own boundaries (p. 3); (ii) the influence of sport upon black politics but more widely African diasporic people and how they understand themselves and how these communities are viewed by others (p. 4) and (iii) what the author refers to as the deeply Priapean nature of modern sports and in particular its white colonial framing (p. 4). It is a trans-disciplinary study and attempt to reframe the question of race and sport.</p>
<p>At times the language is loose, which makes it easier for the author to make a case, but if you are looking for evidence or even advice on how to bring about social change then this is not a book where you will find the answers. The promise of being radical does not fully live up to the actuality of being radical.</p>
<p>Writing in March 2011, Feffer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1749975512458626b">2011</xref>: 1) noted that the world is convulsed in protest and that perhaps it is worth reflecting on whether the world has entered an Age of Activism (1991–present). Certainly during 2010 and early 2011 people filled the streets in different places in the Middle East, the Balkans, Africa and parts of the United States. Their targets were invariably local autocratic leaders, unelected governments and poorly performing economies. In most cases, protesters and activists were demonstrating against specific local sets of conditions, but underlying common tensions existed which meant that the protests which contributed to the Arab spring uprisings shared some concerns with the protesters on the streets in Greece, Italy, Spain and other parts of the world who were affected by downturns in the international markets and economies. In reality activism in different parts of the world is caused by a number of factors, but initially three might be mentioned: the economic recession, the call for transparency, and the increased capacity to socially network through technological advances.</p>
<p>The political question for sport is to what extent does sport contribute to any age of activism? To what extent does sport contribute albeit in ever such a small way to improving capabilities for individuals, communities or nations, or to what extent can sport contribute to narrowing the gap, improving life chances, being a resource which helps to close the gaps between rich and poor? Arguments about poverty do not find a home in this book.</p>
<p>Such reservations aside, this problematic on race, politics and sport is an extremely useful review of a body of work, the arguments are well crafted, and as a starting point for understanding some of the tensions surrounding contemporary thinking about sport, politics and race this is an intervention that needs to be read. If the purpose of the project is to activate university employees to fight for a better world or social change then this is a missed opportunity, but the book is perhaps at its best when it is talking about particular case studies or biographies where sportsmen and women have challenged the world through sport in an attempt to provide alternative ways of seeing and being, and much more could have been made of this.</p>
