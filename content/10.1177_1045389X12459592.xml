<abstract>
<p>This article presents a completely servo-less, piezoelectric controlled, wind tunnel and flight tested, remotely piloted aircraft that has been developed by the 2010 Virginia Tech Wing Morphing Design Team (a senior design project between the Departments of Mechanical Engineering and Aerospace and Ocean Engineering). A type of piezocomposite actuator, the Macro-Fiber Composite, is used for changing the camber of all control surfaces on the aircraft. The aircraft is analyzed theoretically for its aerodynamic characteristics to aid the design of the piezoelectric control surfaces. A vortex lattice analysis complemented the database of aerodynamic derivatives used to analyze control response. Steady-state roll rates were measured in a wind tunnel and were compared to a similar aircraft with servomotor actuated control surfaces. The theoretical analysis and wind tunnel testing demonstrated the stability and control authority of the concept, culminating in the first flight of the completely Macro-Fiber Composite controlled aircraft on 29 April 2010. An electric motor-driven propulsion system is used to generate thrust, and all systems are powered with a single lithium polymer battery. This vehicle became the first completely Macro-Fiber Composite controlled, flight tested aircraft. It is also known to be the first fully solid-state piezoelectric material controlled, nontethered, flight tested fixed-wing aircraft.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The use of small aircraft has become feasible with the decreased size and weight of sensors, video, communication devices, and many other electronic subsystems. Most small radio-controlled (R/C) or unmanned aircraft use servomechanisms linked to independent control surfaces to provide flight control. A common problem observed in a servomechanism actuated control system is the reduction in lift and the drag penalty that results from control linkages, horns, hinges, and the discontinuities between the control surface and the stabilizer or the wing. Articulated sections actuated by servomechanisms consist of a large number of moving mechanical parts such as hinges, linkages, gears, bearings, shafts, and motor coils. A functionally equivalent solid-state control surface may have the potential of reducing the mechanical part count. Increasing the efficiency and/or reducing the complexity of the control surfaces for small aircraft are desired, and either or both may be achieved by employing continuous camber control of the control surfaces.</p>
<p>There are several benefits of using camber control as a type of morphing over the trailing edge (TE) control. First, the low Reynolds (Re) number flow regime can result in flow separation that reduces the effectiveness of a TE control surface. Second, power-limited small aircraft cannot afford to lose energy through control surface drag. The main challenge is found in operating a relatively compliant, thin structure (desirable for the actuator) at high dynamic pressures to extract controlling forces. Establishing a wing configuration that is stiff enough to prevent flutter and divergence, but compliant enough to allow the range of available motion, is the central challenge in developing a morphing wing. Another challenge is the low energy density of materials, which present direct electromechanical coupling, that are currently available. The energy density for these materials, quantified here as work-output-per-material-density, may be severely low compared to conventional actuation mechanisms. In addition, the necessary electronic circuits may introduce increase in complexity in the electronic subsystem. Novel smart material actuators and methods of mounting the actuator can take advantage of aerodynamic loads to reduce control input moments and increase control effectiveness.</p>
<p>Shape memory alloys and piezoelectric materials are the most widely used “smart” or active materials because they offer high actuation energy density. A smart material, from a broad perspective, is a solid-state material that has a transduction property between two or more fields (electrical to mechanical, thermal to mechanical, etc.). Specifically, piezoelectric materials have been extensively studied and employed in aerospace structures by performing shape and flow control. The Macro-Fiber Composite (MFC) is a type of piezoelectric actuator that offers structural flexibility and high actuation authority. A common disadvantage with piezoelectric actuators and with the MFC actuator is that they require high-voltage (HV) input. An MFC actuator could be excited up to 1.8 kV, and some smart material systems may require up to 10 kV. In contrast, the current drain is usually low, creating reasonable power consumption. The HV demand requires additional amplifiers, converters, and electronic circuits to be included in the system. With continuing developments in electronic systems, smart materials are becoming more feasible in small aircraft.</p>
<p>The following section presents a comprehensive literature survey on the use of piezoelectric materials in flightworthy rotary-wing aircraft blades, missile fins, rotary-wing exit-guide-vanes, and small fixed-wing aircraft.</p>

<title>Literature survey</title>
<p>During the past few decades, smooth and continuous control surface designs with piezoelectric materials have been implemented for vibration control of continuous surface aerodynamic applications. Although the strain output of piezoelectric materials is very small for low excitation levels, the response is relatively linear and they offer relatively high force output in a wide frequency range. In the linear regime, the fast response of lead zirconate titanate (PZT) actuators caused initial interest in the field of aerodynamic vibration control. Many researchers focused on the application of piezoelectric materials to the blades of rotary-wing aircraft to improve their performance and effectiveness. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1045389X12459592">Steadman et al. (1994)</xref> showed an application of a piezoceramic actuator for camber control in helicopter blades. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1045389X12459592">Giurgiutiu et al. (1994)</xref> have researched the performance improvement on rotor blades using strain-induced actuation methods (using PZTs). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1045389X12459592">Giurgiutiu (2000)</xref> presented a comprehensive review on the application of smart material actuation to counteract aeroelastic and vibration effects in helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft. For flap actuation, devices range from piezobimorphs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1045389X12459592">Koratkar and Chopra, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1045389X12459592">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1045389X12459592">Spangler and Hall, 1990</xref>), piezostacks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1045389X12459592">Janker et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1045389X12459592">Lee, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1045389X12459592">Lee and Chopra, 2001a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1045389X12459592">2001b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1045389X12459592">Straub et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1045389X12459592">2009</xref>), and piezoelectric/magnetostrictive-induced composite coupled systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1045389X12459592">Bernhard and Chopra, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1045389X12459592">Cesnik et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1045389X12459592">Cesnik and Shin, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1045389X12459592">Derham and Hagood, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1045389X12459592">Kovalovs et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1045389X12459592">Rogers and Hagood, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1045389X12459592">Shin, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1045389X12459592">Shin et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The “quasi-static” shape control in aerodynamic applications using piezoelectric materials started in early 1990s. In static aeroelastic control, researchers employed both the low-amplitude (mostly linear) and high-amplitude (nonlinear) excitation ranges of the piezoelectric material. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1045389X12459592">Crawley et al. (1989)</xref> presented one of the first investigations on active aerodynamic surfaces. The researchers constructed a bending-twist coupled graphite–epoxy plate and actively bent it using bonded piezoceramic sheets. When the plate was exposed to air loads, it bent further, which increased the twist, and accordingly, the control deflections were effectively magnified through the coupling. In 1989, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1045389X12459592">Barrett (1990)</xref> presented one of the first examples of a twist-active piezoceramic actuated missile wing and a helicopter rotor blade. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1045389X12459592">Ehlers and Weisshaar (1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1045389X12459592">1992</xref>) presented research on adaptive wings and missile fins and showed that aeroelastic tailoring coupled with directionally attached piezoceramic (DAP) elements could be used to generate sufficient deflections for flight control. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1045389X12459592">Lazarus et al. (1991)</xref> examined the feasibility of using representative box wing adaptive structures for static aeroelastic control. In 1992, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1045389X12459592">Barrett (1992)</xref> demonstrated a torque-plate rotor that generated static pitch deflections of ±4.5° and was capable of 3/rev individual blade control. The torque-plate rotor concept was matured in the following years leading to a whirling stand test of a 120-cm solid-state adaptive rotor. This test showed that static pitch deflections of ±8° could be generated, and dynamic pitch deflections could be commanded through 2.5/rev (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1045389X12459592">Barrett and Stutts, 1997</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1045389X12459592">Barrett and Law (1998)</xref> designed, fabricated, and tested a new class of twist-active wing where the pitch angle of the wing root was adjusted using a DAP torque-plate. Wind tunnel tests showed that the wing tip of their prototype could twist up to ±1.5° that is comparable to an aileron deflection of ±8.4°. The root-twist concept was also over 20% lighter than conventional ailerons.</p>
<p>During the same period, the Flexspar solid-state adaptive stabilator was introduced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1045389X12459592">Barrett (1996)</xref>. The Flexspar configuration employs a high-strength main spar around which a flexible skin structure (shell) is pivoted. A piezoelectric bimorph actuator is mounted within the flexible skin structure and causes the skin structure to rotate about the spar. The deformation of Flexspar actuated control surface is mainly a rigid body rotation; however, some twist and change in camber are also induced by aerodynamic loading. The Flexspar actuator was used in several vehicles including the first full missile configuration with an adaptive wing. Even without aeroelastic tailoring, deflections in excess of ±30° were achieved in some configurations. The first fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to fly using adaptive materials for all flight control, Mothra, was introduced in 1994 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1045389X12459592">Barrett et al., 1997</xref>). This vehicle employed Flexspar actuators for control of rudder and elevator, and it had no other control surfaces. Although the two Flexspar actuated stabilizers were not completely solid state, the aircraft showed the feasibility of piezoelectric materials for flight control. The first rotary-wing UAV to fly using adaptive materials for all flight control, Gamara, was introduced in 1996 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1045389X12459592">Barrett et al., 1998</xref>). A commercially available R/C rotary-wing UAV was stripped of all conventional servoactuator-related hardware, including the servopaddle assembly. In its place was a pair of two solid-state adaptive rotor torque-plate servopaddles. Flight tests showed the feasibility of the piezoelectric control and benefits in drag (26% reduction), weight (8% total gross weight reduction), and part count (reduced from 94 to 5). In 1997, Kolibri became one of the first rotary-wing microaerial vehicles (MAVs) to use piezoelectric actuators (Flexspar) for flight control. This tethered, 15-cm-diameter vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) aircraft demonstrated controlled flight with the Flexspar actuators (weighing 5.2 g each) that can achieve a static stabilator pitch deflection of ±11° (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1045389X12459592">Barrett and Howard, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1045389X12459592">Lee, 1997</xref>). In 1998, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1045389X12459592">Barrett and Stutts (1998)</xref> proposed an actuator that uses a pair of piezoceramic sheets arranged in a push–pull assembly to turn a spindle of an aerodynamic control surface of a munition. Wind tunnel testing showed the feasibility of the concept. In 1999, the Lutronix Coleopter VTOL MAV (LuMAV) followed Kolibri by replacing the electric motor with an internal combustion engine and getting rid of the electrical tether (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1045389X12459592">Barrett et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1045389X12459592">Barrett and Lee, 2000</xref>). This rotary-wing aircraft also used the Flexspar actuators.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1045389X12459592">Pinkerton and Moses (1997)</xref> discussed the feasibility of controlling the wing geometry employing a piezoelectric actuator known as the thin layer composite unimorph ferroelectric driver and sensor (THUNDER). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1045389X12459592">Geissler et al. (2000)</xref> adopted piezoelectric materials as the actuation element for a morphing leading edge: however, in this case, the leading edge is an independent element able to rotate around an internal hinge. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1045389X12459592">Munday and Jacob (2001)</xref> developed a wing with conformal curvature, driven by a THUNDER actuator. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1045389X12459592">Wang et al.

(2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1045389X12459592">2008</xref>) presented the optimization of sizing and placement of piezocomposite patches on an active TE concept and an active twist concept for helicopter rotor blades. The 2002 Virginia Tech Morphing Wing Design Team (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1045389X12459592">Eggleston et al., 2002</xref>, of the Department of Aerospace and Ocean Engineering) experimented with the use of piezoceramic materials (THUNDER actuator), shape memory alloys, and conventional servomotors. Wind tunnel testing showed the feasibility of the smart material systems.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1045389X12459592">Barrett (2004)</xref> reviewed several families of adaptive aerostructures and flightworthy aircraft, including rotary- and fixed-wing vehicles, munitions, and missiles. More than 40 adaptive aerostructures programs that have had a direct connection to flight test and/or production UAVs, ranging from hover through hypersonic and from sea level to exostratospheric, were examined. A historical analysis showed the evolution of flightworthy adaptive aircraft from the earliest staggering flights in 1994 to the publication date in 2004. For example, in 2001, a convertible coleopter UAV was introduced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1045389X12459592">Barrett (2002)</xref>. This type of aircraft is capable of hovering like a helicopter, then transition nearly 90° to fly like an airplane. The XQ-138 aircraft achieved yaw control through deflections of its turning vane flaps; pitch and roll controls were maintained by a set of cascading “grid” fins. The aircraft was later fitted with the postbuckled precompressed (PBP) actuators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1045389X12459592">Barrett and Tiso, 2004</xref>). The PBP concept employed piezoelectric elements along with elastic elements to magnify control deflections and forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1045389X12459592">Barrett et al., 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1045389X12459592">Vos et al. (2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1045389X12459592">2008</xref>) conducted research to improve the PBP concept for aerodynamic applications. Roll control authority was increased on a 1.4-m span UAV.</p>

(2009)</xref> designed and fabricated a smart flapping wing using a graphite/epoxy composite material and an MFC actuator. A 20% increase in lift was achieved by changing the camber of the wing at different stages of flapping motion. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1045389X12459592">Bilgen et al. (2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1045389X12459592">2009</xref>) demonstrated a unique application of piezocomposite actuators on a 0.76-m span morphing wing aircraft. In this application, two MFC patches were bonded to the wings of a small demonstration vehicle, and the camber of the wing was changed with voltage. Adequate roll control authority was demonstrated in the wind tunnel as well as in flight. All electronics, including MFC power electronics, were powered by an 11.1-V lithium polymer battery. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1045389X12459592">Bilgen et al.

<title>Current motivation</title>
<p>The review of the literature shows that a completely solid-state piezoelectric controlled fixed-wing aircraft does not exist. The purpose of the research is to exploit solid-state MFC actuation to perform complete flight control of a small aircraft and to determine the feasibility and advantages of smooth control surface deformations. Continuous camber control, instead of an articulated control surface, is employed as a morphing strategy. The article is organized as follows: First, the development of HV electronics (to drive the MFC actuators) is presented. Next, the two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) theoretical aerodynamic analyses are presented, and the fabricated aircraft is introduced. Next, wind tunnel tests, aimed at determining the steady-state roll rate of the fabricated aircraft, are presented. The following section presents the flight tests and an analysis of the flight characteristics. The article concludes with a brief summary of results and recommendations.</p>

<title>High-Voltage electronics</title>
<p>The effective application of piezoelectric actuators requires attention to the driving electronics as well as the structure. Due to the nature of piezoelectric materials, a HV converter is necessary onboard the aircraft to convert the voltage from the battery to a desired value (proportional to the user input) to actuate the MFCs to their peak excitation level. The highest deformation per active material weight by a piezoelectric-based actuator (hence by the MFC actuator) can be achieved by a bipolar–bimorph configuration. In this configuration, the electronics can supply current in both directions, and the actuator has two layers of piezoelectric material that can be actuated in opposite polarity. There are several approaches of implementing a piezoelectric control surface with incremental increases in complexity and performance. A unipolar direct current-to-direct current (DC-DC) converter allows the conversion of low-voltage (typically 3–24 V) and high-current (0.1–1 A) source to a high-voltage (0–10 kV) and low-current output. This converter can provide actuation in one direction and can leverage 75% of the MFC actuation range (reason discussed later). To attain a full actuation range, the unipolar voltage signal to the MFC can be switched depending on the desired actuation direction. An electromechanical relay can be used; however, it is known that relays can cause electrical discontinuities. On the other hand, using several unipolar or bipolar converters to achieve bipolar actuation of the MFC increases the weight and power consumption by two (or four for some cases). The electrical configuration that can use the peak actuation range can result in increase in total weight and complexity and reduced overall efficiency and energy density. The following sections describe the individual electromechanical components of an MFC actuated control surface. The fabricated converter that allows bipolar–bimorph actuation is presented at the end of the section.</p>

<title>The Macro-Fiber Composite actuator</title>
<p>Piezoceramic materials have been used in many applications due to their high-frequency bandwidth. In many cases, the piezoceramic materials are brittle, making them impractical for direct shape control. MFCs were developed at NASA Langley Research Center (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1045389X12459592">Wilkie et al., 2000</xref>). An MFC is a flexible, planar actuation device that employs rectangular cross-section, unidirectional piezoceramic fibers (PZT 5A) embedded in a thermosetting polymer matrix. This active, fiber-reinforced layer is then sandwiched between the copper-clad Kapton film layers that have an etched interdigitated electrode pattern. A comprehensive manufacturing manual for the MFC can be found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1045389X12459592">High and Wilkie (2003)</xref>.

<title>Characteristics of an MFC actuated bimorph</title>
<p>A bimorph employing MFC actuators requires several electronic components for achieving the peak actuation range. In contrast to the traditional bimorph (monolithic piezoceramic material in <italic>31</italic> mode), the <italic>33</italic> mode interdigitated MFC has an asymmetric (−500 to +1500 V) actuation range. For a monolithic piezoceramic based bimorph, a series (or parallel depending on the polarization direction) electrical connection provides equal voltage drop across both active layers. If an MFC is connected in series, the negative limit of −500 V can be exceeded (with the application of +1500 V to the opposite layer), and the piezoceramic will be repolarized. For a bimorph employing monolithic piezoceramic materials, the excitation to the two piezoelectric layers can be supplied from the same power source. Therefore, a single bipolar power source is sufficient for peak-to-peak actuation. If an MFC is connected in the same fashion, the actuation range will be limited to −500 to +500 V. In order to develop sufficient control forces and moments to achieve a complete flight (from takeoff to landing), it is critical that the peak-to-peak range of 2 kV is employed.</p>

<title>DC-DC converters</title>
<p>A DC-DC converter is a relatively simple electronic circuit that amplifies a DC signal. DC-DC converters are a good choice for driving piezoceramic materials (as well as some lasers) because of the relatively high voltage-output and low-power demand of these systems. A low-voltage power source (e.g. battery) can be converted using a DC-DC converter with approximately 45% electrical efficiency in a frequency range of 0–10 Hz. These converters typically receive input of 0.7–5 V and can output up to 10 kV proportional to the input. Maximum power consumption is typically below 3 W. A current buffer amplifier is typically used to drive the converter, where current can be drawn from the power source and the voltage output is controlled by a reference voltage (e.g. from a data acquisition system or aircraft receiver).</p>
<p>First, several commercially available DC-DC converters, purchased from AM Power Systems (AM Power Systems Website), are experimentally analyzed. These converters are 23 mm wide and 36 mm long and have a weight of 4.6 g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1045389X12459592">Figure 1</xref> shows the electrical response of an AM2505P-type converter from AM Power Systems that is capable of unipolar output of 2.5 kV. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1045389X12459592">Figure 1(a)</xref> shows the input–output relationship for various resistive loads. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1045389X12459592">Figure 1(b)</xref> presents the power consumption per output voltage also for several resistive loads.

<title>Voltage divider circuit</title>
<p>As stated earlier, a bimorph actuator is preferred, instead of a unimorph, employing two piezoceramic actuators operating in the <italic>33</italic> mode (MFCs in our case) instead of two monolithic piezoceramic materials that operate in the <italic>31</italic> mode. The challenge with the MFCs is that the maximum driving voltage range is “asymmetric”; therefore, a passive, solid-state voltage divider circuit, proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1045389X12459592">Bilgen et al. (2010c)</xref>, is used in the converters that power the solid-state control surfaces in the morphing aircraft (presented later). This circuit allows the division of voltage depending on the direction of current induced by the HV source. The division is required for an MFC bimorph in two possible electrical configurations (a) with two unipolar DC-DC converters or (b) with a single bipolar DC-DC converter. The design consists of solid-state passive electrical components (resistors and diodes). The circuit is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1045389X12459592">Figure 2</xref> (highlighted in the large dashed box).</p>

Note that the MFCs are represented by capacitors with a value of 13 nF in the circuit diagram. These capacitors are for “representative” purposes, and they (1) do not represent the actual (high order) dynamic response of the MFC bimorph and (2) are not a part of the circuit. The circuit can operate in both electrical potential gradients (e.g. <italic>V1</italic> &gt; <italic>V2</italic> or <italic>V2</italic> &gt; <italic>V1</italic>) without any physical changes. The circuit chooses the specific “voltage divider” resistances depending on the input potential polarity (hence the direction of the current). The details and the analysis of the circuit are presented in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1045389X12459592">Bilgen et al. (2010c)</xref>.</p>
<p>The voltage divider circuit is prototyped for a preliminary evaluation. Four diodes (model SP5L (Product sheet for SP5L type high-voltage diode) from HV Component Associates with a reverse breakdown voltage of 5 kV) are used along with two 33-MΩ and two 100-MΩ resistors (purchased from DigiKey Corporation). The input–output relationship showed an excellent linear behaviour for both MFC outputs. For the case when <italic>V1</italic> &gt; <italic>V2</italic>, the MFC1 (which is in extension) received up to +1500 V; simultaneously, the MFC2 (which is in compression) is actuated with a potential of −500 V. For the case when <italic>V2</italic> &gt; <italic>V1</italic>, the MFC1 (which is in compression) received up to −500 V; simultaneously, the MFC2 (which is in extension) is actuated with a potential of +1500 V. The total voltage drop across the circuit is low; hence, the power loss due to resistive heating is small. This circuit allows the bimorph (with MFC actuators) to be actuated to its full input range using two unipolar DC-DC converters. The circuit is composed of resistors and diodes; therefore, the useful bandwidth of the circuit is limited by three factors: (a) frequency limit of the piezoceramic (10 kHz for the MFC actuator), (b) the power input limitation of the piezoceramic (which is a function of both amplitude and frequency), and (c) the frequency and power limitations of the diode (due to the small junction capacitance and heat dissipation limitations). These restrictions are specific to the components used in the system; therefore, the reader is referred to the product specifications listed by the manufacturer of the MFC actuator (Product sheet for the MFC actuator) and the HV diode (Product sheet for SP5L type high-voltage diode).</p>

<p>First, the control signal from the receiver is translated into an analog DC signal. The signal from the receiver is a pulse width modulation (PWM) signal. Depending on the PWM duty cycle, an active low-pass filter converts the PWM signal to a DC voltage. The dsPIC30f2010 microcontroller is used to interpret this DC voltage (by an analog to digital conversion) and produce two PWM signals (one proportional and the other inversely proportional to input signal). Next, these two PWM signals are fed into two separate paths that power two separate unipolar DC-DC converters. One of the four fabricated converters is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1045389X12459592">Figure 4</xref>. <fig id="fig4-1045389X12459592" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Fabricated bipolar bimorph high-voltage converter with two outputs of ±2 kV, supply input of 11.1 V, and standard PWM control input.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1045389X12459592-fig4.tif"/></fig>The use of a microcontroller made it easy to define the minimum and maximum PWM duty cycle values (hence the DC voltages).

<title>Solid-state control surfaces</title>
<p>A radio-controlled and commercially available aircraft is chosen to test the fully solid-state piezoelectric flight concept instead of designing the aircraft from scratch. The main reason for choosing a commercially available platform is to allow for a fair comparison between the solid-state and discrete control surfaces. An aircraft with detachable wings and tail is also preferred. First, an analysis of the current R/C market is conducted to select the aircraft and its performance characteristics. Through the use of manufacturer websites and online hobby shops, a breakdown chart of R/C aircraft categories is generated. Based on the market research, the list of R/C aircraft types is narrowed to the aerobatic park flyer. This R/C aircraft type is chosen based on its portability, its appeal to modelers, cost, fuselage volume, and several other reasons. The aerobatic park flyer offers modelers with the ability to fly the aircraft at virtually any outdoor location, while still offering flight characteristics that thrill the modeler. Based on a decision matrix assembled using several commercially available aerobatic park flyer aircraft, the Great Planes Edge 540 (TowerHobbies) scale model is chosen as the baseline aircraft. To make a relatively fair comparison between the baseline and the solid-state aircraft, the plan-form parameters of the morphing aircraft (chord, span, sweep, dihedral, and so on) were kept equivalent to the scale Edge 540 model. The following sections present the design and theoretical analysis of the baseline and morphing wings and horizontal and vertical stabilizers. Next, the stability and roll response of both the baseline and the morphing aircraft are theoretically analyzed. Finally, the fabricated morphing aircraft is presented.</p>
<sec id="section11-1045389X12459592">
<title>Aerodynamic design and analysis of the wings</title>
<p>The utilization of an MFC actuated variable camber control surface introduces challenges in the design and fabrication processes. First, a thin (and compliant) airfoil is desired to maximize the chordwise deflection induced by the MFC actuators. The aerobatic requirements of the aircraft call for the wings to be stiff in both spanwise and chordwise directions. Both aerodynamic and structural requirements of the aircraft favor a thicker wing. These conflicting design requirements cause the need for a unique morphing wing design that is a compromise between the competing requirements. The problem is addressed using a thick and aerodynamically favorable wing leading section that smoothly blends into a thin and flexible morphing trailing section. The trailing section is proposed to be an MFC actuated bimorph.</p>
<p>First, a MATLAB program was developed to calculate the coordinates of such an airfoil for a wide range of structurally feasible input parameters. These parameters include geometric properties such as the thickness of the leading section profile (based on NACA four-digit airfoils), the length of the leading NACA profile, the length of the variable camber trailing section, the thickness of the trailing section, and the input voltage to the MFC actuator. To create the airfoils (hence the wings, rudder, and the elevator), the program first outlines the leading NACA profile, splices it at a user-defined fraction of the chord and then resizes the remaining section to the desired leading section length. Next, the trailing section (which is a thin MFC bimorph) is outlined, scaled, and actuated depending on the geometric parameters such as length, thickness, and the actuation voltage. Next, a spline interpolation is employed to create a smooth transition between the leading and trailing sections, completing the airfoil. Symmetric NACA four-digit profiles with thicknesses between 4% and 15% are investigated in the parametric analysis. Using a fixed variable camber trailing section length of 112 mm and a thickness of 0.81 mm, individual wing cross sections (airfoils) are analyzed at the root, mid-span, and the tip. The leading section length (spliced NACA profile) is defined as 78% of the remaining chord not taken up by the trailing morphing section, with the other 22% used to transition between the leading and trailing sections.</p>
<p>A previous research presented in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1045389X12459592">Bilgen et al. (2010a)</xref> is employed to aid the design of the MFC bimorph morphing trailing section of the main wings and the stabilizers. In this study, a thin MFC bimorph airfoil was formed by sandwiching a 25.4-µm-thick stainless steel sheet with four MFC M8557-P1 type actuators (two on each side) and bonding the laminate under vacuum. The airfoil had a 127-mm chord. The chordwise displacement response at peak voltage values corresponded to an approximately ±5% change in camber under aerodynamic loading at a flow velocity of 15 m/s and at a Re number of 127,000. It was observed that the flow-induced deformation of the airfoil was relatively small at 15 m/s when compared to the piezoelectric strain-induced deformation. The effect of piezoelectric hysteresis nonlinearity was observed in the displacement versus voltage response. However, the displacement response was repeatable, and a circular arc with constant curvature was shown to be a good approximation of the displacement field along the chordwise direction. Using the results from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1045389X12459592">Bilgen et al. (2010a)</xref>, the theoretical aerodynamic analysis in this article is done by assuming a linear relationship between displacement and voltage, and this assumed relationship is matched to the actual nonlinear response of the thin airfoil at the peak voltage levels. Since the proposed variable camber trailing section is in a bimorph configuration, the MFCs on the opposite side are actuated with an opposite field and with 3-to-1 fixed ratio (as imposed by the voltage divider circuit presented earlier). Excitation levels of −1500 (−500 V to top MFC and +1500 V to bottom MFC), 0, and +1500 V (+1500 V to top MFC and −500 V to bottom MFC) are investigated for each thickness and spanwise location, representing a maximum negative (−5% camber), zero, and maximum positive (+5% camber) deflections, respectively.</p>
<p>An aerodynamic panel method code, XFOIL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1045389X12459592">Drela, 1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1045389X12459592">2000</xref>), was used to analyze the 2D aerodynamic characteristics of both baseline and variable camber airfoils. First, a validation of XFOIL was conducted using wind tunnel results from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1045389X12459592">Gault (1949)</xref> for the baseline airfoil section (NACA 63-009) currently used in the main wings of the scale Edge 540 aircraft. This experiment was conducted at a chord Re number of 5.8 × 10<sup>6</sup> and a Mach (M) number of 0.167. The critical transition amplification ratio, <italic>n</italic>, which was used to describe the (expected) low turbulence level in XFOIL, was set to 9. A total of 320 panels were used to define the airfoils in XFOIL. The lift curve slope was accurately predicted. The stall was over predicted by 20% when compared to the wind tunnel data. Both of these observations are considered when analyzing the aerodynamic results obtained from XFOIL.</p>
<p>The cruise speed was initially assumed to be between 18 and 27 m/s, so the Re and M numbers corresponding to the cruise speeds of 18, 22, and 27 m/s were calculated. The corresponding Re and M number pairs were 200,000–0.05, 260,000–0.06, and 310,000–0.08, respectively. From a preliminary analysis (not reported here) of the NACA 63-009 airfoil at these Re and M number combinations, only a small difference in lift and drag coefficients was observed over a range of angle of attack (AOA). The differences were most notable at stall, but they were still very small. It was determined that further comparisons only need to be made between airfoil shapes, without considering variations in the Re and M numbers in flight. All further analyses are conducted at Re = 310,000 and M = 0.08.</p>
<p>First, the aerodynamic response of the baseline NACA 63-009 airfoil with a discrete TE control surface at deflections of 0°, 11°, and 20° is evaluated. These deflections are chosen as they represent the maximum deflection for low and high rates on the baseline Edge 540 aircraft. The length of the TE control surface is set to 25% of the chord. Next, a parametric study was conducted to determine the effect of the thickness of the symmetric NACA leading section (ranging from 4% to 15% chord) to the proposed airfoil concept with a thin, variable camber trailing section. The goal of this analysis is to determine the aerodynamic performance of the airfoils with thin variable camber trailing section and to match (or exceed) the aerodynamic characteristics of the baseline airfoil. This is necessary to ensure that the aircraft is able to fly with the same performance when using the morphing control surfaces as it does with the baseline. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1045389X12459592">Figure 5</xref> shows the theoretical 2D lift coefficient plotted against AOA, as well as the drag polar plot.

<p>The analysis of the effect on leading section thickness shows that the desired lift curve slope and the maximum lift are not achieved by leading section thicknesses less than 9% (for both nonactuated and actuated comparisons); therefore, only thicknesses of 9% and greater are considered. A thickness upward of 12% will be best structurally due to the spar tube thickness limitations.

<p>A similar analysis was also conducted for other spanwise locations for the stability analysis of the aircraft (presented in the next section).

<title>Vortex lattice model and static stability analysis</title>
<p>A 3D aerodynamic analysis was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness and the stability of the baseline and the morphing aircraft designs before the wind tunnel and flight tests. The aircraft was modeled using a vortex lattice software, Athena Vortex Lattice (AVL; see Drela). AVL is well suited for aerodynamic configurations that consist mainly of thin lifting surfaces at small angles of attack and sideslip. These surfaces and their trailing wakes are represented as single-layer vortex sheets, discretized into horseshoe vortex filaments, whose trailing legs are assumed to be parallel to the streamwise axis. AVL provides the capability to also model slender bodies such as fuselages and nacelles via source + doublet filaments. Since the fuselage is expected to have a small influence on the lift and roll responses, it is left out of the model. AVL assumes steady flow. It also assumes that any oscillatory motion (in roll or in pitch) must be slow enough so that the period of oscillation is much longer than the time it takes the flow to traverse an airfoil chord. Also, the roll, pitch, and yaw rates used in the computations must be slow enough so that the resulting relative flow angles are small. It must be noted that AVL only predicts the induced drag portion of the total drag. A cosine chordwise and spanwise distribution is chosen for discretization of the geometry into vortex lattice panels. The cosine spacing is generally the most efficient distribution (best accuracy for a given number of vortices). The strips are concentrated at the leading edge and TE along the chordwise direction and at root and tip along spanwise direction. Flight dynamics are determined by linearization of the aerodynamic model for a specified trim condition. The AVL model used in this analysis consists of the main wings, horizontal tail, and vertical tail. The geometry of the main wing is defined using four cross sections. A simple check showed that increasing the number of cross sections defining the main wing from two to four had virtually no impact on the results (&lt;0.1%). At each spanwise station, the lift curve slope is adjusted to the viscous value calculated by the XFOIL analysis to (partially) account for the effect of thickness and viscosity. The fuselage area between the main wings is approximated by a rectangular section compromising a varying camber shape. The shape is an interpolation from the left-wing root camber to a midpoint section defined by a flat plate and finally to the opposite right-wing root camber. This configuration is chosen to allow the left-wing and right-wing sections to be actuated in an opposite sense. In other words, this prevents a discontinuity in the camber line variation at the midpoint. The horizontal tail is modeled using three sections. The vertical tail is modeled using two sections. The locations of the leading edge of each lifting surface and their respective chord lengths are measured (from the baseline Edge 540) and are used to define the aircraft geometry. The <italic>x</italic> = 0 point (on the roll axis) for the aircraft model is assumed to be the front of the engine cowl (of the baseline scale Edge 540). The reference point is assumed to be the 1/4 chord of the main wings (which is at <italic>x</italic> = 25 cm). The final AVL geometry is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1045389X12459592">Figure 9</xref>.</p>

The similarity of the results is to be expected since both airfoils are relatively thin and have approximately the same thickness. The wing sections of the AVL model are defined solely on the basis of the mean camber line and the corrected lift curve slope. The modified vortex lattice analysis does not account for most of the viscous effects; therefore, the expected drag reduction from a smooth morphed control surface over a discrete servo-aileron is not observed here.</p>

The main wings are assumed to be in their nonactuated configuration at 0° or 0 V. In both the morphing and baseline cases, the analysis indicates that the elevator has strong authority, and only small deflections will be necessary to trim the aircraft.

<p>In the event that the total lift coefficient of the nonactuated main wings is inadequate, the trimmed flight condition may require the main wings to be operating at a cambered, nonzero voltage state to produce more lift.

<title>Steady-state roll response analysis</title>
<p>To calculate the steady-state roll rates, a video of another scale Edge 540 aircraft (an existing aircraft used to film a promotional video for the manufacturer) in flight, performing steady-state roll maneuvers, was studied. It was assumed that the aircraft in the video was using the highest possible aileron deflections also known as “3D rates.” Because this was a promotional video and the aircraft rolls appeared to be very quick, it is reasonable to assume that 3D rates were used. A whole number of rolls, <italic>n</italic>, are counted and the elapsed time, <italic>t</italic>, is recorded with a stopwatch. The roll rate <italic>p</italic> is found using the equation <italic>p</italic> = 360<italic>n</italic>/<italic>t</italic>. The average steady-state roll rate is found to be approximately 377°/s.</p>
<p>The rolling moment derivative resulting from the roll rate, <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub>, can be used to determine the settling time for a step roll command.

</inline-formula> is the rolling moment coefficient derivative with respect to deflection of the aileron. The time constant represents how fast the aircraft approaches a new steady-state condition after being disturbed with a control input. The range of aileron deflections for the baseline (nonmorphing) aircraft is known for each “rate setting” (controlled by the pilot). For the low-rate setting, the aileron deflection is 11° (16 mm). For the high-rate setting, the aileron deflection is 20° (29 mm). For the 3D rate setting, the aileron deflection is 33° (44 mm). The wingspan of the scale Edge 540 is <italic>b</italic> = 104 cm.

<p>where <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>ss</italic></sub> is the steady-state rolling rate. The rolling velocity is typically used to quantify an aircraft design to meet certain minimal control requirements. It is found that the morphing aircraft had a slightly higher maximum steady-state roll rate compared to the baseline; however, roll performance appears to be essentially unchanged, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-1045389X12459592">Figure 13</xref>. This calculation assumes that the moment of inertia about the roll axis is the same for both configurations. Again, note that the anticipated benefits of the flow resulting from morphing wings over servomotor actuated wings are not observed in the inviscid solutions since they do not account for flow separation and viscous effects. The graph, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-1045389X12459592">Figure 13</xref>, is in terms of normalized actuation amplitude where the baseline is assumed to have a maximum of aileron deflection of 20°, and the morphing wing has a maximum of aileron actuation of +1500 V.</p>

<p>In summary, the theoretical 3D analysis showed that the expected response of the morphing aircraft is similar to that of the baseline under the assumption that both aircraft have equal moment of inertia. The theoretical steady-state roll rate analysis presented in this section shows “equivalency” of the conventional and morphing aircraft from an aerodynamic point of view. These theoretical results provide guideline for the fabrication stage that is presented in the following. Due to the in-house fabrication limitations, it is expected that the prototype morphing aircraft will potentially be heavier than the conventional aircraft (which is mass produced), and therefore, its steady-state roll rate will be lower than the predicted values.</p>

<sec id="section14-1045389X12459592">
<title>Overall specifications of the aircraft</title>
<p>Using the 2D and 3D analyses and structural constraints, the morphing main wings, and vertical and horizontal stabilizers were fabricated. The fuselage of the baseline aircraft was modified so that the baseline and morphing control surfaces can easily be changed. The wingspan of the morphing aircraft is 104 cm, which matches the scale Edge 540 baseline aircraft. Twelve MFC M8528-P1 actuators, 85 mm long and 28 mm wide, were bonded together to form six bimorphs and employed in each main wing. The vertical tail employs two bimorphs, also formed using the MFC M8528-P1 actuators. The morphing elevator has two sections, each employing two MFC M8528-P1 and two MFC M8507-P1 type actuators. The CAD model of the final aircraft is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-1045389X12459592">Figure 14</xref>.<fig id="fig14-1045389X12459592" position="float"><label>Figure 14.</label><caption><p>Model of the final design of the morphing aircraft.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1045389X12459592-fig14.tif"/></fig> Note that there are no servomotor actuated control surfaces in the morphing aircraft. All solid-state control surfaces are MFC actuated bimorphs. The figure also shows two of the custom converters, mounted to the side of the modified (extended) engine mount. The aircraft electronics are typical for model airplanes except for the power electronics that drive the MFC actuators. Remote communication is achieved using a 72-MHz radio transmitter and receiver combination. All electronics, including MFC power electronics (four custom converters, 55 g each), are powered by an 11.1-V lithium polymer battery, a common choice for remotely controlled aircraft. The MFC power electronics consume approximately 3.0 W each during maximum actuation. A RimFire 35-30-1250 brushless motor is used to generate thrust.</p>
<p>The final iteration of the fabricated morphing aircraft weighed approximately 1403 g, which is significantly more than the weight of the baseline aircraft, 804 g. The weight increase was due to design modifications along the fabrication process and due to the overdesign of the morphing control surfaces. The increased weight caused a higher cruise speed, slower response, and also higher cruise incidence angle. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1045389X12459592">Table 1</xref> presents the weight comparison of the baseline and morphing aircraft in detail.</p>

<p>It is observed that a significant amount of deformation can be attained by the MFC bimorph actuated control surfaces. Before the wind tunnel tests (presented in the following), the torsional and bending stiffnesses of the main wings are compared to the baseline. This test is conducted by applying different levels of pure bending and pure torsional loads to both baseline and morphing wings and measuring the transverse deflection and angle of rotation, respectively, for each test case. It was determined that the morphing wings had slightly higher torsional and bending rigidities. As noted earlier, this is due to the overdesign of the morphing wings. A video showing the operation of the wings can be seen in the YouTube website of the 2010 Wing Morphing Design Team (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1045389X12459592">VTWMD YouTube Link, 2010b</xref>).</p>

<title>Wind tunnel experiments</title>
<p>It is important to have accurate roll rate information to determine the benefits of the morphing control surfaces for an R/C aircraft. The steady-state roll response of the baseline and morphing wings were quantified by wind tunnel experiments. Free-to-roll tests were conducted in the Virginia Tech Stability Wind Tunnel on 15 April 2010. The test setup consisted of a scale Great Planes Edge 540 EP fuselage and tail with interchangeable baseline and morphing wings. The model was mounted to a rigid carbon fiber tube running the length of the fuselage along its roll axis and exiting the aft section of the fuselage, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig19-1045389X12459592">Figure 19</xref>. The tube extended back to the tunnel sting mount through bearings and fixed with collars.</p>

</fig>
<p>Multiple tunnel speeds were chosen in the range of 9 and 27 m/s, depending on the vibration behavior of the model. Aileron deflections for the baseline aircraft correspond to the maximum deflection on the low-rate (11°) and high-rate (20°) settings. The steady-state roll rates were measured for each set of speeds and aileron deflections. The morphing wings were actuated with positive and negative excitation levels of 500, 1000, and 1500 V. A video camera and multiple stopwatches were used to determine the roll rates of the aircraft. The results, presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig20-1045389X12459592">Figure 20</xref>, show that the baseline configuration at high-rate deflection (+20°) was able to achieve approximately 40% higher roll rate than that of the morphing configuration at its maximum voltage (+1500 V). Although the morphing wings provide an aerodynamic benefit by virtue of their smooth and continuous surfaces, the MFCs were not able to deflect as much as the servomotors during these tests and therefore had less control authority.</p>

</fig>
<p>For both configurations, the roll rate varied depending on the direction of roll (i.e. a positive or negative deflection or voltage). This directional bias for both cases can be attributed to differences in fabrication between wings and to the slight asymmetric mounting of the support rod with respect to the thrust line. Also, a significant amount of vibration was observed during roll at high speeds. During the tests, the aircraft nose oscillated in small circles, and occasionally, a “sticky point” in the roll was observed where it momentarily slowed down. These effects were negligible at low airspeeds; however, they became evident at higher speeds and explain, in part, the decrease in roll rate at 27 m/s for some cases. It is worth noting that the direction bias was small for the baseline configuration but significant for the morphing configuration. This may be because the morphing wings were fabricated in-house, but may also be a result from some hysteresis that was not fully accounted for (as assumed) during the test procedure.</p>

<sec id="section16-1045389X12459592">
<title>Flight tests</title>
<p>A series of flight tests (total of seven) were conducted that culminated in a final full morphing configuration flight test. The first four flight tests, not presented here, were conducted to understand the stability and dynamic characteristics of the aircraft due to the increase of weight from the baseline aircraft. These preliminary tests had no piezoelectric control surfaces; however, the effects of the morphing control surfaces in terms of mass and inertia were represented using distributed weights on the baseline aircraft. The videos of the preliminary flight tests can be seen in the YouTube website of the 2010 Wing Morphing Design Team (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1045389X12459592">VTWMD YouTube Link, 2010a</xref>).</p>
<p>The first flight test that introduced the morphing control surfaces to the baseline aircraft, flight test number 5, was conducted on 11 April 2010. The aircraft configuration consisted of the MFC actuated wings and a servomotor actuated tail. The objective of the flight was to demonstrate the ability of the morphing wing to sustain flight and provide sufficient actuation for roll control. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig21-1045389X12459592">Figure 21</xref> shows the aircraft before the flight. It was found that the MFCs were sufficient to control aircraft in roll. However, the response time from pilot transmitted signals was delayed, and the tendency for the MFCs not to center (due to hysteresis) when user input was centered proved problematic. The effect of flying the aircraft by line of sight with piezoelectric hysteresis and with the first-order response lag resulted in overcompensation in roll controls. Due to the limited flight time (from batteries) and the lack of confidence in the aircraft, an emergency landing was attempted. The landing position was misjudged and resulted in a nose strike and wing tip strike into the ground. The damage included a broken wing spar tube, minor cracks in the fuselage around the landing gear, and a broken propeller. The damage to the fuselage was repaired with epoxy and super glue. A new wing spar tube and propeller were installed. Although the removable wing spar tube was split into three pieces at the wing roots, the morphing wings were not damaged. The video of this flight can be seen in the YouTube website of the 2010 Wing Morphing Design Team (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1045389X12459592">VTWMD YouTube Link, 2010b</xref>).</p>

<p>The first flight test with all-morphing control surfaces, flight test number 6, was conducted on 29 April 2010. The date and time for this test were chosen in cooperation with the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) NOVA (a popular science television series) film crew, who were at the site to record the test for the production of the show called <italic>Making Stuff: Smarter</italic> hosted by David Pogue. The wind conditions were unfavorable when the first flight attempt was made; however, the flight was conducted due to the schedule of the PBS film crew. Due to unpredictable logistical issues at the test site, this first flight was not attempted until around noon. By this time, the wind speed and the temperature were significantly higher compared to the originally scheduled early morning hours. Several takeoffs were unsuccessful due to the lag in rudder control. The torque from the motor pulled the aircraft to one side of the runway, and keeping the aircraft centered was a challenge. On the third takeoff attempt, the lag in the rudder upon liftoff was corrected with some roll control; however, once again the lag and hysteresis of the tail and the wings turned this into an uncontrollable roll and eventual dive into the ground. The impact destroyed the front part of the fuselage (engine mount); however, all the morphing control surfaces remained intact. The total fight time was approximately 10 s. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig22-1045389X12459592">Figure 22</xref> shows the aircraft before the flight.</p>

</fig>
<p>A second flight test on 29 April, flight test number 7, was also conducted. A spare fuselage was assembled on the field from the wreckage of flight test number 6. It was decided to fly without the morphing rudder to avoid the problems encountered at takeoff with the previous flight test. For the present flight test, the aircraft flew successfully; however, there was an oscillatory roll action due to the lag and hysteresis of the wings throughout the flight. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig23-1045389X12459592">Figure 23</xref> shows the morphing aircraft in flight. In addition, there were very high winds (relative to the recommended by the manufacturer of Edge 540) and periodic drops in altitude resulting from the constant side-to-side rolls. The pilot’s attention was focused on keeping the aircraft level, and there were no moments of steady flight that would allow the pilot to climb to a comfortable altitude. Eventually, one of the altitude drops during the first landing attempt resulted in the aircraft crashing into a tree. The foremost part of the fuselage was destroyed. The output shaft of the servomotor for the rudder, which was used to fix the position of the rudder, was stripped; however, the morphing elevator and main wings remained intact. Total flight time was 2 min and 30 s. It is again worth mentioning that the flight was conducted early in the afternoon where the average wind speed was two to three times higher than the desired wind speed for such lightweight aircraft. The video of these flights can be seen in the YouTube website of the 2010 Wing Morphing Design Team (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1045389X12459592">VTWMD YouTube Link, 2010b</xref>).

<title>Conclusion and recommendation</title>
<p>The goal of this research was to assess the ability of MFC actuated morphing surfaces to control a remotely controlled aircraft during the complete flight spectrum. The flight tests demonstrated that the morphing aircraft was able to accommodate the additional weight of the morphing system, and the morphing surfaces provided enough control authority for flight. However, the flight tests also showed that the morphing aircraft was sluggish and resembled a “slow flyer” rather than an aerobatic aircraft like the baseline. Although the morphing surfaces provided sufficient control, the dynamic stability of the aircraft became a major concern because of the hysteresis and lag effects of the MFC actuators. The lag in the input–output response of the piezoelectric control surfaces was caused by the large total capacitance of MFCs. Nonetheless, a fully morphing flight was successfully achieved, and several partial morphing flights were very promising. During the flight tests, several incidents occurred. The aircraft fuselage and other nonmorphing parts were completely damaged for some cases; however, the compliant and variable camber control surfaces were undamaged even after the hardest landings. It is the experience of the authors that this is not the case for vehicles with conventional control surfaces. It should be pointed out that one of the valuable lessons of these trials was in realizing the resiliency of the design. Because of the flexible nature of the control surfaces, these components are able to absorb impact energy, with little or no damage to the structure.</p>
<p>In summary, the flight tests demonstrated the potential of morphing wing flight and provided insight into the major challenges associated with this technology. The results presented here show conclusively that continuous camber change via MFC actuators (a) is feasible, (b) allows operation during flight, and (c) works beyond the laboratory in a flight demonstration. The MFC actuators were successfully employed to change the camber of the wings symmetrically and asymmetrically to cause pitch and roll moments, respectively. A combination of lightweight amplifiers and converters supplied the HV required by the MFC actuators. All systems were powered with a single lithium polymer battery.</p>
<p>One of the major lessons learned from this project was the increase in lag exhibited by a large number of MFCs (connected in parallel) powered by the power-limited onboard converters. This lag, which is directly proportional to the total capacitance of the system, has a significant adverse effect on the flying qualities of the aircraft, making it “hard to fly.” Apart from ensuring a seasoned pilot flying the plane on the first flight attempt, it is recommended that a thorough study of the dynamic stability and control of the aircraft be conducted. In particular, it is fundamentally important to model the first-order (resistive–capacitive) actuator response and the hysteresis nonlinearity of the control surfaces. Once this analysis is made, the driving electronics (mainly the microcontroller) can easily be modified to provide more responsive and linear actuation. It would be ideal to implement a control system that converges to the commanded signal or to simulate these dynamics in an R/C simulator to give the pilot extensive training on the ground.</p>
