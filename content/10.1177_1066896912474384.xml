<abstract>
<p>The differential diagnoses of neck mass may include a wide spectrum of lesions ranging from cysts, inflammatory processes, benign and malignant tumors arising from skin, soft tissue, lymph nodes, endocrine glands, salivary glands to metastatic tumors. In adults, malignant non-thyroid neck masses are often metastatic squamous cell carcinoma. Gynecomastia, presenting as a mass or enlargement in its typical subareolar location is usually a straightforward diagnosis. Enlargement due to gynecomastia in locations other than subareola can pose diagnostic challenge. We describe a unique case of gynecomastia presenting as a neck mass in a patient who was diagnosed and treated for squamous cell carcinoma of the floor of the mouth.</p>

<body>
<p>A 53-year-old man was found to have right neck mass on a follow-up visit for squamous cell carcinoma. The patient was diagnosed with a moderately differentiated keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma of the right floor of the mouth and tongue for which he underwent a composite resection that included the mandible, floor of the mouth, hemiglossectomy, and bilateral neck dissections. The defect was reconstructed with a free fibular bone graft and pectoralis myocutaneous flap. The patient recovered well from his multiple procedures. However, on a follow-up visit to the plastic surgery clinic 3½ months later, a mass was noted in the right neck. Clinically, this mass was thought to be malignant. No fine needle aspiration or core biopsy was performed prior to the excision of the mass.</p>
<p>Intraoperatively, a 3 × 3 cm mass deep to the subcutis was excised from the right neck adjacent to the pectoralis muscle flap and medial to the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Pathology demonstrated a 3 × 2.8 cm, somewhat well-delineated area of dense fibrous tissue surrounded by adipose tissue of subcutis. Instead of histological features of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma, this area of dense fibrous tissue demonstrated unexpected ductular structures surrounded by periductal fibrosis and edema, reminiscent of gynecomastia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1066896912474384">Figure 1</xref>). The diagnosis of breast tissue with gynecomastia-like changes was confirmed on learning that the neck mass corresponded to the area where the prior pectoralis flap was implanted.</p>

<p>Gynecomastia is conventionally defined as the enlargement of the male breast due to hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the glands and stroma. Gynecomastia, when present in its typical subareolar location, is usually a straightforward diagnosis. However, when it is found in peculiar location, it can present a diagnostic quandary.</p>
<p>We believe it is valuable to share this case not only for its unique and interesting presentation but also as an example of how a complete history and prior surgical procedure is crucial for a correct pathologic diagnosis. Without the full knowledge of the history and procedure, unexpected findings such as this on a small biopsy or needle aspirate may lead to inappropriate treatment.</p>
