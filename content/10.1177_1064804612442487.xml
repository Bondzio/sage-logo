<p>Ergonomics standards can be a very useful source of information for both hardware and software designers. In addition, products sold in Europe must typically meet relevant International Organization for Standardization (ISO) ergonomics standards, and most products currently being developed are intended for the world marketplace. However, ISO standards are available only by purchasing them from the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). So the question for most designers is whether the cost of a given ISO ergonomics standard would be justified based on its usefulness in regard to improving design.</p>
<p>One example in determining the cost-benefit of purchasing an ISO ergonomics standard is <italic>Ergonomics – General approach, principles and concepts</italic> (ISO 26800:2011), which costs $208, may be of general interest to practitioners, but contains only general guidance and information and probably would have limited impact on design decisions. ISO 26800 presents the general ergonomics approach and specifies basic ergonomics principles and concepts that are intended to be applicable to the design and evaluation of tasks, jobs, products, tools, equipment, systems, organizations, services, facilities, and environments. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1064804612442487">Table 1</xref> shows the table of contents.</p>

<p>In this article I describe some of the ergonomics standards being developed in two of the ISO subcommittees charged with developing standards relevant to the ergonomic design of systems and their usefulness to practitioners. I also describe the HFES standards and those being developed by a Joint Working Group of ergonomics and software quality technical committees.</p>
<sec id="section1-1064804612442487">
<title>International Ergonomics Standards for Designers</title>
<p>Although ISO 26800 is intended for designers, ergonomists, and project managers, as well as managers, workers, consumers (or their representatives), and procurers, it does not provide specific design guidance (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1064804612442487">Table 1</xref>). ISO 26800 was developed by Subcommittee 1 (SC 1) of the Ergonomics Technical Committee (TC 159), which is charged with producing general standards that apply across various ergonomics subject areas. Such generic ergonomics standards are useful for standardizing terminology and general principles across more specific application-area standards. Therefore, these generic ergonomics standards are probably more useful to managers and ergonomics standards developers than they are to practitioners.</p>
<p>The other SCs of TC 159 have published and are in the process of developing more detailed standards that are important for practitioners. For example, TC 159/SC 4’s (Ergonomics of human-system interaction) current scope covers ergonomic standardization of the interaction between systems (often computer based) and the people who design, manufacture, use and maintain them. Areas of standardization include hardware ergonomics (including input, display and interactive devices), software ergonomics (including dialogue and interaction design) and human centred design processes and methods (including usability engineering and participative design methods).</p>
<p>A list and description of the standards produced by SC4 can be found at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_tc_browse.htm?commid=53372&amp;published=on">http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_tc_browse.htm?commid=53372&amp;published=on</ext-link>.</p>
<p>An example of a soon-to-be published ergonomics standard that provides detailed information useful to software designers is ISO 9241-143 (<italic>Ergonomics of human-system interaction</italic> – Part 143: Forms). ISO 9241-143 presents requirements and recommendations for the design and evaluation of forms – in which the user fills in, selects entries for, or modifies labeled fields on – a “form” or dialogue box presented by the system. Often the system then creates or updates the data associated with the form. Form-based entries typically are in the form of typed input (abbreviations, or full names) or selections from available option lists. The standard is applicable to forms regardless of the modality in which they are rendered (visual, spatial, or vocal). However, much of the guidance is based on a model of visual and spatial relationship.</p>
<p>ISO 9241-143 also specifies the use of nontext methods for providing forms entries (e.g., list boxes) and pertains to dialogue boxes that utilize form techniques. Guidance is provided on the selection and design of user-interface elements that are relevant to forms.</p>
<p>As can be seen in the table of contents for ISO 9241-143 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1064804612442487">Table 2</xref>), this standard contains a great deal of detail that should be useful to a practitioner who will be designing forms. As of this writing, it has passed its vote as a Final Draft International Standard (FDIS), which is the last stage prior to a standard’s being published. Publication is expected during the first half of 2012.</p>

<title>Hfes Standards for Designers</title>
<p>The Human Factors and Ergonomics Society has developed and published a number of ANSI standards that are useful to practitioners. For example, ANSI/HFES 100-2007 (<italic>Human Factors Engineering of Computer Workstations</italic>) provides useful information regarding the design of computer workstations and associated components. ANSI/HFES 200-2008 (<italic>Human Factors Engineering of Software User Interfaces</italic>) offers recommendations concerning accessibility, interaction techniques, interactive voice response, visual presentation of information, and use of color.</p>
<p>Section 3 in ANSI/HFES 200, Interaction Techniques, on forms was used as the basis for ISO 9241-143, described earlier. In addition, Section 4, Interactive Voice Response, was the basis for ISO 9241-154, <italic>Design guidance for interactive voice response (IVR)</italic>, which should be released soon as an FDIS. However, in the case of both forms and IVR, the inclusion of additional content and refinements based on the participation of international experts from various countries and organizations have improved these standards.</p>
<p>As an example of cooperation between HFES standards committees and ISO, the HFES 200 Committee and the ISO Working Group developing the ISO software accessibility standard (ISO 9241-171) worked together to ensure that the two standards were consistent and equivalent with regard to accessibility. For more information on these standards, visit the HFES Standards Web page at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.hfes.org//Web/Standards/standards.html">http://www.hfes.org//Web/Standards/standards.html</ext-link>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1064804612442487">
<title>Other Standards</title>
<p>Another ISO standards activity that should be of interest to software developers are the series of Common Industry Format (CIF) standards being developed by an ISO joint working group between software engineering (JTC 1/SC 7) and ergonomics of human-system interaction (TC 159/SC 4). This joint working group is responsible for developing requirements for standards in the “Software Quality Requirements and Evaluation (SQuaRE)” series concerning Common Industry Formats for usability-related information. The joint working group has published ISO/IEC PDTR 25060, <italic>General Framework for Usability-related Information.</italic> The group has also prepared Draft International Standards (DIS) for Context of Use descriptions (ISO/IEC 25063) and User Needs Reports (ISO/IEC 25064), as well as New Work Item Proposals for User Requirements and Evaluation Reports. ISO/IEC 25063 and 25064 should be published some time in 2012.</p>
<p>In conclusion, software designers should periodically check newly published ISO and ANSI standards related to ergonomics and user interface design, because many of these standards are specifically intended for practitioners and contain very useful requirements and recommendations.</p>
