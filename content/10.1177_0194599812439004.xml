<title>Objective</title>
<p>The aim of this study is to review the literature about nasal mucociliary clearance (MCC) and passive smoking in otorhinolaryngology by clearly explaining their relationship in a cross-sectional study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0194599812439004">
<title>Study Design and Setting</title>
<p>This cross-sectional study was conducted at the Umraniye Education and Research Hospital in Turkey. Umraniye Education and Research Hospital Ethical Committee approved the study, and informed consents of the patients were obtained.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0194599812439004">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Our study consisted of patients who presented to the Ear-Nose-Throat Department of Istanbul Umraniye Education and Research Hospital between February 2011 and July 2011. Three groups of subjects were evaluated: 15 passive smokers (group 1), 17 active smokers (group 2), and 15 healthy matched controls (group 3). All patients were asked to answer our questions regarding their smoking history, and nasal MCC time was assessed for all individuals of the 3 groups.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0194599812439004">
<title>Results</title>
<p>The mean MCC value was 23.59 ± 12.41 in the smoking group, 12.6 ± 4.67 in the passive smoking group, and 6.4 ± 1.55 in the healthy group. The comparison of MCC values between the smoking group and passive smoking group and between the smoking group and healthy group revealed statistically significant differences (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .01). There was also a significant difference between the MCC values of the passive smoking group and the healthy group (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .01). In addition, we compared MCC values according to exposure number of cigarettes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0194599812439004">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In this study, we conclude that passive smoking affects nasal MCC. Both active and passive smoking increases nasal MCC time when compared with healthy controls.</p>

<p>Mucociliary transport mechanism of the nose helps to eliminate foreign particles, pathogens, and toxins to obtain normal nasal physiology.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599812439004">1</xref></sup> There are studies in the literature that have described associations between the defect in mucociliary clearance (MCC) and some rhinological pathologies (ie, sinusitis, allergic rhinitis, nasal polyposis).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812439004">2</xref></sup> Because of this relationship, otorhinolaryngologists still show great interest in new articles about MCC.</p>
<p>According to the literature, MCC can be affected from toxins, drugs, environmental heat, smoking, pressure, pH, and so forth. It has also been shown that trauma, sinonasal surgery, and some rhinological applications may have an effect on MCC.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812439004">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>There is a thoroughly documented association of MCC and smoking; however, the correlation of passive smoking and MCC has not been clearly documented yet. The correlation of passive smoking and MCC has been the topic of only a limited number of articles. One of the relevant studies presented by Atef et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812439004">4</xref></sup> stated that passive smoking has a negative impact on sinus cilia regeneration following functional endoscopic sinus surgery. Also, De et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599812439004">5</xref></sup> suggested that passive smoking might alter the inflammatory response within the nasal mucosa in a similar way to allergy.</p>
<p>Passive smoking and its relationship with upper airway pathology is a popular issue that has been published commonly in the recent literature. Because of insufficient data about the relationship between passive smoking and nasal MCC, we aimed to clarify this relationship by our cross-sectional study.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<sec id="section7-0194599812439004">
<title>Study Objectives and Design</title>
<p>In this study, we especially focused on the effect of passive smoking on nasal MCC. This cross-sectional study was conducted at the otolaryngology clinic of Umraniye Education and Research Hospital in Turkey. Umraniye Education and Research Hospital Ethical Committee approved the study, and informed consents of the patients were obtained.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0194599812439004">
<title>Setting</title>
<p>The study was conducted at an education and research hospital with a residency training program in otolaryngology.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0194599812439004">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Our study consisted of patients who presented to our hospital’s outpatient clinic between February 2011 and July 2011. Participants were recruited from voluntary subjects who had been referred to our clinic for symptoms other than rhinological diseases. At least 3 years of smoking history or passive smoke exposure time was required in order to be included to our study. Also, we excluded individuals with current upper respiratory tract infection, allergic rhinitis, major septal deviation, a history of previous nasal surgery, and trauma. Three groups of subjects were evaluated: passive smokers (group 1, 15 subjects), active smokers (group 2, 17 subjects), and control group (nonsmokers, no exposure to environmental smoke, group 3, 15 subjects).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0194599812439004">
<title>Questionnaire and Protocol</title>
<p>Individuals whom we included provided their information about passive and smoking history. Patients were asked to answer these questions:</p>
<list id="list1-0194599812439004" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Smoking history: Do you smoke? How many cigarettes/d do you smoke?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Passive smoking history: Do you live together with person(s) at home who smoke? Do you work with people who smoke in closed areas? How many cigarettes/d are you exposed to in closed areas?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>According to these results, active smokers were classified into 3 groups: those consuming less than 10 cigarettes/d, 10 to 20 cigarettes/d, and more than 20 cigarettes/d. In addition, passive smokers were classified into 2 groups according to environmental exposure in closed areas: less than 10 cigarettes/d and more than 10 cigarettes/d. Nasal MCC time was assessed for all individuals of the 3 groups.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0194599812439004">
<title>Measurement of Nasal MCC</title>
<p>There are various techniques to evaluate the activity of the nasal mucosa. Although stroboscopy, roentgenography, and photoelectron techniques can evaluate ciliary activity, they are quite expensive for routine use. Saccharin test and rhinoscintigraphy are the most commonly used techniques for the measurement of nasal MCC. Tc-99m-MAA is the most popular radiopharmaceutic used in rhinoscintigraphy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599812439004">6</xref></sup> Although rhinoscintigraphy is a reliable and easily reproducible method, it has potential side effects. Therefore, we used the saccharin test to evaluate the nasal MCC in our study.</p>
<p>For the saccharin test, subjects were seated and positioned with the head slightly extended. The saccharin granules were 2 to 3 mm in diameter. A saccharin granule was placed under visual control 2 cm inside the right nostril by the tester. Subjects were instructed to swallow every 30 seconds per minute with a chronometer. After the placement of the saccharin granules, participants continued the test individually. The subjects used a stopwatch to indicate the time that they first perceived the sweet taste of the saccharin and recorded the time in minutes. Within the duration of the test, individuals were requested to maintain their position and were not allowed to breathe deeply, cough, talk, sniff, or sneeze.</p>
<p>Nasal MCC may be affected by environmental temperature, humidity, and partial oxygen pressure. Age was also reported as an individual factor affecting nasal MCC. Normal nasal MCC is supposed to range between 9 and 17 minutes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599812439004">7</xref></sup> To standardize the temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, and age among subjects, we studied within the same city with same climate and same partial atmospheric pressure. Therefore, we accepted nasal MCC of nonpassive/active smoker subjects as the control group.</p>

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>NCSS 2007&amp;PASS 2008 Statistical Software (Kaysville, Utah) was used for all analyses, and a biostatistician reviewed the results. Besides standard descriptive statistical calculations (mean, median, and standard deviation), a 1-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test was used to compare the data between group in quantitative parameters showing normal distribution, and the Tukey HSD test was used for the determination of the group responsible for the difference. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used in the assessment of parameters according to groups. The Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test was used for the evaluation of differences. The statistical significance level was established at <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Normal nasal function depends on several factors. MCC is an important factor for normal nasal function. It is the first line of the airway defense against noxious stimuli in the environment. Inhaled particles are trapped within the mucus of the airways, and they are transported to the pharynx by ciliary transport. Then, they are either swallowed or coughed up. There are 3 components that this mechanism depends on: the volume and composition of airway surface liquid (mucus and periciliary fluid), the ciliary structure and beating frequency, and the mucus-cilia interaction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599812439004">8</xref></sup> Therefore, alterations in either ciliary function or physical and chemical properties of mucus can lead to ineffective mucociliary flow.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599812439004">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Exposure of the ciliated epithelium to particles of cigarette smoke results in a significant decrease in ciliary beat frequency.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599812439004">10</xref></sup> According to Cohen et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599812439004">11</xref></sup> ciliary beats diminish as a result of smoking. MCC has been shown to be slower in regular smokers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599812439004">11</xref></sup> Proença et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599812439004">12</xref></sup> showed the acute and chronic response of nasal MCC to tobacco smoke exposure in smokers. Stanley et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599812439004">13</xref></sup> also showed that smoking elongates nasal MCC. They stated that smoking decreases cilia number and changes the viscoelastic property of mucus. Diseases such as cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis, immotile cilia syndrome, septum deviation, a history of nasal surgery or trauma, diabetes mellitus, adenoid hypertrophy, and inflammatory process of the upper airway also interact with MCC rate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812439004">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Active smoking has been causally associated with nasal MCC. The correlation was described in detail in previous literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599812439004">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599812439004">11</xref></sup> However, in the present literature, the relationship between nasal MCC and exposure to passive smoking has not yet been clearly described. Nowadays, research on passive smoking is quite popular. For example, Mallis et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599812439004">14</xref></sup> demonstrated that passive smoking in the working environment presents a contributing risk factor for laryngeal cancer. On the other hand, Hammarén-Malmi et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0194599812439004">15</xref></sup> have shown that maternal tobacco smoking was associated with a 4-fold increase in the risk of recurrent acute otitis media after the insertion of tympanostomy tubes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0194599812439004">15</xref></sup> Also, Brook<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0194599812439004">16</xref></sup> reported the importance of cessation of smoking in parents not only for restoration of their own normal flora but also for its beneficial effects on their children.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0194599812439004">16</xref></sup> In short, recent studies have presented evidence that passive smoking could play an important role in upper aerodigestive tract pathologies. It may be hypothesized that it could be related to the direct effect of MCC.</p>
<p>Only a limited number of articles studied the correlation of passive smoking and its effect on nasal MCC. Passive smoking is also identified as secondhand smoke (SHS) and environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) in the literature.</p>
<p>According to the literature, SHS exposure is associated with diseases such as asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis, and lower airway infections that are also associated with impaired nasal MCC.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0194599812439004">17</xref></sup> The mechanism by which SHS might impair nasal MCC remains incompletely understood. There are some hypotheses about possible mechanisms of effect of SHS on nasal MCC. One of them is that SHS impairs epithelial ion transport, which can negatively affect MCC.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0194599812439004">18</xref></sup> Savitski et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599812439004">9</xref></sup> showed that SHS exposure inhibits chloride secretion and basolateral K+ conductance, which could also affect MCC.</p>
<p>Bascom et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0194599812439004">19</xref></sup> studied the correlation between ETS and nasal MCC. They classified ETS into 2 different groups: ETS sensitive and non–ETS sensitive. They found that after clean-air exposure, the percentage tracer remaining was similar in the 2 groups. After smoke exposure, the non–ETS-sensitive subjects showed accelerated nasal MCC. In contrast, the ETS-sensitive subjects had no change in mean clearance.</p>
<p>According to an animal study by Zayas et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0194599812439004">20</xref></sup> mucus transport was significantly reduced, even after exposure to the smoke of 1 cigarette. They also showed extensive areas of tissue disruption by scanning electron microscope. The clearance of mucus on the frog palate was significantly reduced after exposure to ETS, and cilia and the extracellular matrix were anatomically disrupted.</p>
<p>In our study, we found that the comparison of MCC values between the active smoking group and the passive smoking group and between active smoking group and the control group revealed statistically significant differences (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .01). There was also a significant difference between the MCC values of the passive smoking group and the control group (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .01). When we compared MCC values according to exposure to the number of cigarettes per day in the passive smoking group, there was a statistically significant difference between the group exposed to &lt;10 cigarettes/d and the group exposed to &gt;10 cigarettes/d. In the active smoking group, the comparison of MCC values between the group consuming &lt;10 cigarettes/d and the group consuming 10 to 20 cigarettes/d revealed statistically significant difference. However, when we compared the MCC values between the group smoking 10 to 20 cigarettes/d and the group smoking &gt;20 cigarettes/d, there was no significant difference. There was also a significant difference between the group smoking &lt;10 cigarettes/d and the group smoking &gt;20 cigarettes/d.</p>
<p>One of the limitations of our study was the change that results in the sensation of taste in smokers that could adversely affect saccharin test results. Another disadvantage of this test is that the nasal mucociliary transit rate was not measured. Rhinoscintigraphy could have supplied objective and detailed information that allows quantitative analyses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599812439004">6</xref></sup> The small sample size and the difficulty in precise measurement of the amount of tobacco exposure are the other limitations of our study. Finally, to understand a more objective relationship between passive smoking and nasal MCC, further research needs to be done by using the scintigraphic methods with a larger group of participants.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>There are various factors described in the literature that may affect nasal MCC.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812439004">2</xref></sup> Smoking is also a well-known factor that could have an effect on nasal MCC.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599812439004">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599812439004">11</xref></sup> However, the correlation between passive smoking and nasal MCC has not been evaluated and published before. Published data in the literature about the effects of passive smoking are increasing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599812439004">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0194599812439004"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0194599812439004">16</xref></sup> Our study may meet the deficit in this regard. In our study, we could conclude that passive smoking affects nasal mucociliary clearance. Both active and passive smoking increase nasal mucociliary clearance time when they are compared with healthy controls.</p>
