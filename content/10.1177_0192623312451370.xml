<p>We report the developmental neuropathology for rat pups at postnatal day (PND) 37 and PND 77 and the molecular biomarkers for PND 35, 75, and 350 after perinatal exposure to a reconstituted mixture of persistent organochlorine pollutants (POPs) based on the blood profiles of people living in the Great Lake Basin. The developmental neuropathology included routine histopathology evaluation, quantification of cell proliferation and death in the subventricular zone, linear morphometric measurements, and transcriptional analysis. No histopathological, structural, or stereological changes were observed in animals treated with the POPs or Aroclor 1254, on PND 37 or PND 77. While no transcriptional changes were found in Arcolor-treated animals, significant transcriptional changes were observed on PND 350 in female offspring perinatally exposed to 0.13 mg/kg of the POP mixture. Markers of the cholinergic system including acetylcholinesterase and the muscarinic receptors (subtypes M1–M5) were downregulated 2- to 6-fold. In addition, structural genes including neurofilaments (NFLs) and microtubule-associated protein (MAP-2) were downregulated at least 2-fold or greater. Our results support that in utero and lactational exposure to the chemical mixture of POPs lead to developmental changes in adult rat brains.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The human health risk posed by exposure to persistent organochlorine pollutants (POPs), including polychlorinated dioxins, polychlorinated dibenzofurans, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), present in food and the environment is one of widespread concerns throughout the industrialized world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0192623312451370">Wigle et al. 2008</xref>
<bold>
</bold>; Qing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0192623312451370">Qing et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0192623312451370">Kodavanti 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0192623312451370">Hites et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0192623312451370">Stellman et al. 1998</xref>). These organic compounds are major concerns for human and ecosystem health due to their high degree of bioaccumulation and persistence and long life. Although the use of most POPs is banned in most countries, some organochlorine pesticides are still being used in certain parts of the world, which could lead to the environmental pollution of the neighboring regions or even the entire world. The presence of these toxic substances in the Great Lakes continues to be a significant concern because POPs and other pollutants were routinely disposed of into lakes by heavy industries and agricultural activities until the 1970s. Despite decades of cleanup efforts, the concentration of POPs in some local fish populations remains elevated and may pose a continuing threat to people who heavily rely on fish in their diet. In many parts of the Great Lakes basin, there is little information available on exposure levels, body burdens, and health effects of POPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0192623312451370">Kodavanti 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0192623312451370">Abelsohn et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0192623312451370">Rice 1995</xref>). These considerations are especially relevant to those populations whose traditional diet of fish results in higher toxicant body burden. Epidemiological studies have shown that young children of mothers consuming large amounts of contaminated fish from the Great Lakes exhibit decreased growth rate and neurological disturbances such as deficient intellectual capacity, altered attention, and memory deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0192623312451370">Debes et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0192623312451370">IIwaniuk et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0192623312451370">Jacobson and Jacobson 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0192623312451370">Evangelista de Duffard and Duffard 1996</xref>). Animal studies have also shown that these contaminants affect brain development, neurobehavior, and cognitive functions; however, many of these studies have employed high doses of chemicals that greatly exceeded the levels of human exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0192623312451370">Kodavanti 2005</xref>; Newland and Rassmussen 2000; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0192623312451370">Schantz and Widholm 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0192623312451370">Gilbert and Grant-Webster 1995</xref>). In addition, most of the animal studies conducted used single chemicals, simple mixtures, or commercially available mixtures (e.g., Aroclors), and it is not clear whether these produce toxicological effects that adequately estimate the toxic effects among human populations exposed to complex mixtures of chemicals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0192623312451370">Kodavanti 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0192623312451370">Moser et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0192623312451370">Carpenter et al. 1998</xref>). In addition, the potential additive, synergistic, or antagonistic effects of contaminant mixtures have not been adequately investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0192623312451370">Cory-Slechta 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0192623312451370">Carpenter et al. 2002</xref>). It is unclear whether the prenatal exposure to these mixtures has been linked to reduced fetal and postnatal growth, neurological deficits, delayed development of motor functions, and impaired short-term memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0192623312451370">Kodavanti 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0192623312451370">Seegal 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0192623312451370">Seegal, Pappas, and Park 1998</xref>). The developmental processes, including neurogenesis, migration, synaptogenesis, gliogenesis, and myelination, are extremely susceptible to damage from exposure to environmental insult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0192623312451370">Garman et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0192623312451370">Tilson 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0192623312451370">Rodier, Reynolds, and Roberts 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0192623312451370">Rodier 1976</xref>). These sequences of events are genetically programmed and interference at any stage may alter subsequent development and result in permanent impairment. In adults, they have generally reached a steady state and are not potential targets for neurotoxic agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0192623312451370">Garman et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0192623312451370">Tilson 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0192623312451370">Campbell et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0192623312451370">Rodier, Reynolds, and Roberts 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0192623312451370">Rodier 1976</xref>). Extensive studies using lead, mercury, methylazoxymethanol, alcohol, methylmercury, nicotine, and chlorpyrifos have shown that these chemicals affect multiple pathways during normal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0192623312451370">Erickson and Talts 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0192623312451370">Campbell et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0192623312451370">Chanda and Pope 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Previously reported results from this study have shown that developmental exposure to the mixture resulted in maternal weight loss, produced significant and persistent reductions in offspring weight, caused high mortality rates at the highest mixture dose, and altered early neurobehavioral function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0192623312451370">Bowers et al. 2004</xref>). In addition, systemic toxicity results showed that exposure to the POP mixture up to 13 mg/kg/day perinatally caused elevated serum cholesterol, increased liver microsomal enzyme activities, and immunopathological changes in the thymus and spleen, and lethality. Most of the effects were seen at dose levels much higher than the expected human exposure. The reconstituted POPs mixture produced greater toxicity than a comparable dose of the commercial PCB mixture Aroclor 1254.</p>
<p>In this article, we report the neurotoxicological neuropathology end points including quantification of cell proliferation and death in the subventricular zone, linear morphometric measurements, and transcriptional analysis of brain tissue. The brains were collected for neuropathologic assessment on postnatal day (PND) 37 and PND 77. For molecular analysis, brains were collected on PND 35, PND 75, and PND 350. These time periods correspond to juveniles, young, and mature adults, respectively. Necropsies were performed at the target age (±2 days) and were counterbalanced between treatment groups and gender. Because of the multidisciplinary nature of this study, tissues were collected for a number of analyses or end points, and no animals were available for neuropathologic assessment on PND 350.</p>

<title>Chemical Mixture</title>
<p>The POP mixture used in this study is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0192623312451370">Table 1</xref>. This mixture was derived from measured contaminant blood levels in human fish eaters living in the Canadian Great Lakes basin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0192623312451370">Health Canada 1998</xref>). The specific relative concentration for each chemical was generated from a weighted average of the lipid-adjusted PCBs and organochlorine concentrations found in tissues as reported in these studies. Compounds measured in human tissues that contributed 1.5% or more to the total mass of the measured chemicals were selected for inclusion in the final mixture. The contribution of each chemical to the total mass of all chemicals included was recalculated and this percentage contribution (by mass) defined the chemical mixture. Two PCB congeners (PCB 126 and PCB 169) did not satisfy the 1.5% inclusion criteria; however, because of their known high toxicity, they were added to the mixture at one-half of the detection limits reported in the human studies. Aldrin, <italic>p,p′</italic>-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane (DDE), <italic>p,p′</italic>-dichlorodiphenyttrichloroethane (DDT), dieldrin, heptachlor epoxide (isomer B), hexachlorobenzene (HCB), β-hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH), mirex, <italic>cis</italic>-nonachlor, and <italic>trans</italic>-nonachlor were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Canada Ltd. (Oakville, Ontario). The PCB congeners 74, 94, 99, 126, 156, 169, 170, 187, 194, and 201 (BZ 200/IUPAC 201) were purchased from AccuStandard Inc. (New Haven, CT). The PCB congeners 118, 138, 153, and 180 were purchased from Radian International (Austin, TX). Oxychlordane was generously donated by Julie Fillion of the Pest Management Regulatory Agency (Ottawa, Ontario). All of the chemicals were neat and the purities were at least 99%.</p>

<p>
<italic>Note</italic>. The relative proportions of the components in the Great Lakes Mixture were based upon the measured levels in fish consumers in the Great Lakes/St. Lawrence basin. The proportion of PCB 126 in the mixture is slightly higher than intended, possibly as a result of trace quantities of PCB 126 as an impurity in other more concentrated PCBs, or possibly as a measurement error since PCB 126 was added at very low concentrations. DDE = dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane; DDT = dichlorodiphenyttrichloroethane; PCBs = polychlorinated biphenyls.</p>

<p>The mixture was prepared by weighing the individual chemicals in clean vials and transferring them into small volumes of Mazola corn oil using preservative-free diethyl ether (Sigma-Aldrich Chemicals). Diethyl ether was then removed from corn oil solutions using a Savant Automatic Environmental Speedvac (Model AES 2000, Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, Illinois, USA) and confirmed by weighing the corn oil samples before adding ether and after processing in the Savant. The mixture was prepared at its final concentration (by mass) using clean corn oil. Because the mixture precipitated out of the liquid upon standing, 5% (wt/wt) diethyl ether was reintroduced into the PCBs/OC mixture as a cosolvent to ensure that all chemicals remained in the solution. The nominal concentration of this stock solution was 15 mg/ml and dosing solutions of 1.5, 0.15, and 0.015 mg/ml were prepared by serial dilution of the stock solution with corn oil containing 5% (wt/wt) of diethyl ether. The mixture composition was verified by an independent laboratory (Wellington Laboratories; Guelph, Ontario) using high-resolution gas chromatograpy–mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) analysis.</p>
<p>A separate group of animals was exposed to Aroclor 1254, a known neurotoxic agent, as a positive control treatment and the toxicological impact of this commercial and frequently used PCB mixture was compared against the complex mixture based on human blood contaminant profiles. Aroclor 1254 (AccuStandard Inc., lot number 124191) was prepared at a concentration of 15 mg/ml in corn oil with 5% diethyl ether. The control dosing solution consisted of corn oil containing 5% (wt/wt) of diethyl ether.</p>

<title>Animal Treatment</title>
<p>All animals, treatments, and dosing methods have been reported in detail previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0192623312451370">Bowers et al. 2004</xref>). Briefly, all treatment procedures and housing conditions conformed to the Canadian Council on Animal Care guidelines and had been approved by Health Canada’s Institutional Animal Care Committee. Seventy-eight nulliparous female Sprague-Dawley rats (200–230 g) and 38 male Sprague-Dawley rats (315–350 g) from Charles River, St Constant, Quebec, served as subjects. Females were housed two/cage and males were housed individually in polycarbonate hanging cages (35 cm × 30 cm × 16.5 cm) containing shaved wood bedding and maintained in rooms at 22°C ± 2°C and 50% ± 10% humidity. Animals were placed on a reverse dark–light cycle starting 24 hr after arrival in the facility by advancing the dark cycle by 1 hr/day for 12 days for a final light cycle of lights on: 20:00, lights off: 08:00. Breeding and dosing were conducted in two cohorts of litters of roughly equivalent size and representing all dose groups.</p>
<p>Food and water were available <italic>ad libitum</italic>. Permanent identification chips (Model IMI-1000, Bio Medic Data Systems, Seaford, DE) were implanted under light isoflurane anesthesia in females 7 days after arrival. Breeding females were weighed daily starting 10 days before breeding until they were sacrificed. Following 3 weeks of habituation breeding was conducted by placing the females into the cage of a breeding male. Females were monitored daily (7:00 – 8:00 hr) for the presence of sperm or a vaginal plug. Once detected (denoted as gestation day, GD-0), the female was housed individually in a cage with shaved wood bedding.</p>
<p>Doses of the chemical mixture were based on a pilot study in which pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were dosed orally with 0.15, 1.5, and 15 mg/kg/day from GD 10 to 17. These doses produced no effects on maternal weight gain, reproductive rates, litter size, pup growth, development, or mortality. Mixture doses used in the principal study were 0.015, 0.15, 1.5, and 15 mg/kg/day. Pregnant females were dosed by placing 1 ul/g body weight of the assigned dose on a Teddy Graham® cookie (approximately 2.0 g; Nabisco Ltd., Toronto, Ontario), placing the uncovered cookies in a fume hood overnight to allow the ether to evaporate and providing the dosed cookies to pregnant rats the next day. All dams had been pre-exposed to cookies dosed with 250 ul of clean corn oil for 5 days prior to breeding, and all females readily consumed the dosed cookies. Dams were dosed daily from GD 1 to weaning on PND 23. Parturition was monitored starting on GD 18 at 07:00, 15:00, and 23:00 hr. Day of birth was denoted as PND 0. For each litter, pups were counted on PND 0 but not weighed or handled. Pups were sexed on PND 1 and confirmed on PND 2, 3, and 4. Total litter weight for each litter was obtained on PND 1, 2, 3, and 4. Mortality and morbidity were monitored daily and dead pups removed immediately. Litters were culled to 8 pups on PND 4 by randomly selecting 4 males and 4 females (where possible) from each litter to remain and the excess pups sacrificed. Pups were fostered between litters from the same dose group where fostering was needed, but fostered pups were excluded from all analyses. Pups were individually identified on PND 4 with footpad injections (Ketchum Animal Tattoo Ink, Ketcham Manufacturing, Ottawa Ontario) and weighed individually each day from PND 4 until PND 35. Any offspring remaining after PND 35 were weighed 3 times weekly. Permanent identification chips (Model IMI-1000, Bio Medic Data Systems) were implanted in pups on PND 27–28 under light isoflurane anesthesia.</p>
<p>The schedule and sample size for tissues collection are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0192623312451370">Table 2</xref>. One male and one female per litter were sacrificed by decapitation on PNDs 35, 75, and 350 for collection of tissues for brain neurochemistry and biomarkers analysis. Brains were divided into two hemispheres with one hemisphere assigned for neurochemical analysis (reported separately) and the other hemisphere assigned for brain biomarker analysis. The tissue was immediately frozen on crushed dry ice and stored at −80°C until analysis. The assignment of brain hemisphere for neurochemistry or biomarker analysis was counterbalanced between dose groups and sexes to address potential lateralization effects.</p>

<p>The remaining cohort of male and female offspring was assigned for neuropathology with half the animals per litter (1 male or 1 female per litter) sacrificed by decapitation under isoflurane anesthesia on PND 37 and the remainder sacrificed under isoflurane anesthesia on PND 77. Perfusion fixation was not used since multiple tissues from these animals were also collected for other analyses. For logistical reasons, animals assigned for neuropathology analysis on PNDs 37 and 77 were sacrificed 2 days after the animals were sacrificed for brain biomarker analysis. The skull was opened and the entire head submersed in 10% formalin until later processing in 4% buffered paraformaldehyde and postfixed in 10% formaldehyde. Control and treated animals were handled under the same conditions and tissue sampling was processed at the same time. The brains were removed from the skull and sliced into coronal sections using the appropriate rodent matrix suitable to the age of the rat (RBM Activational Systems Inc., Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA). The tissues were processed for paraffin embedding and sectioned on a microtome at 6 µm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0192623312451370">Truelove et al. 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>For histology examination and morphometric measurements, brain coronal sections were prepared and referenced according to the rat brain atlas of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0192623312451370">Paxinos and Watson (1986</xref>). Several anatomical plates were used to ensure the inclusion of specific structures including subventricular zone (SVZ, plates 16–17); hippocampus/median eminence/arcuate nucleus (plates 30–32); hippocampus, substantia nigra, pineal recess (plates 38–40); facial nucleus/dorsal cochlear nucleus/locus coeruleus/cerebellum (plates 58–60); and area postrema (plates 72–74). The atlas of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0192623312451370">Amaral and Witter (1995)</xref> was used as a reference for the anatomy of the hippocampus.</p>
<p>The histological evaluation was conducted using Mayer’s hematoxylin and eosin Y (H&amp;E; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0192623312451370">Luna 1968</xref>) and specific histological stains to evaluate morphological structures. Myelin and nerve cells were stained with Kluver–Barrera/luxol fast blue (LFB) with cresyl violet as the counterstain; Nissl substance were stained with Einarson gallocyanin; nucleic acids were stained with Feulgen; neuronal processes were stained with silver stain (Chen–Bodian); and microglia cells were stained with phosphotungstic acid hematoxylin ([PTAH] <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0192623312451370">Luna 1968</xref>). The stained slides were evaluated using a light microscope.</p>
<p>Detailed evaluation of the brain morphology included routine histology (H&amp;E), histomorphometric analysis including linear measurements, and quantification of pyknosis and mitosis in the SVZ of the lateral ventricles. For the current study, a detailed evaluation of these regions was performed using histomorphometric analysis, which included (1) linear measurements and (2) cell quantification of pyknosis and mitosis in the SVZ of the lateral ventricles.</p>

<title>Linear Measurements</title>
<p>For each brain, two highly homologous and symmetrically, vertically cut sections at the level of the anterior part of anterior commissure (plate 30–32; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0192623312451370">Paxinos and Watson 1986</xref>) were stained with H&amp;E and subsequently used for quantitative linear measurements. All measurements were done using a Zeiss microscope (Ob-Objective x1, Oc-Occular x10). Calibration was performed using a calibrated ocular scale (1 mm in 100 parts, Zeiss, Zeiss Axioskop 2 with Axiocam Camera, Zeiss Canada Ltd, Toronto, CA) and the object micrometer slide (1 mm in 100 parts, Zeiss). All measurements (except measuring the Ammon’s horn height) were performed as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0192623312451370">Figure 1</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0192623312451370">Rodier and Gramann 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0192623312451370">Duffell, Soames, and Gunby 2000</xref>). The following were measured: a = the vertical line through the middle of dorsoventral diencephalon (thalamus and hypothalamus) from the dorsal III ventricle to the median eminence; b = lateromedial width of the brain hemisphere, perpendicular to (a), just below the anterior hippocampus; c1 = cortical thickness in the hind limb area of the cortex; c2 = cortical thickness in the parietal 1 area of the cortex; d1 = length of the dorsal arm of the dentate gyrus; d2 = length of the ventral arm of the dentate gyrus; e1 = lateromedial length of the Ammon’s horn from the area CA 2 to the dorsal III ventricle; e2 = height of the Ammon’s horn, perpendicular to (e1) from alveus through areas CA1 and CA3 just laterally to the end of the ventral arm of the dentate gyrus. All measurements, except (a), were taken in both the right and left hemispheres.</p>

<title>Counting of the Number of Mitoses and Pyknoses in the SVZ of the Forebrain Lateral Ventricles</title>
<p>For each brain, 2 H&amp;E stained sections at the level of the anterior part of anterior commissure (plates 16–17; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0192623312451370">Paxinos and Watson 1986</xref>) were selected for quantification of pyknotic and mitotic cells in the SVZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0192623312451370">Figure 2</xref>). Cells were counted under the Zeiss microscope (Model number), Ob ×40, Oc ×12.5. Counting started from the upper lateral corner of the lateral ventricle and was performed by shifting the field of vision around the ventricle in clockwise direction eventually encircling it. The thickness of the SVZ cell layer spread along the ventricle never surpassed the chosen diameter of the field of vision of the microscope. Densely packed, small, moderate to dark stained subventricular (subependymal) germinal cells located along the lateral wall of both lateral ventricles, with predominant concentration in the upper lateral corner of each lateral ventricle, are distinguishable from sparsely distributed glial cells in the corpus callosum and caudate putamen.</p>

<p>This SVZ was chosen since it exhibits the largest population of proliferating cells in the brain of rodents, monkeys, and humans. Mitoses (metaphases and anaphases) and pyknoses were counted per a section of the lateral ventricle in left and right hemispheres, respectively. Small, round, extremely densely stained pyknotic nuclei (or their fragments) are easily discernable from subventricular cells. Apoptotic cells were characterized by small, round, densely stained pyknotic nuclei (or their fragments) and were easily distinguishable from subventricular cells.</p>

<title>Transcriptional Analysis by Semiquantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction</title>
<p>The transcriptional analysis was conducted on brain tissue collected from animals on PND 35, PND 75, and PND 350. A systematic analysis of the genes related to specific cell types of the brain and their relation to a range of relevant pathways was performed. These include (1) neurotransmitter systems (cholinergic muscarinic and nicotinic receptors) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors; (2) cell cycle checkpoint genes including p53, p16, p21, cyclin E, and D; (3) early injury markers (EIMs) including c-fos, c-myc, c-jun, and the heat shock protein (Hsp-72), and oxidative stress markers (cyclooxygenase 2 [COX-2], also known as prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase), superoxide dismutase ([SOD] Zn- and Mn-dependent SOD), and catalase. We also used markers of specific cell types and markers for structural genes. These included markers for (1) astrocytes (glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP]) and S100; (2) neurons (neuron-specific marker—enolase—NSE); (3) microglia (F4/80 and leukocyte common antigen [LCA]; (4) oligodendrocytes (myelin basic protein [MBP]), myelin-associated protein (MAG), myelin proteolipid protein (PLP), and 2′,3′-cyclic nucleotide 3′-phosphodiesterase (CNP); and (5) structural genes (microtubule-associated protein [MAP-2], tubulin-1α, and neurofilaments [NFLs]).</p>
<p>Total RNA was extracted from the frozen brain hemispheres using Trizol reagent (Gibco/BRL, Burlington, Ontario), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Total RNA (5 animals per dose/sex/brain hemisphere) were pooled and the pooled samples analyzed. For RT (reverse-transcriptase) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis, 2 mg of total RNA used for first-strand complementary DNA (cDNA) synthesis using the Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Gibco/BRL, Burlington, Ontario) and with the oligo(dT) primer. The cDNAs were then amplified by PCR using gene-specific primers and Taq enzyme (Promega, Madison, WI). The reactions were performed in triplicates. The PCR conditions included denaturation at 94°C for 1 min, annealing at 55 to 60°C (depending on the primer pair used) for 1 min, and extension at 68°C for 1 min. The cDNA fragments were amplified for 25 to 35 cycles followed by an extension at 68°C for 10 min. All the cycles chosen were in the range of linear relationship between the PCR products and the number of cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0192623312451370">Marone et al. 2001</xref>). The cDNA products were separated on a 2% agarose gel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0192623312451370">Gill et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0192623312451370">Marone et al. 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>The 18S (3:7 alt RNA; Applied Biosystems, Life Technologies Inc., Burlington, ON, CA) was used as the internal housekeeping gene for semiquantitative PCR analysis because its expression did not change with different treatments. All PCRs were performed in triplicates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0192623312451370">Marone et al. 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>The amplified PCR-generated products were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel using ethidium bromide staining. To evaluate the changes in relative levels of different genes, the band intensities for the genes obtained from each aliquot of PCR products were normalized against the band intensities of the housekeeping gene 18S (3:7 alt rRNA) in the same experimental run (Alpha Innotech Incorporation, San Leandro, CA). Values were expressed as arbitrary units of relative abundance of the specific target genes. A 2-fold change of the integrated density value was taken as a significant change in gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0192623312451370">Gill et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0192623312451370">Marone et al. 2001</xref>).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Because dosing cookies were prepared based on body weight 24 hr before delivery to the animals so that the required ether could evaporate, the actual doses delivered was calculated based on body weight on the day the dosing cookies were delivered. These calculated doses based on this were 0.013, 0.13, 1.3, and 13.9 mg/kg for the mixture-treated animals, while the dose for Aroclor-treated animals was 14.9 mg/kg. As previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0192623312451370">Bowers et al. 2004</xref>), the highest mixture dose had been tested in a pilot study using a shorter exposure period and revealed no signs on maternal and offspring toxicity. However, in the current study using a longer dosing period (GD1 to PND 21), there was clear maternal and offspring toxicity at the highest dose (13.9 mg/kg) of the mixture, including maternal weight loss and high offspring mortality (66% mortality after PND4). There were few offspring available from this dose group for testing, and the maternal toxicity in this dose group would preclude any clear attribution of effects to direct toxicity on the offspring. Accordingly, all data from the 13.9 mg/kg group was excluded from analysis.</p>
<sec id="section10-0192623312451370">
<title>Histology Staining</title>
<p>For other dose groups of POPs and Aroclor 1254, general histological screening (H&amp;E) and specific stains did not reveal any observable effects in any of the brain regions examined. Linear measurements were made for both the left and the right hemispheres. Since there are no significant differences between the hemispheres, brain hemisphere was not used as a factor in further analysis. For the PND 37 pups, the mixture at 1.3 mg/kg/day and the Aroclor 1254 groups showed a significant decrease (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) in the length of the dorsal and the ventral arms of the dentate gyrus compared to the control animals. In addition, Aroclor 1254 significantly decreased (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) the lateromedial width of the brain hemisphere relative to the control animals. There were no changes in the lateromedial length or height of Ammon’s horn (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0192623312451370">Table 3</xref>). The mixture doses of 0.13 and 0.013 mg/kg had no impact on any measure. On PND 77, the Aroclor 1254-treated animals showed a significant decrease (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) in the length of the dorsal and the ventral arms of the dentate gyrus compared to control animals (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0192623312451370">Table 3</xref>). Because we have previously reported that the body weights of these animals were affected by treatments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0192623312451370">Bowers et al. 2004</xref>) as were organ weights, including brain weights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0192623312451370">Chu et al. 2005</xref>), we also normalized the morphometric measures using the lateromedial width of the brain hemisphere (measure b in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0192623312451370">Figure 1</xref>) as a reference point and expressed all other measures relative to this measure. If the treatment-related effects on morphometric measures are not attributable to indirect effects on brain size, then treatment-related effects should be evident after this normalization. Measurements of a,, c1, c2, d1, d2, e1, and e2 were divided by measurement b, and these new values were analyzed by ANOVA. Analysis on these normalized morphometric measures indicated that there no significant changes in any dose group as compared to the control groups.</p>

<italic>Note</italic>. There were no lateral difference between the left and right hemispheres. Transcriptional analysis was done for the cell cycle checkpoints (p53, p16, p21, and cyclin E and D); early injury markers (c-fos, c-myc, c-jun; heat shock protein [HSP-72]); oxidative stress markers (cyclooxygenase [COX-2], also known as prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase, superoxide dismutase [Zn- and Mn dependent-SOD] and catalase); structural genes (microtubule-associated protein [MAP-2], tubulin-1, and neurofilaments [NFL]). Markers for specific cell types included (1) astrocytes: (glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP] and S100); (2) neurons: (neuron specific marker—enolase—NSE) (3) microglia: (F4/80 and leukocyte common antigen [LCA]); (4) oligodendrocytes: (myelin basic protein [MBP], myelin-associated protein [MAG], and myelin proteolipid protein [PLP]) and 2′,3′-cyclic nucleotide 3′-phosphodiesterase (CNP). Markers for the cholinergic system included M1 (muscarinic acetylcholine receptor subunit 1), M4 (muscarinic acetylcholine receptor subunit 4), M5 (muscarinic acetylcholine receptor subunit 5), and Ache (acetylcholine esterase); PCR = polymerase chain reaction; POPs = persistent organochlorine pollutants.</p>

<p>Markers for the GABA and cholinergic neurotransmitters systems were also examined. For the 14 subunits of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, there were no changes in gene expression at any age, gender, or dose. However, the cholinergic markers of muscarinic receptor subtypes (M1, M4, and M5) were all downregulated approximately 4-fold and acetycholin esterase (Ache) was downregulated 6-fold.</p>
<p>The oxidation marker COX-2 (PTGS) showed a 2-fold decrease, while SOD (Zn and Mn dependent) and catalase were not affected (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0192623312451370">Table 4</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion and Conclusions</title>
<p>The current study examined the neurodevelopmental impact of perinatal exposure to a mixture of PCBs and organochlorine pesticides based on human blood levels on brain morphology and transcriptional changes in young, juvenile, and mature animals. Potential damage to the central nervous system (CNS) is difficult to assess because of wide variations in its normal function as well as its plasticity, residual capacity, and compensatory mechanisms. Furthermore, different brain regions have their own specific time window for the proliferation, migration, differentiation, and scheduled apoptosis of cells. During the specific time window, some regions may be more adversely affected than others, often resulting in changes in cell numbers or cell structures. Hence neuropathologic assessment of chemically induced developmental alterations in the nervous system for regulatory purposes is a multifactorial, complex process. In this study, we performed qualitative and quantitative morphologic analysis of numerous brain regions including general histological evaluation (H&amp;Es), a battery of histological special stains, linear and stereologic measurements to evaluate morphological structures. In our study, H&amp;Es and specific stains for structural damage did not reveal any injury either with the POPs or Aroclor groups. Although absolute morphometric measurements were affected by treatments, analysis of normalized results to adjust for treatment effects on body weight indicated that changes in morphometric measures observed on PND 37 could be attributed to treatment-induced changes in brain weights that are associated with altered body weights. Based on these results, there was no indication that any treatment directly altered brain morphometry.</p>
<p>It has been shown that linear measurements of adult mice exposed in the fetal period to the effect of antimitotic agents showed reduction in specific brain structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0192623312451370">Rodier et al. 1979</xref>). These tests were performed in the hippocampus and SVZ since they are the sites of neurogenesis where developmental insults of POPs may alter the growth of specific regions of the brain in the absence of overt lesions It is known that the progenitor cells within the SVZs are vulnerable to chemical, radiation, and ischemia-induced damage. With moderate insults, the SVZ can recover, but it cannot recover after more severe injury. Thus, the vulnerability or insult to these cells has important ramifications when considering therapeutic interventions for the treatment of brain tumors and for the prospect of recovery after ischemia. The cells of the perinatal and adult SVZ not only have the capacity to replenish their own numbers, but they also have the capacity to replace neurons and glia after ischemic and traumatic brain injuries. However, certain insults such as perinatal hypoxia/ischemia can deplete the progenitor cells in the SVZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0192623312451370">Romanko et al. 2007</xref>), leading to permanent damage.</p>
<p>There was a decrease in the number of mitotic and pyknotic cells in the SVZ on PND 77 as compared to PND 37. This decrease was expected between young and more mature animals. There was no indication that any mixture dose affected the mitotic index on PND 37 or 77 compared to control animals. This absence of difference between the experimental and control group could partly be due to the time between exposure and the age when the measurements were performed, which would suggest a transient effect. Interestingly, Aroclor-treated animals did show an increase in the number of pyknotic cells on PND 37, suggesting that the lack of effects of the mixture are not likely to be related to transient effects of exposure. These results also add to the evidence that the effects of Aroclor may be substantially different than the effects of mixtures that more completely mimic human exposure profiles on PND 37.</p>
<p>Age-related molecular and cellular alterations in the CNS are known to show selectivity for certain cell types and brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0192623312451370">Rutten et al. 2007</xref>). We chose general markers for transcriptional analysis, since the effects of the POPs were not known and the proper neurological function requires a coordinated and functional relationship between all the different cell types. For normal development, the acetylcholine receptors (muscarinic) are important for learning and cognition. Further, the cholinergic neurons make contact with noncholinergic structures, suggesting that they are needed for modulating the activity, acting on other types of neurons, and modulating the release of norepinephrine, dopamine, GABA, serotonin, and acetylcholine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0192623312451370">Stein et al. 2002</xref>). To assess this, we conducted transcriptional analysis for a variety of cell types at each time period. Although there were no transcriptional changes on PND 35 and PND 75, significant transcriptional changes were observed in females exposed to 0.013 mg/kg of the mixture on PND 350. While Aroclor 1254 had no effects at any age, gender-specific transcriptional changes in exposure to POPs have also been reported by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0192623312451370">Powers et al. 2005</xref>; Adeeko et al. 2004); and these could be explained by differences in gender-specific metabolism of POPs. Most of the biomarkers including the EIMs, cell-specific markers, structural genes, oxidation markers, and markers of the cholinergic system were affected only at the 0.13 mg/kg/day group.</p>
<p>In addition to being gender specific, there was also a nonlinear dose-response for the brain biomarkers. Although there was little effect at doses of 0.013 and 1.3 mg/kg of the mixture, 0.13 mg/kg produced a dramatic effect. Though the reason for this U-shaped dose-response is not obviously clear, it is likely that multiple mechanisms of action, the presence of homeostatic mechanisms, and/or activation of compensatory or protective mechanisms among the different cell types are responsible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0192623312451370">Davis and Svendsgaard 1989</xref>) as this has been observed in other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0192623312451370">Marotta et al. 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0192623312451370">2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The transcriptional changes suggest that exposure to the mixtures during the rapid development of the neonatal rat brain (the brain growth spurt [BGS]) leads to irreversible changes in the function of the adult brain. Since there was no systemic or other effects on the dams at the 0.13 mg/kg dose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0192623312451370">Chu et al. 2005</xref>), the transcriptional changes observed can be attributed to the perinatal exposure to the mixture. On PND 35 and PND 75, the insults that occurred during the BSG of the lactational period may be masked due to the reserve capacity and plasticity of the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0192623312451370">Forcelli, Gale, and Kondratyev 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0192623312451370">Slikker and Boyer 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0192623312451370">Erickson and Talts 2000</xref>) only to be depleted over time by a number of factors, such as aging. Others have also shown that early exposures to environmental chemicals are reliably associated with late neurotoxicities in children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0192623312451370">Bondy and Campbell 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0192623312451370">Erickson and Talts 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0192623312451370">Weiss 2000</xref>). A long latent or silent period is assumed to precede the expression of clinical signs, and this observation has been documented in both humans and laboratory animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0192623312451370">Bondy and Campbell 2005</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0192623312451370">Weiss 2000</xref>). The mechanisms of compensation may also make their own contribution to the process by generating neurotoxic by-products. In addition, concomitant aging of neuroendocrine and immune system function may amplify these CNS consequences. Many brain areas show a decline in nerve cell populations associated with aging, and additional exposure to environmental or food contaminants will exacerbate these effects. At that point, the aftermath of early damage may emerge in the form of impaired function detectable by transcriptional changes or even as overt neurodegenerative disease.</p>
<p>In summary, <italic>in utero </italic>and lactational exposure to the chemical mixture of POPs suggest developmental changes in female adult rats as observed by transcriptional changes.</p>
