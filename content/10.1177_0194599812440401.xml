<p><italic>Objective.</italic> Despite preservation of the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN), transient vocal cord paralysis (VCP) occurs after 1.2% to 10.9% of thyroidectomies. The objective of this study was to study risk factors for transient VCP after thyroidectomy.</p>
<p><italic>Study Design.</italic> Prospective cohort study.</p>
<p><italic>Setting.</italic> Academic teaching hospital.</p>
<p><italic>Subjects and Methods.</italic> Two hundred fifteen consecutive thyroid surgeries performed by a single surgeon. All patients underwent preoperative and postoperative laryngoscopy. Patients with preexisting VCP or without postoperative laryngoscopy were excluded. Clinical and operative data were recorded prospectively at the time of thyroid surgery.

<p><italic>Results.</italic> Six patients were excluded (2 with preexisting VCP and 4 without postoperative laryngoscopy). There was 1 intentional sacrifice of an RLN and 1 unintentional RLN transection. Of the remaining 322 RLNs at risk, 15 (4.7%) had postoperative VCP. Operative findings of cancer invading the RLN requiring sharp dissection to separate the nerve (<italic>P</italic> = .006) and operative findings of RLN extensively draped along the thyroid or intimately associated with the thyroid parenchyma at Berry’s ligament (<italic>P</italic> = .03) were significantly associated with VCP. Revision surgery (<italic>P</italic> = .06) trended toward significance. Malignancy, central compartment neck dissection, extralaryngeal RLN branching, hyperthyroidism, and retrosternal extension were not significant. Of cases with follow-up laryngoscopic documentation of vocal function, 85% (11/13) showed full resolution of VCP, with 1 further case showing partial recovery.</p>

<body>
<p>Injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN), leading to permanent vocal cord paralysis (VCP), is one of the major risks associated with thyroid surgery. The consequences of VCP are variable: whereas some patients may compensate well and have minimal symptoms, others may be very debilitated by breathy dysphonia, aspiration of liquids, stridor on exertion, or a combination of these symptoms. Bilateral VCP is a devastating complication, with most cases requiring a tracheostomy in the immediate postoperative period.</p>
<p>The reported incidence of permanent VCP after thyroidectomy varies between 0.3% and 5.8%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599812440401">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812440401"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812440401"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812440401"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599812440401"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599812440401"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599812440401"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599812440401"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599812440401"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599812440401">11</xref></sup> With meticulous surgical technique and careful identification of the RLN, most large series report incidences of permanent VCP of &lt;2%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599812440401">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812440401"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812440401"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812440401"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599812440401">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599812440401">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599812440401"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599812440401"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599812440401"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599812440401">11</xref></sup> However, despite careful identification and preservation of the RLN, postoperative VCP may occasionally still occur. This is usually attributed to neuropraxic injury to the RLN, similar to facial nerve neuropraxia after parotid surgery. Possible mechanisms of neuropraxic injury to the RLN during thyroidectomy include stretching, direct trauma by surgical instruments during dissection, thermal injury due to electrocautery, or perineural devascularization. As long as the integrity of the nerve has been grossly preserved and there has not been any unrecognized permanent injury to the nerve, VCP in such cases is usually transient, with most cases resolving fully within a period of months.</p>

<sec id="section1-0194599812440401" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>This was a prospective observational study of 215 consecutive thyroid surgeries performed by the senior author between March 2009 and November 2011. Surgeries performed included total thyroidectomy, unilateral (total) lobectomy, completion thyroidectomy (removal of contralateral lobe in patient who had previously undergone thyroid lobectomy alone), and revision thyroidectomy (removal of remnant/recurrent thyroid tissue in patient who had previously undergone thyroid surgery on the ipsilateral side). All operations were performed by the senior author (P.S.). In all cases, total removal of all thyroid tissue on one or both sides was performed. Subtotal or near-total thyroidectomy was not performed. In most cases, a midline approach to the thyroid gland was used, with capsular dissection and identification of the RLN only in the vicinity of Berry’s ligament, close to its entry point into the larynx. Intraoperative nerve monitoring was not employed.</p>
<p>All patients undergoing thyroid surgery underwent flexible laryngoscopy preoperatively and within 2 weeks postoperatively to document vocal cord function. All laryngoscopies were performed by the senior author. VCP was considered to be present when there was absent or markedly reduced movement of the affected vocal cord. Because of subjective difficulties in discerning subtle degrees of vocal movement, no attempt was made to differentiate between complete vocal paralysis and paresis. Patients with postoperative VCP were given appointments for a repeat laryngoscopy, generally within 2 to 3 months. Patients who still showed vocal cord dysfunction were followed up with repeat laryngoscopy on a 2- to 4-month basis until normal vocal cord mobility returned. Any case of VCP persisting beyond 1 year was considered permanent.</p>
<p>Cases were classified as either bilateral or unilateral surgeries. Bilateral surgeries included total thyroidectomies or revision thyroidectomies in which both sides of the neck were reexplored. Unilateral surgeries included thyroid lobectomies, completion thyroidectomies, or revision thyroidectomy in which only 1 side of the neck was explored. Exclusion criteria were cases with preexisting vocal cord palsy, cases with deliberate intraoperative sacrifice of the RLN, and cases in which preoperative or postoperative laryngoscopy had not been performed. Cases in which inadvertent injury to the RLN was recognized intraoperatively were also excluded from the analysis of risk factors for transient VCP.</p>
<p>The following variables were recorded prospectively by the senior author at the time of surgery: (1) presence of invasive thyroid cancer with gross invasion of the RLN, but with preservation of the RLN after sharp dissection to separate the nerve from the cancer; (2) concomitant (ipsilateral) central compartment neck dissection (CCND) with skeletonization of the ipsilateral RLN into the mediastinum; (3) retrosternal extension of the thyroid gland on the side ipsilateral to the RLN; (4) revision surgery (ie, thyroid surgery previously performed on the ipsilateral side); (5) hyperthyroidism, either uncontrolled or requiring antithyroid medications to control (excluding cases of subclinical hyperthyroidism in patients with T4 levels within the reference range who did not require antithyroid medications); (6) intraoperative finding of extralaryngeal branching of the RLN; (7) intraoperative finding of the RLN extensively draped along surface of thyroid, or intimately associated with the thyroid parenchyma at Berry’s ligament, as subjectively assessed by the senior author at the time of surgery; (8) “severe” adhesions, or severe “stickiness” or friability of surgical planes, as subjectively assessed by the senior author at the time of surgery (as opposed to “moderately severe” adhesions or good planes); and (9) cancer diagnosis at final histology (excluding microcarcinomas and completion thyroidectomies in which there was no cancer in the completion thyroidectomy specimen). These variables were subsequently analyzed for any effect on incidence of recurrent laryngeal nerve neuropraxia.</p>
<p>Statistical analysis was performed using Winstat for Excel. The risk of neuropraxia in the entire group and according to the risk factors analyzed was calculated with respect to nerves at risk. The relative risk with 95% confidence intervals was calculated for each of the risk factors studied. A Fisher’s exact test was used to confirm significant differences in incidence of neuropraxia between groups.</p>
<p>Permission to conduct the study was granted by the local clinical research ethics committee (Clinical Research Ethics Committee of Cork Teaching Hospitals).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>During the period of the study, 215 patients underwent thyroid surgery (119 bilateral, 96 unilateral). Six of these were excluded. Two patients undergoing unilateral thyroid lobectomy had preoperative ipsilateral vocal cord palsy. Four other patients undergoing total thyroidectomy did not undergo postoperative laryngoscopy: 3 of these refused the procedure, whereas laryngoscopy was not attempted in 1 further patient with Down’s syndrome. All 4 of these patients had normal voices postoperatively.</p>
<p>Of the remaining 209 cases, there were 115 bilateral surgeries and 94 unilateral surgeries, giving a total of 324 nerves at risk. Forty-five operations were performed on patients with thyroid malignancy (80 nerves at risk). Twenty-one patients underwent unilateral or bilateral CCND (38 nerves at risk). Twenty-four patients had hyperthyroidism (47 nerves at risk). Seven patients underwent revision surgery on a previously operated lobe (9 nerves at risk). Extralaryngeal branching of the RLN was noted in 42 cases (13.0%). There was a single case of a nonrecurrent right inferior laryngeal nerve (0.3%).</p>
<p>There was 1 case of deliberate sacrifice of the RLN (0.3%) and 1 case of inadvertent transection of the RLN, which was recognized intraoperatively (0.3%). These 2 cases were excluded from the analysis of risk factors for transient VCP. Thus, 322 nerves at risk were included in the analysis of risk factors for RLN neuropraxia. In all of these cases, the integrity of the RLN was confirmed intraoperatively, and postoperative laryngoscopy had been performed to document postoperative vocal function.</p>
<p>Of these 322 nerves at risk, postoperative laryngoscopy demonstrated reduced or absent vocal cord movement in 15 (4.7%). Ten of these patients had unilateral VCP after bilateral surgery, with 5 having unilateral VCP after unilateral surgery. There were no cases of bilateral VCP. Two patients had immediate onset of significant hoarseness, accompanied by transient swallowing symptoms. Seven had mild hoarseness. The remaining 6 had very subtle vocal changes, which were usually apparent only after talking for a while.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0194599812440401"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref> shows the association between the variables studied and risk of postoperative VCP. The following variables were found to be significantly associated with VCP postthyroidectomy: operative findings of cancer invading the RLN requiring sharp dissection to separate the nerve (relative risk 16.36, <italic>P</italic> = .006) and operative finding of RLN draped extensively along the surface of the thyroid or intimately associated with the thyroid parenchyma at Berry’s ligament (relative risk 3.97, <italic>P</italic> = .03). Revision surgery (relative risk 5.35) was also associated with a higher incidence of postoperative VCP, but this was just outside the 5% level of significance (<italic>P</italic> = .06) on Fisher’s exact test. Concomitant central compartment neck dissection on the ipsilateral side, hyperthyroidism, extralaryngeal branching of the RLN, operative findings of severe adhesions or severely “sticky” or friable planes, and cancer diagnosis were not associated with postoperative VCP. There was no difference in weight of resected specimens between cases with and without VCP by Student’s <italic>t</italic> test. The single case of nonrecurrent RLN was not associated with postoperative VCP.</p>

<p>Of the 15 patients with VCP, 11 had follow-up laryngoscopic examination documenting full restitution of vocal cord mobility, with resolution of all symptoms. The median time to restitution of vocal mobility was 3 months (range, 2-4.5 months). One further patient who had an invasive thyroid cancer, which required sharp dissection to separate the nerve from the cancer, and who also underwent postoperative external beam radiotherapy, regained unequivocal partial movement of the affected vocal cord with return of normal voice 6 months after his surgery. Two patients who had vocal neuropraxia documented at their first postoperative visit subsequently refused further postoperative laryngoscopy. Both of these patients were asymptomatic with normal voices at the time of last follow-up. Finally, 1 patient who underwent total thyroidectomy for Grave’s disease still had persistent vocal palsy 1 year after surgery. Surgery in this case had been uneventful with both RLNs identified and no concerns regarding the integrity of either nerve. This patient also had preexisting hoarseness of voice related to Reinke’s edema and vocal cord polyps and continues to have mild hoarseness. She continues to undergo follow-up in our department.</p>
<p>Thus, 11 of 13 (85%) patients with postoperative VCP who underwent follow-up laryngoscopic examination were found to have regained fully normal vocal mobility, with 1 further patient regaining partial mobility. The incidence of permanent (&lt;1 year) VCP in RLNs in which the integrity of the nerve is confirmed intraoperatively is 0.3% (1/322). The overall incidence of permanent VCP in our series, including cases of deliberate sacrifice of the RLN and inadvertent transection of the RLN, is 0.9%.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the present study, we found that 4.7% of RLNs that were functioning normally preoperatively and that were confirmed to have been preserved intact intraoperatively did not function normally in the immediate postoperative period, leading to VCP. The vast majority of these regained fully normal function within 6 months. These results are consistent with those of other authors (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0194599812440401"><bold>Table 2</bold></xref>).</p>

<p>The cause of temporary VCP postthyroid surgery is considered to be due to neuropraxic injury to the RLN. This may be due to stretching, direct trauma during difficult dissection, thermal injury due to use of electrocautery, devascularization, or compressive injury due to postoperative hematoma.</p>
<p>In the present study, we found the following factors to be significantly associated with postoperative VCP: operative finding of cancer invading the RLN, operative findings of RLN draped extensively along the surface of the thyroid or intimately associated with thyroid parenchyma at Berry’s ligament, and revision surgery (previous surgery performed on ipsilateral side), although the significance for revision surgery was just outside the 5% level of significance by Fisher’s exact test. It should also be noted that the number of events of cancer invading the RLN was low (2/3).</p>
<p>The increased incidence of postoperative VCP in cases of thyroid cancer invading the RLN is likely explained by increased stretching and/or direct trauma to the RLN when trying to separate the RLN from the tumor. The RLN may also be more prone to stretching and/or direct trauma during revision surgery because of its being adherent to scar tissue. Reoperation was also reported by Chan et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599812440401">8</xref></sup> to be a risk factor for VCP after thyroidectomy.</p>
<p>A similar mechanism of neuropraxic injury is likely to be the cause of VCP in cases in which the RLN was found intraoperatively to be extensively draped along the surface of the thyroid or intimately associated with the thyroid parenchyma at Berry’s ligament. Of note, it is the senior author’s practice to always perform total removal of each thyroid lobe, including the entire tubercle of Zuckerkandl and all thyroid tissue associated with Berry’s ligament. This may lead to difficult dissection in cases in which the RLN is intimately associated with thyroid parenchyma at Berry’s ligament, thus increasing the risk of RLN neuropraxia secondary to stretching and/or direct trauma. In contrast, severe adhesions, or severely “sticky” or friable planes, were not associated with an increased risk of VCP, suggesting that meticulous surgical technique in these cases should avoid any undue trauma to the RLN.</p>
<p>The intraoperative data in the present study were recorded prospectively by the same surgeon at the time of surgery and before the patient’s postoperative voice and/or vocal cord mobility were assessed. Thus, it is likely that, in the senior author’s hands at least, those findings found to be associated with postoperative VCP (invasive cancer and relationship of RLN to thyroid lobe/Berry’s ligament) represent true risk factors for RLN neuropraxia postthyroidectomy. However, the assessment of these variables was nonetheless subjective and as such may be prone to interobserver variability between different surgeons. Another potential weakness was the lack of an independent observer for assessment of vocal mobility. However, every effort was made to ensure this assessment was as objective as possible.</p>
<p>The presence of extralaryngeal branching of the RLN has been reported by 2 previous authors to be associated with increased risk of transient VCP after thyroidectomy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599812440401">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599812440401">9</xref></sup> In contrast, we did not find any such association. We do believe that some cases of permanent VCP postthyroidectomy, in which the surgeon documented that the RLN had been preserved intraoperatively, may be due to unrecognized extralaryngeal RLN branching and unrecognized injury to the anterior-most branch, which provides the major motor supply to the intrinsic laryngeal muscles.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599812440401">12</xref></sup> However, it is worth noting that the overall incidence of extralaryngeal branching of the RLN in our series was 13.0%, which is less than that reported in other studies (18.5%-37.4%).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599812440401">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599812440401">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599812440401">12</xref></sup> It is the senior author’s practice to identify the RLN only at Berry’s ligament, close to where it enters the larynx, rather than in the region of the inferior thyroid artery, as reported by others. Thus, it is possible that some cases of extralaryngeal branching in our series were not recognized, as only the anterior-most branch was identified. Nevertheless, we believe that with meticulous surgical technique, the finding of extralaryngeal branching of the RLN should not present an increased risk of postoperative VCP.</p>
<p>There is currently much debate in the literature regarding the role of elective CCND in papillary thyroid carcinoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599812440401">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599812440401"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0194599812440401">15</xref></sup> and whether CCND with total thyroidectomy is associated with an increased risk of complications compared with total thyroidectomy alone. A trend toward increased incidence of transient VCP in patients undergoing CCND was reported by Palestini.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0194599812440401">16</xref></sup> In contrast, other authors reported that CCND was not associated with any increased risk of transient VCP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0194599812440401">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0194599812440401">18</xref></sup> In the present study, we did not find any increased incidence of transient VCP in patients who had undergone CCND. Even though CCND involves extensive dissection of the RLN, our experience is that it is generally possible to do this with minimal mobilization of the RLN and thus with minimal risk of stretching or direct trauma.</p>
<p>The presence of thyroid malignancy,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812440401">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599812440401">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599812440401">8</xref></sup> retrosternal goiter,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812440401">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0194599812440401">19</xref></sup> and hyperthyroidism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812440401">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599812440401">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599812440401">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0194599812440401">19</xref></sup> has been associated with increased risk of transient and permanent VCP after thyroidectomy. We did not find an association between these variables and postoperative VCP. There was a significantly increased risk of VCP in patients with cancer that was grossly invading the RLN. However, no such association was found among all cases with a diagnosis of thyroid malignancy. In our experience, the vast majority of cases of thyroid cancer are not associated with extrathyroid soft-tissue invasion and thus do not present undue difficulty for RLN dissection.</p>
<p>Of note, we did not use intraoperative nerve monitoring in our series. The main reason for this is the additional cost involved. However, the RLN was clearly identified intraoperatively in all 15 cases of RLN neuropraxia, and so we are not convinced that intraoperative nerve monitoring would have made any major difference in these cases.</p>
<p>It is notable that many patients with transient VCP after thyroidectomy experience very mild symptoms. In fact, in 6 of the 15 patients in the present study with VCP, symptoms were extremely subtle, and the finding of VCP on postoperative laryngoscopy was almost unexpected. These results are consistent with those of Steurer, who reported that 11 cases of postoperative VCP had no detectable hoarseness,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812440401">4</xref></sup> and Lo, who reported one-third of patients with VCP to have minimal hoarseness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599812440401">7</xref></sup> These findings would suggest that the incidence of VCP is likely to be underestimated in series in which postoperative laryngoscopy is not routinely performed on all postthyroidectomy patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0194599812440401">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>The overwhelming majority of patients with RLN neuropraxia experience full recovery of RLN function and resolution of symptoms within a period of months. Restitution of normal vocal mobility has been reported to take as long as 2 years,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812440401">4</xref></sup> although most authors would designate VCP persisting beyond 1 year as permanent.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599812440401">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599812440401">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599812440401">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599812440401">11</xref></sup> In the present study, 11 of 13 patients (85%) who underwent follow-up laryngoscopy regained normal vocal mobility. One further patient had regained partial vocal mobility by 6 months; however, this patient also underwent postoperative external beam radiotherapy, a factor that is known to delay recovery of facial nerve function after parotid surgery. All had complete resolution of symptoms.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In the present study, we found that 4.7% of RLNs that were confirmed to be preserved intact intraoperatively demonstrated postoperative dysfunction in the form of transient VCP. This is more likely to occur in cases in which there is cancer invading the RLN, requiring sharp dissection to separate it; cases in which the RLN is extensively draped along the surface of the thyroid or intimately associated with thyroid parenchyma at Berry’s ligament; and cases of revision surgery. In the vast majority of cases, spontaneous resolution of symptoms with restitution of vocal movement can be expected to occur within a period of months.</p>
