<p>This is a comprehensive and carefully researched account of tourism policymaking in China since 1949, with an emphasis on developments since the 1980s. While the rise of Chinese tourism has attracted steadily increasing attention among tourism scholars – not to mention industry professionals – throughout the world, this is the first study to offer a sustained examination of tourism policymaking within China’s complex and opaque system of government. Arguing that ‘the political dimensions of tourism are under-explored and not well understood’ (p. 5), David Airey and King Chong situate tourism policymaking within the context of China’s national policy developments and changes since 1949. Based on interviews with political and professional participants in the tourism policy process, along with extensive analysis of government documents, Airey and Chong find that, in general terms, and as most tourism scholars would readily agree, the state’s role is indispensable to successful tourism development. In China specifically, the state has played a successful role in ‘nurturing the market’ and in using tourism to boost economic development throughout the country. In addition, tourism has enabled the state to promote an agenda of improving people’s quality of life as a major agent driving new forms of leisure consumption.</p>
<p>After a brief overview of travel history in China and of China’s political and administrative system, the book proceeds with an extensive conceptual framework where the authors lay out their approach to the tourism policy process. This is followed by several chapters describing the different phases of tourism policy in China since 1949. The authors summarize these developments into five periods: 1949–1978, tourism as a political and diplomatic vehicle; 1978–1985, tourism as an economic activity; 1986–1991, tourism as an economic industry; 1992–1997, tourism as an important industry; and 1997 to the present, tourism as a multifunctional strategic industry. They then turn to a very brief discussion of tourism policy in four specific regions: Hong Kong, Macao, Tibet, and Taiwan. The final two chapters explore the broader theoretical implications of their study for both tourism policy studies as well as for Chinese tourism’s prospects.</p>
<p>Airey and Chong argue that tourism policy is shaped by multiple and interrelated factors. They call their approach an ‘ideational-based interrelationships framework of the factors affecting policy-making’. They go into great conceptual detail to sort out the policy factors affecting tourism policymaking, including their origins, their scales, and how they are related to each other. These interrelationships occur within a ‘policy paradigm’, that is, the generally accepted ideas for improving society as they are applied to a particular sector, such as tourism. They trace the emergence of a new tourism policy paradigm in China, in which tourism becomes a central component in market-driven economic development and consumption-oriented modernization schemes. This new paradigm marks a shift away from a political-based orthodoxy (the Mao era) to one based on economic development (the post-Mao reforms). Airey and Chong argue that the China case highlights the importance of what they call the ‘ideational dimension’ in tourism policymaking. They find tourism policy in China to be fragmented, and that since Chinese policymaking is itself a highly fragmented process, tourism policy ‘has been conducted by a variety of policymakers, with a diversity of values and interests’ (p. 136). This is, of course, consistent with most understandings of Chinese policymaking, but it left me wondering whether tourism policy can teach us anything about the Chinese policymaking processes that scholars have otherwise missed. This, however, does not appear to be Airey and Chong’s objective.</p>
<p>As a China specialist who explores the practices and politics of tourism development at very local scales, I found this book very illuminating of the broader scale processes of tourism policymaking. But detailed though their conceptual framework is, their policymaking approach does not engage, at a conceptual level at least, with the field of Chinese policymaking in any sustained way. Indeed, throughout the extensive conceptual chapter, China itself is barely ever mentioned, much less discussed in terms of policymaking. Airey and Chong’s aim is instead set on putting tourism in conversation with the broader policymaking scholarship. In this, China serves more as a case study in a project about tourism policymaking, rather than the subject of a study on policymaking in China as viewed through the lens of tourism. As such, the book may appeal more to tourism policy scholars than China area specialists.</p>
