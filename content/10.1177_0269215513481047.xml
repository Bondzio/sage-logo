<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Multiple sclerosis is the most common autoimmune inflammatory disease in young adults and is characterized by recurrent neurological deficits.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269215513481047">1</xref></sup> Clinical features of multiple sclerosis are fatigue, motor weakness, spasticity, poor mobility and balance,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269215513481047">2</xref></sup> gait disturbances and an increased risk of falling. Also, individuals with multiple sclerosis have moderate reduction in their physical activity,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269215513481047">3</xref></sup> which is often attributed to underlying impairments, such as fatigue, muscle weakness and spasticity. Exercise training is a therapeutic strategy to minimize the loss of functional capacity in the multiple sclerosis population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269215513481047">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>The benefits of exercise in patients with multiple sclerosis have been investigated in relation to aerobic training,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269215513481047">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269215513481047">6</xref></sup> resistance exercise,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269215513481047">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269215513481047"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269215513481047">9</xref></sup> and core stability training.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269215513481047">10</xref></sup> Some studies have investigated combined exercise, which includes aerobic and/or resistance components.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215513481047">11</xref></sup> In the study, comparing endurance- and resistance-exercise training, it has been demonstrated that both endurance- and resistance-exercise training were well tolerated and appear to provide similar effects for people with multiple sclerosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269215513481047">12</xref></sup> A trial comparing low, high and a combination of low and high-intensity exercise delivered on a cycle ergometer has shown no differences between groups, greater benefit may be associated with higher-intensity exercise, but this may be less well tolerated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269215513481047">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Since multiple sclerosis has caused many clinical problems, studies examining adaptations to exercise training in individuals with multiple sclerosis have focused on different outcome measures. A Cochrane systematic review of exercise therapy for people with multiple sclerosis confirms there is good evidence that exercise can be beneficial for mobility, isometric muscle strength, physical fitness and mood.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269215513481047">4</xref></sup> In addition, there is evidence indicating exercise therapy has the potential to induce a positive effect on multiple sclerosis fatigue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269215513481047">14</xref></sup> A meta-analysis supports that exercise training is associated with a small improvement in quality of life among individuals with multiple sclerosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215513481047">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although balance, coordination and functional exercises have an important contribution to function in individuals with multiple sclerosis, a limited number of studies have contained specific exercises for balance and coordination as well as strengthening and stretching exercises.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269215513481047">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269215513481047">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269215513481047">16</xref></sup> Therefore, we aimed to investigate the efficacy of our exercise programme, including all dimensions in accordance with our outcome measures.</p>
<p>There is limited research about efficacy of group exercise training in the literature. To our knowledge, only two trials investigated the effects of group exercise in patients with multiple sclerosis. In one of them, Learmonth et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269215513481047">16</xref></sup> suggested that community-based group exercise classes are a feasible option for people moderately affected with multiple sclerosis, and offer benefits such as improved physical activity levels, balance and leg strength. In the other study, McCullagh et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269215513481047">17</xref></sup> reported that three months of exercise classes can improve exercise capacity, quality of life and fatigue in patients with multiple sclerosis. Furthermore, they indicated that improvements in fatigue and quality of life can last beyond the classes. However, the effects of group exercise training on mobility, spacticity, fatigue and quality of life in people with multiple sclerosis has not been comprehensively evaluated. We hypothesized that participating group exercise training may effect positively clinical outcome measures in moderately affected patients with multiple sclerosis. The aim of our study was to explore the effect of group exercise training on balance, functional status, spasticity, fatigue and quality of life in ambulatory individuals with multiple sclerosis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0269215513481047" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Our study design was a randomized single-blind controlled study of 12 weeks including ambulatory multiple sclerosis patients. Sample size was calculated by Raosoft, Inc. Clinically meaningful difference was considered 20% for all outcome measures. The original sample size was estimated at 44 patients to detect a statistically significant difference between the exercise training group and control group. After stratification by disability level and age, participants were randomly assigned to the group exercise group or control group by a neurologist (ME) using the function of Microsoft Office Excel software. Treatment and random number columns were created and each part of the group column was (pre-assigned as exercise group and control group, respectively) given a random number between 0 and 1 by the Microsoft Excel software random number generator. The sort and filter menu was used to sort the random number row from smallest to largest so that groups were randomly ordered.</p>
<p>Patients were referred by a neurologist from the University Hospital, Departmant of Neurology to the Division of Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation. The enrolment period was between 14 November 2011 and 30 April 2012. Patients were screened for eligibility to the study after signing a consent form. The inclusion criteria were; diagnosis of definite multiple sclerosis by McDonald criteria, Expanded Disability Status Scale<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269215513481047">18</xref></sup> score between 2.0 and 6.5, no relapse within 30 days, ability to adapt to exercises, having stability in medication and no difficulty in the transportation to the hospital. Patients were excluded if they had a disease affecting the central nervous system other than multiple sclerosis, were pregnant, had a medical condition or complication that prevented exercising and had trained regular scheduled exercise training at least three months ago. Patients who met the inclusion criteria were randomly assigned to the group exercise training group or a control group. Outcome measures were evaluated by an assessor (YZ) blinded to group randomization. Group allocation was concealed from the assessor until the end of the study. Three physical therapists carried out supervision of the whole group exercise programme in the university Hospital’s rehabilitation unit. Patients in both groups were advised to continue their usual prescribed medical care throughout the study.</p>
<p>All subjects signed an informed consent. The study was approved by the University Institutional Review Board (2011/1452-708) and performed in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration.</p>
<sec id="section11-0269215513481047">
<title>Intervention</title>
<p>The intervention schedule for the exercise training group was three exercise sessions per week for 12 weeks (36 sessions), while the patients in the control group were included in the waiting list until the end of the study and they had no intervention. At the beginning of the study, subjects participated in assessment for primary and secondary outcome measures (one session) and group orientation and exercise training (two sessions) under physical therapists’ supervision at hospital. In the final week of the study period (last two sessions), all outcome measures were re-assessed. For the control group, a phone call was made to the patients by a neurologist once month and information received about their clinical status throughout the study.</p>
<p>Exercise sessions were attended by a group of up to six or seven participants with similar age and Expanded Disability Status Scale scores. Participants in both groups were advised to continue their usual routine. They were asked to avoid beginning any new exercise regime during the study. After the completion of the study, if they would like to participate, the control group was offered the same exercise programme.</p>
<p>The group exercise programme, which was designed by physical therapists, was performed for each exercise group (Appendix, available online). The programme included flexibility, range of motion, strengthening with/without Theraband (The Hygenic Corporation, Akron, OH44310, USA) for lower extremity, core stabilization, balance and coordination exercises and functional activities. The treatment programme was carried out on alternate days in groups (totally nine groups) and consisted of 60-minute sessions thrice weekly for 12 weeks, led by the same physical therapists. Patients were educated about appropriate level of exertion and were asked to have a rest when their level reached 13 (Somewhat hard)/20 in rating of perceived exertion scale.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269215513481047">19</xref></sup> During the training, an increase of 20 pulse per minute in heart rate and 20 mmHg in blood pressure were accepted in the resting criteria.</p>
<p>The participants were dropped-out if they had an exacerbation of symptoms, participated in less than 80% of the training sessions, participated a new exercise programme, had personal problems or failed to attend the second assessment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0269215513481047">
<title>Outcome measurements</title>
<p>We aimed to assess the change in balance and functional status as primary outcome measurements, and spasticity, fatigue and quality of life as secondary outcome measurements. The Berg Balance Scale is a task performance test consisting of 14 items that measure postural stability. The maximum possible score is 56 with lower scores indicating more impaired balance. Good reliability and validity of the Berg Balance Scale have been demonstrated in multiple sclerosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269215513481047">20</xref></sup> The 10-metre walk test is the tool used to evaluate temporal attributes of gait.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269215513481047">21</xref></sup> Subjects were instructed ‘to walk at usual comfortable speed’. A dynamic start was adopted and time registration occured over the middle 10-metres of a 14-metre walkway to avoid measuring the acceleration and deceleration phases of gait. In 10-stair climbing test, participants climbed up 10 steps (measuring 18 cm in height), with or without the use of the rails and/or assistive devices. Subjects were asked to climb the stairs without skipping any steps, preferably using one foot for each step and descend without stopping. The time taken to climb the 10 steps was recorded.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269215513481047">22</xref></sup> Both the 10-metre walk test and 10-stair climbing test (10 SCT)were done thrice at each evaluation session, allowing a maximum of 5 minutes rest between tests, and the average value was used for analysis. During the tests, the required assistance was noted and participants were instructed to use the same assistance during the second measurements. Throughout the test procedure, physical therapist assessor followed the patients to avoid unexpected falls.</p>
<p>The Modified Ashworth Scale is a clinical instrument for measuring spasticity, which is scored on an ordinal scale from 0 to 4.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269215513481047">23</xref></sup> The scoring of the Modified Ashworth Scale was changed to 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 (0 = no increase in muscle tone, 5 = affected part rigid in flexion or extension) for statistical analysis. We assessed tonus of hip flexors, hamstring and Achilles in the supine position shortly after the 10 SCT. The Fatigue Severity Scale is a nine-item, self-administered questionnaire to assess the severity of fatigue and its impact on daily functioning during the past week.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269215513481047">24</xref></sup> The items are rated on a seven-point scale (1 = strongly disagree and 7 = strongly agree) and item scores were averaged into an overall measure of a person’s severity of fatigue symptoms. Higher Fatique Severity Scale scores reflect greater severity of fatigue. The Mutiple Sclerosis International Quality of life questionnaire is a multidimensional health-related quality of life instrument. It consists of 31 questions divided into nine dimensions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269215513481047">25</xref></sup> The activity of daily living and psychological well-being dimensions were particularly sensitive to both improvement and worsening in health status. For each individual, the score of each dimension was obtained by computing the mean of the item scores of the dimension. A global index score was computed as the mean of the dimension scores.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0269215513481047">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS software package (version 17.0; SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for Windows. Data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation. The normality of the data distribution was assessed by the Shapiro-Wilk test. Qualitative variables were compared with the chi-square test. Continuous variables were compared with Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test. At the baseline and after the treatment, the outcomes in the two randomization groups were summarized by mean and standard deviation (SD); direct comparison between groups was done by <italic>t</italic> tests. The intention to treat analysis was performed, including the data about the subject who dropped-out from our study. A <italic>p</italic>-value of &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant for all analysis.</p>
<p>The effect size <italic>r</italic> was calculated for each variable to index magnitude of group differences in performance; a large effect is represented by an <italic>r</italic> of at least 0.50, a moderate effect by an <italic>r</italic> of 0.30 and a small effect by an <italic>r</italic> of 0.10.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269215513481047">26</xref></sup></p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present randomized controlled trial was aimed to evaluate the effects of a supervised comprehensive group exercise programme in the multiple sclerosis population compared with the control group. The results demonstrated that supervised group exercise training can improve balance and functional timed test scores in moderately impaired subjects with multiple sclerosis. Spasticity, fatigue and quality of life all enhanced in favour of the supervised group exercise training in multiple sclerosis patients.</p>
<p>Following a 12-week study, our subjects in the group exercise group showed significant improvements in Berg Balance Scale scores. Similar to our findings, Freeman et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269215513481047">10</xref></sup> found a significant improvement with fewer group exercise sessions (10 weeks, twice weekly) in Berg Balance Scale scores. On the other hand, Learmonth et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269215513481047">16</xref></sup> reported improved physical activity levels, perceived balance confidence and leg strength, but they did not observe improvements in Berg Balance Scale and 25-foot walk time after 12-weeks community-based group exercise intervention in moderately affected patients with multiple sclerosis. In a meta analysis, the cumulative evidence supports that exercise training programmes are associated with small, but clinically meaningful, improvements in walking mobility among individuals with multiple sclerosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269215513481047">27</xref></sup> We showed statistically significant improvements in the 10 metre-walking test and Berg Balance Scale after the 12-week group exercise training.</p>
<p>Walking speed and stair climbing may also be affected by muscle tonus and balance in people with multiple sclerosis. One of the key findings of the present study was an increase in functional activities as walking and stair climbing. Taylor et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269215513481047">7</xref></sup> showed in their study that there was no significant improvement after a twice-weekly 10-week progressive resistance exercise programme in the multiple sclerosis group. We indicated benefits of the group exercise programme for 10 SCT results in our study. Differences in therapy contents of the two trials may lead to this different result. Taylor et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269215513481047">7</xref></sup> applied only progressive resistive training in their study, while there was strengthing, balance and core stabilization exercises, which may cause improvement in stair climbing, in our study.</p>
<p>It is known that spasticity has a negative effect on balance and mobility in persons with multiple sclerosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269215513481047">28</xref></sup> It has been believed that strengthening exercises may cause increased muscle tone. Recently, there are studies showing beneficial effects of exercise on spasticity in the multiple sclerosis population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269215513481047">29</xref></sup> Our study also revealed the positive effects of group exercise training in reducing spasticity of the lower extremity.</p>
<p>Although fatigue is a common symptom in multiple sclerosis, a review noticed that there are few trials investigating fatigue as a primary outcome measure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269215513481047">14</xref></sup> Increased fatigue in multiple sclerosis patients is likely to consist of both motor-related and mood-related dimensions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269215513481047">30</xref></sup> Andreason et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269215513481047">14</xref></sup> suggested that exercise therapy has the potential to induce a positive effect with endurance training, resistance training and combined training on multiple sclerosis fatigue. From our findings, we concluded that supervised comprehensive group exercise training is a useful intervention for multiple sclerosis patients while they cope with fatigue.</p>
<p>It is found that exercise training was associated with a small improvement in quality of life in people with multiple sclerosis. While improvements were found significant after exercise sessions in some studies, there are other researches that have not supported this finding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215513481047">15</xref></sup> Our findings are similar to studies that found significant improvement in quality of life after exercise training. We thought this finding as a benefit of group exercise training, which had important role on the physical well-being domain of quality of life.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there were interesting results for the control group, which kept on usual care during the 12-week period. The control group showed a significant decrease in Berg Balance Scale scores and an increase in the 10-metre walking test and Fatique Severity Scale scores. They did not maintain their function status as a consequence of lack of benefits obtained from the exercise programme. We emphasize that exercise training is required, not only to increase the functional parameters, but also to keep the existing functional status in patients with multiple sclerosis.</p>
<p>Specifically in group exercise, we considered that the intensity of the exercise programme is a key factor both to provide training effect and to maintain patient compliance for all persons without any adverse effect. Our group exercise training of moderate intensity seems to be well tolerated and to improve both balance and some functional measures among moderately impaired multiple sclerosis patients. We applied a thrice weekly, 60-minutes duration group exercise training as an intervention. We considerthat our exercise training may be implemented safely in community exercise centres under supervision of a physical therapist.</p>
<p>There are some limitations in the study. Our study was a single-centre study, therefore its wider applicability is questionable. Although the carrying out of assessments by a single physical therapist increased reliability of outcomes, our results would be much more definitive if we had designed a multicentre study. On the other hand, our study had a control group that was put on a waiting list. A cross over design could be preferred to highlight differential results in the mere ordering of intervention/non-intervention. As this study is single blinded, a potential beneficial intervention effect in the group exercise group should be taken into consideration. Another limitation of our study may be not assessing depression status of the individuals. Since fatigue is affected by depression, depression measurements could draw firm conclusions about the cause of the observed improvement. We interpreted that the increased fatigue threshold was related to the exercise training. Lastly, since we have no long-term follow-up results, we do not know whether the acquired benefits from the group exercise training is maintained in the multiple sclerosis population.</p>
<p>Our study has important strength in terms of the interpretation of results. First, the present study was undertaken in one centre at University Hospital. Thus, we provided homogeneity in both diagnosis and medical care and group exercise training led by the three experienced physical therapists. Second, we included a large sample size providing reliability in terms of interpretation of our results. Last, we used a comprehensive exercise programme combining balance, strengthening, stretching and functional activities for each session. The outcomes for activity and participation were used in our study. There was considerable consistency between our study objectives and with respect to the target outcomes chosen.</p>
<p>This study demonstrated that a university-based group exercise training programme, combining balance, coordination, strengthening, flexibility, core stabilization and functional activities, is effective in improving balance, functional status, spasticity, fatigue and quality of life in people moderately affected with multiple sclerosis, with no worsening of their clinical status. In conclusion, we suggest that group exercise training is a potentially significant beneficial treatment effect and feasible choice in multiple sclerosis management. Since multiple sclerosis has chronic progress, life-long exercise is needed in multiple sclerosis patients to maintain, or slow decline in, their functional level. Group exercise training designed by a physical therapist based on group features can enhance exercise participation in patients with multiple sclerosis. In future, definitive studies are required about the long-term effect of group exercise therapy in multiple sclerosis.</p>
