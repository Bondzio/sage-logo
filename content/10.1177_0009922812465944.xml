<abstract>
<p>Parents (n = 500) were surveyed about which professional groups they were most likely to seek and follow advice from regarding child discipline as well as their use of corporal punishment (CP). Nearly half of the parents reported that they were most likely to seek child discipline advice from pediatricians (48%), followed by religious leaders (21%) and mental health professionals (18%). Parents who sought advice from religious leaders (vs pediatricians) had nearly 4 times the odds of reporting use of CP. Parents reported that they were more likely to follow the advice of pediatricians than any other professional; however, black parents were as likely to follow the advice of religious leaders as that of pediatricians. Pediatricians play a central role in advising parents about child discipline. Efforts to engage pediatricians in providing violence prevention counseling should continue. Increased efforts are needed to engage other professionals, especially religious leaders, in providing such advice to parents.</p>

<p>Parental decisions regarding child discipline are critical because a growing body of research finds that corporal punishment (CP), such as spanking, has been linked with a multitude of negative physical, social, emotional, behavioral, and neurophysiological consequences for children,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922812465944">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922812465944">2</xref></sup> such as increased risk for aggressive behavior,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922812465944">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922812465944"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922812465944">5</xref></sup> mental disorders,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922812465944">6</xref></sup> and being physically abused.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922812465944">7</xref></sup> Most parents believe that even good parents need help or advice about parenting now and then, although lower-income parents might be less inclined to think so.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922812465944">8</xref></sup> Not surprisingly, parents are more likely to seek help when they feel increasing parenting stress,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922812465944">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922812465944">10</xref></sup> although parents generally seek help from personal support systems before seeking help from professionals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922812465944">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922812465944">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0009922812465944"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0009922812465944">13</xref></sup> One reason for this might be fear of judgment or criticism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922812465944">8</xref></sup> However, parents are more likely to seek help from a professional, such as a family doctor, pediatrician, psychologist, or teacher, when they have a decreasing ability to manage their children<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922812465944">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0009922812465944">14</xref></sup> and when they believe that changing their child’s negative behavior is possible.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0009922812465944">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Walsh<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0009922812465944">16</xref></sup> examined sources of parenting advice regarding child discipline, and spanking in particular, among a mostly white sample of 2-parent families from rural/agricultural Minnesota. When asked to rank the importance of advice from various professional sources, parents ranked pediatricians as most important, followed by psychologists, and then religious leaders. Most parents viewed these professionals as having neutral opinions toward spanking; however, a sizable proportion of parents (45% for psychologists, 37% for pediatricians, and 32% for ministers) assumed that these groups were opposed to spanking. Parents’ use or nonuse of spanking was predicted by the importance of the source to the parent combined with the parent’s perceived recommendation of that source regarding spanking.</p>
<p>The current study adds to Walsh’s work, drawing on a majority black, urban sample to examine parents’ primary professional sources of advice about child discipline. This study also aimed to examine the association of these choices with parents’ demographic and religious characteristics, some parenting risk factors, and their reported use of CP. Findings might help inform community-based prevention strategies that engage professionals in promoting effective, nonphysical child discipline strategies, reducing parental use of CP, and, thereby, improving outcomes for children.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section2-0009922812465944">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>We conducted a random-digit dial telephone survey of parents in New Orleans, Louisiana. This sampling strategy was used to recruit a sample more generalizable to the New Orleans population than could be obtained from clinic-based sampling strategies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0009922812465944">17</xref></sup> The sample was stratified by race and gender to reflect parental demographics in the city. Racial strata were set at 60% black and 40% white. (The size of other racial and ethnic groups would have been too small for statistical comparison.) Gender strata were set to overrepresent women (70% women and 30% men), given that 91% of families in the area contained a female adult, and only 51% contained a male adult. Further details about this survey are described elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0009922812465944">18</xref></sup> Our final sample was very similar to the New Orleans population according to available comparable statistics, such as education: less than high school, 12.8% (vs 16.6%); high school graduates, 22.4% (vs 26.9%); college graduate, 22.8% (vs 22.4%); and graduate degree, 17.4% (vs 13.4%).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0009922812465944">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>A total of 500 parents were interviewed between December 2008 to January 2009. To be eligible for the study, a person had to be 18 years of age or older, the parent or legal guardian of at least 1 child younger than 16 years living in the household, fluent in English, and self-identified as either black or white. The survey took about 25 minutes to complete. If the participant was the parent or legal guardian of more than 1 child, his or her child closest to 4 years of age, a peak age for use of CP,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0009922812465944">20</xref></sup> was identified as the index child, and parents were instructed that survey questions would be in regard to this child only. The interviews were conducted by Eastern Research Services. The survey was approved by the Tulane University Institutional Review Board.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section4-0009922812465944">
<title>Professional sources of parenting advice parents were most likely to seek</title>
<p>Parents were asked, “When it comes to seeking advice from a professional source about how best to discipline your child, are you more likely to seek advice from . . . (1) your child’s doctor; (2) a religious leader such as your pastor, minister, or rabbi; or (3) some other professional? If the parent chose the latter, he or she was asked to specify.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0009922812465944">
<title>Sources of parenting advice parents were most likely to follow</title>
<p>Parents were asked, “For each of the following persons or sources that I mention, please tell me how likely you would be to follow their advice about parenting, especially how to discipline your child.” A list of 14 possible sources of parenting advice was provided, including family members, professionals, and relevant organizations. For each source, participants were asked to rate how likely they were to follow that person’s or resource’s advice on a 5-point scale from 1 = <italic>very likely</italic> to 5 = <italic>very unlikely</italic>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0009922812465944">
<title>Use of corporal punishment</title>
<p>Parents were asked, “When your [index child’s age] year old misbehaved, whether minor or severe, in the past six months, how often on average did you spank, slap, smack, or swat this child?”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0009922812465944">21</xref></sup> This variable was coded as follows: (0) <italic>never</italic>, (1) <italic>less than once per month or more than 6 months ago</italic>, and (2) <italic>at least once per month in the past 6 months</italic>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0009922812465944">
<title>Demographics</title>
<p>Demographic characteristics assessed included parent gender, race, age, marital status, education, and perceived adequacy of household income. (The latter was used as a proxy for income because more than 8% of the income data was missing.) Religion and religiosity were assessed, including frequency of attendance at religious services and importance of religious or spiritual beliefs in daily life.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0009922812465944">
<title>Parenting risk</title>
<p>Some important parenting risks previously linked with the use of CP were assessed as covariates, including expectation of positive outcomes from CP,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0009922812465944">22</xref></sup> parenting stress,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0009922812465944">23</xref></sup> unrealistic expectations of child development,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0009922812465944">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0009922812465944">25</xref></sup> and family of origin aggression and violence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0009922812465944">26</xref></sup> Four proxies for parenting risk were examined, respectively. First, parents were asked about their level of agreement with the statement “Non-physical types of discipline (such as time out or positive reinforcement) never work as well as physical discipline such as spanking.” Second, parenting stress was measured using 11 items from the Parenting Stress Index<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0009922812465944">27</xref></sup> (α = .85 in this sample). Third, knowledge of child development was assessed using 9-items from a scale developed by Reich.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0009922812465944">28</xref></sup> Finally, assessment of aggression in the respondents’ family of origin included items about having witnessed interparental violence and aggression and having directly experienced psychological or physical aggression by parents.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0009922812465944">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>χ<sup>2</sup> Tests of independence and ANOVAs were conducted as appropriate for bivariate analyses. Multivariable analyses were conducted using a multinomial regression to examine parent characteristics associated with “parents’ professional sources of advice regarding child discipline,” which was a categorical variable coded as “pediatrician” (reference outcome), “religious leader,” “mental health professional,” and “other professional.” Following this regression, we used improvement χ<sup>2</sup> tests to assess the statistical significance of each variable in the model. Paired <italic>t</italic> tests were conducted to assess differences in likelihood of following advice from 14 potential sources.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0009922812465944" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Sample characteristics are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0009922812465944">Table 1</xref>. Nearly a majority (48%) of parents cited pediatricians as the professionals they were most likely to seek advice from regarding child discipline; the next most common groups were religious leaders (21%) and mental health professionals (18%). The remaining parents cited other professionals that mainly included groups such as teachers, child care workers, and parent education specialists. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0009922812465944">Table 2</xref> shows how these sources of advice varied according to parental use of CP, demographics, religious characteristics, and assessed parenting risk factors. Parents who reported using CP most frequently were less likely to seek advice from pediatricians and more likely to talk with religious leaders and, to some extent, with other professionals. Parents who were more likely than others to seek help from pediatricians included those who were white, college educated, reportedly well-off financially, had a younger index child, or were Catholic or low in religiosity. Parents who were more likely than others to seek help from religious leaders were black, previously married, less than college educated, reportedly not well-off financially, Christian (non-Catholic), or high in religiosity. Parents who sought help from religious leaders also had lower “knowledge of child development” scores than those in other groups and were more likely to agree (or not disagree) that “non-physical types of discipline (such as time out or positive reinforcement) never work as well as physical discipline such as spanking.” There were no notable differences to report for parents who sought advice primarily from mental health or other professionals.</p>

As anticipated, personal sources of support, such as one’s own parent or spouse, topped the list. However, pediatricians were a very close second and did not differ statistically from the latter groups. Mental health professionals followed closely after pediatricians. The remainder of the top 10 did not differ statistically from one another and included, in order, the child’s school teacher or child care provider, parenting skills instructor, religious leader, a university professor who studies children and families, a friend who is a parent, and another family member. However, the ranking for 1 professional source differed significantly (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) by ethnic group: religious leaders ranked on par with pediatricians and mental health professionals for black parents (2.04) and ranked much lower (2.60) for white parents.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Pediatricians were parents’ first choice for professional advice both sought and followed regarding child discipline. Religious leaders were the second most common source of child discipline advice for parents. Notably, black parents were as likely to follow advice from their religious leaders as they were from their pediatrician. Mental health professionals were the third most common source of advice and the second most likely group that parents would listen to for advice. These findings are on par with those of Walsh<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0009922812465944">16</xref></sup>; however, her sample was nearly all white, and religious leaders did not figure as prominently as pediatricians in her study.</p>
<p>In the current study, parents who relied primarily on pediatricians versus other professionals for advice about child discipline had the lowest reported risk for using CP. Because this is a cross-sectional study, it is unclear whether this means that pediatricians tend more than other professionals to advise against using CP or if parents who are at lower risk for using CP are more likely to seek help from pediatricians than other professionals. Although the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) does not endorse the use of spanking or hitting a child and encourages pediatricians to help parents find other ways to discipline their children,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0009922812465944">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0009922812465944">30</xref></sup> this attitude is not ubiquitous within the profession.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0009922812465944">31</xref></sup> Furthermore, although a majority of pediatricians in an AAP survey reported feeling comfortable discussing the topic of CP,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0009922812465944">18</xref></sup> many provide responses that discourage parents from discussing such topics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0009922812465944">32</xref></sup> Unfortunately, many pediatricians feel that either their training in or their time to conduct violence prevention counseling is inadequate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0009922812465944">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0009922812465944">34</xref></sup> or feel constrained because of concerns about lack of reimbursement and cultural sensitivity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0009922812465944">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>The latter points might at least partially explain why black, Christian (non-Catholic), and highly religious/spiritual parents in this sample relied more heavily on religious leaders (vs pediatricians) for child discipline guidance compared with white, non-Christian, and less religious/spiritual parents, respectively. It is important to note that those parents who sought advice from religious leaders had much higher odds of using CP than those who relied on pediatricians. The same caveat noted above is noted here: It is unclear if this means that parents who are generally at higher risk for using CP are just more likely to seek help from religious leaders or if religious leaders tend more than other professionals to advise parents to use CP. However, given that conservative Protestant values reportedly promote the utilization of CP for child discipline,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0009922812465944">36</xref></sup> the latter is likely to be true to some extent. In a nationwide study of Presbyterian clergy, those who were male, nonwhite, less affluent, politically conservative, Republican leaning, and who did not know someone in their congregation who had been abused were more likely to approve of CP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0009922812465944">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>In contrast, mental health professionals tend to condemn the use of CP according to official policy statements.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0009922812465944">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0009922812465944"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0009922812465944">40</xref></sup> One study of psychologists found that 70% would not suggest the use of spanking to parents, and 33% thought that suggesting spanking to parents would be unethical; also, those who believed the research evidence that linked spanking with negative outcomes for children were not as likely to recommend its use.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0009922812465944">41</xref></sup> However, the data from this study are more than a decade old.</p>
<p>There are a number of limitations to the current study. First, the opinions are limited to parents from 1 US city; however, findings are on par with those from a sample with very different demographics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0009922812465944">16</xref></sup> Second, the data assessed self-reported likelihood of advice seeking and following behavior, as opposed to actual behavior. Third, there might be important moderating variables that were not assessed. Finally, we included parents with children of all ages, and there is tremendous variability in the use of CP across age groups. It would have been ideal to survey parents of children 3 to 5 years of age, when the use of CP peaks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0009922812465944">20</xref></sup> Unfortunately, the cost of screening parents to meet this standard was prohibitive.</p>
<p>This study has several implications relevant to pediatric practice. First, this study highlights the pivotal role that pediatricians can play in parental decision making regarding child discipline as well as the positive influence they might exert toward discouraging the use of CP. Although parents who seek advice from pediatricians are at reduced risk for using CP, it also might be that parents who use CP are less inclined than those that do not use it to seek child discipline advice from pediatricians. Therefore, a sensitive and proactive approach to providing such guidance might be required, especially for those parents who need it the most. Second, pediatricians should recognize their prominent role in this arena and be prepared to provide parents with clear and appropriate guidance regarding child discipline. Although some parents have concerns about privacy with pediatricians asking about parenting issues that seem beyond the scope of pediatrics, being judged or patronized, and a potential lack of cultural sensitivity, parents might feel more comfortable if they have an ongoing relationship with the pediatrician and if relevant information is provided in a supportive but authoritative manner.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0009922812465944">35</xref></sup> Improved psychosocial interviewing techniques can improve parental disclosure of such issues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0009922812465944">42</xref></sup> And programs such as Connected Kids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0009922812465944">43</xref></sup> and Play Nicely<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0009922812465944">44</xref></sup> are designed to support pediatricians in their efforts to provide strengths-based violence prevention counseling to parents. There is, however, a critical need for additional research on primary care–based interventions to prevent child abuse.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0009922812465944">45</xref></sup> Finally, policy targeting the education of religious leaders on this topic might be an effective way to influence parents. This is warranted, especially, given their prominent role in providing advice about child discipline, their association with increased risk for using CP, and their lack of training in child development.</p>
