<body>
<p>Collections of poems written by psychoanalysts raise questions: what are the similarities and differences, for example, between poetry and psychoanalysis, and what distinguishes a poem written by a psychoanalyst from poems written by others?</p>
<p>The shared experience of the analyst and analysand is a creation unique to the particular characteristics of each person and to the present changing moment in their personal histories. The joining of a poem and a reader is also a unique mix; although the poem remains constant, the reader is not and the poet is absent. Analyst and analysand are both present, though not necessarily constant. Analyst, analysand, and reader share the experience of subjectively engaging with the voice of another. Poetry is a created product, analysis a created process.</p>
<p>When a poem moves a reader, he or she may experience a flow of memories and associations, feel surprise at a different view of something familiar, or feel confronted by something unexpected, strange, or disturbing—experiences familiar to the analysand. Similarly, the analysand, by his or her own words or by those of the analyst, can be startled or excited, experience a frisson or an outpouring of grief, or feel a sense of fullness—a good feed. Both analysis and poetry when they work have a powerful bodily component. Emily Dickinson captured the potential bodily power of some poetry when she wrote, “If I feel physically as if <italic>the top of my head</italic> were taken <italic>off</italic>, I know <italic>that</italic> is poetry” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0003065112474070">Higginson 1891</xref>, p. 9).</p>
<p>Transferences—the presence of internalized others—are active in analysand, analyst, reader, and poet. What moves one reader may have no affect on another. A poem that leaves a reader unmoved at one time may have a powerful impact at another. While this may be true for any art form, poetry and analysis share the verbal representations of primary process—condensation, displacement, metaphor—and the music, rhythm, and meanings of language. All have the potential to quicken our senses.</p>
<p>Some poetry is so finely wrought and so tuned to unconscious experience it has almost universal appeal. Shakespeare’s sonnets are one rare example. More frequently a poem, or a fragment of a poem, either captures a reader’s imagination and visceral response or it doesn’t.</p>
<p>I tend to look for a strong sense of place in a poem. I need place as an anchor or placeholder as the poem sails off in surprising directions. Some readers may thrill to feeling lost in space or relish the challenge of abstract ideas. Place can be a landscape or an interior. Place when perceived in a poem evokes the feeling and moving body in space. Even a still life painting, by form and subject, evokes the body and its senses. As I explore the poet’s landscape I want to feel and envision the body in motion as it breaks upon the world or breaks free of it. First thrust into the world, then held and carried, our first explored landscape and sense of place was our mother’s body. The unique style of physical engagement between mother and baby inflected our explorations. Some readers may desire more holding, some more carrying, and some more physical action.</p>
<p>I enjoy poems that include the quotidian details of a life, including objects—the pots and pans, the shoes and socks. For me this renders the ordinary extraordinary.</p>
<p>A universal aspect of poetry is musicality of language. Musicality allows words to say more than their literal meaning. The music of language ties us to the primal hearing of our mother’s voice when language was <italic>only</italic> music—sounds and rhythms. In analysis, the analysand’s recumbent position, facing away from the analyst, attunes both analyst and analysand to the musical and therefore poetic aspects of spoken words.</p>
<p>So what of these two volumes of poetry written by psychoanalysts?</p>
<p>Steven Ablon’s <italic>Night Call</italic> is organized according to the unfolding of his professional life from the time of his medical training through his development as an analyst. There are three sections: “Medical School,” “Residency,” and “Practice.” In the first, “Medical School,” we meet Ablon as he first encounters and poetically captures his reactions to his patients’ exposed bodies in illness and in pain.</p>
<p>In “Quadruple Amputee,” Ablon must draw blood from a limbless woman and recognizes he is inflicting even more pain on her. She forgives him with a kiss, her “skin flushed with fire / forgiving fate, forgiving me.” Here is a fragment from the end of the poem.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I rearrange her daisies, stem</p>
<p>by stem, fanning them out</p>
<p>in their vase like pickup</p>
<p>sticks before they fall [p. 28].</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In this gentle and detailed metaphor we experience a young medical student’s feeling and fear of his helplessness in the face of inexorable loss and frailty. Daisies will appear again in a later poem—suggesting that they represent something important for the poet. According to Wikipedia, in the “language of flowers” daisies not only signify purity and innocence; they are also durable, adaptable survivors. They can be trammeled one season and bloom the next.</p>
<p>I was particularly moved by “Differential Diagnosis,” another poem in this section. Ablon recognizes that his patient has all the symptoms of lupus. Urgently, in short staccato phrases, he lists the worrisome symptoms as he discovers them. Then he interrupts himself.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>To comfort myself I think</p>
<p>of sandwiches, especially</p>
<p>grilled cheese, especially</p>
<p>with crust cut off. Tip Top bread.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>He returns to observing his patient’s symptoms and sits on the edge of her bed,
<disp-quote>
<p>precarious as a sub</p>
<p>of hard salami,</p>
<p>corned beef, sauerkraut,</p>
<p>Lupus on the darkest rye [p. 21].</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The child-friendly soft grilled cheese sandwich on Tip Top bread can no longer comfort him. He tries to compensate. His own body sitting on the bed feels as “precarious” or dangerous as a sub(marine). He persists—<italic>hard</italic> salami, the salt of corned beef, the acid of sauerkraut—he must face it—<italic>Lupus on the darkest rye.</italic> Perhaps <italic>rye</italic> is a pun on <italic>wry</italic>—his final effort to find some mordant comfort in the presence of his patient’s suffering.</p>
<p>In the section “Residency,” Ablon conveys the weight of responsibility and exhaustion he feels as he cares for desperately sick people. With precision, trepidation, and a sense of awe he intrudes upon and sometimes invades the still strange landscape of his patients’ bodies. He struggles to find his compass by evoking memories of his own familiar landscapes. The effect is like hearing a precise and singable melody punctuated with the counterpoint of memory and overtones of feeling.</p>
<p>“Aspirating a Lung” is an example. We are privy to Ablon’s feelings while he searches for something familiar about the strangeness of his task. “The latex gloves are as dry / as a baseball mitt on opening day.” Next we briefly return with him to the present.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I line the needle up between the ribs,</p>
<p>push, guess the proper distance</p>
<p>to the pleural cavity, distance</p>
<p>like between third base and home [p. 41].</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Immediately he brings us back to the present as he draws on the syringe: “the thick / effusion to be catalogued on a slide.”</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I smooth the dressing, the adhesive grip</p>
<p>tense as the black electrical tape</p>
<p>from my father’s tool box</p>
<p>compressing the neck of my bat.</p>
<p>Mrs. G. and I suspended here</p>
<p>in the dugout of her lungs [p. 41].</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In the section “Practice,” Ablon is now a physician of the mind; however, the body is always present as we bear witness to his patients’ gestures, small and large. I found the most moving poem of this section to be “The Tick,” not about a patient but about his mother. Here it is in its entirety.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>After lunch my mother says</p>
<p>there is this bite</p>
<p>I want to show you,</p>
<p>unbuttons her purple cardigan</p>
<p>downward, from top</p>
<p>to bottom, and I study</p>
<p>her nail polish clear, fragile.</p>
<p>It is a tick rooted in the center</p>
<p>of her daisy chest.</p>
<p>Just one second, I say,</p>
<p>ask for tweezers, sterilize</p>
<p>them molten over the burner</p>
<p>on her stove, walk with her</p>
<p>to the living room and sit</p>
<p>her down on the couch.</p>
<p>I scrape her marbled skin</p>
<p>away. I pry under that tick,</p>
<p>draw my mother’s blood,</p>
<p>probe her muscle raw.</p>
<p>Her breasts are pale</p>
<p>as marguerites. I leave</p>
<p>that tick to slough</p>
<p>in time, lips wet</p>
<p>with milk [p. 83].</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The delicate and profound intimacy of the poem packs a primal punch. This poem of carefully chosen words feels ineffable and secretive. It is as though the words whisper from beneath his mother’s skin. There is violence in it—drawing the mother’s blood as though biting her breast. Although different, it drew to mind the force of John Donne’s “The Flea,” where the image of a detestable and tiny insect evokes a potent and driven libidinal world.</p>
<p>In <italic>Between Hours</italic>, Salman Akhtar gathers a collection of poets who are psychoanalysts. They are presented in alphabetical order, with a brief biography for each preceding their poems. Several of the poets collected here have also written articles on literature and psychoanalysis (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0003065112474070">Akhtar 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0003065112474070">Hamer 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0003065112474070">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0003065112474070">Jones 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0003065112474070">Richards 2000</xref>). The collection begins with Akhtar’s poems.</p>
<p>Ahktar writes in a variety of styles—narrative, surreal, extremely condensed. Some poems are oblique and some very direct. He embraces themes of sexual passion, nostalgia and ironic anger, the anger of feeling helpless and the anger of injustice. An example of this is in “A World without Seasons,” dedicated to Indian immigrants in the United States. Here are the final four lines.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Proudly we mispronounce our own names</p>
<p>And those of our monuments and our children</p>
<p>Forsaking the grey abodes and sunken graves of</p>
<p>Our ancestors, we have come to live in</p>
<p>A world without seasons [p. 8].</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Gerald Garguilo writes about loss and grief with exquisite delicacy and strength. His carefully constructed poems attend to form and music. As I reread them I found myself remembering the Cavatina from the fifth movement of Beethoven’s Quartet in B-flat op. 130, <italic>Adagio molto espressivo</italic>. Here is “The Found World” in its entirety.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Past the mid-point of</p>
<p>Our lives</p>
<p>When wisdom’s consolation</p>
<p>Interrupts</p>
<p>The rush of time,</p>
<p>We recall when first we made the</p>
<p>World,</p>
<p>And knew it as our own.</p>
<p>But life betrays</p>
<p>By seasonal design:</p>
<p>Before each May</p>
<p>Our absence grows,</p>
<p>Compassions’s shadow then brings</p>
<p>No relief</p>
<p>And autumn tells—</p>
<p>We are a memory of light</p>
<p>Fleeing the forgetfulness</p>
<p>Of night [p. 14].</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Forrest Hamer writes and hears poems through his body. Here is “Genesis,” a poem about the poet, the poem, and the reader who re-creates them.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>There are endless poems</p>
<p>in the world,</p>
<p>and each one seeks its listener out.</p>
<p>A poet hears first some hint,</p>
<p>coaxes this</p>
<p>into the body</p>
<p>where listening begins</p>
<p>between them—the poem</p>
<p>making the poet,</p>
<p>the poet making the poem.</p>
<p>After, each listener becomes another</p>
<p>maker, each time the poem made</p>
<p>all over again, each time</p>
<p>becoming something new [p. 25].</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Sheri Hunt, poetry editor of <italic>The American Psychoanalyst</italic>, incarnates her landscape with acuity to sound and language. She achieves this most vividly in “Green Lake.” She begins “We live by a lake, / Not dwell.” She ends more emphatically: “We live by a lake, / We do not dwell.” In the poem she brings her lake to lustful life. Here is a section.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It stirs itself, first slowly.</p>
<p>The lake, our lake, quickens in the ready sun.</p>
<p>The lake abounds,</p>
<p>Animates itself.</p>
<p>The lake’s aroused below the surface,</p>
<p>We can always tell [p. 42].</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Her lake is <italic>aroused</italic> and her swimmers as well as they immerse themselves in its spirited waters.</p>
<p>Alice Jones’s poetry rings out with vibrant movement, sensuality, and the flavor of words. In “Circus” she uses the metaphor of swinging on a trapeze. With remarkable concision she captures the dizzying thrill of body and mind as the poet finds words to express it.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Pitching myself into space,</p>
<p>trapeze swing, an arc</p>
<p>through air, that’s it:</p>
<p>pairing form and gesture</p>
<p>to find words, not a fall</p>
<p>into the tent’s blackness,</p>
<p>not towards the hungry</p>
<p>watchers, but that catch</p>
<p>at the bar—pulled up</p>
<p>into voice—a mating of self</p>
<p>and motion, to embody</p>
<p>their wedding, one line [p. 45].</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Eugene Mahon, attentive to poetic form and classical themes, moves supplely from surface to depth, from past to present and back again as he captures the extremes of despair, terror, rage, and lost love. In “Dream” he uniquely captures the elusiveness and unapproachability of a dreamer dreaming.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Beside me shaking,</p>
<p>A dream shivering,</p>
<p>A piece of the night</p>
<p>Cornered inside you</p>
<p>Like a wounded animal.</p>
<p>I reach in:</p>
<p>Your flesh bars the way.</p>
<p>Shut out</p>
<p>I can feel the thunder</p>
<p>On an ocean</p>
<p>I cannot see or hear.</p>
<p>Only morning</p>
<p>Will bring the halves</p>
<p>Of us together</p>
<p>When words split</p>
<p>The dream in two [p. 56].</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The surprise in this poem is “When words split / The dream in two.” <italic>Split</italic> has a force that asserts the poet’s urgency to find entry into the mind of the dreamer. Words are the tool.</p>
<p>Rebecca Meredith writes narrative poems that capture a primal, sensual sense of the Mississippi Gulf Coast in dazzling detail—speech, gesture, and steamy soporific heat—all undercoated with serious humor and the urgently needed, soul-saving power of the blues. The following fragment is from “Intergenerational Delta Blues,” in which Meredith returns to her place of birth “to watch my father die.” She brings her son with her. It is his first trip to the place of his mother’s origins. Here is a segment.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>That’s the way it is, I told him,</p>
<p>the radio plays country and evangelicals, and nothing else.</p>
<p>The cell phones don’t work at all.</p>
<p>And all you can do is lay yourself on</p>
<p>the delta’s dinner table and let the kudzu take you;</p>
<p>let the Drama-Queen southern thunderstorms</p>
<p>cuss you for a Yankee dog</p>
<p>and submit to it until you can run, still living, away</p>
<p>and just let it have the dead [p. 65].</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>I cannot leave Merideth’s poems without mentioning “When Old, Old Women Up and Get The Blues.” A pelvic throbbing blues beat speaks as much as the words to capture the heartache and the still pulsing heart of being “old, old” and alone. Here is the opening segment.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>When old, old women up and get the blues,</p>
<p>they dream a dream that slowly, gently creeps</p>
<p>around their lonely thighs and collar bones—</p>
<p>and when those middle nights deny them sleep</p>
<p>it leaves them, makes them moan and toss and weep [p. 72].</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Arlene Richards’s colorful poetry surprises with Chagall-like magical realism, unexpected objects, and wild movement. The moods of her poems vary, expressing sadness, tenderness, lust, and fear. Most address someone—lover, mother, father, an old man on the bus. “Halloween” captures her voice.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Your ghost ate chocolates and refused to ski.</p>
<p>Mine drank music and wore boots.</p>
<p>Yours loved to shop, to throw furious pots.</p>
<p>Mine finally removed his red toupee.</p>
<p>Our ghosts dance on the shaggy green rug,</p>
<p>between us.</p>
<p>We’ll fold their sheets, top and bottom,</p>
<p>to make our bed [p. 81].</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Arnold Richards’s elegiac poems offer biographies and histories of family, friends, and acquaintances in a few condensed lines. Here is a section from “Father’s Day.”</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>My father had a stubble beard</p>
<p>a crippled gait, a sad face, a quiet voice</p>
<p>My father had a troubled life.</p>
<p>Mother died before her time.</p>
<p>Brother struck by Cossack blade.</p>
<p>Father carried the body home.</p>
<p>Sister shot in dark ravine.</p>
<p>A world destroyed, A god that failed [p. 88].</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Elise Sanders writes dream and memory poems rich with quotidian details that capture an aching heart. Here is a fragment from “Old House.” The poet wanders through her now empty house.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>If I wander there, my heart beats so heavy I have to lie</p>
<p>down on the hard floor of sorrow.</p>
<p>I let it slip through</p>
<p>my emotional hands with dreams of ever after,</p>
<p>the table is no longer here, its surface sticky with flecks of glitter</p>
<p>and stray sharpie marks bled through a project [p. 95].</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In his prologue to this volume, Akhtar tells us about poetry as a bridge that links the unknown and the known, the preverbal and the verbal, music and prose, male and female, emotion and logic, merger and separation, reality and unreality. Poetry, he says, “is not located midway between reality and unreality but simultaneously accommodates both of them. It is both subjective and objective” (p. xiv). He ends the volume with an epilogue about the interplay between psychoanalysis and poetry: “In the end it is all about transformation through listening. Writing poetry requires listening to one’s own self and conducting psychotherapy requires listening to the Other. Both endeavors transport the inner and incomprehensible baggage of the heart to the outer and comprehensible platform of the mind” (p. 106).</p>
<p>So what distinguishes these poems as poems specifically by psychoanalysts? Attention to detail, a nonlinear sense of time, the past as it lives in the present, how the infant alive within us never truly sleeps, the unexpected—all these are elements both of fine poetry and of psychoanalysis. I cannot distinguish the fine poems in these collections as specifically by psychoanalysts. These are poems by poets. I commend both volumes without reservation.</p>
