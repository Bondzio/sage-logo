<p><italic>Background</italic>: The benefit of ω-3 fatty acids in fat emulsion remains controversial. This study evaluated the effect of ω-3 fatty acids on immune and inflammatory modulation in surgical intensive care unit (SICU) patients. <italic>Methods</italic>: Thirty-eight patients admitted to the SICU after major surgery were enrolled in this prospective controlled study and randomized to receive parenteral nutrition (PN) with equal volume and calories from glucose, nitrogen, and fat but different lipid components for 7 postoperative days. Group A (n = 12) received a mixture of soybean and medium-chain triglyceride oils; group B (n = 18) received a fat emulsion with part of the lipid replaced by fish oil. Blood tests, including lipid profile, routine biochemistry, inflammatory cytokines, and lymphocyte subpopulations, were evaluated preoperatively and on postoperative days 4 and 7. <italic>Results</italic>: Both lipid regimens were well tolerated. There was a trend toward reduced serum inflammatory cytokines in group B vs group A with significant differences regarding interleukin (IL)–1, IL-8, and interferon (IFN)–γ on postoperative day 4 (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05) and IL-1, IL-8, IFN-γ, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor–α on postoperative day 7 (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05). There was a reduction in postoperative liver dysfunction (A vs B: 50% vs 33.3%) and infection rate (A vs B: 41.7% vs 27.8%) in group B, although this was not statistically significant. There was no mortality in either group. <italic>Conclusion</italic>: This study suggests that supplementation of parenteral ω-3 fatty acids in PN is safe and may improve immune and hyperinflammatory response for SICU patients after major surgery.</p>

<body>
<p>Lipid emulsions have been used as a key constituent of the parenteral nutrition (PN) regimen and are regularly used postoperatively to supply energy and essential fatty acids. However, more than being a dense source of energy, the fatty acids composing lipid emulsions are active with complex immunologic properties influencing biochemical pathways and signal transduction. A number of downstream biological effects are related, including immunosuppression and excess inflammation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0884533611429796">1</xref></sup> This is of particular significance in critically ill patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0884533611429796">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0884533611429796">2</xref></sup> and may be the major contributor to the development of organ failure, the most common cause of death among hospitalized patients. Thus, the nature and quantity of the lipid supplied may have an important role in determining clinical outcome.</p>
<p>The conventional soybean oil–based lipid emulsions are rich in the ω-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) linoleic acid, which may be immunosuppressive and may predispose patients to an increased risk of infection. In addition to depressing cell-mediated immunity, ω-6 fatty acids have also been implicated in the promotion of inflammation, primarily via the production of proinflammatory eicosanoids (ie, prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and thromboxanes) by arachidonic acid (AA).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0884533611429796">1</xref></sup> Ultimately, concerns regarding the potential immunological and inflammatory effects of ω-6 fatty acids led to the development of lipid emulsions that have replaced some of the soybean oil content with alternative fatty acid sources. The physical combination of medium-chain triacylglycerols (MCTs) and long-chain triacylglycerols (LCTs) (MCTs/LCTs) has been shown to induce a better immune response in children after surgery when compared with the LCT-containing lipid emulsion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0884533611429796">3</xref></sup> Even the ratio of phospholipids to triacylglycerols of a lipid emulsion makes a difference in lipid metabolism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0884533611429796">4</xref></sup> In the past few years, more studies have emerged promoting the use of fish oil, a source of ω-3 fatty acids primarily including eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), either as a supplement to PN or for the use of the new lipid emulsions. In contrast to ω-6 fatty acids, ω-3 fatty acids generally exert anti-inflammatory effects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0884533611429796">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0884533611429796">7</xref></sup> In addition, by incorporation into membranes, the ω-3 fatty acids can compete with AA, giving rise to less inflammatory active and antithrombotic eicosanoids.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0884533611429796">8</xref></sup> Fish oil was reported to suppress the hyperinflammation induced by surgery and decrease the risk of postoperative thrombosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0884533611429796">9</xref></sup> A randomized controlled trial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0884533611429796">10</xref></sup> has demonstrated a shorter postoperative intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital stay and a lower rate of severe infections in patients administered ω-3 fatty acids perioperatively. These results suggest that supplementation with ω-3 fatty acids may have a more favorable effect on the outcome of patients after a major surgery. However, interestingly, it is not consistent assessing the beneficial effects of using immunonutrition, including fish oil, in general ICU patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0884533611429796">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0884533611429796">12</xref></sup> Variability from a heterogeneous setting might be the major cause.</p>
<p>Most recent guidelines recommend that further investigation should aim at allocating current therapy options to those specific disease patterns or patient groups in which maximum benefit for the patients is expected.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0884533611429796">13</xref></sup> Although several studies have demonstrated the beneficial effects of ω-3 fatty acids on immune competence and patient outcome, controlled clinical trials focusing on the postoperative use of parenteral fish oil in the ICU are limited. The aim of this prospective study was to comprehensively evaluate the effects of ω-3 fatty acids as a PN supplement on clinical outcome, organ function, serum lipid profile, biochemical parameters, and immunological response in surgical intensive care unit (SICU) patients.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>This prospective, randomized, double-blinded study was approved by the Ethics Committee of National Taiwan University Hospital. Thirty-eight consecutive patients admitted to the SICU after major operations were enrolled into this study. Informed written consent was obtained from all patients. They were randomized to receive PN with the same volume and calories of glucose, nitrogen, and fat but different lipid components, either a mixture of MCT/LCT (group A) or part of a lipid emulsion replaced by fish oil (group B). The study was registered at the ClinicalTrials.gov Protocol Registration System (identifier number: NCT00172198).</p>

<sec id="section4-0884533611429796">
<title>Interventions</title>
<p>Patients were assigned to the intervention or control group by the institutional intensivists by use of a computer-generated block randomization list. Both the patients and the investigators were thus unaware of the infused drug. Group A was defined as the control group and group B the experimental group. Postoperatively, all patients received PN for more than consecutive 7 days through an indwelling central venous catheter or peripheral catheter. Glucose, amino acids (Aminomix 1 for intravenous infusion; Fresenius Kabi Deutschland GmbH, Bad Homburg vor der Höhe, Germany), fat- and water-soluble vitamins, and trace elements were provided to both groups by infusion pumps for 24 hours daily. The lipid emulsions were given separately with the infusion pump to control the infusion duration for 16 hours (0.0625 g fat/kg body weight [BW]/h) from 8:00 <sc>am</sc> to 12:00 <sc>pm</sc>. In group A, a mixture of MCT/LCT (10% Lipofundin MCT/LCT, 50:50 ratio of MCT:LCT; B. Braun, Melsungen, Germany) was given with 10 mL/kg BW daily. In group B, the lipid content of PN was partially replaced by fish oil (Omegaven 10% emulsion for intravenous infusion; Fresenius Kabi Deutschland GmbH) 0.2 g/kg BW daily (ie, mixture of MCT/LCT 8 mL/kg BW/d with fish oil 2 mL/kg BW/d). The nutrition in both groups was isonitrogenous and isocaloric. The regimen of daily PN is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0884533611429796">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Blood Samples and Analytical Methods</title>
<p>Safety and efficacy were evaluated comprehensively. Vital signs (including blood pressure, heart rate, and body temperature), blood liver function test, renal function test, coagulation profile, white blood cells (WBCs), and lipid profile (triglycerides [TGs], cholesterol [CH], low-density lipoprotein [LDL], and high-density lipoprotein [HDL]) were monitored. The assessments for inflammatory responses, including absolute lymphocyte count, cytokines (interleukin [IL]–1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-11, IL-18, interferon [IFN]–γ, transforming growth factor [TGF]–β, tumor necrosis factor [TNF]–α), OX40 ligand, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), and microcirculation, were performed. The clinical outcomes, including morbidity, mortality, and infectious complications during the hospital stay, were also evaluated.</p>
<p>For laboratory measurements, 12 mL of whole blood (8 mL serum, 4 mL EDTA) was withdrawn before PN was started as the baseline data and on the fourth and seventh days, respectively, after PN use (termed postoperative day [POD] 0, POD4, POD7). Routine blood test and biochemistry analysis were immediately performed at the clinical laboratory of the National Taiwan University Hospital according to standard procedures. The platelet function for primary hemostasis was measured by the PFA-100 analyzer (Dade Behring, Milton Keynes, UK) with a collagen/epinephrine cartridge (EPI) and then with a collagen/ADP cartridge (ADP). Percentage of CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells was analyzed by flow cytometry (EPICS Elite ESP; Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA). Serum vials for analysis of cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-α were separated and kept at 2–8°C and measured in 24 hours. For quantitative detection of cytokine, OX40 ligand, and G-CSF, enzyme immunoassays were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit commercially available from R&amp;D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Microcirculation was analyzed by a Laser Doppler Perfusion Monitor (DRT4; Moor Instruments Ltd, Axminster, UK) of up to 4 external analogue signals using an internal 4-channel 12-bit analogue to digital converter.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Surgical trauma could induce a general inflammatory response associated with a stimulation of the innate immune system and a depression of cell-mediated immunity. Moreover, perioperative lipid supplement for those who have undergone a major operation with temporary gut dysfunction may aggravate this disarrangement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0884533611429796">14</xref></sup> A meta-analysis using data from both surgical and critically ill patients suggested that the use of conventional lipid emulsions with the major component of ω-6 PUFA is associated with higher complication rates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0884533611429796">15</xref></sup> The free fatty acids serving as precursors for lipid mediator pathways are, therefore, available in excess, producing the subsequent unwanted immunological and inflammatory effects relating to the generation of oxygen radicals, cell motility, control of organ perfusion, reaction to ischemia/reperfusion injury, and apoptosis. An overwhelming proinflammatory state may ultimately lead to organ dysfunction and multiorgan failure.</p>
<p>The hyperinflammatory state may be regulated by substrate availability. The immunomodulation of ω-3 fatty acids in contrast to the ω-6 fatty acids is recognized for the ability to modify leukocyte activity, alter lipid-mediator generation, and modulate cytokine release.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0884533611429796">16</xref></sup> Intravenous infusion of fish oil rapidly leads to an incorporation of ω-3 fatty acids in leukocyte cell membrane phospholipids, leading to a reduced production of proinflammatory cytokines because of a higher ratio of ω-3 to ω-6 fatty acids.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0884533611429796">17</xref></sup> EPA and DHA compete with AA in the cyclooxygenase and 5-lipoxygenase pathways, in favor of the generation of corresponding triene prostanoids (eg, PGE3, PGI3, TXA3) and pentaene leukotriene (LTB5) derived from EPA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0884533611429796">18</xref></sup> Leukotrienes have numerous effects on inflammatory and immune functions, such as leukocyte-endothelial interaction, lymphocyte proliferation, and induction of cytokine gene expression (eg, IL-1, IL-6, or TNF-α). Recently, novel ω-3 fatty acid–derived products of neutrophil-endothelial interaction, which are exclusively formed by dioxygenation from EPA or DHA, have been identified in murine models as well as in human plasma. Named resolvins and neuroprotectins, these mediators are potently anti-inflammatory and inflammation resolving and are shown to play an important role in improving mortality in a murine model of colitis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0884533611429796">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0884533611429796">20</xref></sup> Apart from the influence through the modulation of lipid mediators, ω-3 fatty acids were reported to decrease production of inflammatory cytokines by altering the cellular signal transduction pathways, such as nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0884533611429796">16</xref></sup> Moreover, modulation of vagal tone with potential anti-inflammatory effects was demonstrated following myocardial infarction and in experimental human endotoxinemia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0884533611429796">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>Weiss et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0884533611429796">10</xref></sup> reported a significant downregulation of the proinflammatory response with decreased serum IL-6 and TNF-α in patients treated with fish oil emulsion after abdominal surgery during the perioperative period. Data in our study also indicated distinct effects of postoperative administration of ω-3 fatty acids on immunomodulation in patients who had undergone major surgery. Significantly lower serum inflammatory cytokine levels were revealed in the group with the ω-3 fatty acid supplement regarding IL-1, IL-8, and IFN-γ on POD4 and IL-1, IL-8, IFN-γ, IL-6, and TNF-α on POD7. In fact, in contrast to the elevating trend of serum IL-1, IL-8, IFN-γ, and TNF-α levels shown in the control group postoperatively, the corresponding data as well as IL-6 all showed a decrease in the group receiving ω-3 fatty acids.</p>
<p>The lower magnitude of postoperative inflammatory response to the use of ω-3 fatty acids may have a favorable impact on clinical outcomes of patients after major surgery. A large prospective, multicenter trial conducted by Wichmann et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0884533611429796">22</xref></sup> randomized the surgical patients requiring intensive care to receive 5 days of PN, including soybean oil or a mixed soybean LCT/MCT/fish oil emulsion formula. The latter group had significant increases in EPA, LTB5 production, and antioxidants, as well as significantly shorter lengths of hospital stay. A lower tendency of a postoperative infection rate was also observed in the SICU patients with the ω-3 fatty acid supplement in this study. Mayer et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0884533611429796">18</xref></sup> displayed a significant improvement in neutrophil function in patients receiving ω-3 fatty acids, including leukotriene generation and respiratory burst. Liang et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0884533611429796">9</xref></sup> also showed decreased IL-6, elevated CD4+/CD8+ ratio, and higher CD3+ and CD4+ lymphocyte percentage in colorectal cancer patients receiving postoperative ω-3 fatty acid–supplemented PN. These findings suggest that supplementation of ω-3 fatty acids may support immunocompetent cells under inflammatory conditions such as surgical trauma.</p>
<p>Heller et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0884533611429796">23</xref></sup> demonstrated that no coagulation and platelet abnormalities were evoked by fish oil supplementation as high as 0.2 g/kg/d for 5 postoperative days. Improved gas exchange as well as inflammatory cytokine modification was displayed by Barbosa et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0884533611429796">24</xref></sup> by including fish oil for septic ICU patients. Improved liver and pancreas function parameters were also observed in postoperative cancer patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0884533611429796">25</xref></sup> Interestingly, fish oil–derived emulsions have been reported to prevent PN–associated liver disease (PNALD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0884533611429796">26</xref></sup> and treat essential fatty acid deficiency.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0884533611429796">27</xref></sup> Our study presented a similar result for the safety of a postoperative ω-3 fatty acids supplement regarding the coagulation profile, plasma lipid profile, and direct adverse event. In addition, a lower tendency of postoperative liver dysfunction was also observed in the group receiving ω-3 fatty acids. Mortality is such a rare event in elective postoperative patients that changes in its rate remain statistically undetectable, particularly when the case number is limited. In a large retrospective evaluation based on 249 ICU patients elected for major abdominal surgery, Tsekos et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0884533611429796">28</xref></sup> showed a significantly decreased mortality rate, as well as a significantly shorter hospital stay, in patients receiving pre- and postoperative fish oil supplements compared with standard PN.</p>
<p>Conversely, Friesecke et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0884533611429796">12</xref></sup> reported that use of a mixed soybean LCT/MCT/fish oil lipid emulsion in the ICU had no effect on inflammatory markers or clinical outcomes, including infections, ventilation requirement, or ICU or hospital stay, when compared with MCT/LCT without fish oil. Makay et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0884533611429796">29</xref></sup> also failed to show significant differences in biochemical parameters, complications, length of hospital stay, or mortality between groups of gastric cancer patients receiving postoperative PN supplemented with a combination of ω-6 and ω-3 fatty acids or ω-6 fatty acid for 5 days. Moreover, a prospective randomized study on 60 patients conducted by Schauder et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0884533611429796">30</xref></sup> demonstrated that administration of 0.2 g/kg/d fish oil after a moderate surgical stress was not immunosuppressive but enhanced production of IFN-γ, TNF-α, and possibly IL-2. Chen et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0884533611429796">31</xref></sup> also observed a trend of an increased risk of complications and a poorer outcome when ω-3 fatty acid–enriched PN was applied postoperatively for colorectal cancer patients. The inconsistent data may be because of the heterogeneity of the study designs and patient populations with different metabolic stress.</p>
<p>In our pilot study, the sample size was limited, so we applied the nonparametric methods instead. Further studies, based on a large sample size and randomized controlled trial, are warranted.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this study convincingly demonstrates that postoperative supplementation of parenteral ω-3 fatty acids is safe and provides clinical benefits on SICU patients compared with only a mixed lipid emulsion of MCT/LCT. The hyperinflammatory response after major surgery is significantly decreased with less production of endogenous cytokines. A lower tendency of liver dysfunction and postoperative infection rate is presented.</p>
