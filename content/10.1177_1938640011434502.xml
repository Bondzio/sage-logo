<p>Diabetic neuropathies (DN) are a diverse class of nerve disorders affecting both the autonomic and somatic nervous systems. Peripheral neuropathy is a common complication of diabetes mellitus (DM) with a prevalence ranging from 19% to 51%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1938640011434502">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1938640011434502">2</xref></sup> Up to half of these patients may be asymptomatic, placing them at high risk for foot and ankle pathology due to lack of protective sensation, motor impairment, or autonomic dysfunction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1938640011434502">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Diabetic neuropathy negatively affects quality of life causing numbness, pain, and inability to sense heat or cold. Moreover, DN is an independent risk factor for limb-threatening complications such as postoperative infection, foot ulceration, and failure of ankle fracture repair.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1938640011434502">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1938640011434502">6</xref></sup> It is essential to identify which patients have DN since this complication is associated with poor outcomes in patients undergoing foot and ankle surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1938640011434502">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1938640011434502">7</xref></sup> The aim of this prospective study was to determine the prevalence of neuropathy in diabetic patients who undergo surgery for foot or ankle pathology.

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>Institutional review board approval was obtained prior to beginning this prospective study and a comprehensive foot and ankle registry was created. Our study included any patient who was 18 years or older who underwent foot and ankle surgery by a single surgeon. All patients were enrolled prior to undergoing foot and ankle surgery, specifically during their preoperative evaluation with the attending surgeon. During a consecutive 42-month period, patient data were prospectively entered for 2503 consecutive surgeries which were performed on 1859 patients. During this 3.5-year study period, 644 patients underwent more than 1 surgery. For purposes of analysis, only data collected from each subject’s first procedure was used in this study. Among the subjects, 394 had been previously diagnosed with DM, and the remaining 1465 did not have DM. Prior to surgery, all patients were screened for peripheral neuropathy during the preoperative office visits. The following data were included for each subject: age, gender, presence or absence of DM, type of DM (type I or II), presence of comorbidities such as peripheral arterial disease (PAD), neuropathy, tobacco use, history of organ transplantation, and history of foot ulceration. Preoperative serum glucose and creatinine were recorded for all patients. Those patients with a diagnosis of DM or peripheral neuropathy without a history of DM also had measurement of glycohemoglobin levels. The diagnosis of DM was made based on the history during the preoperative evaluation, and all patients with that diagnosis were receiving oral agents, insulin, or combination therapy.</p>
<p>As a routine part of our academic teaching practice, all patients (both those with and without DM) had both feet examined for neurovascular abnormalities. Patients were diagnosed to have peripheral neuropathy using the Michigan Neuropathy Screening Index (MNSI). This validated instrument relies on Semmes–Weinstein monofilament, vibration testing with the 128-Hz tuning fork, assessment of Achilles reflex, presence or absence of ulceration, and the presence or absence of deformity (claw toes, Charcot’s neuroarthropathy [CN]). Diabetic neuropathy was confirmed in patients by a quantitative neurological examination coupled with nerve conduction studies in the original study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1938640011434502">8</xref></sup> Four plantar sites (the first and fifth metatarsal heads, plantar hallux, and heel) were tested with the 5.07 Semmes–Weinstein monofilament. These 4 sites represented a slight modification from the original description of the MNSI. Patients who could sense all 4 sites with their eyes closed received a score of 0 for each foot. Patients who were unable to sense the monofilament in 1 of the 4 sites received a score of 0.5 per foot. Patients who were unable to sense 2 or more of the 4 sites received a score of 1.0 per foot. Vibratory sensation was evaluated with the 128-Hz tuning fork at the dorsal hallux. If the patients could feel the vibration consistent with the duration that the examiner felt while holding the tuning fork, a score of 0 was given for each foot. Those patients who initially felt the vibration but were unable to sense it after 5 seconds of dampening received a score of 0.5 for each foot. Those patients who were unable to sense the tuning fork at all or noted absence within 5 seconds were given a score of 1.0 for each foot. Achilles reflexes were evaluated in a standard musculoskeletal manner.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1938640011434502">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1938640011434502">9</xref></sup> An intact reflex without re-enforcement was scored as 0, a reflex that was present with re-enforcement was scored as 0.5 and absent reflex as 1.0. If a foot ulcer was present, a score of 1.0 was given and a 0 was scored if no ulcer was present. For the purposes of this study, we defined neuropathic deformity as multiple claw toes involving both feet and or the presence of CN. Claw toes and CN were evaluated both clinically and radiographically. The presence of a deformity was scored as 1.0 and the absence of deformity as 0. The maximum score per foot was 5 and the combined maximum total score of both feet was 10. In the very rare patient with an amputation, we assessed the remaining foot and doubled this to estimate the MNSI. Peripheral neuropathy was defined as a MNSI score &gt;2.0.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1938640011434502">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1938640011434502">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>The peripheral vascular examination included palpation of the dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses, and each pulse was defined as present or absent. If all 4 pedal pulses were palpable, no further evaluation took place unless the patient had previously undergone revascularization of the lower extremity. Patients with an abnormal examination were sent for noninvasive arterial studies. Peripheral arterial disease was defined as an ankle–brachial index (ABI) &lt;0.9. Those patients whose ABI was &gt;1.3 were also diagnosed to have PAD if the pulse volume recording waveforms were monophasic.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1938640011434502">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Pearson χ<sup>2</sup> tests and univariate logistic regression were used to analyze dichotomous variables and Student <italic>t</italic> tests with equal variance were used to determine significant differences of the means of normally distributed continuous variables (ie, age) between groups. Statistical significance was taken at an α = .05 (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The overall prevalence of neuropathy in this cohort of surgical patients was 25.6% (476 of 1859 patients). The prevalence of neuropathy in patients with and without DM was 77.2% (304 of 394 patients) and 11.7% (172 of 1465 patients), respectively. The etiology of neuropathy in the 172 patients without DM included alcohol abuse, immune-mediated neuropathy, chemotherapy-induced neuropathy, demyelinating peripheral neuropathy, idiopathic neuropathy, steroid-induced neuropathy, and Parkinson’s disease. The nondiabetic neuropathic patients had been evaluated by their primary care physicians and/or neurologists and carefully screened for DM. The mean hemoglobin A1c level in nondiabetic neuropathic patients was 6.0% and was lower than mean of 7.6% in patients with DM. The 394 surgical procedures in diabetic patients included elective reconstructive surgery in 268 patients (68%) and treatment for soft tissue infection or osteomyelitis in 126 patients (32%). Peripheral neuropathy was identified in 178 of the 268 patients (66%) who underwent elective reconstructive surgery.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>As hypothesized, this study found that the prevalence of DN was higher in patients undergoing foot and ankle surgery compared with the reported general diabetic population. Using a validated screening instrument for identifying DN, we identified a prevalence of 77%, indicating that nearly 4 out of 5 diabetic patients undergoing surgery had neuropathy. The MNSI is a simple, reproducible method that does not require sophisticated equipment. Preoperative identification of peripheral neuropathy allows surgeons to appropriately educate the patient and stratify surgical risks, because neuropathy is negatively associated with outcomes in patients undergoing foot and ankle surgery. Wukich et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1938640011434502">7</xref></sup> demonstrated with multivariate analysis that peripheral neuropathy increased the risk of a postoperative infection by a factor of 4 in a large retrospective study of foot and ankle surgical patients. That study also reported that the presence of complicated DM (ie, neuropathy, PAD, or nephropathy) increased the risk of postoperative infection by a factor of 10 compared with the risk for patients without DM and by a factor of 6 compared with the risk for patients with uncomplicated DM.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1938640011434502">7</xref></sup> The findings of this retrospective study was comfirmed in a prospective study by the same authors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1938640011434502">6</xref></sup> The presence of peripheral neuropathy in diabetic patients is associated with more overall complications, a higher rate of deep infection, more aggregate noninfectious complications, and an increased rate of revision surgery in patients undergoing ankle fracture repair when compared with diabetic patients without peripheral neuropathy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1938640011434502">5</xref></sup> In a controlled study of diabetic patients undergoing arthrodesis surgery of the foot and ankle, peripheral neuropathy increased the risk of a postoperative complication by 164%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1938640011434502">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is not surprising that patients with DN had higher creatinine levels, higher prevalence of PAD, higher rates of foot ulceration, higher rates of preoperative infection, and were more likely to have undergone solid organ transplantation. These chronic complications of DM usually involve microangiopathy, a pathological process that is implicated in the development of neuropathy, atherosclerosis and nephropathy. Optimal short- and long-term glycemic management is critical in avoiding the complications of diabetes, so it is not surprising that patients with DN had higher fasting serum glucose on the day of surgery and higher hemoglobin A1c levels. This study demonstrated that patients with DN were more likely to use tobacco and have a longer smoking pack year history than patients without DN. Because of such a high prevalence of DN in patients with undergoing foot or ankle surgery, the findings of this study are especially relevant in the current health care climate. Preoperative identification of neuropathy can assist surgeons in appropriate informed consent since infectious and noninfectious complications are more likely in neuropathic patients. During the preoperative evaluation, certain factors such as male gender, history of foot infection, PAD, and organ transplantation should heighten the suspicion for previously unrecognized DN.</p>
<p>Postoperative complications, such as surgical site infections, are publicly reported in many geographic areas to allow comparisons among providers and to encourage improvement in outcomes. Hospitals no longer receive additional reimbursement from government payers such as Medicare and Medicaid for surgical site infections after certain procedures. Patients, insurance companies, and medical facilities are increasingly aware of what is thought to be a potentially preventable complication, and it is important to be able identify high-risk patients if meaningful scrutiny of outcomes is to be done by nonphysicians. There is an increasing body of literature reporting that DN is associated with higher complication rates after surgery although the mechanism by which this occurs is not clear. Possible mechanisms by which neuropathy is associated with adverse surgical events may be related to reduced amounts of neuropeptides or failure in surface receptors for advanced glycosylation end products.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1938640011434502">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1938640011434502">14</xref></sup> Surgeons who treat these complicated patients will experience higher rates of adverse postoperative outcomes; however, these outcomes should not be viewed in the same context as the outcomes of patients without complications of DM. Diabetes is growing at an alarming rate, and it is currently estimated that nearly 26 million patients in the United States have DM.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1938640011434502">15</xref></sup> Foot and ankle surgeons are more likely to be exposed to these high-risk patients because of high prevalence of foot and ankle pathology encountered by diabetic and elderly patients. A limitation of this study is the relatively small number of diabetic patients reported in this study, particularly in the group without DN. Nonetheless, this study evaluated nearly 400 consecutive diabetic patients with a thorough preoperative neurological examination. Previous studies have relied on the absence of sensation with the Semmes–Weinstein monofilament as the criteria for neuropathy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1938640011434502">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1938640011434502">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1938640011434502">16</xref></sup> Clearly, this would vastly underestimate the prevalence of neuropathy because loss of protective sensation is a relatively late finding. Combining more than one of the simple screening tests (monofilament, vibration and reflexes) improves the sensitivity of in detecting diabetic neuropathy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1938640011434502">17</xref></sup> Other screening tests are also validated in identifying DN, and the specific method of diagnosing neuropathy should be at the discretion of the individual surgeon.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1938640011434502">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1938640011434502">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>Even well-designed prospective studies are subject to bias. Prospective studies such as this rely on the competence of the examiner, and the data obtained for analysis are only as good as the physical examiner. We have attempted to minimize measurement bias by following a consistent preoperative neurological evaluation by a single experienced foot and ankle surgeon. Nonresponder bias has been minimized because of the fact that this was a consecutive series of patients, and no patients were eliminated during the study period. Our primary outcome measure (prevalence of DN) was assessed consistently in each patient, and interviewer bias is potentially present since the primary investigator determined the primary outcome. Another potential limitation of this study concerns the population of diabetic patients treated by the senior author. The nature of this particular practice is a large academic referral practice and may not mirror a general foot and ankle practice. Consequently, the prevalence of neuropathy in this cohort of patients may be higher than seen by community-based surgeons. This would be analogous to the findings of the probe to bone test for diabetic osteomyelitis. Grayson et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1938640011434502">21</xref></sup> found a much higher positive predictive value of probing to bone than Lavery et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1938640011434502">22</xref></sup> largely because of the population of patients studied. The patients in the study by Grayson et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1938640011434502">21</xref></sup> had a much higher prevalence of osteomyelitis than those in the study by Lavery et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1938640011434502">22</xref></sup> (66% vs 12%, respectively).</p>
<p>In summary, nearly 80% of diabetic patients undergoing foot and ankle surgery at a large academic medical center had DN. When excluding those patients with infections, we found that the prevalence of DN was still quite high (66%) in patients undergoing elective reconstructive surgery. Preoperative recognition of this morbid complication of DM is important to appropriate stratify those diabetic patients into a high-risk category.</p>
