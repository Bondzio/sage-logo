<abstract>
<p>The combination of gasoline direct injection and turbocharging is a promising method to reduce the fuel consumption of internal combustion engines through engine downsizing, which leads to increased engine efficiencies and a reduction of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions at a comparable power output. Spray-guided direct injection allows overall lean and unthrottled operation, which is realized with a highly stratified mixture at part load. However, exhaust gas aftertreatment with conventional three-way catalysts is currently not possible. Furthermore, insufficient mixture preparation, especially at the upper load limit of stratified charge operation, causes increased particulate matter emissions. This paper discusses the advantages of engine downsizing, by gasoline direct injection in combination with turbocharging, to reduce fuel consumption and presents the results of experimental and numerical investigations of stratified exhaust gas recirculation in a single-cylinder gasoline engine to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions. The radial exhaust gas stratification was achieved by a spatial and temporal separated induction of exhaust gas and fresh air, performed by specially shaped baffles and impulse charge valves in the inlet port. The thermodynamic and optical investigations with injection pressures up to 1000 bar demonstrate the capability to reduce soot emissions in a spray-guided direct-injection engine.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Improvement of efficiency is more than ever before the focus of current research and development activities, not only in research institutions, but also in industry. Increasing engine efficiency, hence reducing the fuel consumption in addition to reducing the driving resistance, is the only way to reduce the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of cars and other transportation vehicles driven by internal combustion engines. Although the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions caused by road traffic are responsible for 20% of the overall CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in Germany,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1468087412451695">1</xref></sup> a comprehensive reduction of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions requires a reduction in all relevant areas. In view of the different fuel qualities, two concepts found their way into modern vehicles for worldwide application. One is the concept of downsizing where high specific power is achieved by boosting. To maximize the driving response, these engines are increasingly equipped with direct fuel injection and homogeneous mixture distribution. The second concept is high efficiency achieved by reducing friction and pumping losses. Direct fuel injection with stratified mixture distribution is one of the single measures offering the highest potential to increase engine efficiency. The combination with turbocharging has even higher potential to further reduce fuel consumption, but has high demands on mixture preparation and in-cylinder flow. This technology is presently the focus of research and development activities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1468087412451695">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1468087412451695">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1468087412451695">7</xref></sup> Future concepts to increase engine efficiency will combine different technologies such as direct fuel injection, boosting and variable valve actuation.</p>
<p>The spark-ignition (SI) engine with direct injection (DISI) represents a combination of the combustion phenomena of both SI (Otto) and compression ignition (diesel) engines and should, in principle, be able to combine the advantages of both engine concepts. In particular, at part load operating conditions, unthrottled operation with stratified charge and a lean mixture offers similar fuel economy to that of compression ignition engines. The improvement in fuel consumption results from reduced gas exchange losses due to dethrottling and increased thermal efficiency due to lean combustion. In addition to these advantages at part load operation, the mixture preparation procedure and combustion characteristics of a DISI engine provide better knocking characteristics than those of a conventional SI engine with port fuel injection (PFI). This allows the compression ratio of the DISI engine to be increased.</p>
<p>The volumetric efficiency can be further improved beyond that of PFI engines because of the faster and more rapid fuel spray vaporization during the intake stroke, the accompanying decrease in charge temperature, and the increased pressure differences across the intake valves during the intake stroke. Therefore, at full load operation, the DISI engine offers higher power output than the equivalent conventional PFI engine. Currently, gasoline direct injection with stratified mixture preparation and unthrottled engine operation at part load and downsizing, in combination with turbocharging, offers the best promise to become the SI engine concept with the highest possible engine efficiency. However, due to the very complex mixture preparation and combustion processes with turbocharging and stratified mixture at part load conditions, such an engine concept has not reached the market yet.</p>
<p>Gasoline engines with stratified lean mixture require exhaust gas aftertreatment systems that are able to reduce nitrogen oxide (NO<sub>X</sub>) emissions under lean conditions and particulates due to the highly inhomogeneous mixture. Reducing both emission components with aftertreatment systems has a negative impact on fuel consumption. Thus, reducing these emissions can also be considered as an equivalent measure to increase engine efficiency.</p>

<title>Concepts of downsizing</title>
<p>Downsizing is defined as a reduction of the total swept volume of an engine in combination with an increase in specific power to keep the power output at a constant level. Due to the decrease in power output caused by the reduction of engine swept volume, downsized engines are usually turbocharged to compensate for the loss of power output. Since the beginning of the development of internal combustion engines, downsizing at constant power and thereby increasing of the specific power has been an important goal. In general, downsized engines are defined as engines that show distinctly higher brake mean effective pressure (BMEP) and distinctly higher specific power than the average BMEP and specific power of the engines currently on the market.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1468087412451695">Figure 1</xref> shows the BMEP of present SI engines for passenger cars.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1468087412451695">4</xref></sup> While naturally aspirated engines have BMEP values below 15 bar, the BMEP of boosted engines goes up to 20 bar, while high-load engine concepts with more than 20 bar BMEP represent downsizing concepts with either turbocharging or supercharging. Gasoline engines with maximum engine speeds higher than 7000 r/min are defined as high-speed concepts.</p>

<p>The concept of downsizing allows the design of compact combustion engines that are comparable in their power output to naturally aspirated engines with considerably larger displacements. In comparison to conventional naturally aspirated engines, a fuel consumption reduction of 10% and more can be expected in the regulated test driving cycles as well as during real traffic driving. Downsizing concepts are characterized by high specific power output in combination with low fuel consumption.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1468087412451695">Figure 2</xref> explains the concept of downsizing. A reduction of engine displacement from a six-cylinder naturally aspirated engine to a four-cylinder naturally aspirated engine results in a loss of both power output and torque, while the fuel consumption will be reduced due to the smaller number of cylinders. However, to keep the power output and the torque at the same level as the six-cylinder engine, the smaller four-cylinder engine requires charging of the intake air. With a certain level of either supercharging or turbocharging, or both, the six-cylinder naturally aspirated engine can be replaced by a six-cylinder boosted engine.</p>

</fig>
<p>Due to the higher specific power output of downsized engines, it is possible to modify the overall transmission ratio, yielding to a shift of the engine operating point towards lower engine speeds. This is commonly defined as downspeeding, which is generally combined with the downsizing concept.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1468087412451695">Figure 3</xref> shows both the effect of an increase of specific power by downsizing and the effect of reduced engine speed by downspeeding on the fuel consumption engine map. By replacing the larger naturally aspirated engine with a smaller turbocharged engine, the maximum BMEP (BMEPmax) increases distinctly. For a certain road load at an engine speed of 3000 r/min, the BMEP (point A) can be shifted to a higher operating point with better fuel efficiency (point B). The decrease in engine speed from 3000 r/min to 2550 r/min results in a further shift to more fuel-efficient operation (point C). The overall reduction of fuel consumption is about 15%, which also means 15% lower CO<sub>2</sub> emissions than the naturally aspirated engine.</p>

</fig>
<p>The differences between the operating points A and C with respect to the maximum specific power outputs for the related engine speeds (line a; line b) represent the acceleration characteristics of the two engine types. If these two lines had the same lengths from the two different operating points A and C to the two different maximum specific power outputs, the acceleration characteristic would be the same for both cases. Due to the longer line b compared to line a, the acceleration behaviour and, respectively, the driving behaviour of the downsized turbocharged engine is distinctly better than that of the naturally aspirated engine. Due to these advantages, some engines have been introduced in recent years that utilize the benefits of both engine downsizing and engine downspeeding.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1468087412451695">
<title>Current SI engines with direct injection</title>
<p>One of the first downsized gasoline engines with direct injection on the market is the Volkswagen 1.4 l TSI engine, which is equipped with both a supercharger for the low engine speed range up to 2500 r/min and a turbocharger for the higher engine speed range. The fuel injector is located in the cylinder head below the intake ports, and the spark plug is located in the centre of the cylinder head between the intake and exhaust valves. Due to the homogeneous mixture formation for the entire engine operating range, this wide spacing arrangement of injector and spark plug is achievable.</p>
<p>In addition to the turbocharged and supercharged SI engines with direct injection and a homogeneous mixture, there are also some gasoline direct-injection engines from BMW and Mercedes-Benz with stratified mixture preparation and lean combustion. These engines operate with a so-called spray-guided fuel injection strategy and two different methods of mixture preparation. At part load, the injection takes place during the compression stroke at a late phase of compression shortly before ignition. At higher loads, up to full load, fuel injection takes place during the intake stroke to allow time for the formation of a homogeneous mixture.</p>
<p>The injection of the fuel for mixture stratification at the end of the compression stroke requires a complex injection strategy to avoid problems with spark plug fouling and deposits on the combustion chamber walls and the injector itself, as well as to generate a stratified mixture cloud that is compact and in sufficient proximity to the spark plug at the time of ignition. Engines that are presently in production are generally equipped with outward-opening piezo injectors operating at injection pressures up to 200 bar.</p>
<p>For future applications of gasoline direct injection with a spray-guided fuel injection system, a large potential exists to significantly reduce fuel consumption and exhaust emissions. For this purpose, extensive research for optimizing fuel injection, mixture preparation and combustion is necessary. This research work should include investigations of fuel spray, vaporization of fuel and mixing processes, ignition and flame propagation, combustion, and formation of pollutants during the engine process. In addition, the fuel pressure and injection pressure should be increased substantially compared to the fuel pressure of present gasoline injection systems.</p>
<p>Combining either supercharging or turbocharging and stratification of the charge by spray-guided fuel injection provides the capability for further improvements in process efficiency and additional reduction of fuel consumption. With turbocharging, it is possible to increase the air–fuel ratio, thus improving the thermal efficiency of the combustion process. Turbocharging and the associated greater mass of air in the combustion chamber can yield an extension of the load range with stratified charge operation in the engine operation map. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1468087412451695">Figure 4</xref> shows how fuel economy can be improved by supercharging or turbocharging compared to the naturally aspirated mode.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1468087412451695">8</xref></sup></p>

<title>Extending stratified operation range by boosting</title>
<p>Due to the limited air-intake mass of naturally aspirated engines, the highly efficient stratified operation is applicable only at low loads. Boosting enables an increase of the air-intake mass and therefore the air–fuel ratio, so that stratified operation can be extended to higher loads. Hence, low fuel consumption can be achieved over a larger area of the engine map. Furthermore, in the conventional stratified operation range, fuel consumption can be reduced at higher thermal efficiencies by increasing the air–fuel ratio, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1468087412451695">Figure 5</xref>.</p>

<p>The investigations were performed at different part load operation points at an engine speed of 2000 r/min with a production multi-hole high-pressure injection valve (HDEV 1.2) from Bosch with an optimized spray pattern for spray-guided operation. The injection pressure was held constant at 200 bar and premium gasoline with a research octane number of 95 was used.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1468087412451695">Figure 7</xref> shows indicated specific fuel consumption (ISFC) and the standard deviation of the net IMEP (σ<sub>IMEP</sub>) for different IMEP and boost rate π at 2000 r/min. At naturally aspirated operation, which corresponds to π = 1, the engine can be operated in stratified mode up to IMEP = 6 bar. A further increase of load leads to misfires, which is seen at high σ<sub>IMEP</sub> values. With a boost rate of π = 1.1, stratified engine operation without misfires can be extended to IMEP = 8 bar.</p>

<p>Although high boost rates cause high turbulence intensity in the cylinder according to Golloch<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1468087412451695">5</xref></sup> the cyclic combustion fluctuations are on a low level (σ<sub>IMEP</sub> &lt; 0.15 bar). The results show that fuel consumption decreases significantly with increasing boost rates for all loads. For example, at IMEP = 3 bar, the ISFC is reduced by about 18.2% from 237 g/kWh at natural aspirated operation to 194 g/kWh at a boost rate of π = 1.4. This significant reduction in fuel consumption is mainly caused by the reduced charge-cycle losses. However, the required energy for a compressor is not taken into account. An estimation of power required for supercharging and the impact on fuel consumption was described by Kneifel et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1468087412451695">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Besides the charge cycle, the combustion characteristics are improved with increasing boost rate. This can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1468087412451695">Figure 8</xref> at different mass fraction burned (MFB) values. In comparison to natural aspirated operation (π = 1) both the inflammation delay (ignition to 5% MFB) and the combustion duration (5% MFB to 90% MFB) are reduced in the boosted cases. Boosting has mainly two effects on the in-cylinder flow and thermodynamic conditions.</p>

</fig>
<p>The cylinder pressure, the flow intensity and the turbulence levels all increase. This affects the injected spray by reducing its penetration length and by accelerating the droplet evaporation process. The early inflammation process is improved and near-wall combustion is reduced as well as cylinder wall wetting. Furthermore, combustion is accelerated by the turbulent flow conditions. With the reduction of combustion duration, the combustion efficiency increases. The air–fuel ratio increases from λ = 2.2 at π = 1 to λ = 4 at π = 1.4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1468087412451695">Figure 8</xref>). As a result, the thermal efficiency increases with λ, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1468087412451695">Figure 5</xref>.</p>
<p>Under lean conditions, NO<sub>x</sub> formation mainly depends on the combustion temperature, which is affected by the intake temperature. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1468087412451695">Figure 9</xref> shows the indicated specific NO<sub>x</sub> (ISNO<sub>x</sub>) emissions for different boost rates and loads. At loads above IMEP = 3 bar, an intercooler has kept the intake temperature constant at 25°C. At IMEP = 3 bar, it was deactivated so that the intake temperature increases with boost rate.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1468087412451695-fig9.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Due to the increasing intake temperature at IMEP = 3 bar, NO<sub>x</sub> emissions increase with boost rate, as can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1468087412451695">Figure 9</xref>. At the other loads with constant intake temperature, the NO<sub>x</sub> emissions remain constant, or even decrease with boost rate. This results in higher in-cylinder air mass, leading to an increase of the in-cylinder heat capacity and hence to lower combustion temperatures for increasing boost rate. At IMEP = 5 bar and IMEP = 6 bar, the NO<sub>x</sub> emissions in comparison to natural aspirated operation are reduced by about 36.5% and 28.4%, respectively, with the boost rate π = 1.4. At higher loads (IMEP = 7 bar to IMEP = 8 bar), the influence of the boost rate on the NO<sub>x</sub> emissions is very low.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1468087412451695">Figure 9</xref> also shows the filter smoke number (FSN) for different loads and boost rates. Due to the short time provided for the mixture process at spray-guided operation, soot formation may occur due to the interaction of the liquid fuel with the combustion flame. At natural aspirated engines at higher loads, the fuel mass increases and with it the overall and local air–fuel ratios decrease, leading to high soot emissions. With increasing boost rate, the overall and local air–fuel ratios increase and very low soot emissions are achieved, especially at high boost rates. In addition, the shorter penetration length of the sprays reduces fuel–wall interactions. Furthermore, the mixture process is supported by the higher in-cylinder flow intensity and turbulence levels in the boosted cases so that soot formation decreases.</p>

<title>Measures for reducing emissions of lean combustion concepts</title>
<p>One limiting factor for the operation of stratified charge engines is the time necessary for injecting the required fuel mass at higher loads. In particular, with multi-hole injectors, insufficient charge stratification is achieved.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1468087412451695">10</xref></sup> Long injection duration, combined with deep penetration of the fuel into the combustion chamber and a slow rate of vaporization, leads to locally increased air–fuel ratios and, as a result, longer burn duration and increased hydrocarbon (HC), carbon monoxide and soot emissions.</p>
<p>Moreover, currently used exhaust gas aftertreatment with conventional three-way catalysts is not possible due to the presence of O<sub>2</sub> in the exhaust gas. Therefore, lean NO<sub>X</sub> catalysts are needed to satisfy future emission limits, although they reduce the gains in fuel efficiency. The NO<sub>X</sub> raw emissions have to be reduced to decrease the regeneration phases that are responsible for the decrease in efficiency.</p>

These conditions are prerequisites for a reliable mixture preparation at the end of the compression stroke.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1468087412451695">13</xref></sup> Arcoumanis and Kamimoto<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468087412451695">14</xref></sup> and Mitroglou et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1468087412451695">15</xref></sup> give a brief overview of the advantages and disadvantages of different injector designs.</p>
<p>On the contrary, DISI engines that operate homogeneously are typically equipped with multi-hole solenoid or swirl injectors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1468087412451695">16</xref></sup> In comparison to a piezo injector, these injectors exhibit lower flow rates. The result of the lower flow rates is a longer required injection duration to inject the necessary fuel mass into the combustion chamber, especially at high loads. The effect is deeper penetration of the fuel into the combustion chamber. In combination with slower vaporization, caused by the larger droplets,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1468087412451695">17</xref></sup> this leads to a spatially spread and comparatively leaner stratification. Therefore, burn duration and HC and soot emissions are increased. A promising approach to improve the mixture preparation as well as the subsequent combustion using a multi-hole injector is to increase the injection pressure and, therefore, the obtainable flow rate.</p>
<p>Investigations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1468087412451695">18</xref></sup> using the same Rotax Engine as in the previous section show the improvements of higher injection pressures in naturally aspirated and stratified operation mode. For injection pressures up to 1000 bar, a common-rail solenoid diesel injector (CRI1) from Bosch and Eurosuper without additional lubricants were used. The tip of this injector was modified to have the same spray pattern as the baseline HDEV 1.2.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1468087412451695">7</xref></sup> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1468087412451695">Figure 10</xref> shows the spray pattern generated from six nozzle holes that are positioned around the spark plug.</p>

The ISFC is not significantly affected by increasing the pressure in the fuel rail. Starting at an ISFC of 233 g/kWh at 200 bar injection pressure, only a minute reduction to 231 g/kWh is observed at 1000 bar.

<p>Soot emissions were measured with two analysers operating on a different measurement principle. As a standard, the AVL 415s smoke meter is used. To detect low soot emissions more sensitively, the AVL 483 micro soot sensor was added. Due to its photoacoustic measurement principle, it is possible, using this sensor, to detect the lowest levels of elementary carbon quantities continuously. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-1468087412451695">Figure 12</xref>, the results of both systems are shown. A steep reduction in soot emissions is observed with both systems between 200 and 500 bar. Starting with an FSN = 0.145 at 200 bar, it drops to FSN = 0.017 at 500 bar. At the injection pressures of 750 and 1000 bar, no soot emissions are observed. The much higher soot emissions at 200 bar are caused by the deeper penetration of the spray into the combustion chamber due to the longer injection duration. This leads to piston wetting, which was identified by Velji et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1468087412451695">19</xref></sup> to be responsible for increased soot emissions.</p>

<p>The impact of increasing injection pressure on indicated specific HC emissions (ISHC) and NO<sub>x</sub> emissions is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-1468087412451695">Figure 13</xref>. In both cases, a reduction in emissions with increasing injection pressure is observed. While the reduction in NO<sub>x</sub> emissions is linear from 10 g/kWh at 200 bar down to 8.7 g/kWh at 1000 bar, the HC emissions show a steeper reduction between 200 and 500 bar. Starting at 6 g/kWh at 200 bar, a recognizable reduction to 4 g/kWh is observed at 500 bar. This behaviour is similar to the observed variation of soot concentration and points to piston wetting, as already mentioned in the discussion of soot emissions. By increasing the fuel pressure up to 1000 bar, a further reduction to 2.8 g/kWh is achieved.</p>

<p>To investigate the impact of the injection pressure on the particulate matter emissions, experiments using a particle sizer (TSI engine exhaust particle sizer™ 3090) were performed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1468087412451695">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>The measurements of the particle size distribution at 2000 r/min and IMEP = 6 bar show a significant dependency of both particle size and particle number on injection pressure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-1468087412451695">Figure 14</xref>). Up to a pressure of 500 bar, the total concentration decreases from 6·10<sup>6</sup> to 1.5·10<sup>6</sup> #/cm<sup>3</sup>. An increase of small particles with increasing injection pressure cannot be observed. On the contrary, high injection pressures reduce the particle number concentration over the entire size range. Hence, the maximum particle diameter (D<sub>P</sub>) decreases from 300 to 150 nm and the total concentration drops by about 88% between 200 and 1000 bar injection pressure. These results confirm the effects of the rail pressure (p<sub>Rail</sub>) on the soot emissions shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-1468087412451695">Figure 12</xref>.</p>

From IMEP = 7 bar to 8 bar, there is a sharp increase up to 4.8·10<sup>6</sup> #/cm<sup>3</sup> observed due to the combustion taking place at a very rich global air–fuel ratio of λ = 1.2 and an IMEP of 8 bar.

<p>To investigate this matter more in-depth, combustion was recorded with a high-speed Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor camera (CMOS). No filters were applied so that the complete spectrum of light could be recorded. Because of its dominant radiation, only soot is visible in the following pictures.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16-1468087412451695">Figure 16</xref> shows the progress of combustion at 200 bar in the left column and 1000 bar in the right column. Due to the earlier ignition timing of 24 crank angle degrees (°CA) before top dead centre (BTDC) at 200 bar injection pressure, the start of combustion is already visible in the first picture at 10°CA BTDC. At the same time, at 1000 bar, combustion has not started yet and only the spark is observed; combustion in this case starts 3°CA later. In the second picture, at top dead centre, combustion at 1000 bar has also started. In contrast to the 200 bar case, a very intense radiation from the centre of the combustion chamber is observed. At 200 bar injection pressure, at the same time, soot radiation is detected in the outer regions beneath the exhaust valves. At 10°CA after top dead centre (ATDC), in both cases, an increase in soot radiation is visible. At 200 bar, the origin of soot radiation remains in the outer regions of the combustion chamber, while at 1000 bar, almost the complete field of view is occupied by soot radiation. 10°CA later, at 1000 bar, soot radiation is massively reduced, where only in the central area behind the spark plug is there some radiation visible. At 200 bar, soot radiation originates primarily from two pool fires on the piston, which exist at least until 80°CA ATDC, when the piston moves out of sight. At 30°CA ATDC at 1000 bar, only weak radiation is observed.</p>

<p>These pictures imply a more compact mixture cloud. Because of the improved mixture preparation at the higher injection pressure, a relatively rich compact mixture cloud is generated. By igniting this mixture, conditions conducive to soot formation are present during combustion. Soot formation is known to occur between temperatures of 1500 K and 1900 K, at a very rich air–fuel ratio (λ &lt; 0.6), which likely occurs in the area of the spray.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1468087412451695">21</xref></sup> Because of the high combustion temperatures present, oxidation of soot is very efficient, and the majority of the soot generated seems to be oxidized.</p>
<p>As expected, the injection duration at 200 bar is longer than that at 1000 bar,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1468087412451695">10</xref></sup> and this leads to a longer mixture preparation process. As a result, the 200 bar case produces a mixture volume that takes up most of the combustion chamber. The mixture is very lean compared to the 1000 bar case, except in the areas where the spray cones are observed. This leads to a relatively lean combustion with radiation in the ultraviolet range (therefore not visible in the images) and insignificant soot formation. High soot concentrations appear primarily in the area of the spray cones and at the surface of the piston where the fuel impinges during injection. Since the pool fire at 200 bar has a longer burn duration, the relatively high amount of soot emissions measured in the exhaust is not unexpected.</p>

<title>Stratified exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) for reducing NO<sub>x</sub> emissions</title>
<p>The EGR is a very effective way to reduce combustion peak temperatures and thus the formation of NO<sub>x</sub>. The reduced combustion temperature also leads to lower wall-heat losses and hence to a higher thermal efficiency.<sup>22</sup> Adding exhaust gas also leads to higher charge-cycle efficiency due to the dethrottling of the engine at part load. This advantage of EGR cannot be fully realized with DISI engines because of the mainly unthrottled engine operation and already high charge-cycle efficiency. However, adding the inert gas to the combustion air results in a lower laminar burning rate and higher difference from the ideal constant-volume combustion. The maximum possible EGR rate is limited by high cyclic variations, misfire, the reduction of total efficiency and the increase of HC and carbon monoxide emissions. The stratified EGR is characterized by the separation of EGR and fresh air in the combustion chamber. Due to the limited exhaust gas concentration at the spark plug region, the inflammation and flame propagation are both improved compared to homogeneous EGR and, therefore, the EGR compatibility is increased. In an ideal case, completely unthrottled operation with stoichiometric air–fuel ratio and exhaust gas aftertreatment with three-way catalysts could be possible.</p>
<p>Through an external port, the exhaust gas was supplied into the right inlet port that was vertically separated by an air baffle. This air baffle in the inlet port, which reaches nearly down to the inlet valve, prevents an early mixing of air and exhaust gas. To reach the same flow structure of the fresh air through both inlet ports, another air baffle was adapted into the left inlet port. With this layout, a radial stratification can be achieved in the combustion chamber. The intake of exhaust gas and fresh air is temporally separated by impulse charge valves (ICVs), which allow high flexibility in adjusting the valve timing, short switching times and high tightness. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17-1468087412451695">Figure 17</xref> shows a computer-aided design (CAD) model of the intake system with the ICVs and the air baffles.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1468087412451695-fig17.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>During this stratification strategy, the exhaust gas first flows into the combustion chamber through the right side of the vertically sectioned right inlet port. The intake of fresh air follows the intake of the exhaust gas. The closing ramp of the impulse charge valve for the exhaust gas (ICVEG) cuts the opening ramp of the impulse charge valve for the fresh air (ICVFA), and this time determines the EGR rate. The experimentally and numerically investigated EGR rate (in one dimension) against the overlapping time of the ICVs is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig18-1468087412451695">Figure 18</xref>.</p>

</fig>
<p>The experimentally investigated engine operating behaviour against the EGR rate is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig19-1468087412451695">Figure 19</xref>. The maximum possible EGR rate increases to 39% compared to 25% with homogeneous EGR. The maximum EGR rate was defined as the percentage at which the engine first misfires. The standard deviation of the IMEP is kept under 0.3 bar until an EGR rate of 35%. At an EGR rate of 39%, the standard deviation of the IMEP remains below 0.4 bar. The ISFC increases continuously without a sharp rise. The NO<sub>X</sub> emissions are lower than 2 g/kWh at an EGR rate of 30% (equivalent to 45 ppm at this operating point). At an EGR rate of 39%, the NO<sub>X</sub> emissions are lower than 1 g/kWh (equivalent to 25 ppm at this operating point). The NO<sub>X</sub> emissions were reduced further with EGR by about 88% compared to homogeneous and by about 99% compared to the operation with no EGR. The exhaust gas temperature increases from 228°C with no EGR to 270°C at maximal EGR. To reach EGR rates higher than 25%, the pressure difference between the inlet and the exhaust port had to be sufficient. Due to the very short opening time of the ICVFA and the higher flow losses, throttling of the fresh air with a decreasing manifold air pressure would not be adequate to reach the necessary pressure difference. So the exhaust gas back pressure was increased by throttling the exhaust gas stream. This leads to higher internal residuals and hence to higher fuel consumption and higher cyclic variations of the cylinder pressure.</p>

<p>The calculated exhaust gas concentration in the combustion chamber with this strategy at a global EGR rate of approximately 37% is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig20-1468087412451695">Figure 20</xref>. The overlapping time of the closing ramp of the ICVEG and the opening ramp of the ICVFA was 150°CA ATDC. At 65°CA ATDC, the exhaust gas flows into the combustion chamber and causes a high swirl motion. At 120°CA ATDC, the recirculated exhaust gas is concentrated at the outlet side.</p>

</fig>
<p>As a result of the swirl motion, the exhaust gas flows along the combustion chamber wall. At 180°CA ATDC, when the fresh air flows into the centre of the combustion chamber, a clearly radial stratification is present, especially as the exhaust gas concentration at the outlet side decreases due to the incoming air. The exhaust gas is concentrated at the inlet side of the combustion chamber. Because of the persisting swirl motion, the exhaust gas is transported to the outlet side. At 230°CA ATDC, an exhaust gas concentration of about 5% at the spark plug region and 50% at the inlet side of the combustion chamber can be seen. At the start of ignition (SOI) (300°CA ATDC), a stratification with higher exhaust gas concentration at the combustion chamber wall and lower exhaust gas concentration at the centre of the combustion chamber is present. The concentration of the exhaust gas in the slightly off-centre spark plug region is about 10% and, near to the combustion chamber wall, about 45%.</p>

<title>Concluding remarks</title>
<p>The paper has explained different measures to directly and indirectly reduce the fuel consumption and hence the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in direct-injection gasoline engines.</p>
<p>Since today’s engines with stratified operation require expensive injection systems with piezo-actuated injectors and lean NO<sub>x</sub> traps, the actual trend in engine development is towards downsizing and downspeeding concepts with high specific power output, direct injection and homogeneous operation. As such, BMEP values of 30 bar or more are expected within the next few years. By increasing specific load and decreasing engine speed, the engine can operate in more efficient areas of the engine map in most cases. A reduction in fuel consumption by about 10 to 20% seems to be realistic.</p>
<p>The disadvantage of expensive piezo injectors and poor mixture formation in the case of stratified operation can be resolved using a multi-hole injector and considerably higher injection pressures. In the presented investigations, the fuel was injected at pressures up to 1000 bar. As a result, the injection duration decreased and the stratification and compactness of the mixture cloud was enhanced. Consequently, the soot emissions were drastically reduced and the faster mixture formation enabled extension of the stratified range to higher engine speeds. When additionally combined with boosting, the upper load limit of the stratification was shifted to an IMEP of 8 bar.</p>
<p>EGR is capable of reducing NO<sub>x</sub> emissions by decreasing combustion temperature and reducing fuel consumption by dethrottling the gas exchange during part load. However, homogeneous EGR concentrations are limited because of increasing COV of IMEP leading to misfire. In this paper, a special intake system was introduced that was able to generate high stratification of fresh air in the centre and exhaust gas in the outer region of the combustion chamber. Consequently, ignition is almost uninfluenced and an overall EGR concentration of up to 40% could be achieved. NO<sub>x</sub> emissions were reduced by 88% compared to homogeneous EGR and by 99% compared to no EGR. This approach prevents the need for a lean NO<sub>x</sub> catalyst or at least reduces regeneration intervals and, therefore, decreases the CO<sub>2</sub> output of future DISI engines.</p>
