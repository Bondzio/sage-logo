<p>Objectives: The present study examined the psychometric properties of the Chinese Virtues Questionnaire (CVQ). The reliability, factor structure, construct validity, and temporal stability of the inventory were examined. Method: A university student sample (<italic>n</italic> = 878) and a working adult sample (<italic>n</italic> = 153) were recruited. Participants were asked to complete the paper-and-pencil CVQ and a set of questionnaires to measure both their positive and negative psychological status. Results: The results supported the three-factor structure of the CVQ established earlier. Factorial invariants were found in different subsamples (students vs. workers; male vs. female). Each factor (interpersonal, vitality, and cautiousness) demonstrated satisfactory internal consistency (α = .87 to .92), test–retest reliability (<italic>r</italic> = .70 to .76), convergent validity, discriminant validity, incremental validity, temporal stability, and theoretical significance. Conclusions: The questionnaire with good psychometric characteristics and solid cultural foundations can facilitate positive social work assessment and intervention.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Peterson and Seligman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1049731513477214">2004</xref>) proposed the use of the Values in Action Classification (VIA) in systematically studying virtues and strengths. Character strength is a positive trait reflected through an individual’s thoughts, emotions, and behaviors. Meanwhile, a virtue is “a property of the whole person and the life that person leads” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1049731513477214">Peterson &amp; Seligman, 2004</xref>, p. 87). In VIA, 24 character strengths are aggregated into six virtues: Wisdom and knowledge, courage, humanity, justice, temperance, and transcendence. These qualities pervade various classical philosophy literature around the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049731513477214">Dahlsgaard, Peterson, &amp; Seligman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1049731513477214">Peterson &amp; Seligman, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1049731513477214">Peterson and Seligman (2004</xref>) developed a self-reporting English language questionnaire (Values in Action Inventory of Strength, VIA-IS) to measure the 24 character strengths (10 items per strength) and their 6 corresponding virtues. Previous studies have shown that 17 translated versions (e.g., Chinese, Spanish, Japanese, German, Hebrew, Danish, Korean, etc.) of VIA-IS were created, and that individuals from at least 15 countries have used this questionnaire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049731513477214">Biswas-Diener, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049731513477214">Linley et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049731513477214">Otake et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1049731513477214">Park &amp; Peterson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1049731513477214">Park, Peterson, &amp; Seligman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1049731513477214">Ruch et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1049731513477214">Seligman, Steen, Park, &amp; Peterson, 2005</xref>) and have proven its contributions to positive psychological outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049731513477214">Gillham et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1049731513477214">Park et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1049731513477214">Peterson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1049731513477214">Peterson, Ruch, Beermann, Park, &amp; Seligman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1049731513477214">Quinlan, Swain, &amp; Vella-Brodrick, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1049731513477214">Seligman &amp; Csikszentmihalyi, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1049731513477214">Shimai, Otake, Park, Peterson, &amp; Seligman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1049731513477214">Wood, Linley, Maltby, Kashdan, &amp; Hurling, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The cultural invariance of the virtue system proposed by Peterson et al. has recently been questioned (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049731513477214">Kubokawa &amp; Ottaway, 2009</xref>). In addition, most previous studies could not demonstrate the six-factor virtue structure theoretically hypothesized by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1049731513477214">Peterson and Seligman (2004</xref>). In fact, five-factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1049731513477214">Peterson &amp; Seligman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1049731513477214">Ruch et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1049731513477214">Singh &amp; Choubisa, 2010</xref>), four-factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049731513477214">Brdar &amp; Kashdan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049731513477214">Macdonald, Bore, &amp; Munro, 2008</xref>), and three-factor virtue structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049731513477214">Khumalo, Wissing, &amp; Temane, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1049731513477214">Shryack, Steger, Krueger, &amp; Kallie, 2010</xref>) have all been obtained from different samples sourced from different cultures. This may suggest that an identical strength might be attributable to different functions among different cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049731513477214">Cheung, van de Vijver, &amp; Leong, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049731513477214">Leong, Leung, &amp; Cheung, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The philosophical views of the Chinese on well-being would be a particular example. In contrast to the West, the Chinese idea of well-being pays much attention to collectivistic, harmonious interrelationships, as well as mental experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049731513477214">Lu &amp; Gilmour, 2004</xref>). This characteristic is largely influenced by the concept of well-being upheld by traditional Chinese culture. Culture affects and even dominates the subjective experience of well-being, resulting in a subjective well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049731513477214">Lu et al., 2001</xref>). Chinese culture is diverse and multilayered, particularly concerning views on well-being. The schools of Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism, which are the most typical and influential bases of philosophy and culture in China, each holds distinctive views on well-being. Confucianism associates well-being with a realistic sensibility toward coexistence with one’s parents and an absence of conflict among siblings. And, the school also emphasizes the well-being of rationality in pursuit of justice and humanity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1049731513477214">Watson, 2007</xref>). Taoism advocates a hyperrealistic well-being characterized by conformity to nature and the interdependence of weal and woe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049731513477214">LaFargue, 1992</xref>). Meanwhile, Buddhism associates well-being with nirvana and divine intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049731513477214">Huang, 1991</xref>). These systems have developed independently, but also exhibited mutual fusion to some extent, forming three distinct views about well-being that remain highly influential to the modern Chinese. The first kind of well-being is called collectivistic well-being, which focuses on interpersonal and social harmony, but pays less attention to personal feelings. The second relates to one’s sense of morality (goodness), and aestheticism (beauty). The third pursues rationality by escaping from reality. These views partly reveal the three components of Chinese well-being: interpersonal affairs, life, and self.</p>
<p>Duan et al. (2012b) asked 839 undergraduate students in mainland China to complete the simplified Chinese version of the VIA-IS online to attempt to solve the factorial invariance problem of the original VIA-IS in Chinese communities. Item-level exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and qualitative interviews were conducted to reduce the number of culturally inappropriate items (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049731513477214">Duan et al., 2012b</xref>). A Chinese Virtues Questionnaire (CVQ) containing 96 items was developed after the EFA and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Three virtue subscales based on Chinese culture were established: Interpersonal (32 items), vitality (40 items), and cautiousness (24 items). These three virtues correspond respectively to the connotations implied in the views of Chinese well-being discussed previously. Therefore, we believe that the three-factor virtue structure in the CVQ is firmly based on Chinese philosophy and culture. The interpersonal, vitality, and cautiousness virtues are feasible means of achieving and promoting the Chinese sense of well-being. Compared with similar virtue structures obtained in previous studies conducted in Western countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049731513477214">Khumalo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1049731513477214">Shryack et al., 2010</xref>), such a virtue structure might be universal, spanning across cultures. A new study found no significant difference, in terms of these three virtues, between the two subcultures of Hong Kong and Mainland China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049731513477214">Duan et al., 2012a</xref>).</p>
<p>However, the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049731513477214">Duan et al. (2012b</xref>) faces certain limitations. First, the sample was composed exclusively of university undergraduates with high educational levels. Thus, whether the same three-factor structure can be generalized to community samples cannot be ascertained. In addition, the authors only examined the factor structure and internal reliabilities of the subscales. Other properties, such as criterion-related, predictive, and content validities, have yet been established.</p>

<title>The Present Research</title>
<p>Based on the above review, the present study was conducted in response to the limitations of the previous study of the CVQ by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049731513477214">Duan et al. (2012b</xref>) to evaluate its reliability, factor structure, construct validity, and temporal stability. The samples included an undergraduate student sample and a community working adult sample in China to examine the ecological validity of the questionnaire. Three studies were conducted. Study 1 examined the second-order factor structure and measurement invariance of the CVQ. Study 2 examined the construct validity of each constituent dimension. Study 3 explored the reliability of the CVQ and its predictive validity for life satisfaction. This current project can be seen as a follow-up study to the previous one, as it also examines the virtues of the Chinese people. The results can demonstrate the psychometric properties of the CVQ, and provide insight into other derivative versions of VIA-IS. Subject consent to personal data collection for this study was obtained from the Department of Cross-culture and Psychology Research of the Cultural Development Research Institute of Chongqing Municipality in China.</p>

<sec id="section3-1049731513477214">
<title>Study 1: Second-order Factor Structure and Measurement Invariance</title>
<p>Study 1 addressed two issues regarding the factor structure of the CVQ.</p>
<p>The first issue determined whether a higher second-order structure exists beyond the three first-order factor models (interpersonal, vitality, and cautiousness) of the CVQ proposed earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049731513477214">Duan et al., 2012b</xref>). Specifically, this study aims to explore the possibility that a universal single-factor virtue exists among the Chinese in addition to the current three-factor virtue system. Given that our previous research showed that the correlations between factors range from .64 to .73, such high correlations among the three virtues suggest that they should not be treated as independent constructs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049731513477214">Fowers, 2008</xref>). Accordingly, we applied CFA to test the fit of the two models: A first-order three-factor model and a higher second-order factor model.</p>
<p>The second issue is related to measurement invariance by including both undergraduates and store workers as participants. A series of cross-group CFAs were conducted to examine this issue. We predicted that the factor structure of the CVQ within various samples of Chinese people should be identical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049731513477214">Meredith, 1993</xref>).</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section5-1049731513477214">
<title>Participants and Procedure</title>
<p>Two samples were used. One sample consisted of students from Southwest University in Chongqing, China (<italic>n</italic> = 493; 182 male and 311 female; mean age = 21.52 years, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.49 years). The other sample consisted of employees from a department store in the province of Anhui, China (<italic>n</italic> = 153; 82 male and 71 female; mean age = 29.56 years, <italic>SD</italic> = 6.68 years).</p>
<p>The total sample consisted of 646 participants, with 264 males and 382 females. The mean age of this sample was 23.41 years old (<italic>SD</italic> = 4.88, ranging from 18 to 49). Students and workers were recruited through public notice channels (e.g., bulletin boards, web sites, and Bulletin Board Systems of communities and schools). Volunteers were sought for a “Strengths and Virtues Survey”. After giving verbal informed consent, all the participants completed a paper-and-pencil questionnaire package (Package I) containing demographic variables (gender and age) and the CVQ. Data were collected between October 2011 and December 2011. The community working adults sample also completed other questionnaires (see later) for use in Study 2. The different authors of this study collected the data from the respective locations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1049731513477214">
<title>Measure</title>
<p>The CVQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049731513477214">Duan et al., 2012b</xref>) is a simplified Chinese scale for assessing three virtues: Interpersonal (32 items), vitality (40 items), and cautiousness (24 items). The respondents were asked to rate to what extent each item could describe them on a five-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (<italic>very much unlike me</italic>) to 5 (<italic>very much like me</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049731513477214">Duan et al., 2012b</xref>). The scores for the three virtues can be obtained by summing the corresponding items of each subscale. In this study, the mean, standard deviation, and coefficient of internal consistency of each subscale were: Interpersonal, <italic>M</italic> = 118.31, <italic>SD</italic> = 14.97, α = .90; vitality, <italic>M</italic> = 143.14, <italic>SD</italic> = 18.84, α = .92; cautiousness, <italic>M</italic> = 85.83, <italic>SD</italic> = 11.13, α = .90.</p>

<title>Results and Discussion</title>
<sec id="section8-1049731513477214">
<title>Factor Structure</title>
<p>Two CFAs were constructed to examine the factor structure of the CVQ: A first-order three-factor model (Model A) and a higher second-order factor model (Model B). The root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), standardized root mean square residual (SRMR), and comparative fit index (CFI) were adopted as approximate fit indexes. The chi-square test result was not included as a criterion because it might produce excessive Type I error rates under certain conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049731513477214">Marsh, Balla, &amp; McDonald, 1988</xref>). The consistent Akaike information criterion (CAIC) was adopted to compare the models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1049731513477214">Parker, Keefer, &amp; Wood, 2011</xref>). The model with the smallest CAIC value provided the best balance between goodness of fit and model parsimony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049731513477214">Bozdogan, 1987</xref>). Interestingly, both Model A and Model B nearly met the criteria and showed exactly the same data on all indicators (CFI = .89, SRMR = .05, RMSEA = .08, CAIC = 1675.02), indicating that the two models did not have a statistically significant difference, suggesting that the three factors share some systematic variance at a more global level. Similar results were obtained by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049731513477214">Macdonald et al. (2008</xref>), who found that the 24 character strengths were well represented by both one- and four-factor solutions. A possible reason for this result is the particularity of Models A and B, which have the same degree of freedom and number of variables. Nevertheless, like many classic complex personality constructs, adding the scores of each dimension of the personality to represent the profile of an individual is meaningless. On the contrary, the profile must be displayed through different dimensions in term of the total score, such as extraversion, openness, neuroticism, agreeableness, and conscientiousness instead of the score of the Big Five (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049731513477214">Cattell &amp; Kline, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1049731513477214">Reise, Waller, &amp; Comrey, 2000</xref>). Virtue is more a function of personality rather than of moral reasoning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049731513477214">Cawley, Martin, &amp; Johnson, 2000</xref>). Thus, we suggest that, as in previous research, the three virtues should be treated as related but independent variables in future research and practice.</p>
<p>The standardized parameter estimates for each subscale are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1049731513477214">Table 1</xref>. The items loaded strongly or moderately on their respective strengths, ranging from .40 to .77 (<italic>M</italic> = .61), with the exception of items 24 and 48. For example, item 24, “I see beauty that other people pass by without noticing,” can, on one hand, exhibit the ability to perceive beauty, but, on the other hand, can also embody the qualities of perspective. Given that all the items on the CVQ were selected from the original VIA-IS without any change, some items were retained despite a low item loading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049731513477214">Duan et al., 2012b</xref>). Thus, minute adjustments are required to improve the indicator for further exploration.</p>

<title>Measurement Invariance</title>
<p>Six further CFAs with multiple groups were conducted to test the measurement invariance of Model A. The total sample was divided into student–worker groups, male–female groups, and two other evenly distributed samples to fit the same model. Invariance was assumed to hold if this model fit the data well or if a minimal difference was observed between these models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1049731513477214">Widaman &amp; Reise, 1997</xref>). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1049731513477214">Table 2</xref> shows the fit statistics (CFI, SRMR, RMSEA, and CAIC) of this model for the total sample and by gender, type, and evenly distributed subgroups. The fit for the total sample was slightly better than those for the female and worker groups, but not as good as for that of the male and student groups. The two evenly distributed subgroups had very slight differences in terms of the crucial indicators (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1049731513477214">Table 2</xref>). Considering different sample sizes affect the Type I error rates and the chi square difference test results, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1049731513477214">Vandenberg and Lance (2000</xref>) suggested using change in CFI (ΔCFI ≤ .01) as the equivalent fit. The results showed that the female, student, and worker groups exhibited tiny changes in CFI within ± .01, whereas the male group had a change of approximately .01. Whether from traditional fit statistics or equivalent fit, measurement structure was gender and type invariant in this study, indicating that the results of the measurements from different genders and type populations can be compared. Age group was not included because the sample in this study consisted mainly of students (18–22 years old) and workers (25–49 years old). Furthermore, this bimodal distribution was not conducive to the division of age groups. Future studies need to make appropriate adjustments in sampling. This study, therefore, supported the measurement invariance of the factor structure.</p>

<title>Study 2: Construct Validity</title>
<p>Construct validities are classified into convergent and discriminant validities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049731513477214">Campbell &amp; Fiske, 1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049731513477214">Cronbach &amp; Meehl, 1955</xref>).</p>
<p>An important issue with convergent validity is common method biases, which are artificial covariant system errors that generate serious confusion and potentially misleading conclusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1049731513477214">Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Lee, &amp; Podsakoff, 2003</xref>). This bias typically manifests as a covariant between predictor and criterion variables when they have the same data source or raters, the same measurement environment, item context, or item characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1049731513477214">Podsakoff et al., 2003</xref>). We therefore used procedure control to weaken common method bias, as recommended by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1049731513477214">Podsakoff et al. (2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, one issue with discriminant validity is that unique associations among predictors and criterion variables are masked when bivariate correlations are calculated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1049731513477214">Parker et al., 2011</xref>). For instance, the vitality subscale of the CVQ consists of a group of character strengths, including hope, gratitude, and creativity, and should therefore have higher predictive validity than the individual strengths it contains (e.g., hope and gratitude). Thus, each subscale of the CVQ, when compared with the corresponding individual strengths it contains, should demonstrate the discriminant through incremental validity. Multivariate linear regression analysis was also conducted to obtain estimates of the total, unique, and shared amounts of observed variance between the predictor and criterion variables in this study.</p>

<title>Participants and Procedure</title>
<p>The participants in Study 2 were composed of two subsamples. Sample 1 consisted of 142 students (51 males and 81 females) from the Southwest University with a mean age of 20.08 (<italic>SD</italic> = .90, ranging from 18 to 23). Sample 1 was a separate undergraduate sample from Study 1, selected to expand the effective sample size and make the sampling process more convenient. Sample 2 consisted of the same 153 workers (82 male and 71 female; mean age = 29.56; <italic>SD</italic> = 6.68) from Study 1. The participants were recruited in the same manner as in Study 1.</p>
<p>We collected data from two different sources (students and workers) in their respective environment contexts to control the common method bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1049731513477214">Podsakoff et al., 2003</xref>). All questionnaires were divided into three packages (Package I: CVQ; Package II: Hope scale and Gratitude Questionnaire; Package III: Life Satisfaction scale; and Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale). The items in each package appeared randomly to counterbalance the bias derived from question order. We also obtained verbal informed consent from each participant and guaranteed their confidentiality to protect respondent anonymity and reduce evaluation apprehension. All participants had a rest time of 15 to 20 min after the completion of each questionnaire package. The students’ data were collected between January 2012 and February 2012.</p>

This scale contains 12 items: 4 items belong to the pathways component, four are agency components, and the remaining 4 items are distracters. The pathway component represents the plans and means to reach one’s goals; the agency component represents goal-oriented determination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1049731513477214">Snyder et al., 1991</xref>). The respondents were asked to rate to what extent each item described them according to an eight-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (definitely false) to 8 (definitely true). The scores on these 8 items related to agency and pathway were summed to provide the total overall hope score, with higher scores reflecting a greater hope cognitive style. The internal reliability, test–retest reliability, and construct of the Hope scale are well established; the range of Cronbach’s α was .74 to .88, .70 to .84, and .63 to .86 for the overall score, agency score, and pathway score, respectively, and the test–retests all exceeded .80 for both 3 and 10 weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1049731513477214">Snyder, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1049731513477214">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1049731513477214">Snyder et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1049731513477214">Snyder, Rand, &amp; Sigmon, 2002</xref>).

<title>Convergent Validity</title>
<p>As expected, a significant positive correlation (.27 to .52) was found among scores for the three virtues and positive variables (i.e., hope, gratitude, and life satisfaction). The three virtues each had a negative correlation with anxiety and depression (−.25 to −.12). As is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1049731513477214">Table 3</xref>, the interpersonal factor reflecting positive behavior toward other people had the highest correlation coefficient with gratitude (<italic>r</italic> = .47), which can be attributed to the significant attention that the Chinese people pay to interpersonal dependence and mutual assistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049731513477214">Hsieh &amp; Hsu, 2010</xref>), as well as to the better expression of gratitude in interpersonal relationships. The hope cognitive style involved the pathway and agent for achieving future objectives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1049731513477214">Snyder et al., 1991</xref>). Hence, it was most relevant to vitality, which reflected positive behaviors toward the world or society (<italic>r</italic> = .52). Individuals who scored high on this factor tend to have a life full of vigor and vitality. Similarly, life satisfaction, based on people’s evaluation of their past and present lives, had the highest degree of correlation with validity. In line with the expectation that virtues were important for having a good life or for cultivating happiness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049731513477214">Dahlsgaard et al., 2005</xref>), their correlations with anxiety and depression were negative and moderate in this study. Furthermore, the cautiousness subscale of the CVQ had moderate low correlations with both positive and negative outcomes in this study. This result is consistent with the result of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049731513477214">Macdonald et al. (2008</xref>), who also found that Conscientiousness in the Big 5 scale was only weakly related to some character strengths.</p>

<title>Discriminant and Incremental Validity</title>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1049731513477214">Table 3</xref>, although the correlations among the three factors and validation variables were all significant, the degree of association varied (coefficient <italic>r</italic> ranged from −.12 to .52). As mentioned previously, the unique associations among predictors and criterion variables have been hidden. Accordingly, the incremental validity of the CVQ was evaluated to show supportive evidence. Two hierarchical multiple regressions, with life satisfaction as the dependent variable, were conducted. Anxiety and depression were excluded in this analysis because both have low correlations with the three factors (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1049731513477214">Table 3</xref>). In the first group, the Hope scale and Gratitude Questionnaire scores were input first, followed by the scores for the three virtues. For the second group, we swapped the order of the two steps in the hierarchical regression equation to observe the changes in explained variances. The results are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1049731513477214">Table 4</xref>. For the first group in Step 1, Hope and Gratitude together explained 13% of the observed variance in life satisfaction. After this variance was controlled in Step 2, the three virtue factors additionally accounted for 9% of the observed variance with significant unique contributions from the vitality factor. We then examined the incremental validity of Hope and Gratitude over the three virtue factors in predicting life satisfaction by the second regression. In Step 1, the three virtue factors combined explained 21% of the observed variance, whereas the values of incremental observed variance accounted for by hope and gratitude in Step 2 were 1%, thereby reflecting a slight increase. As seen from the above results, the predictive ability of the CVQ for positive outcomes demonstrated a certain degree overlap with a specific trait (i.e., hope and gratitude). However, the value of explained variance sharing with hope and gratitude was relatively modest, supporting the distinctiveness and comprehensiveness of the CVQ from other positive traits. Previous related researches indicated that by demonstrating incremental predictive validity, scores on a particular scale were expected to explain at least 5% unique variance in the criterion, independent of their overlap with others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049731513477214">Gignac, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1049731513477214">Zeidner, Roberts, &amp; Matthews, 2008</xref>). Our results showed that the scores on the three factors of the CVQ contributed remarkable values of explained variance (nearly 10%) to the prediction of life satisfaction over and above the variance accounted for by hope and gratitude traits.</p>

<title>Study 3: Reliability and Long-Term Predictive Validity</title>
<p>“The most effective assessment instruments are, with rare exceptions, those which have been developed for the specific purpose at hand (p. 11)” said <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049731513477214">MacAndrew (1979</xref>), on the advantage of having a measurement several years ago. In the present study, we examined the long-term predictive validity of the CVQ in a student sample. Test–retest reliabilities were also examined.</p>

<title>Participants and Procedure</title>
<p>Another independent sample consisting of 296 undergraduate students from the Southwest University attended this longitudinal study. None of them had exposure to the CVQ prior to the present study. After verbal informed consent, each student received and completed a questionnaire package including the CVQ and satisfaction with life scale in class. Ten weeks later, they were asked to complete the satisfaction with life scale again. The question order was in random sequence. Fifty-three students were excluded from the data pool because they did not complete the package during the second time. Finally, the data analysis consisted of 243 students (72 males and 171 females), and the mean age was 19.67 (<italic>SD</italic> = .99). The data were collected between February 2012 and May 2012.</p>

Undergraduates were required to respond to each item (e.g., “I am satisfied with my life.”) using a seven-point Likert scale (1—<italic>strongly disagree</italic> to 7—<italic>strongly agree</italic>). A higher score reflects higher life satisfaction. The coefficient α was 0.87, as reported by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049731513477214">Diener et al., 1985</xref>), and the test–retest correlation coefficient was 0.82 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049731513477214">Diener et al., 1985</xref>).

<sub>2</sub> = 18.12, <italic>SD<sub>2</sub>
</italic> = 5.83; <italic>t</italic> = 1.27; <italic>p</italic> = .21) before and after 10 weeks. A hierarchical regression was conducted to explore the predictive power of CVQ. Both present life satisfaction and future life satisfaction (10 weeks later) were set as dependent variables. Interpersonal scores were first inputted, followed by the vitality scores, and cautiousness scores. The results of the regression analyses (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1049731513477214">Table 5</xref>) showed that only the vitality scores significantly predicted the present life satisfaction of participants, as well as their future satisfaction. A recent study conducted in mainland China and Hong Kong revealed the same result: vitality was the only significant predictor of life satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049731513477214">Duan et al., 2012a</xref>). When the vitality scores were input into the models, the predictive power of the interpersonal factor in the regression was partially attenuated, even becoming insignificant. The finding partly confirmed the results of Study 2 that vitality is a significant factor for personal life satisfaction. However, the explained variance was relatively small in this study (ranging from 8% to 15%) compared with that in Study 2, which may be attributed to the adoption of another measurement to assess life satisfaction, which was the original version proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049731513477214">Diener et al. (1985</xref>). The said version focused on intrapersonal SWB. Overall, although vitality predicted the life satisfaction of students both in the present and the future, the predictive power for the present was much stronger than for the future.</p>

<title>Psychometric Properties of CVQ</title>
<p>Given possible concerns surrounding the original VIA-IS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1049731513477214">Shryack et al., 2010</xref>), we developed the CVQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049731513477214">Duan et al., 2012b</xref>). The present research provided the first known investigation on the psychometric properties of the CVQ in Chinese populations. Consistent with expectations, the CVQ achieved the basic requirements of psychometrics. Moreover, the CVQ demonstrated adequate reliability (internal consistency and test–retest reliability), item-level characteristics, factorial validity, both convergent and discriminant validities, and long-term predictive validity. The CVQ had significantly moderate correlations with positive psychological trait measures (hope, gratitude, and life satisfaction), as well as the negative ones (anxiety and depression). In addition, CVQ remarkably predicted scores for both present and future life satisfaction. Overall, these results suggest that CVQ is appropriate for Chinese people and might be a preferred self-report measure of character strengths and virtues relative to the VIA-IS.</p>
<p>We found that the α reliability coefficients for the 32-item interpersonal subscale ranged from .88 to .90; the 40-item vitality subscale ranged from .89 to .92. The 24-item cautiousness subscale ranged from .89 to .90. Thus, the present findings indicated that the CVQ had good internal consistency. The stability coefficients of the three subscales (interpersonal, vitality, and cautiousness) over the 10-week period ranged from .70 to .76. These coefficients are similar to the original VIA-IS reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1049731513477214">Peterson and Seligman (2004</xref>).</p>
<p>As mentioned previously, a chief concern surrounding the original VIA-IS was its factor structure. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049731513477214">Macdonald et al. (2008</xref>) raised the question of what to do with the six virtues, which were found ubiquitous in various forms of literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1049731513477214">Peterson &amp; Seligman, 2004</xref>). Two solutions were found: One is that the virtues can be potentially dealt with as a stand-alone classification with a separate instrument needed to be developed to measure them, or they were simply treated as additional strengths that could be added to the current classification. Our results gave a direct response to this argument. Although we did not deny the universality of the six virtues, we also argued that these six virtues have overlapped in different cultures. Thus, perhaps a more feasible way is to reexplore the virtue factor based on the current 24 character strengths across different cultures with comparable samples and methods because these differences were the likeliest causes of the different factor structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049731513477214">Duan et al., 2012b</xref>). In addition, virtues obtained through this method, as we recommended, were dealt with as a stand-alone classification with a separate instrument to measure them. Our previous and current research precisely embodied the above idea.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section33-1049731513477214">
<title>Limitations and Future Directions</title>
<p>Several limitations of the current research should be noted. First, only the CVQ, a short version of VIA-IS, was evaluated. Whether the long form (original version) of CVQ would perform better, as well as the relationship between the two instruments, remains to be investigated. Second, the method of evaluating convergent and discriminant validity can be refined through the multitrait–multimethod latent-variable modeling approach, as recommended by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049731513477214">Marsh, Ellis, Parada, Richards, and Heubeck (2005</xref>), wherein the variables in the correlation matrix are assessed using different methods for future research, such as a self-reporting questionnaire, performance tests, others-rated method, and so on. Third, our long-term predictive validity was relatively weak. Thus, improved statistical methods and target variables are needed in the future. Fourth, regarding the samples, because the research on the CVQ was conducted with an adult sample, similar to the original VIA-IS, we could develop the adolescent applicable version to expand its use of the populace. Moreover, the representativeness of the current ordinary individuals was another limitation. Future studies may be conducted with large-scale ordinary individuals from different socioeconomic backgrounds. Finally, the hypothesis that the three-factor virtue structure might be universal across cultures should be explored through cross-culture research, given that studies in one single culture would not be enough to prove this conclusion.</p>
<p>In conclusion, further research still needs to be done on the CVQ. No single set of research can provide exhaustive psychometric evidence for one scale, considering the task of scale and construct validations is a long-term and continuous process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1049731513477214">Strauss &amp; Smith, 2009</xref>). In addition, we recommend that the CVQ can be used for a variety of research, education, training, and developmental consultancy purposes, but not for clinical or diagnostic ones. The multidimensional structure based on the Chinese traditional culture of well-being lends itself particularly well to research or programs aiming to enhance individuals’ well-being and mental health.</p>

<title>Discussion and Applications to Social Work</title>
<p>When it comes to social work, several implications may be stressed on the practical applications of the current instrument. First, this instrument can be used to explore the virtues of professional social worker samples and reveal their virtue profile, which gives a possible answer to the question “What kind of individual can become a better social worker?” Moreover, this instrument may indicate a possible route of cultivating certain virtues for social workers who want to be better and become more professional in their line of work. Second, this instrument can also be used to explore the virtues of clients. Intervention activities can be designed based on the clients’ virtues, which will enhance compliance. Clients are then able to devote all their energies or willingness to the intervention activities and will achieve great benefits. Along such research ideas, an intervention program based on virtues is a promising application of this proposed instrument.</p>
