<p>We report the biological response of novel nano-Sr–HA and HA–ZrO<sub>2</sub> composites designed for load-bearing applications in the skeleton produced by employing sol–gel technology, minimal ZrO<sub>2</sub> loadings, and novel microwave-sintering regimes, thereby retarding decomposition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0885328211403020">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0885328211403020">2</xref></sup> Three composites were evaluated <italic>in vitro</italic> using rat osteosarcoma (ROS) cells; a reproducible method of determining the response of cells in culture to test biomaterials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0885328211403020">3</xref></sup> The two most promising materials were then further evaluated to assess the bone response to the test materials in a rat femur healing model.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0885328211403020">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>HA is employed for repairing skeletal defects as it resembles the mineral phase of bone and is bioactive. However, its poor strength limits load-bearing applications. Mechanical properties can be improved by incorporating zirconia, but sintering at high temperature is required, resulting in HA decomposition and reduced bioactivity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0885328211403020">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0885328211403020">6</xref></sup> At a critical point of dehydroxylation, the process becomes irreversible and the HA begins to decompose to other calcium phosphates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0885328211403020">7</xref></sup> Decomposition produces products such as tetracalcium phosphate [TTCP]{Ca<sub>4</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>O} which can further degrade to tri-calcium phosphate [TCP]{Ca<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>}<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0885328211403020">8</xref></sup> and calcium oxide. In addition, studies of the stability of HA show that the presence of ZrO<sub>2</sub> serves to destabilize the HA structure at lower temperatures than would be seen without the oxide phase.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0885328211403020">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0885328211403020"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0885328211403020"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0885328211403020">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Sr<sup>2+</sup> has a biological role in the body where it decreases the activity of bone-resorbing osteoclasts and increases the activity of bone-forming osteoblasts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0885328211403020">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0885328211403020">14</xref></sup> In the HA lattice, Sr<sup>2+</sup> replaces the cation Ca<sup>2+</sup>, but due to the mismatch in atomic radii there is a lattice expansion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0885328211403020">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0885328211403020">16</xref></sup> affecting the properties of the material. The presence of Sr<sup>2+</sup> within HA is known to decrease the mechanical resistance of the ceramic in a linear manner;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0885328211403020">17</xref></sup> and may also increase the solubility of Sr–HA compared to HA. This increase in the solubility of the Sr–HA has been reported to have a positive effect on osteoblasts and reduce the number of osteoclasts due to the release of Sr<sup>2+</sup>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0885328211403020">18</xref></sup> In addition to Sr<sup>2+</sup> release, increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from Sr–HA is suggested to activate calcium channels and thus stimulate cell response.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0885328211403020">19</xref></sup> Also, increased solubility of the Sr–HA increases the possibility of increased interconnected porosity on its surface enhancing osseintegration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0885328211403020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0885328211403020">21</xref></sup> and interfacial bonding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0885328211403020">22</xref></sup> Thus, although Sr–HA is a more resorbable material than HA, its possible increase in bioactivity and bonding to bone make it a more desirable material that could influence the quality of newly formed bone.</p>
<p>Zirconia exists in three different phases depending on temperature; monoclinic (M) at room temperature to 1170°C, tetragonal (T) between 1170°C and 2370°C, and cubic (C) above this temperature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0885328211403020">23</xref></sup> Upon cooling, the T–M transformation results in a volume expansion of approximately 4% and the associated stresses can result in cracking of pure zirconia. The addition of ‘stabilizing oxides’ such as CaO, MgO, Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, and CeO<sub>2</sub> are required to stabilize the high-temperature C/T phases at room temperature. The addition of small amounts of Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (2–3 mol%) to zirconia can result in the retention of a fully tetragonal phase at room temperature known as tetragonal zirconia polycrystals (TZPs).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0885328211403020">24</xref></sup> Yttria-stabilized TZP (Y-TZP) has various inherent characteristics such as low porosity, high density, high bending and compression strengths, low coefficient of thermal expansion, and chemical stability, which make it suitable for clinical applications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0885328211403020">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> responses of these novel Sr–HA and HA–ZrO<sub>2</sub> composites designed for skeletal load-bearing applications.</p>

<p>A simple precipitation method previously described by Jarcho et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0885328211403020">26</xref></sup> was used for the HA, which was then modified to produce Sr–HA.</p>

<p>Calcium nitrate hydrate (Ca(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>·4H<sub>2</sub>O) (78.72 g) was dissolved in 600 mL of distilled water which was made basic by the addition of 10 mL of ammonium hydroxide (NH<sub>4</sub>OH). The mixture was stirred vigorously and raised to the desired temperature of 25°C under the same stirring conditions.</p>

<p>Ca(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>·4H<sub>2</sub>O (71.11 g) was dissolved in 600 mL of distilled water which was made basic by the addition of 10 mL of NH<sub>4</sub>OH under vigorous stirring conditions. Once the Ca(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>·4H<sub>2</sub>O had dissolved, 7.08 g of strontium nitrate hydrate (Sr(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>·4H<sub>2</sub>O) was added to the Ca(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>·4H<sub>2</sub>O and the mixture was raised to the desired temperature of 25°C under the same stirring conditions.</p>
<p>Di-ammonium hydrogen orthophosphate ((NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>) (26.41 g) was made basic in 1066 mL of water by the addition of 25 mL of NH<sub>4</sub>OH, and brought to the desired temperature of 25°C. The Ca(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>·4H<sub>2</sub>O and (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>-based solutions were stirred vigorously before synthesis to ensure that the reagents were completely dissolved. To determine this, visual inspection of the solution was conducted for un-dissolved reagent particulates. Under continued vigorous stirring, the (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub> solution was added drop-wise from a glass funnel into the Ca(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>·4H<sub>2</sub>O solution over a 60-min interval. Throughout the synthesis, the pH was kept above 10.0 by the addition of NH<sub>4</sub>OH at constant intervals to avoid a large pH change to the system. Once the drop-wise addition was completed, the solution was kept at the synthesis temperature for 1 h under the same temperature and vigorous stirring conditions, effectively giving an aging time of 1 h. The sample was then left to stand for 24 h at room temperature. The supernatant was removed and replaced with fresh distilled water, re-stirred for one 1 h, and left to stand again for 24 h. This procedure was performed three times to remove any unwanted residue from the precipitate. The supernatant was removed a final time and replaced with distilled water and spun for 15 min. The suspension was then filtered under vacuum, using a Buchner filter and distilled water until the ammonia was removed. The filter cake was then removed from the filter and placed into a beaker and dried in a fan-assisted oven at 85°C for 20 h. The dry precipitate was then crushed by pestle and mortar and sieved through a 90-µm stainless steel sieve.</p>
<p>The sieved HA was mixed with 3 mol% Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-doped ZrO<sub>2</sub> (3Y-TZP; Tosoh Corporation, Japan) using a dry ball-milling technique with alumina media for 6 h to create batches of composite powders with 5 and 10 wt% ZrO<sub>2</sub> additions as described elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0885328211403020">2</xref></sup> The test bodies of Sr–HA and ZrO<sub>2</sub>–HA were prepared by pressing 1.3 g of powder in a 20 mm diameter stainless steel die. The green bodies were then densified using a hybrid microwave-sintering furnace developed at the University of Limerick (Limerick, Ireland). The device has a peak power output of 1.125 kW and utilizes silicon carbide (SiC) as a susceptor medium to facilitate hybrid heating. Firings were performed at 1200°C (±20°C) with a hold time of 1 h and subsequently left to furnace cool.</p>
<p><italic>HA-A</italic> contained HA doped with 10 mol% Sr of the total calcium content. <italic>HA-B</italic> contained HA with 5 wt% ZrO<sub>2</sub> (3Y-TZP), and <italic>HA-C</italic> contained HA with 10 wt% ZrO<sub>2</sub> (3Y-TZP). Discs of HA-A, HA-B, and HA-C were 8 mm in diameter and 2 mm in thickness. The irregular sized granules of HA-A and HA-B were in the range 90–350 µm. The control discs were composed of heat-cured acrylic.</p>

<p>The HA powder was pressed into ethyl–cellulose pellets using a 32 mm <italic>ø</italic> stainless steel die. These were then placed in the X-ray diffractometer (Philips X’Pert) for an initial scan covering a range of 10–70° 2<italic>θ</italic>, with a step size of 0.083° and a step time of 120.015 s.

<sec id="sec8-0885328211403020"><title>X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy</title>
<p>X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were done on a Kratos AXIS 165 spectrometer (Kratos Analytical, Shimadzu Corporation, Japan) with a monochromatic Al source of spot size 1 mm diameter. The X-ray gun was run at 150 W (10 mA, 15 kV) with mono Al-Kα of 1486.58 eV. The pass energy was 160 eV for survey spectra and 20 eV for narrow regions with a vacuum compatibility of 10<sup>−8 </sup>Torr. The samples were scanned for 50 ms (dwell) and 100 ms (region) with electron volt energies of 1 eV (dwell) and 0.05 eV (region). The spectra were collected in the normal to the surface direction with a detection limit of 0.1–0.5%. Construction and peak fitting of synthetic peaks in narrow region spectra used a Shirely-type background and the synthetic peaks were of a mixed Gaussian–Lorenzian type. Relative sensitivity factors (RSFs) used were from the CasaXPS library containing Scofield cross-sections. RSF values used for individual peaks were given in excel sheets, which were used to tabulate and graph the data.</p>

<p>Discs (acrylic, HA-A, HA-B, and HA-C) were sterilized in 70% (v/v) ethanol, before being washed in phosphate-buffered saline three times and placed into 24-well plates. ROS cells (1 × 10<sup>4</sup>) were added onto the discs and incubated at 37°C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. After 48 or 72 h, the media was replaced with media containing 10% Alamar Blue, covered with foil and incubated. After 4 h, the fluorescence (<italic>λ</italic><sub>ex</sub> = 540 nm, <italic>λ</italic><sub>em</sub> = 585 nm) was measured using an Infinite M200 plate reader with Magellan Software (Tecan, Switzerland).</p>

<p>Discs were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehdye in 0.1 M phosphate buffer overnight at 4°C, washed three times in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, and fixed in 2% aqueous osmium tetroxide for 2 h at room temperature. Specimens were then dehydrated through a graded series of ethanol at room temperature and air-dried overnight. Once dried, samples were mounted on stubs, attached with Sticky Tabs, and coated with approximately 25 nm of gold in an Edwards S150B sputter coater. Specimens were examined in a Phillips/FEI XL-20 scanning electron microscope (SEM) at an accelerating voltage of 20 kV.</p>

<sec id="sec13-0885328211403020"><title>Surgery</title>
<p>Juvenile male Wistar rats aged 4–6 weeks at the time of surgery were used for this study. Animals were housed in groups in conventional laboratory conditions and provided with standard laboratory food and water <italic>ad libitum.</italic></p>
<p>Animals were anesthetized using Isoflurane in oxygen; under aseptic conditions, the mid-shaft of the right femur was exposed using sharp and blunt dissections and a defect created using a 1-mm diameter round stainless steel dental bur running at slow speed in a dental handpiece under saline irrigation. Approximately, 4–8 granules (90–350 µm) of a single test material were placed into the bone defect using fine tweezers, (<italic>n</italic> = 6 per material).</p>
<p>Wounds were closed using resorbable sutures at 28 days. Animals were sacrificed using a schedule one method. The right femurs were dissected free and placed in formalin.

<sec id="sec16-0885328211403020"><title>Powder characterization</title>
<p>The stoichiometric quality of the laboratory-produced HA was investigated using XRD and XRF analysis techniques. XRD analysis matched the laboratory-synthesized HA to JCPDS card 09-0432, while the XRF results determined the Ca/P ratio to be 1.66. From these results, it was determined that the HA synthesis procedure produces near-stoichiometric quality HA. The ratio of Ca<sup>2+</sup> to Sr<sup>2+</sup> was determined using XPS as 19.43% to 1.99%, respectively in the Sr–HA with 10% Sr<sup>2+</sup> substituted for the total Ca<sup>2+</sup> content. This ratio of 20:2 indicates that the there was near-total substitution of the Sr<sup>2+</sup> ions into the HA lattice in place of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions.</p>

<p>Cells migrated onto and colonized all the materials.

After culture with ROS cells for 72 h, cells had migrated onto and attached closely to the surface of all materials and were forming a confluent layer which was more complete on the acrylic and HA-A discs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0885328211403020">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

<p>The histological features were similar for both HA-A and HA-B. At 4 weeks, all surgical sites were well healed and the cortical defect was closed and filled with lamellar bone. In some instances, particulate material was seen in this region and was in direct contact with bone. There was no evidence of an inflammatory response in any of the sections examined and the materials were well tolerated by bone and marrow tissue. The granules of material were in direct contact with either bone or normal marrow tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0885328211403020">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0885328211403020">5</xref>).

There was no evidence of resorption of either material. Where material was seen at the bone/connective tissue interface, a thin layer of fibrous connective tissue was seen over the material (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0885328211403020">Figure 4</xref>(c)).

<p>The <italic>in vitro</italic> evaluation indicated that all three test materials induced a favorable response in the ROS cells with some evidence that the order of ‘biocompatibility’ was:
<disp-formula id="disp-formula1-0885328211403020"><mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block" id="mml-disp1-0885328211403020"><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>HA</mml:mtext><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mtext>A&gt;HA</mml:mtext><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mtext>C</mml:mtext><mml:mo>≥</mml:mo><mml:mtext>HA</mml:mtext><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mtext>B</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:math><graphic alternate-form-of="disp-formula1-0885328211403020" xlink:href="10.1177_0885328211403020-eq1.tif"/></disp-formula>
</p>
<p>HA-A may present better biocompatibility due to the variably observed deposition of material onto the surface which may have been an apatite layer observed by others on Sr-HA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0885328211403020">27</xref></sup> Reduced zirconia content has also been reported to be associated with improved bone response in HA–ZrO<sub>2</sub> composites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0885328211403020">28</xref></sup> HA-A also benefits from the incorporation of strontium.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0885328211403020">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>The animal model used to assess the bone response to the test materials was the rat femur healing model, which is well established; this and the similar rat tibia model have been regularly used by our group and others.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0885328211403020">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0885328211403020">29</xref></sup> A defect in the immature rat femur will heal rapidly and implanted materials will often encourage increased bone formation in the medullary space; this region is normally occupied by marrow and has little trabecular bone except for the proximal and distal ends of the bone. This model is useful for establishing whether a material will elicit a favorable or unfavorable response in bone. Those that excite an unfavorable response in this model are unlikely to be worthy of more long-term studies. This model is useful as an early screen for new materials intended for medical implantation. <italic>HA−A</italic> contained hydroxyapatite doped with 10 mol% strontium of the total calcium content and <italic>HA−B</italic> contained HA with 5 wt% ZrO<sub>2</sub> (3Y-TZP) both elicited a favorable osteoconductive response in bone and would appear suitable for further evaluation in more rigorous non healing models. The materials appears not to have caused any inflammatory response in bone, but if excess material were to escape into soft tissue, a different response may be elicited and care should be taken to interpret these results in the context of bone only.</p>
