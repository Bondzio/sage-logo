<abstract>
<p>This article investigates the claim that student poverty is the strongest significant predictor of science teaching and learning, even more than school factors. To investigate this phenomenon, this study focuses on education in South Africa. South Africa is a country and educational system characterized by communities of both extreme poverty and wealth, and using cross-nationally comparative quantitative evidence, one can draw a clear distinction and estimate of the impact of student poverty on teaching and learning for both an international and a South African sample. The cross-national comparison contrasts education in South Africa with approximately 40 other countries by using internationally comparative data from the 2003 Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study eighth-grade science assessments and background questionnaires. Using this data, the author tests the hypothesis that student poverty impact is a stable, strong predictor of science teacher pedagogy and student performance in South Africa compared to educational systems around the world and at every level of national development. These cross-national data are analyzed using hierarchical linear modeling, which is a multilevel regression technique that nests student-level indicators of teaching and learning within school communities, and school communities within national systems. Results support the hypothesis that student poverty is the most significant influence on science teaching and learning, which has strong implications for teacher accountability and the impact of school factors on student learning in high poverty communities worldwide.</p>

<title>Science Teaching and Learning</title>
<p>Science performance is often a bellwether for economic growth and social development. International evidence confirms that science education contributes to community and national economic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0002764211408861">Ramirez, Lou, Schofer, &amp; Meyer, 2006</xref>). However, evidence from the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) shows that South African science that South African science education is neither internationally competitive nor meeting national standards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0002764211408861">Reddy, 2005</xref>). The state of math and science teaching and learning in South Africa is a topic of much discussion both within South Africa and among the international community across all populations (White, Black, and “mixed race”) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0002764211408861">Reddy, 2005</xref>). This is because of the consistently poor performance of South African students on the TIMSS, which allows comparison to students and systems in approximately 50 other countries.</p>
<p>In three cycles of the TIMSS (1995, 1999, 2003), South Africa ranked last among all participating countries every time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0002764211408861">Howie et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0002764211408861">Mullis, Martin, Gonzalez, &amp; Chrostowski, 2004</xref>). As a country dealing with a legacy of extreme social and political inequality, this low science performance is especially troublesome. Furthermore, the gap between high and low achievers in science is associated with the gap between advantaged and disadvantaged groups of students in South Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0002764211408861">Howie, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0002764211408861">Howie &amp; Scherman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0002764211408861">Howie, Scherman, &amp; Venter, 2008</xref>). Yet there is strong comparative evidence that suggests that South African primary children are highly interested in practical science concepts and learning and might even benefit from being able to develop their own relevant science curricula with their teachers’ guidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0002764211408861">Pell &amp; Manganye, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0002764211408861">Stears &amp; Malcolm, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The role of teachers in integrating science throughout the primary curriculum is a key component to the development and improvement of science learning and achievement in South Africa. Traditionally, the ways that teachers develop their science pedagogical knowledge and skills are through “drill-and-kill” exercises offered by the local professional development unit of the department of education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0002764211408861">Bantwini, 2009</xref>). The alternative is to develop professional communities of teachers who work with and mentor each other on a continuous and constructive basis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0002764211408861">Fricke, Horak, Meyer, &amp; van Lingen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0002764211408861">Jita &amp; Ndlalane, 2009</xref>). Another challenge for South African teachers is that the science curriculum policy adopted nationwide requires them to enact an “indigenized” science curriculum, which can be a challenge for teachers who do not come from the same extreme poverty or socio-ethnic community as their students do (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0002764211408861">Ogunniyi, 2007a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0002764211408861">2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0002764211408861">Ogunniyi &amp; Ogawa, 2008</xref>). Yet it is widely recognized that science education contributes to community development as well as national economic growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0002764211408861">Ramirez et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Half of all South African children are at risk of not finishing school, and most of them live day-to-day in communities with the highest HIV-AIDS infection rates in the world. In fact, South Africa has the highest HIV-AIDS infection rates among adults worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0002764211408861">Republic of South Africa, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0002764211408861">Sachs, 2002</xref>). Since teachers and educators compose the largest white-collar profession in South Africa, many in the adult population who are either infected or engaging in high-risk sexual activity are teachers. To exacerbate the problem, the highest HIV-AIDS infection rates are in marginalized and extremely poor communities (i.e., the disadvantaged; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0002764211408861">Baxen &amp; Breidlid, 2009</xref>). This double jeopardy is most pronounced among girls and young women either living or working in disadvantaged communities in South Africa because of their marginalized status and almost constant exposure to HIV-AIDS infection opportunities. A lack of education not only diminishes their economic chances but also increases their potential for high-risk sexual behavior and decision making.</p>
<p>The mixed-race and Black communities in South Africa are officially referred to as “previously disadvantaged” communities, but evidence suggests that there is nothing “previous” about the poverty and lack of adequately-resourced social services (such as education) still prevalent in the those communities compared to what is available to White South Africans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0002764211408861">Mabokela &amp; Mawila, 2004</xref>). In the case of disadvantaged communities in South Africa, school-age children are often unable to take full advantage of the educational opportunities available to them for reasons ranging from the quality and resources available in local schools to the consequences of health and economic conditions in their homes and communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0002764211408861">Phurutse, 2005</xref>). In this context, sustained access to quality education and flexible models of teaching and learning are critical to the long-term impact and sustainability of formal education and community development.</p>
<sec id="section2-0002764211408861">
<title>Conceptual Framework</title>
<p>The institutionalized differences in education, which result from community-based poverty, may affect achievement and socioeconomic status, but aspirations and expectations for education are both converging and shared across differentiated social and economic strata of the school and community. In other words, there remain significant educational opportunities for the disadvantaged in spite of their conditions and limitations, which were not available before the advent of mass schooling systems in countries and communities around the world. South Africa is no exception even though there are extreme disadvantages and obstacles to educational progress, teaching, and learning. As a result, the expectations of students, parents, and teachers are often beyond what is reasonably achievable by most students living in extreme poverty. Yet these students and parents living in poverty still have these expectations that education will contribute to their individual, community, and national development.</p>
<sec id="section3-0002764211408861">
<title>The intersection between student poverty and national development</title>
<p>During the 20th century, countries everywhere made large investments in public education to expand and increase the human capital of their citizens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0002764211408861">Psacharopoulos, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0002764211408861">Schultz, 1982</xref>). The rationale behind this emphasis on human capital, in particular, was to make youth more economically productive by making schooling accessible to every youth and increasing their levels of educational attainment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0002764211408861">Becker, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0002764211408861">Griliches, 1996</xref>). However, an increase in the accessibility of education or in youth’s educational attainment alone has not ensured future economic productivity, social literacy, or productive citizenship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0002764211408861">Carnoy &amp; Levin, 1985</xref>). Some of the blame for this failure of mass schooling to create model citizens or societies has been attributed to the rapid changes in technology and information systems that dramatically altered world labor markets during the 20th century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0002764211408861">Carnoy, Castells, Cohen, &amp; Cardoso, 1993</xref>). For example, during the latter part of the 20th century, schools increasingly shifted their formal curriculum and programs to meet employers’ perceived needs rather than offering youth a steady diet of social and political education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0002764211408861">Kanter &amp; Lowe, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>This may be because the sociopolitical development of youth poses severe challenges to government-sponsored school systems due to the often-impersonal, mass elements of public schooling. As a result, the rapid 20th-century massification of education has often had dire consequences for youth both in and out of schools (e.g., violence; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0002764211408861">Akiba, LeTendre, Baker, &amp; Goesling, 2002</xref>). Also, popular and academic discussions of schooling and youth development beginning immediately following September 11, 2001, have increasingly focused on the incorporation and transmission of ideas that are shaped by conceptions of national, cultural, and ethnic identity and ideology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0002764211408861">Abowitz, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0002764211408861">Giroux, 2002</xref>). In particular, evidence suggests that there is institutionalized support for the transmission of separatist ideologies to youth in some schools and nations instead of institutionalized support for global citizenship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0002764211408861">Salem, 2002</xref>). Finally, there is some question as to whether formal public schooling is a dominant venue for the transmission of culture and values versus whether and to what extent youth are instructed in values and ideologies from other less-regulated institutions (e.g., family, religious, and social groups; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0002764211408861">Qadir, 2001</xref>).</p>

<title>Western economic ideology and schooling for development</title>
<p>Western educators, policy makers, and economists typically suggest the importance of investment in physical inputs to develop economic situations; however, physical inputs alone cannot fully explain how economic growth occurs. National economic growth depends on a number of factors, among which a principal and essential nonphysical factor is education. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0002764211408861">Schultz (1982)</xref> states both that (a) education can be a form of human capital and that (b) inequalities are the basis for economic growth. A Western human capital approach to schooling, therefore, suggests that through this blend of investment and stratification, the effect of education on an individual’s life not only persists throughout life but also influences his or her future income independent of other influential economic factors. In other words, there is a culture of education that is spread through worldwide participation in schools and that perpetuates its own mythology by instilling the belief that high achievement and continued progress in school necessarily leads to high economic return and escape from poverty and marginalization.</p>
<p>In other words, a fundamental Western human capital rationale suggests that humans invest their present resources in themselves through education, training, and other skill- or opportunity-enhancing activities in exchange for future returns on these investments, usually in the form of income (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0002764211408861">Wiseman &amp; Alromi, 2007</xref>). Investment in human capital, therefore, may produce economic growth at the individual, regional, or even national level although the individual returns are usually emphasized over the others. In spite of the individual-level emphasis of a human capital rationale, the connection between individual skill value and system-level productivity espoused by this perspective is persistent.</p>
<p>Schooling is, therefore, a formal tool that individuals can use to invest in themselves. Moreover, a human capital rationale suggests that schooling is an efficient and appropriate process through which students acquire skills and knowledge needed in the labor market. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0002764211408861">Bidwell (1989)</xref> argues that a human capital rationale assumes schooling has cumulative effects on individuals’ productivity, occupational prestige, and income. A human capital rationale also suggests that work entry problems arise because youth’s skills are inadequate or even defective. As a consequence, students leaving school without skills needed by the labor market can negatively affect not only their own future earnings but also nations’ economies. In other words, poor performance of entry-level employees weakens nations’ economies and may be attributed to inadequate educational preparation or skill investment.</p>
<p>Human capital development is, therefore, variously defined as a process by which knowledge, skills, and capacities of individuals increase. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0002764211408861">Becker (1993)</xref> asserts that human capital arguments presume schooling provides not only skills or knowledge but also a way of resolving problems. Thus, a human capital approach considers education to be a tool for increasing individuals’ occupational adaptability as well as incomes. Reports on school-to-work transition, for example, suggest that employers seek more and better <italic>basic</italic> skills in their employees since the 1980s than they did in previous decades. When there is mismatch between employees’ skills and employers’ needs, individuals’ skill values and, more importantly, income suffer from the discrepancy. In light of this, therefore, a human capital rationale considers education for employable skills to be an investment for individuals in which they align themselves with the labor market. The human capital approach to schooling, therefore, emphasizes the importance of individual value based on the exchange value of the education received.</p>
<p>The hypothesis emerging from the research literature on schooling for development, educational impact on economic productivity, and the role of culture in development is that student poverty is a stable and strong predictor of science teacher effectiveness and student performance in South Africa as well as educational systems around the world and at every level of national development. If the previously introduced hypothesis is true that student poverty is one of the most significant and stable predictors of various school outcomes, namely, student achievement, then the human capital rationale would be weakened. This general hypothesis is testable using cross-national data on mathematics and science teaching and learning.</p>

<title>Data and Method</title>
<p>Empirical, cross-nationally comparative data for this study comes from the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study administered in 2003. TIMSS 2003 contains data from 50 different countries, including South Africa, although only 38 contain sufficient data for analysis here. The data used in these analyses is for eighth-grade-equivalent students, teachers, and schools. Science achievement data as well as questionnaire data for participating students, classroom teachers, and principals contribute to the background and learning environment data. The TIMSS 2003 data are publicly available online from the TIMSS and PIRLS International Study Center at Boston College (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://timss.bc.edu/">http://timss.bc.edu/</ext-link>). There is a data analysis SPSS add-on tool (IDB Analyzer) available from the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement, which makes appropriate weighting and data adjustments given the unique sampling techniques employed during the assessment’s administration; however, most analyses were conducted using the statistical software programs SPSS and HLM.</p>
<p>Each participating TIMSS country, including South Africa, used a two-stage sampling design. The first stage consisted of a probability-proportionate-to-size sample of schools selected from a sampling frame of all schools in that nation enrolling most of the students in the targeted grade level. The second stage sampled up to two science classrooms per school with an equal probability of selection, and all students in these classrooms were included in the study. Science achievement tests as well as background questionnaires for students, teachers, and principals were designed to be comparable across nations. The study developed sampling weights to adjust for disproportional sampling of subgroups and nonresponse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0002764211408861">Martin, Mullis, &amp; Chrostowski, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Methodologically speaking, contextualizing cross-national survey data requires multilevel, multivariate statistical modeling (e.g., hierarchical linear modeling that incorporates national and international variables into individual models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0002764211408861">Raudenbush &amp; Bryk, 2002</xref>). The analysis reported here began with univariate and bivariate analyses at the nation level to describe cross-national trends in differences between national and non-national students in terms of achievement and other performance indicators. Using this information, the analyses progressed to determine the degree of association and significance of differences in science achievement score or economic disadvantage in students’ homes. Finally, multilevel regression models using HLM were conducted to determine the impact of student home and school resources on their science achievement score and teacher pedagogical reports while controlling for other background and learning environment characteristics.</p>
<p>Multilevel analyses reported here compare student science achievement, learning conditions, and background characteristics at the student, school, and nation levels. A summary of the different indicators used in the main analysis is below.</p>

<title>HLM Models</title>
<p>To examine evidence relative to the national versus non-national focus of this study, an HLM regression strategy estimates the multilevel and contextual effects of national status on student achievement and science-related labor market and university expectations. HLM is especially appropriate in the context of nested data; here, this is applied to student-level effects nested within school contexts for both the international and South African samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0002764211408861">Bryk &amp; Raudenbush, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0002764211408861">Raudenbush &amp; Bryk, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0002764211408861">Willms &amp; Raudenbush, 1989</xref>). For these two samples in TIMSS 2003, separate models are estimated for student-level indicators of educational performance or productivity, specifically, science achievement score and reported science teaching method.</p>
<p>The objective here is to estimate the effect of cross-school variation in national status on size of the student-level gap in science performance and teacher pedagogy in each country in the international sample. The equation below assumes students’ science score as the dependent variable, although in different HLM models, expectations for the labor market and university participation were substituted for the dependent variable.</p>
<p>First, an equation is estimated for the influence of a student’s national status, university, and labor market expectations and, for control of background effects, three indicators of the student’s socioeconomic status:</p>

<title>Evidence of the Educational Significance of Poverty</title>
<p>In schools where more than 50% of the student population come from economically disadvantaged homes, there are more problems with school and class attendance, lower principal perceptions of school climate, and a greater impact of resource shortages on classroom instruction. The TIMSS 2003 data support this. For example, three indicators representing (a) an index of availability of school resources for science instruction (BCDSST), (b) an index of principals’ perception of school climate (BCDGCH), and (c) an index of good school and class attendance all show greater disadvantage for schools with predominantly economically disadvantaged students.</p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0002764211408861">Table 1</xref> shows, schools where more than half of the student population are economically disadvantaged have 6.4% fewer principals’ responses that they have high levels of good school and class attendance but 6.7% more principals’ responses that they have low levels of good school and class attendance. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0002764211408861">Table 2</xref> shows that schools with more than half of the student population economically disadvantaged have 18.8% fewer principals rating their school climate as high but 11.5% rating their school’s climate as low. Finally, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0002764211408861">Table 3</xref> shows that 18.7% fewer principals of economically disadvantaged schools report that they have high availability of school resources for science instruction compared to principals reporting from schools that are not economically disadvantaged to that degree; whereas 8.4% more principals at economically disadvantaged schools report that they have low availability of schools resources for science instruction.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0002764211408861">Table 4</xref> shows the comparative background statistics for all of the key indicators used in the multilevel regression model for the international and South Africa–only samples. The reason South Africa was selected as a special case is readily apparent from this table. For example, the average science achievement score for the international sample is 462, but South Africa’s average science achievement score is 223 points lower at 239 (i.e., almost half the international average). The background statistics also show that there is significant variation in the degree to which students report that they speak the language of the test (i.e., instruction) at home. In South Africa, the central tendency of the LANGUAGE variable is a full scale point lower than the international average for this indicator, meaning that many more students in South Africa come from minority or marginalized racial or ethnic groups with unique languages than in most other countries.</p>

<p>Finally, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0002764211408861">Table 4</xref> shows that school principals in South Africa report to a much larger degree that more than half of the students in their schools come from economically disadvantaged homes, even though there are slightly more students reporting they have a large number of books in their homes (which is traditionally a useful indicator of home resources related to education). This suggests that although perhaps more of the population in South Africa are literate and own books, there is still a larger proportion of the population who are economically marginalized. This conclusion is supported as well by the fact that principals report more of a shortage of science resources affecting classroom instruction in South Africa than in the international sample at large. Although it is helpful to consider these data at the student, school, and nation levels, it is also important to nest or contextualize the data at or within each level.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0002764211408861">Table 5</xref> shows the multilevel regression model (i.e., HLM) results indicating the impact of poverty and marginalization on science learning and teaching performance. The fixed effects at the student, school, and nation levels are identified in the left column, and the results for both the international and South African samples are shown in the columns to the right. For each sample, there were three dependent variables: student science achievement scores (BSSSCI01), frequency that students plan science experiments or investigations (SCIPLAN), and frequency that students listen to teachers lecture (SCILECTURE). These variables were also used as student-level controls when not included in the model as the main outcome variable.</p>

<p>The table shows that for the international sample, all of the student-level measures of poverty and marginalization (including gender, language, and home resources) were significant predictors of student achievement and teacher pedagogy. Students who are female were predicted to score significantly lower than boys on their science assessment (<italic>b</italic> = −15.75, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), and students with fewer home resources (e.g., books) scored significantly lower than those with more resources available at home (<italic>b</italic> = −11.96, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001).</p>
<p>At the school level for the international sample, there were also clear indications that economic disadvantage at school and at home negatively affected student science achievement. For example, schools where more than half of the students reportedly came from economically disadvantaged homes were estimated to score significantly lower than schools where more than half came from affluent or average homes (<italic>b</italic> = −15.69, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). A shortage of science resources for classroom instruction was also shown to have a significant impact on science achievement (<italic>b</italic> = 8.81, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0002764211408861">Table 5</xref> also shows the multilevel regression results for the South African sample, only with some surprising differences. At the student level, for example, the only indicator of poverty and marginalization that was a significant predictor of student science achievement was whether a student spoke the language of the test at home. In other words, in communities where English or Afrikaans was not the home language, students tended to score lower, and where one of these was the language spoken at home, they scored much higher (<italic>b</italic> = 17.12, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Neither books in the home (<italic>b</italic> = −2.01, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05) nor students’ gender (<italic>b</italic> = 0.26, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) was a significant predictor of student science achievement in South Africa. The data tell us that poorer communities and schools have students who score lower on the science achievement test, and the table tells us that lower-scoring students tend to be more likely to have teachers who ask them to plan science experiments or investigations and less likely to have teachers who lecture them; however, the coefficients for both indicators were so small that the significance of these small coefficients is perhaps merely an artifact of the large sample size.</p>
<p>At the school level for the South African sample, the impact of economic disadvantage in the home was enormous (<italic>b</italic> = −75.43, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), and shortage of science resources for classroom instruction was equally strong in terms of associating with lower science scores (<italic>b</italic> = 20.20, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001).</p>

<title>The Impact of Poverty on Education</title>
<p>The role of poverty and home background in influencing the student performance and teacher behavior in schools around the world has been of particular interest since the famed “Coleman Report” of the 1960s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0002764211408861">Coleman, 1966</xref>). Since the release of this report and the public debate about the impact of school versus home resources that ensued, governments, parents, development agencies, and communities have argued about how much resources matter when it comes to education. As a result, student poverty and home background have become the 900-pound gorillas of educational research, especially when dealing with school effects.</p>
<p>The implication of the importance of student poverty in predicting student achievement and teacher behavior is that it shifts much of the attention away from teachers and schools and back onto the family and local communities. For example, it is quite well known around the world that students from affluent backgrounds tend to outperform their less-advantaged peers both in school and in the labor market. Although there are those educational researchers who may be content to simply suggest how schooling associates with labor market productivity, there is abundant evidence that schooling (and student achievement in particular) is a proxy for resource support or advantage that exists beyond or in addition to the school.</p>
<p>Reform efforts are especially susceptible to these ambitious interpretations that look for school effects on student achievement first and consider student poverty only as a background factor. For example, teacher accountability reforms attempt to hold teachers accountable for the measurable performance of the students from their classrooms. The de facto logic is that a student’s teacher is responsible for that student’s performance. However, the teacher is not being directly measured. Instead, the student is directly measured, and research shows that students are more likely to be influenced by their community than any other variable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0002764211408861">Battistich, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0002764211408861">Coladarci, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>This study has shown that student poverty in the home and community is the single most important predictor of student achievement and teaching method at the student and school levels. If this is true, then teacher accountability, principals’ instructional leadership, and many more reform efforts are contextualized by student poverty. In other words, while these school-based effects impact student achievement, their impact is always mediated by student poverty. It does not necessarily follow that a shift in the way a teacher teaches or in the delivery method of the teachers in high- versus low-poverty areas makes much difference. Instead, it is quite the opposite. The analyses here show that even when school factors, such as teacher pedagogy, are included as predictors of student achievement, and when these measures are even significantly associated with student achievement, the indicators of socioeconomic status (e.g., student poverty) are still the largest in terms of impact and importance to the resultant change in dependent variable.</p>

<title>Poverty and Health</title>
<p>The spread of HIV-AIDS has had a devastating impact on South Africa and its education sector. An estimated 5.2 million people were living with HIV-AIDS in 2008, more than any other country in the world. National prevalence is approximately 11% of the population, with some age groups more highly affected. Almost 1 in 3 women ages 25 to 29, and more than a quarter of men ages 30 to 34, are living with HIV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0002764211408861">Hoadley &amp; Ward, 2009</xref>). South Africa’s HIV-AIDS epidemic has had a devastating effect on children. In 2007, there were an estimated 280,000 children younger than 15 living with HIV. In most instances, the virus was transmitted from the child’s mother. Often, HIV-infected children are born into families where the virus may have already had a severe impact on health, income, productivity, and the ability of family members to care for one another. The epidemic may reduce girls’ access to education at all levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0002764211408861">Lewis &amp; Lockheed, 2007</xref>). Girls are highly vulnerable to contracting HIV-AIDS because of social, cultural, economic, and psychological reasons and, compared with boys, are more often kept at home. It is estimated that there are 1.4 million AIDS orphans in South Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0002764211408861">UNAIDS, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Although the health and economic sectors of South Africa have explored the impact of the pandemic in their own sectors for some time, the impact both of and on education has remained peripheral to HIV-AIDS prevention and treatment solutions. Until now, most research addressing the impact of the education sector has been influenced by economics, medicine, and epidemiology but fails to take into consideration the contextual factors that influence the social and cultural embeddedness of the disease. Yet it is the contextual factors of African culture that have had a debilitating grip on South Africa’s ability to control the spread of HIV-AIDS in spite of the commitment of considerable capital in the past decade. In addition, there is a stigma associated with HIV-AIDS education and prevention, which inhibits teachers and other adults from talking honestly with primary school–age children about the disease and how to prevent it. But there is a desperate need to address HIV-AIDS as early as possible in South African children’s primary school career.</p>
<p>In short, the schools in disadvantaged communities are often burdened to address the nonacademic needs of learners far beyond the resources made available to them by the government or educational system. Physical and emotional needs are important aspects that teachers in schools in disadvantaged communities are being required to meet in spite of the fact that teachers may not have all of the knowledge, skills, or resources needed to meet those needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0002764211408861">Onwu &amp; Stoffels, 2005</xref>).</p>

<title>Institutionalized Poverty and a World Culture of Education</title>
<p>But the world does not wait. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0002764211408861">Al Heeti and Brock (1997)</xref> argue, “Issues of development, modernization and related phenomena . . . tend to be grounded in . . . ‘Western paradigms’ . . . and are concerns of the macro realm, while cultural imperatives are essentially local” (p. 374). Although the nation-level forces influencing the development of education are predominantly economic, the actual shape of education is mediated through culture. More culturally sensitive perspectives suggest alternative propositions for schooling that are responsive to issues of cultural mismatch and the impact of human capital rationales for schooling in non-Western cultures.</p>
<p>Culturally sensitive perspectives on education often emphasize the stratifying effects of schooling and the labor market in both Western and non-Western contexts. These perspectives further suggest that the interaction of schooling and labor market institutions is even more deleterious—that each is separately a source of both culture conflict and the reproduction of inequality. Yet the question remains how these arguments specifically speak to mismatch between human capital rationales for schooling in non-Western cultures.</p>
<p>The mismatch may be one of levels. For instance, individuals in Western cultures often attribute success to internal factors, such as educational investment, but shift blame for failures to external factors, whereas individuals from non-Western cultures often do the opposite. Education can influence national economic growth. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0002764211408861">Friedland and Alford (1991)</xref> argue that “the institutional logic of capitalism is accumulation and the commodification of human activity” and that the attendant institutional orders operate by a “set of material practices and symbolic constructions” (i.e., culture; p. 248). Therefore, without considering the influence and interaction of culture with the economic functions of education, a human capital rationale for schooling may be incomplete from individual, national, and institutional perspectives.</p>
<p>Although social and economic class hegemony in Western nations has long been discussed, the West’s hegemonic influence on non-Western nations, regions, and cultures is not new to educational debates and policy reform arguments either. For instance, both <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0002764211408861">Carnoy (1974)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0002764211408861">Said (1993)</xref> argue that education is a form of cultural imperialism, and therefore, by extension, educational curricula or programs that influence or determine the nature of work and employability are especially influential cultural processes.</p>
<p>In truth, many argue that educational systems are organized to maintain the cultural system they represent. Additionally, arguments about world systems and globalization have suggested that schooling as both a carrier of culture and a socializing agent is closely connected to economic and political globalization forces. Therefore, if the model for school curricula and educational programs comes from the West and encourages its own cultural philosophy of human capital, then school programs and curricula should inculcate non-Western students with the values, attitudes, and beliefs of the West’s human capital rationale. In fact, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0002764211408861">Yates (1987)</xref> argues that the “complexity of cultural identity” emphasizes the importance of the relationship between culture and curriculum, such as that suggested or prescribed by school programs and curricula.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0002764211408861">Spindler (1987)</xref> suggests that this inculcation of culture makes the educational component or structure in question credible even in non-Western cultures. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0002764211408861">Hayhoe (1992)</xref> argues that traditionally non-Western Asian nations have purposely sought to gain Western-influenced knowledge through schooling while also fostering continuity in traditional values. Likewise, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0002764211408861">Mazrui (1999)</xref> argues that although “Western liberal democracy has enabled societies to enjoy openness, government accountability, popular participation, and high economic activity” (p. 131), the particular cultural and moral vices that often accompany it are strongly opposed by some.</p>
<p>But in spite of this argument concerning cultural hegemony and even corruption through education, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0002764211408861">Spindler (1987)</xref> takes a more balanced approach to the influence of the West. He asserts that there are “virtually no cultural systems left in the world that have not experienced massive input from the outside, particularly from the West” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0002764211408861">Spindler, 1987</xref>, p. 326). This input includes determinants of schooling systems, such as curricular content and achievement standards. Therefore, if Western influences are replete throughout the world, what choice do non-Western cultures have but to incorporate Western human capital rationales for schooling into their own cultural considerations and understandings of education and the world of work, especially if they are cultures and communities characterized by institutionalized poverty?</p>

<p>Item response theory scale scores were estimated for each student on the basis of an imputed plausible value analysis undertaken by the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study. Five plausible values per student were estimated. After extensive preliminary analysis, no substantial differences among results were found using individual versus integrated values; therefore, the first plausible value is used in some but not all of the analyses reported here.</p>
