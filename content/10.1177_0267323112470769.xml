<body>
<p>It is astonishing how quickly the English language reflects new adult anxieties, in this case anxieties about children, media and consumer culture. Terms like ‘digital natives’ and ‘digital immigrants’, ‘tweens’, ‘the net generation’, ‘generation clueless’, ‘cyberkids’, ‘toxic childhood’ and ‘pester-power’ are circulated by a breathless mass media, to the extent that such terms now trip off the tongues of adults as natural parts of a commonsense viewpoint. Many baby boomer parents, in particular, feel as though they have been challenged by the revolutionary cultural and technological forces reshaping their children’s worlds. Many want answers to questions, and they want them now.</p>
<p>Two books intended to serve as textbooks and three volumes that curate conference presentations, all published in 2010, offer us recent takes on the research intersection between childhood, families, media and consumer culture and say much about the audiences they are written for. They also provide clear evidence that questions about the classical tension between structure and agency continue to be fruitful for scholars to explore.</p>
<p>The emerging field of child studies brings together scholars from diverse fields including history, communication, media/cultural studies, sociology, psychology, anthropology, geography, marketing, critical political economy and education, often for the first time. This cross-disciplinary, multi-methodological research is destabilizing old essentialist theories of childhood, while at the same time suggesting, paradoxically, the ongoing critical importance of engagement with the politics of ‘childhood’ at national and global levels.</p>
<p>Norwegian scholar Woerdahl, in the Buckingham and Tingstad collection, illustrates younger researchers’ self-reflexive approaches to children’s consumer culture. She took her carefully constructed survey tool, honed and tested in Norway, to China. To her surprise, her small sample of parents in Beijing found it ‘off target’. Indeed, it did not seem to address their concerns in any significant way. Whereas Nordic nations have championed protecting children from marketing influences (Sweden and Norway forbid advertising in national children’s programmes), this form of child-centred protectiveness had little resonance for the parents interviewed in central Beijing. Why?</p>
<p>She remarks that, if the rise of consumer culture in the west can be compared ‘to the speed of a car’, then consumer culture in China has arrived ‘at the speed of a space rocket’ bringing with it revolutionary consequences (p. 181). Children in China are now greater consumers than adults, at least in terms of the percentage of family income allocated to children’s consumption. This rapid change in consumer habits has, naturally, raised familiar concerns about the place of children in society and, in turn, the place of consumption in child socialization. The key issues for parents in China, as elsewhere, relate to protection from and preparation for a new consumer society, but the cultural formations and solutions present in quite different ways. While some Chinese critics express familiar western concerns about the new influences on their children, most parents in Woerdahl’s study appear to embrace the possibilities offered by consumer culture. Woerdahl found herself asking previously unthinkable questions: does consumer culture offer possibilities that outweigh the dangers for Chinese families? Indeed, is increasing child consumption <italic>the effect</italic> of parents embracing the possibilities offered by consumer culture in their attempts to ensure that their child is on the right path to a materially better life? She concludes that the primary question for parents in her study is ‘how to compete’ in the new meritocratic China, whilst good and bad consumption is defined through concepts of ‘exercising human virtues’ which draw on models from Chinese history (including Confucianism). ‘Regulation’ relates not to protection from psychological impacts (as in Nordic nations), but rather to physiological effects: fears that a child’s eyesight might be damaged.</p>
<p>Such recent fieldwork provides us with new research directions by challenging western middle-class value judgements about children’s consumption through demonstrating that consumer culture in China supplies ‘different strokes for different folks’.</p>
<p>However, it is clear that there continues to be parental handwringing, and regular popular panics in the west about children and their consuming passions. Authors from the heart of democratic capitalism, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0267323112470769">Schor (2004)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0267323112470769">Linn (2004)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0267323112470769">Palmer (2006)</xref> get wide press coverage when they argue that marketing to children is a bad thing, and even a challenge to childhood itself. Schor goes so far as to claim that children’s involvement in consumer culture leads to anxiety, depression, loss of self-esteem and psychosomatic symptoms.</p>
<p>It is to this hyper-mediatized debate and moral panic that Socha and Yingling (2010) deliver their call to arms, and offer us their peculiarly American answers. <italic>Families Communicating with Children</italic> is one in a series Key Themes in Family Communication targeting caregivers and professions involved in family guidance. Socha and Yingling argue that we cannot examine family life, or human communication development across a lifespan, without considering how children both influence, and are influenced in, families. The authors urge scholars in the field of communications to make the study of children’s communication an urgent priority in order to address two perceived gaps: the lack of focus on children in the US field of communications generally and, in particular, children’s communication within the field of family communication. Students interested in children’s communication have been obliged to take classes outside the field in developmental psychology or education. Does this crossing over to another discipline matter? Yes, probably very much so, inside the politics of juggling for position within US university course work.</p>
<p>The discipline of communication as it is conducted in the US is not one familiar to me from New Zealand, so reading <italic>Families Communicating with Children</italic> was a reminder of how all fields are constituted and fought over. We are told the discipline’s ‘origin’ myth: the way that the American discipline of communication formed as a splintering away, first from English departments, as Rhetoric, and then from various social sciences (interpersonal communication from psychology and group communication from social psychology and sociology). They lament that, while these other contributing disciplines try to explain children’s development, the field of US communication does not and, to the date of publication, there is no textbook on children’s communication for the field in print. Reasons are given – children are harder to work with than adults (as anyone who has attempted to research with children can attest) – but they also point the finger at the communication field’s failure to appreciate that, in studying adults, researchers are studying something that took many years to develop.</p>
<p>They present selected classic foundational ideas about human development: nativists (Chomsky and Pinker), interactionists (Bruner and Piaget) and behaviourists (Skinner) and reach a comfortable roost agreeing with Vygotsky’s symbolic interactionism, before surveying recent developmental research on childhood, from birth to late childhood. The book reads like the textbook that it is and this tone is underscored by an earnest desire to be useful to children’s case workers and anxious American families. In other words, this book has a didactic edge.</p>
<p>According to Socha and Yingling there is one exception to the lack of focus on children within communication: research prompted by anxiety over media effects. Questions about media effects thread through the text. Since the days of silent movies and early comics middle-class parents have worried that their children’s values are being corrupted by popular media. As a consequence there is a long history of US politicians treating media as pathology to be researched and treated, with the resulting skew of research funding going to effects research.</p>
<p>The authors pose questions about media effects. To be fair, they describe ‘good effects’ as well as ‘bad effects’; for example, the effects of pedagogically tested programmes like <italic>Sesame Street</italic>, but the fears about ‘bad effects’ overwhelm any good news. Among other things, they foreground questions guaranteed to create parental anxiety and fear: ‘What happens when children use a computer before they learn to write? Or even before they speak?’ and ‘What if the match in expertise is not good between the adult and child?’ These remain unanswered questions and, indeed, there are slim pickings in terms of research insights into children’s use of media or consumer culture. A three and a half page section in Chapter 2 titled ‘Electronic media: Ubiquitous, interactive, and transformative’, presents some broad generalizations: ‘reading and writing tend to isolate and individualize us; electronic media tend to globalize us and link us’ (p. 42) and then a page or so later, somewhat perversely, a contradiction warning us about the generational chasm being created between parents and children by electronic media. Parents, who once read books with their children, are now faced with ‘the digital generation [who] have learned to perform online identities in the company of peers rather than trusted adults’ (p. 44). On the same page the dangers of interactive media are highlighted and parents are again exhorted to ‘be very observant of a child’s changing behaviour to detect spiralling self esteem’. This is scary stuff indeed.</p>
<p>Citations illustrate the behaviourist bias. They summarize a study on computer games by Dill and Dill, published in the <italic>Journal of Aggression and Violent Behaviour</italic> in 1998, with the following words:<disp-quote>
<p>… when a child chooses to ‘play’ a character with specific strengths, as in <italic>Mortal Kombat</italic> or <italic>World of Warcraft</italic>, the scene is set for role play in which a violent persona is practiced. (p. 43)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The final chapter includes a section <italic>‘</italic>Preventing the negative effects of media and enhancing the positive’. Here they suggest solutions – talking about harms, restrictive mediation (rules) and ‘media literacy’. Here it is the teachers’ and parents’ ability to scaffold communication techniques that is deemed critical for safe media use (p.131). It is indicative that this section appears just before the section ‘Preventing substance abuse and enhancing health’.</p>
<p>Techniques of risk assessment, drawn from behaviourist approaches, are placed at the foreground in this book. This is rather odd since the authors begin the book by championing the cross-disciplinary nature of communication studies and urging more studies of, and with, children. As a consequence the ‘take home’ message from this book is that it is hard work being a parent and that, in individualistic America, your child’s successful future rests firmly on your own parental choices.</p>
<p>The continuing dissemination of effects research has policy implications for rational media debate in other countries. There may be centres of excellence like the Harvard Center for Research on Media and Child Health, which researches issues like the impact on children’s health of exposure to food advertising, but there is also an industry that sells packaged American behaviourist research as universal truth. There is Craig Anderson from the Center for the Study of Violence who pops up around the world as the scientific expert witness in recurrent moral panics about ‘shoot ’em up’ video games. Then there are professional organizations like the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) who, with other public health organizations, have issued a ‘consensus’ opinion that children are particularly vulnerable and prone to adopting aggressive attitudes, opinions, values and behaviour as the result of watching entertainment violence. AAP press releases are incorporated into news stories and stoke recurring moral panics around the world. Few journalists have time to dig deeper to analyse the status and age of the research cited, or interpret the larger picture of the political and institutional forces shaping children’s media research within America. Nor do they often consider the commercial arrangements which have permitted the erosion of US public space (think advertising in schools on Channel One in the US) and the way that corporations and shareholders are absolved from child-centred responsibilities, thus leaving individual parents to shoulder the work of policing childhood. There are hints that this may get worse under bilateral international agreements that enshrine free commercial speech for transnational American corporations.</p>
<p>Sadly, the possibility has to be taken seriously that moral panics generated by American effects research shape news stories around the world as much as empirical fact.</p>
<p>How differently UK-based Messenger Davies frames <italic>Children, Media and Culture</italic>, a survey textbook in the series Issues in Cultural and Media Studies. She does not situate children as a problem demanding urgent intervention, although she is a psychologist by training and acknowledges useful work by the team at the Harvard Center on Media and Child Health. She does, however, discuss how popular media stoke moral panics. Nor is she casually celebratory about the agency of children, as some scholars in cultural studies and audience and marketing researchers can be.</p>
<p>She has a pragmatic and often humorous style: ‘Feed ’em, love ’em, keep ’em out of the traffic’ is the Michael Fox quote she uses to head up the chapter on the science of childhood. What comes through is the voice of someone who enjoys children in all their energetic, hopeful, grubby diversity. It is indicative of her approach that the very last subtitle in the book reads ‘The importance of fun’. As she says, ‘Around panicking adults is usually not a good place to be (p. 91).</p>
<p>Most critically for the reader, she presents a lively re-evaluation (and critique) of cross-disciplinary research and political rhetoric about children, media and culture. She frames her book with clear definitions of children, media and culture, including the observation from Raymond Williams that ‘culture’ is one of the two or three most complicated words in the English language (p. 14). One of the main arguments of the book is that the terms ‘culture’ and ‘children’ are always intrinsically linked, and that one of the primary ways in which they are linked is through ‘media’ (p. 15).</p>
<p>Her material is largely drawn from the US and the UK, simply because that is where the most research and debate is available for review. The book is divided into two sections. The first section (Chapters 1–5) surveys historical, social scientific, political and cultural understandings of childhood and children’s relationship with the media. The second section (Chapters 6–11) explores the very broad cultures and media that have been created about, for and by children.</p>
<p>In Chapter 2 she challenges the idea that childhood is a fixed concept that can be universally characterized across different times and places and illustrates how concepts of childhood have changed over time in the west. Her chapter on the science of childhood succinctly surveys how the development and welfare of children has been ‘studied, defined and (for industrialized countries at least) improved’. She surveys important studies of children and childhood drawn from medicine, history, psychology, sociology, political economy and media/cultural studies. This scholar does not believe in defending disciplinary silos. She shares Chomsky, Skinner and Piaget with Socha and Yingling’s line-up of key theorists but includes Freud and the much misunderstood Bowlby. For some reason she does not include that educational favourite, Vygotsky. Chapter 4 explores the politics concerning concepts of childhood, and the final chapter in the section brings us back to issues concerning ‘effects’, and the importance of well-designed effects research in the production of creative content for children (p. 90).</p>
<p>Chapter 4 merits special consideration because it attempts something very ambitious: ‘to explore the ways in which children’s relationship with media and culture intersects with political action’. Political economic studies of media have tended to ignore how adult institutions and rhetoric shape media and resources for children, so this is an important chapter that indicates a range of issues worthy of further exploration and research. She demonstrates how a child’s well-being is always a political issue and how it can be framed in terms of either empowerment or vulnerability. For example, she provides a two-page analysis of the ‘Toxic childhood panic’ in the UK. This was triggered by a book of that name which argued that the clash between our technology-driven culture and our biological heritage is now damaging children’s ability to think, learn and behave. This message was spread by neuroscientist Baroness Susan Greenfield in speeches in the House of Lords, and then amplified by the popular press. The episode illustrates how children are in a double-bind in terms of how they are reported in the news: they may have rights as citizens in the making, but stories of children as threats to the social order are far more pervasive because they are ‘catnip’ for newsmakers. She quotes one of her 12-year-old informants from research in 2005:<disp-quote>
<p>Children are shown as a responsibility in adult news … something which commits teenage crimes and eats unhealthily. THIS IS NOT RIGHT. (p. 54)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Later in the chapter she returns to discuss commercialism, the ‘junk food’ advertising ban and the subsequent canning of original indigenous production by ITV, in order to illustrate how interconnected political and economic decisions on children’s media content can be.</p>
<p>After a brief outline of media-related articles in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (Article 18 can be more ambiguously interpreted than she indicates), she discusses the inclusivity and rich discursive discussions of the five World Summit Congresses held in Melbourne, Greece, Brazil, South Africa and Sweden. The first, in 1995, focused only on children and television and now the focus has broadened to include youth and media. Some may call these events long on talk and short on action, but they bring together first and third worlds, producers, educators, scholars and young people, and illustrate how different regions respond in different ways to culture, politics and media; for example, the battle for rights for girls in Pakistan or the push to encourage children as media producers in the fight against AIDS in South Africa. Local indigenous production is a commonly shared desire and Messenger Davies quotes a view that British indigenous production ‘could do more to reconnect kids to the society in which they live than a 100 government schemes and initiatives’ (p. 62). The challenge is to demonstrate this to data-driven funders and policy-makers.</p>
<p>Finally she teases out the meaning of ‘media literacy’, as exemplified by Ofcom initiatives, which some critics have attacked as a sop to enable unrestricted introduction of new technologies, and ‘media education’, in both its celebratory and critical forms, as it has been developed in English-speaking nations (the UK, New Zealand, Canada, Australia, the US). I explore this in more depth later.</p>
<p>Section 2 is a treasure trove of specific media examples, from historical images of how children have been depicted, to collections of the unofficial children’s culture of games, rhymes and stories (and, fascinatingly, why that collection process has stalled in more PC times), and on to the more familiar genres of children’s literature, television and interactive digital media. As she says, a great deal has been written about the effects of media but little attention has been given to actual media products. Even literature (so-called ‘high’ culture), in her view, has been too often treated as illustrative of cultural imperialism or as a commodity. She uses close analysis, interviews, case studies and a range of texts to enable this everyday culture to be viewed from multiple directions.</p>
<p>What I like about Messenger Davies’s approach is that she refuses to give pat answers, preferring to open up issues for debate. She sees the relationship between children, media and culture as an opportunity for innovative research that asks new questions and she is invigorated by the ‘remarkable speed of change in the media and cultural studies agendas’. She wants her book to consolidate existing work and ask questions in order to push scholarship forward in imaginative productive directions.</p>
<p>I initially encountered Messenger Davies when her first book, cheekily called <italic>Television is Good for Your Kids</italic>, arrived from the UK in the late 1980s as a calm and sensible riposte to the more hysterical ‘effects panics’ spreading around the world from the US. Critics had already analysed how the FCC deregulation of the television industry had created the wasteland of toy-sponsored ‘kidvids’ for children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0267323112470769">Palmer, 1988</xref>) but this did not curb the panic against television as a medium. <italic>Television is Good for Your Kids</italic> came from a different, child-centred world, the United Kingdom, where public service for children mattered. It still has an honoured place on my bookshelf.</p>
<p>Messenger Davies continues to draw on her background as journalist, psychologist and teacher in her prolific research studies. She finds time to participate in policy reviews, work as a consultant and lobby for indigenous children’s provision. Her multifaceted work demonstrates the value of exploring the tensions between institutional forces shaping children’s choices and audience agency. I find it compelling that she has continued to research <italic>with</italic> children and sees them as <italic>co-creators</italic> of the knowledge she creates.</p>
<p>The final three books considered here are collections published in the wake of Nordic conferences. The first two reflect changing Nordic scholarly concerns and are published by Nordicom. The third collection is internationally focused and contains the best studies drawn from the third international multidisciplinary conference on ‘Child and Teen Consumption’ held in Trondheim in 2008. As with all edited collections, you need to find the right mix to suit you as a reader because the papers can be uneven in either theoretical or methodological interest. Unfortunately, the engagement between papers, which would have made for a vibrant conference, is missing from the page. But the best papers in the volumes offer some useful multidisciplinary approaches to the intersection of children, youth and consumer culture.</p>
<p>The 2010 Nordicom Yearbook may contain Nordic studies, but its Foreword presents important global statistics and asks the big question: How will new media landscapes transform the structure of governance and the social functions of media and communication in different parts of the world? It is shocking today that 60–70% of inequality between social groups is found between nations. This daunting statistic is compounded by the fact that, while children and youth currently represent more than one-third of the world population, this needs to be contextualized by region: in old democracies young people make up only 25% of the population (and dropping), whereas young people may make up to 70% of the population in the least developed nations. The dissemination of global indicators, statistics and other tools of comparison, including the challenging task of cross-national field research, is critical if we wish to document comparative trends about children’s well-being and media access over a longer-term perspective.</p>
<p>National and regional statistics and indicators from more affluent places remain valuable for researchers from less well endowed research environments because they suggest indicative shifts in children’s media use. Key resources include the research data commissioned by Ofcom on shifting media use, and attitudes to that media use; the exhaustive EU Kids Online Project, which continues to be mined for diverse insights into young people’s use of internet and social networking tools; the Kaiser Family Foundation’s longitudinal research studies into daily media use of 8- to 18-year-old American children completed in 1999, 2004 and finally in 2009 (the work of the Kaiser Family Foundation will be sorely missed now that the foundation has shifted its focus to medical policy); and, last but not least, the dissemination of research knowledge through the Nordicom Children’s Media Clearinghouse, founded in 1997 with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child as its point of departure, alongside research conducted in the Nordic region.</p>
<p>Nordicom’s Children’s Media Clearinghouse is a rare thing. It provides a hub for a global network of researchers through its brief to increase awareness and knowledge about children, youth and media. It provides resources for media policy debate and enhancing media literacy and competence. It is fair to say that Nordicom’s yearbooks, newsletters, bibliographies on key issues and register of organizations concerned with children and media have been a lifeline for isolated researchers working far from the established research centres of the north.</p>
<p>We in New Zealand feel an affinity with the Nordic region. It represents a calm repository of good practice based on a long tradition of unquestioned middle-class support for child-centredness (‘<italic>den gode barndom</italic>’). This Nordic ‘taken for granted’ policy position is doubly precious for New Zealanders because we have experienced the dismantling of our own welfare state (a pioneer in its time) and seen it replaced by political belief in the market. Public service television will be closed down this year, leaving citizens with, arguably, the most deregulated media environment in the western world. At the same time neoliberal economics has had dramatic consequences for child-centredness in national policy formation.</p>
<p>The 25 million people in the Nordic region consistently rank high in the indices measuring democracy, prosperity, freedom of expression and absence of corruption. All share long traditions of public service broadcasting and independent journalistic traditions. Media ownership remains largely in Nordic hands and 95% of children have access to the internet. But, as the director of Nordicom observes, behind the good statistics, the calm centre of cultural consensus appears to be unravelling in the Northern European region. The boundaries between private and public, national and global, real and virtual are becoming ever more fluid. The diaspora from the nations of the south to the north create new interconnected family and social worlds: 10% of Swedish children now have overseas kin. At the same time national boundaries are ignored by global satellite media corporations and children’s easy access to consumer culture has become unstoppable on the internet. It is becoming harder to find shared cultural capital, and thus the consensus necessary to justify expensive media and social policy in this hybridizing cultural world.</p>
<p>The 2010 Yearbook, <italic>Children and Youth in the Digital Media Culture: From a Nordic Horizon</italic>, edited by Nordicom’s indefatigable director Ulla Carlsson, was published just before the World Congress on Children, Youth and Media, held in May 2010 at Karlstad. It is designed to feed into Congress debate with its global frame followed by Nordic perspectives. The second Nordicom volume, <italic>Media Literacy Education: Nordic Perspectives</italic>, edited by Sirkku Kotilainen and Sol-Britt Arnolds-Granlund, was compiled from contributions to the first Scandinavian media literacy education conference held in Finland in 2007 and is, as a result, less easy for readers unfamiliar with regional educational politics. <italic>Media Literacy Education</italic> is published as a response to Nordic Ministers of Culture’s call to make globalization a top priority for the region. In both volumes Nordicom’s early mandate to pay special attention to media violence shifts to a focus on media education and there are considerable overlaps between the two volumes, with the five contributions in Section 1 of the Yearbook concerned with media literacy, its importance and challenges. Certainly there is a shared desire to maximize new digital opportunities and competencies for children, while minimizing risks.</p>
<p>Section 2 of the Yearbook offers a mix of overview, reflection and case study. Nordicom’s Carlsson observes that we can no longer just ask what media do to us, but need to ask what we do with the media, and Von Feilitzen, scientific coordinator at Nordicom, confirms that the Nordic region has far more affinity with cultural and reception studies than it does with media effects traditions. One can surmise that there has been less for parents to be fearful about. Its children have been well served with rich local content and, until recently, they have been largely shielded from advertising or marketing.</p>
<p>It is not clear who is the intended audience for the Yearbook volume. Maybe the style is intentional: to include all comers. Experienced researchers will find the broad overviews unnecessary and repetitive. A case in point is the ‘research journey’ contributed by Rydin and Sjoberg. We are presented with the familiar narrative: effects, uses and gratifications, musings on the internet and a call for media education, before mention of an important four-year project with Swedish Television Interactive designed to explore young people’s preferred interactions on television sites, and how public service channels can use the internet in innovative ways. How interesting this section on extending public service broadcasting into social networking media sounds. I would have preferred more on this and less on the overview. Broddason, Olafsson and Karlsdottir present the longitudinal set of surveys of children’s media use begun in Iceland after the introduction of television presented a ‘natural’ experiment in 1968. The headline is that traditional television is waning faster than most thought possible, while ‘television-like’ content is becoming integral to online content. The Nordic region has high internet penetration and long hard winters, which may go some way towards explaining contributions on computer games, fan sites and other electronic tools like Skype. These interactive forms bring to the foreground the mediatization of social worlds of children, where it is harder to distinguish media professionals from other users of media. Hirsjarvi’s study of three Finnish fan sites and Aarsand’s study on play in computer games and Skype demonstrate the value of good case studies. Aarsand asks why is playfulness suddenly a problem in the digital world? Boys playing Lego Star Wars demonstrate how they mediate storylines between themselves and use their avatars to explore, modify and develop the intended storylines.</p>
<p>The second Nordicom volume, <italic>Media Literacy Education: Nordic Perspectives</italic>, is written in English, though Nordic in focus, and designed to offer contributions to international discussions between media studies and education. Nordicom has published surveys of media education initiatives around the world. These illustrate how media education in schools has become a capacious basket into which a motley assortment of educational rationales, pedagogies and media practices has been thrown. Media education has been claimed to be variously: a prophylactic against violent/naughty/exploitive media content, a celebration of popular culture, a preparation for good citizenship, a radical pedagogy that unmasks the role of media within capitalist power structures and craft training for the new lightweight digital audiovisual economy. This volume illustrates something that is evident in other places as well, that ‘media education’ is still at a pioneering stage. Teachers and researchers are still working out if it is a stand-alone subject or something that best threads through the curriculum, or both. But, as ever, good teachers find their own way. Don’t miss the striking study late in the volume by Vettenranta which draws on Appadurai and Vygotsky in order to create a tool called ‘Global Mediagraphy’, designed to interconnect students in a range of ways with their family diaspora across the world. Educators just keep innovating!</p>
<p>Per Lundgren, the director of the 2010 Karlstad World Congress, finishes the volume with a call for networking across the region in order to coordinate new global proposals like UNESCO’s Media and Information Literacy initiative, which was promoted at the World Congress. It was inspiring to me that young Nordic teachers were given special passes to the Karlstad World Congress because they contributed much of value to the event, including the news that we have a rising generation of teachers adept at social networking and at home in the digital world. Here lies hope. Maybe media education now needs to bring on board those adults who say they have not kept up with technology, and yet are only too willing to expound on the dangers lurking on the internet or in children’s popular culture.</p>
<p>Transnational agreements are attempting to position media education firmly within a larger set of civic rights across the world, not just in the first world. These agreements include media-related principles in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (1989), the UN Alliance of Civilizations Media Education initiative (2009) and UNESCO’s Media and Information Literacy initiative, which was introduced to delegates at the Karlstad Congress in 2010. They each have the goal of extending the rights to media education beyond the hubs in North America, Europe and the Antipodes. The challenge facing them is to avoid working in yet more silos.</p>
<p>The final volume under review here, <italic>Childhood and Consumer Culture</italic>, brings together the best presentations from the 2008 Child and Teen Consumption conference, part of a series held every two years since 2004, which brings together established and emerging researchers for cross-disciplinary and multi-methodological debate. The editors, UK-based David Buckingham and Norwegian-based Vebjorg Tingstad, want to take us beyond polarized debates where children ‘are either powerful agents or passive victims: either sophisticated and “media literate” or innocent and naïve; either competent or incompetent’. One aim of this volume is to:<disp-quote>
<p>… look beyond these opposing positions, and to develop a more nuanced and more complex account of how the commercial market operates, and how children relate to it. (p. 2)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Contributions in the volume offer us fresh ways of charting how contemporary childhood is inevitably embedded within complex patterns of consumer culture. Several engage with interactions between the power of markets and the power of young consumers and their families. Key contributions offer revisions and critiques of historical tensions in the fields of childhood and consumer culture, others illustrate through empirical research how adult social categories – gender, divorce, ethnicity, affluence, poverty and class – cut across cosy assumptions about the intersection between childhood and consumer culture. What is clear is that the emerging field of ‘children’s consumer culture’ employs wildly varied theoretical and methodological tools as it has expanded beyond considerations of media consumption and merchandise into studies of food, clothes, bedroom displays and generational signifiers.</p>
<p>In the history section, Cross draws on US print and television advertising to demonstrate how children’s consumer culture cannot be understood without recognizing that adults’ expression of love for children has encouraged consumption, as well as a wish to protect children from its influences. Adults project onto children their own contradictions and desires. Cook frames the theory and method section with a proposition that ‘commercial enculturation’ should replace the concept of consumer socialization in order to move from linear ‘developmentalism’ to a more fruitful exploration of webs of cultural meaning. Johansson follows with a piece that examines the essentialist danger of a category like ‘child’. As she says, sometimes age is important, sometimes other factors like gender, skin colour or even taste in music are key. She draws on actor network theory to make an ontological shift from child ‘entities’ to ‘connections and flows’ in her analysis of interviews with children. She demonstrates how ‘agency’ is constituted through extensions and assemblages connected to humans (family, friends, shopkeepers), structures (family, market economy), objects (coins, toys, jeans, food) and technology. Mitchell quotes Sherry Turkle’s remark that ‘We live our lives in the middle of things’, and calls for a move to a new materialism in her survey of work utilizing memory work (of childhood toy packaging), anthropology (analysing the remains of a council house left by a single mother) and archaeology (digging up the infant self).</p>
<p>Wasko brings us back sharply to the large picture of institutional power in her piece on children’s virtual worlds in the third section containing studies of the market. She uses textual and industrial analysis of kids’ sites like Neopets and Webkinz to demonstrate how corporations appreciate the power of immersion and the consumer data it provides. She concludes that new media engage the imagination of fans, but it is still important to ask who is ultimately in control and how ideas, values and meanings are embedded in such sites. This section concludes with Marten’s engaging analysis of narratives of anxiety and celebration sold to new parents at a commercial baby show.</p>
<p>The final two sections, on social contexts and identities and consumption, offer individual studies of great interest focused on the agency of children. Collins and Janning draw on interviews with adolescents in the US to explore how children use ‘stuff’ in the homes of mother and father after divorce, and how aware they are of their ‘agency’ with each parent. This study contributes to scholarship about home consumption, in particular how young people use consumption within a process of family dissolution. Skaar’s study of participants on the Piczo social networking site usefully challenges superficial accounts of participation online by distinguishing between ‘collectors’ and ‘elaborators’ on a popular children’s site. Rysst from Norway and Lemish and Elias in Israel contribute two studies of the role of clothing in young people’s identity formation: in the first study tweens discuss sexualized clothing in Norway within their own peer-group norms of pre-sexual ‘kul’ (cool), and the latter study explores how clothing is used in identity formation by young émigrés from Russia to Israel. Clothing choices become the ‘social skin’ to be interpreted in relationships between immigrants and locals.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>These publications explore an unruly territory where new research objects are jostling for space at the same time that familiar tensions continue to present themselves: childhood and its relationship to adulthood; young people’s encounters with media/consumer/material culture; children and their families in diverse cultures. It can feel as though there is no shared centre, until it becomes clear that all these scholars are part of a larger, urgent task: to shape a research agenda that better enables us to understand the paradoxical shifts in media and consumer culture and their implications for coming generations. As Buckingham and Tingstad put it:<disp-quote>
<p>… it is entirely possible that children (or indeed adults) may be active and sophisticated readers of media, but might, nevertheless, still be influenced – or indeed that an ‘illusion’ of autonomy might be one of the pre-requisites of contemporary consumer culture. (p. 5)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>If there is a take-away message from reading this diverse group of publications it is that we need more research into both children’s responses to consumer culture, and the state of childhood. Yes, we need to broaden our understanding of how children are agents in their culturally and geographically diverse families, schools and playgrounds (which include media). But we also need research into the larger frameworks of power which shape choices that children can make. Young people are exposed to the same societal forces as the adult world, and this world is overwhelmingly created by those who did not for a minute think of it from the point of view children, or, indeed, in terms of their best interest.</p>
