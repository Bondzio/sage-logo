<p>This slim volume helps to fill in an important corner of the “news agency” story by relating the story of the television news video-providing firms (now just two of them), based in London. Based on the author’s doctoral dissertation (University of Texas–Austin), this melds history (two chapters) with description and analysis to show how multiple players operating years ago compressed into today’s AP Television News and Reuters Television.</p>
<p>With his research, Paterson, a senior lecturer at the Institute of Communications Studies at the University of Leeds, provides the first comprehensive study of how television news agencies work and describes a system of news production that has shaped the world’s shared visual history since the 1950s (indeed, the first such operation began three years before that). The book is based on some two decades of data-gathering, document analysis, video content analysis, news production ethnography (participant observation), and interviews.</p>
<p>Paterson’s book discusses the television agencies’ crucial role as agents of globalization, how they manufacture our image of the world, and their dangerous work providing images of conflict. Several case studies of agency coverage underpin the study, including the war in Kosovo and elsewhere in the Balkans, and the growing focus on news personnel safety resulting from such situations. Two charts help clarify the video news process and the changing cast of agency players in the market.</p>
<p>While the documented study can be seen as something of a tribute to this small (and, to the viewing public, largely unknown) tribe of journalists, it is also a warning that we should all better understand the power and potential harm of the system in which they operate.</p>
