<p>This is a very difficult piece to reply to as it engages so minimally with the substance of my original article, ‘From War to Security: Security Studies, the Wider Agenda, and the Fate of the Study of War’. Instead, Claudia Aradau appears most concerned to defend Critical Security Studies from critique. Apparently, among other things, I homogenise Critical Security Studies through ‘a technique of ambiguous equivalences’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0305829812451974">1</xref></sup> It may come as some surprise to readers of ‘Security, War, Violence’ that my article hardly mentions Critical Security Studies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0305829812451974">2</xref></sup> Rather, I was primarily concerned with traditional security studies, on the one hand, and the ‘wider agenda’ – the idea that anything can be ‘securitised’ – on the other. My argument was that, in International Relations (IR), the study of war was largely a casualty of the debate between these two positions. Traditional security studies dealt with strategy not war, while the wider agenda was concerned with the logic of security itself. As a consequence, a discipline that imagines itself as centrally concerned with questions of war and peace does not in fact study war, part of a larger elision of war in the Enlightenment organisation of social and political inquiry. I go on in the article to outline the astounding absence of the Second World War in IR scholarship and then map out some ways in which the critical study of war leads us to think differently about the ‘international’ as a distinct space for inquiry. I was seeking to outline a ‘critical war studies’ for IR, to frame and enable a new direction for research.</p>
<p>Very little of this shows up in Aradau’s critique. Rather, against my supposed homogenising of the ‘heterogeneous field’ of Critical Security Studies, she provides an overview of Critical Security Studies, with a focus on securitisation theory.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0305829812451974">3</xref></sup> She argues that the study of war should be subsumed into the study of violence in general, so as to avoid ‘old hierarchies’ which prioritise and reify war.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0305829812451974">4</xref></sup> Along the way, a totalising argument is made to the effect that war cannot ever ‘be disentangled from security’, that war is ‘inseparable from security’ in contemporary practice, and that ‘security and war are mutually constitutive’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0305829812451974">5</xref></sup> One wonders how a Latin term (<italic>sēcūritās)</italic> that entered English usage in the 15th century could possibly entrap in their entirety the global histories of war, histories that pre-date Rome and well exceed Eurocentric much less anglophone orders, past and present.</p>
<p>For me, most of all, ‘Security, War, Violence’ raises questions about the possibility of scholarly engagement in a discipline that imagines itself composed of rival camps and in an academy that leaves us so little time and energy for reading, while demanding we write at an industrial pace. My very point was that ‘old hierarchies’ are <italic>not</italic> what we have been led to believe; war was not centred as an object of inquiry by traditional security studies and realist IR. In the course of her motivated overview of Critical Security Studies, Aradau badly misrepresents my position, in part, I believe, because what I have to say is so tangential to what she wants to say. Below I first provide a corrective, before taking up Aradau’s larger claim, that the study of war is bound to that of security, and that only through security (as understood in Critical Security Studies) can we properly grasp the politics of war and violence.</p>
<p>The first point to make concerns the notion that I have ‘homogenised’ Critical Security Studies. Any article, for reasons of space and clarity, ruthlessly brackets everything that it is not directly about. I was not writing about Critical Security Studies, nor would I argue that as a field it can be collapsed into securitisation theory. For one thing, that is an approach which straddles critical, liberal and constructivist perspectives (among others). Aradau’s rendition of the diversity of Critical Security Studies paradoxically borders on equating it with securitisation theory. This, dare I say it, is a ‘homogenising’ move based on an ‘ambiguous equivalence’. I was specifically concerned with the intrinsic connection between securitisation theory and the wider agenda. The very purpose of securitisation theory is to centre ‘logics of security’ and demote specifically military threat as the focus of security studies. I was firing what I regarded as a well-aimed shot at a scholarly formation that obfuscates critical possibilities for the study of war. A scattershot account of the diversity of Critical Security Studies (a field ‘traversed by contestations and debates about the logic of security, its practices, meanings and political effects’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0305829812451974">6</xref></sup>) is not a response to this argument.</p>
<p>A second point concerns Aradau’s charge that I do not deal with the ‘discursive constitution’ of war and that I ‘eschew the problem of naming, of what counts as war and what not or how naming a conflict as war carries political effects’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0305829812451974">7</xref></sup> My discussion of the Second World War is specifically invoked as an example. In making this point, Aradau cites Laleh Khalili’s critique of Stathis Kalyvas’s conception of ‘civil war’. She concludes by saying that the study of war cannot be separated from the analysis of power/knowledge relations and processes of subjectification, as if I had suggested otherwise.</p>
<p>One purpose of my discussion of the Second World War in ‘From War to Security’ was to point out that IR takes for granted that it knows what this war consisted of and when it happened. In the course of this discussion, I make precisely the point Khalili does in respect of Kalyvas, that understandings of ‘civil’ and ‘interstate’ war in the discipline, derived from the Correlates of War project, are profoundly confused and work to obscure international dimensions and political effects.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0305829812451974">8</xref></sup> In fact, I have critiqued Correlates of War several times on just these points.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0305829812451974">9</xref></sup> I argue for a spatially and temporally expansive vision of the Second World War on the grounds that the relations that comprise war cannot be framed and contained in conventional ways. Let me quote one sentence to provide a flavour of the argument:
<disp-quote>
<p>Thus the Second World War, which still appears every day on our television screens, its victorious order of battle still sitting on the UN Security Council, its discourses and contested memories still informing identity politics in and beyond the West, is safely contained by CoW [Correlates of War] between the dates of 1939 and 1945.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0305829812451974">10</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Just how does this ‘eschew the problem of naming’? If the very use of the proper name ‘Second World War’ is enough to raise hackles about hierarchy and naming, my discussion in ‘From War to Security’ makes clear that the ontology of war, in my view, is <italic>relational</italic> and that terms like Second World War denote a broad <italic>field</italic> of relations in time and space.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0305829812451974">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>As for my supposed overlooking of discursive constitution and power/knowledge relations, it is simply not accurate to claim, as Aradau does, that I believe war can be separated from the ‘modes of knowledge, power relations, and political subjectivities’ that make it possible.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0305829812451974">12</xref></sup> ‘From War to Security’ provides a variety of examples and discussions of the constitutive effects of war as a field of relations, both in respect of the Second World War and the Vietnam War. Here are some quotes:
<disp-quote>
<p>If we accept that war is a socially generative force, we cannot take for granted the identities of the entities that engage in it, nor define its geographic and temporal scope solely in terms of sovereign territorial states and their battle casualties. This is especially so in the case of a war that played out in interconnected ways across different regions, articulating various peoples and their diverse struggles, transforming political entities and producing new ones.</p>
<p>The extraordinary social energies generated by the violences and sacrifices of war continue to work their effects long after the guns fall silent, and they do so in ways that constitutively interconnect peoples and places.</p>
<p>This impact continues in everything from Hollywood films to electoral politics to the subjectivities of people transformed by wartime events.’ ‘Mary Renda’s <italic>Taking Haiti</italic> explores both the experience of US occupying forces in Haiti and the effects of various representations of this experience in US society, working out some of the constitutive social and cultural connections between war front and home front.</p>
<p>The international histories and sociologies by which anti-imperial violent struggles are interconnected, shaping one another as well as culture, society and politics in the West and elsewhere, represent an almost wholly unexamined area for inquiry.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0305829812451974">13</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Contrast the above quotes with Aradau’s assertion that ‘discursive constitution is surprisingly absent from Barkawi’s discussion of war’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0305829812451974">14</xref></sup> In ‘From War to Security’ and in other work, I have developed a <italic>position</italic> on the constitutive effects of war as well as on the processes of subject formation and transformation war sets in train.</p>
<p>It is hard to get away from the idea that the real problem Aradau has with my work is that I did not approach my subject through the Critical Security Studies scholarship she cites, and that my use of a general critical theoretic vocabulary – discourse, constitution, power/knowledge – did not accord directly with the instantiation of these terms in that scholarship. The worrying implication is of some kind of Critical Security Studies ownership of these terms, or that they can only be recognised in the forms they take in Critical Security Studies. How else to explain Aradau’s inability to see that I did, in fact, write about war and discursive constitution? Consider in this vein Aradau’s argument that the critical study of war should ‘ally’ with Critical Security Studies, but only after renaming its object of inquiry ‘violence’ and taking on board the conceptual apparatus of Critical Security Studies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0305829812451974">15</xref></sup> This amounts to an imperialising move whereby, among other things, a derivative field of study comes to occupy the theorists and philosophers who originally provided its intellectual resources.</p>
<p>Accordingly, I turn now to some of the totalising moments in ‘Security, War, Violence’, and in particular to the notion that ‘War can … not be disentangled from security, when security is understood as a discursive practice by means of which an actor presents an issue as an existential threat that justifies extraordinary measures to neutralise that threat.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0305829812451974">16</xref></sup> The way Aradau collapses Critical Security Studies, and now war, into securitisation theory is evident here. The absurdity of her claim becomes apparent when one realises that, more or less explicitly, securitisation theory was developed to consider security debates in the Western democracies, and while it is not wholly restricted to this context, that is the most appropriate domain of inquiry. One reason for this, as I discuss at some length in ‘From War to Security’, is that the salience of the term ‘security’ has dramatically shifted and intensified in Western states and societies since the interwar period.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0305829812451974">17</xref></sup> Discourse analysis is historical, and ‘national security’ much less ‘security’ simply do not have the same valences in times and places outside the contemporary West. More generally, there are things one might want to say about war that do not have anything to do with ‘security’ much less securitisation theory. To take just two examples, in <italic>Wretched of the Earth</italic>, Frantz Fanon attends to the role of violent, anti-colonial revolt (i.e. of a form of war) in the constitution of new, anti-imperialist political identities. Fanon does not conceive of violence as a ‘threat’ but rather a profoundly fraught means to this outcome.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0305829812451974">18</xref></sup> In his masterful <italic>The Great War and Modern Memory</italic>, Paul Fussell shows how the contemporary meaning of ‘irony’ in politics and culture was an outcome of the experience and representation of the First World War.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0305829812451974">19</xref></sup> These are some of the kinds of inquiries that are opened up when one shifts from studying security to studying war.</p>
<p>Consider another such shift. Aradau takes up my discussion of how securitisation theory risks uncritically reflecting a liberal politics of war. This is so, for example, in the way in which ‘security’ is imagined as ‘defence’ against a threat, obviating the possibility of liberal wars of aggression, or at the least participating in their legitimation as ultimately ‘defensive’ in character. Aradau notes how securitisation theory entails a world in which elites attempt to convince one another and publics of the legitimacy of their securitising moves. Here, one glimpses the centrality of Western democratic contexts, with their media and public spheres, for securitisation theory, as opposed to the broader historical purview of ‘war’ as a category. Aradau points out that, for Didier Bigo and Barry Buzan, albeit in different ways, securitisation ‘takes place in the discursive interaction between elites and masses, within a communicative space where the elites need to convince the masses about their security claims’. The result is that those ‘constructed as dangerous’ are disappeared in theory and practice: ‘A field where structural positions are occupied by security professionals has no space for those constructed as dangerous.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0305829812451974">20</xref></sup> Carrying on with this debate internal to Critical Security Studies, Aradau goes on to note the ways in which feminist and poststructural work has sought to recover from dominant security discourses the voices of the abject, the silenced and the dangerous. This serves as an example of how Aradau deploys surveys of debates in Critical Security Studies instead of engaging with my arguments.</p>
<p>What she overlooks is the shocking presence of ‘dangerous’ subjects when one shifts attention from ‘security’ to ‘war’. As I discuss in ‘From War to Security’ and elsewhere, anti-colonial resistance in Algeria, Mozambique and Angola achieved regime change in France and Portugal; revolutionary peasants in Vietnam brought down two US presidents and shaped US politics, culture and society for the next 30 years and beyond; while, more recently, ragtag insurgents in Iraq and Afghanistan have put an end to America’s ‘unipolar moment’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0305829812451974">21</xref></sup> Through the interconnections between societies occasioned by war, amid the staggering reversals possible on battlefields, the ‘dominated’ can work their will – and many other effects – upon the powerful. It was in part to draw scholars’ attention to the constitutive effects of the shocks of war that I wrote ‘From War to Security’.</p>
<p>A final totalising move in ‘Security, War, Violence’ is the idea that the study of war should be subsumed under the category of ‘violence’. The reasons offered for this are: violence does not entail a hierarchy in which war is privileged; a focus on violence encourages us to see war in relational terms and makes visible other kinds of violence besides that of war; and that the analysis of violence somehow enables the disentangling of politics from war and a proper critique of liberal violence.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0305829812451974">22</xref></sup> I have no particular objection to the study of violence, and I certainly think there should be more of it in the social sciences. However, why and how this obviates or subsumes the study of war is obscure to me. Is war not historically significant enough to justify inquiry into it? War is a more specific category relative to violence in general, referring to reciprocal organised violence between political entities. I make no claims that the study of war should be privileged over that of other forms of violence. Both the violence of war, and that of, say, patriarchy, demand scholarly attention, but they are also distinct if related topics requiring different forms of theorisation and inquiry. As for relationality, the category of war is already inherently relational; one does not need the concept of violence in general to see this. What precisely distinguishes war from many other kinds of violence, such as genocide or massacre, is that war is a relational form of violence in which the other side shoots back. This is ultimately the source of war’s generative social powers, for it is amidst the clash of arms that the truths which define social and political orders are brought into question. A broader focus on violence in general risks losing this central, distinctive character of the violence of war. Is it really more theoretically or politically adequate to start referring to the Second World War as an instance of ‘violence’? Equally, while I am all for the analysis of liberal violence, another broad category which would include issues of ‘structural violence’, I also think we have far from exhausted the subject of liberalism and war, an important area of inquiry now dominated by the mostly self-serving nostrums of the liberal peace debates.</p>
<p>What perhaps is most interesting about Aradau’s remarks on violence is that she assumes we know what war <italic>is</italic>. So, for example, she suggests that we attend to a continuum of violence in which war is considered alongside ‘insurrections, revolts, revolutions, insurgencies, rebellions, seditions, disobediences, riots and uprisings’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0305829812451974">23</xref></sup> Apparently, on her understanding, these other things are not war, even though most of them typically involve reciprocal, organised violence. This is precisely to take as given the IR disciplinary view of ‘real interstate war’ that underlies Correlates of War and other mainstream work. This is the definition of war that I sought to critique in ‘From War to Security’, a critique Aradau has overlooked. I was posing new questions and possibilities for the study of war, not proffering definitive answers about what war is and what it is not, or about where and when it starts and ends.</p>
<p>It is, I would suggest, Aradau who is most concerned about hierarchy and privilege, particularly in respect of perceived slights to Critical Security Studies and her demand that any study of war be in dialogue with Critical Security Studies. In this, she overlooks the fact that, conceived another way, with a more holistic vision of the community of relevant scholars, my article was already an engagement with critical inquiry into security relations. Perhaps it was the opening rhetoric of my article that inspired Aradau’s ire, my reference to partygoers from Copenhagen and Aberystwyth dancing on graves, or my suggestion that contemporary ‘wider agenda’ security scholars know rather less about the composition of carrier battle groups than did their traditional predecessors.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0305829812451974">24</xref></sup> But does anyone seriously doubt that ‘wider agenda’ scholars are less familiar with histories and sociologies of wars and militaries than were the traditional predecessors, who even so still managed to overlook their significance? These passages were meant to serve a very specific purpose, to denaturalise our images of the new and old security studies, and to open up the reader to the possibility that, with respect to the study of war, these fields of study share more in common than is conceivable within the current terms of debate. <italic>Neither</italic> traditional nor ‘wider agenda’ security studies are centrally interested in war. Given the significance of war in the human past and present, and the dire state of the study of war in the Anglo-American academy, this seems to me a serious problem for critical thought.</p>
