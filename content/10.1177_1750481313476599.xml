<abstract>
<p>Past research on talk radio discourses has illustrated the crucial role of the hosts in managing the conversation and shaping the voices of callers. However, past research focused mostly on dyadic host–caller interactions. Radio talk shows in Hong Kong, in contrast, often have more than one host. This study is interested in the implications of the triadic setting of radio talk shows in Hong Kong. It uses Radio Television Hong Kong’s evening program <italic>Open Line Open View</italic> as a case study. Employing the techniques of conversation analysis, this study replicates some of past studies’ findings about the source of host power. More importantly, the analysis shows that the second host in a triadic setting can play three important roles: the program conductor, the buffer, and the counterweight. The micro-level interactional patterns have important implications for the overall character of the program itself and the role of talk radio in the politics of public opinion in Hong Kong. More generally, this study illustrates the utility of paying attention to the differences between dyads and triads in the microsociological analysis of conversations in broadcast media.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Public affairs phone-in talk shows in the broadcast media have received plenty of research attention in the past two decades. They provide ordinary people with a platform to express opinions, share experiences, criticize the authorities, and even challenge experts or government officials directly. As such, phone-in talk shows are regarded by some scholars as an electronic public sphere and a democratic forum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1750481313476599">Herbst, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1750481313476599">Kurpius and Mendelson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1750481313476599">Leurdijk, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1750481313476599">Livingstone and Lunt, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, broadcast talk shows are media programs produced by organizations with their own concerns. Different programs have their own setup and basic structure. The program conductors may adopt specific styles, rules, or norms. All these factors mediate the public opinion expressed in the programs. More specifically, a set of past studies have focused on the roles played by the hosts in managing the program and the conversations in it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1750481313476599">Giles, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1750481313476599">Hutchby, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1750481313476599">Maynard, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1750481313476599">Wood, 2001</xref>). Underlying many such studies are two intertwined arguments. First, the hosts and the ordinary citizens in audience participation programs are not equally powerful in shaping the conversation. Second, the hosts’ conversational management – the way the hosts manage the flow of conversation within the programs to achieve production, professional, and/or political goals – significantly shapes the ‘voice of the people’.</p>
<p>This article follows the above line of thinking in its study of radio phone-in talk shows in Hong Kong, which has constituted a prominent site for the communication of public opinion in the city since the mid-1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1750481313476599">Lee, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1750481313476599">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1750481313476599">Ma and Chan, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1750481313476599">So and Lee, 2007</xref>). However, few studies have applied the techniques of conversation analysis (CA) or other forms of discourse analysis to examine the actual citizen–host interactions in the programs (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1750481313476599">Lee and Lin, 2011</xref>). More importantly, a specific feature of radio phone-in talk shows in Hong Kong is that they often have more than one host. The citizen–host conversations in the programs, thus, often involve triadic interactions in which the two hosts may take up different roles and alignments. This article contends that paying attention to the triadic setup of the conversation is important in understanding the micro-level interactions and their implications for the role of talk radio in communicating public opinion in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The article begins with a brief discussion of the literature on the role and power of the hosts in broadcast talk shows. It then briefly introduces the contextual background and sets up the specific research questions. The empirical analysis focuses on the program <italic>Open Line Open View</italic> (<italic>OLOV</italic>) produced by Radio Television Hong Kong (RTHK), one of the most prominent phone-in programs in the city at the time of the study.</p>

<title>The role and power of the host in talk radio</title>
<p>While CA was originally developed to analyze everyday sociable conversation not restricted to a particular format or tied to the implementation of a specific duty, sociolinguists have applied the technique to institutional talk. As defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1750481313476599">Drew and Heritage (1992</xref>: 3), the interactions in institutional settings are ‘basically task-related and they involve at least one participant who represents a formal organization of some kind’. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1750481313476599">Goffman (1983)</xref> argued that analyzing conversational interaction could reveal the institutional order linked to the identities of the participants and to macro-level social organization. Conversations in classrooms, in court trials, or during medical examinations are examples of frequently analyzed institutional talk (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1750481313476599">Drew, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1750481313476599">Hutchby, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1750481313476599">Markee and Kasper, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>More specifically, in many types of institutional talk, one group of speakers (teachers, lawyers, doctors) is assigned the role to ask questions, while another group of speakers (students, plaintiffs, patients) is requested to answer questions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1750481313476599">Hutchby, 2006</xref>). This role differentiation is engendered by the pre-existing institutional settings where the conversation is conducted. Analyzing the questioner–answerer interaction is a way to examine the reproductions, negotiations, and contestations of power and control in institutional settings.</p>
<p>This conception of institutional talk is highly pertinent to the analysis of conversations in various types of broadcast programs, such as journalistic interviews, press conferences, and broadcast talk shows (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1750481313476599">Clayman and Heritage, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1750481313476599">Heritage, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1750481313476599">Tolson, 2001</xref>). In a seminal study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1750481313476599">Hutchby (1996)</xref> adopted such a perspective and developed the notion of a ‘first–second’ sequence in analyzing talk radio conversations in the UK. The talk show conversation usually begins by the caller presenting his or her opinion on a specific issue, and the host sequentially responds to the caller’s viewpoint.</p>
<p>On the surface, the callers seem to set the conversational agenda. However, by adopting the second position, the host has the first opportunity for opposition. Instead of giving one’s own view, the host can simply ask the caller questions and/or pick on a weakness or mistake in the caller’s speech. Certainly, the hosts may not always oppose the caller, and there are also instances in which the callers can successfully take up the ‘second position’ and compel the hosts to express their opinions. Overall, though, the basic conversational setting favors the host, and the realization of the first–second sequence is a major source of host power.</p>
<p>The studies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1750481313476599">Hutchby (1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1750481313476599">2006</xref>), however, focused on talk shows in which the conversations are essentially dialogic (i.e. they occur between a single host and a single caller). In other talk shows, triadic conversational relationships may be involved, and the possible conversational arrangement and management may become more complicated.</p>
<p>A triadic conversation could be significantly different from a dialogue because of the additional possibilities of different types of alignments among the three people involved. In sociological theory, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1750481313476599">Simmel (1950)</xref> elaborated on the substantial differences between the dyad and the triad due to the presence of the ‘third element’ in the latter. As he stated, ‘the appearance of the third party indicates transition, conciliation, and abandonment of absolute contrast’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1750481313476599">Simmel, 1950</xref>: 145). He further suggested that, in cases when two persons are in conflict with each other, the third element can play three roles, namely the non-partisan/mediator, the <italic>tertius gaudens</italic> (who benefits from the conflict between the first two persons), and the <italic>divide et impera</italic> (who separates the two sides). By playing these three roles, three different group formations will appear. In reality, the range of possible group formation is likely to be even wider. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1750481313476599">Simmel’s (1950)</xref> insights highlighted the potential utility of paying attention to the characteristics of the triad.</p>
<p>A few studies on broadcast conversations have indeed analyzed triadic conversations. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1750481313476599">Giles (2002)</xref>, for instance, analyzed the British television talk show <italic>Gilroy</italic>, which involved not only a host and citizen-participants, but also experts as guests. In such settings, a key question would be how the host aligns himself or herself with either the citizen-participants or the experts. In turn, this would bear crucially on whether the programs indeed allow laypeople to challenge elite discourses and authority.</p>
<p>Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1750481313476599">Lee and Lin (2011)</xref> analyzed a Hong Kong radio talk show featuring the participation of top government officials. They found that the attending government officials seldom interact directly with the citizen-callers. Rather, the conversational flow is typically broken down into a host–caller dialogue followed by a host–official dialogue. This setup, according to their analysis, is crucial in understanding how the host manages the conversation, protects the official from serious face-threats, and, thus, constructs a safe and friendly discursive environment for the officials. This arrangement, nonetheless, tends to prevent the attending official from properly performing his or her accountability.</p>
<p>The following analysis also focused on talk shows that involve a triadic conversational setup. Instead of having a host, a caller, and an elite guest, the analyzed case involved a caller plus two hosts. Having more than one host can be highly important. A radio talk show host has to handle multiple tasks. She or he needs to engage in conversation with the caller, while also managing the flow of the program. The co-hosting arrangement may allow a division of labor between the hosts. More importantly, having a second host adds to the varieties in possible alignment patterns. The two hosts can align with each other and against the caller, one can align with the caller against the other host, or one of the hosts can play the role of a neutral moderator in a host–caller debate. Adding further complexities into the picture is the possibility of shifting alignment during the conversation.</p>
<p>From a conversation analytic perspective, having different possible patterns of alignment is not a trivial matter. An important question is to what extent, how, and for what purposes the different alignment patterns are realized through talk. To tackle this question, we placed the talk radio programs into a broader social and political context.</p>

<title>Context: Talk radio in Hong Kong</title>
<p>Radio phone-in talk shows have existed in Hong Kong for decades. However, since the mid-1990s, such shows have become a prominent platform for the communication of public opinion. During the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003, for example, popular morning talk radio host Albert Cheng even acquired the nickname of ‘Chief Executive of Hong Kong before 10 a.m.’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1750481313476599">Ma and Chan, 2006</xref>). Through survey studies, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1750481313476599">Lee (2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1750481313476599">2007</xref>) showed that talk radio serves as a platform for citizens, especially those with pro-democracy viewpoints, to share their views. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1750481313476599">So and Lee (2007)</xref>, on the other hand, saw talk radio as ‘the people’s council’ in the city.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, as the most popular radio talk shows often exhibit a ‘pro-democracy bias’, it is widely believed that Chinese officials have attempted to suppress the development of the medium. In 2003, after a huge anti-government rally in July, Chinese officials pinpointed ‘one newspaper, one magazine, and two mouths’ as major mobilizers behind the rally, with the two mouths referring to the two most popular radio talk show hosts at the time. In mid-2004, three famous phone-in talk show hosts resigned in quick succession, citing political pressure as their major reason to quit.</p>
<p>These events did not lead to the disappearance of talk radio. Broadcasters continued to produce such programs in the name of providing a public service, but they exhibited a tendency to ‘balance’ their radio phone-in programs. For example, for about a decade, until the end of 2011, RTHK invited Robert Chow, a public figure widely regarded as having conservative political views, to cohost the morning phone-in talk show <italic>Tipping Point</italic> with a veteran journalist. Within the same period, RTHK continued to let Chi-sum Ng, well known for his pro-democracy views, to host the early evening show <italic>OLOV</italic>. This allowed a ‘balance’ between the two programs.</p>
<p>Moreover, ‘balance’ can also be achieved within a single show by having two hosts with contrasting views. Until the end of 2011, <italic>OLOV</italic> involved a number of guest hosts to partner Chi-sum Ng in turn. One of the guest hosts, Pui-king Lau, was a member of the largest conservative political party in Hong Kong. Hence, a balance was kept between pro-democracy and pro-establishment when Ng and Lau co-hosted the program.</p>
<p>Balance is not the sole reason for the co-hosting arrangement though. Instead, the co-hosting arrangement has been a conventional practice for talk shows in Hong Kong since the 1970s and 1980s. It is difficult to ascertain what originally motivated the co-hosting arrangement. But it can be noted that, for most radio phone-in programs in Hong Kong in the past and present, one of the two hosts would be more famous, celebrated, and/or influential in the public arena. In this sense, a possible function of having two hosts is to allow the more famous host to ‘perform’ and impose his/her personality onto the show, while letting another host do the ‘dirty work’ of managing the program flow. It is, therefore, also understandable that, in some programs, the more famous host would partner an experienced journalist. This was the case in the aforementioned <italic>Tipping Point</italic> of RTHK. It was also the case for <italic>Teacup in a Storm</italic>, the most popular phone-in talk show in Hong Kong in the late 1990s and early 2000s, with popular host Albert Cheng partnering veteran media worker Yuk-wah Lam. It is not crucial for us to pinpoint all possible reasons behind the co-hosting arrangement here. The intended and realized effects of the arrangement may vary across programs, depending on who partners whom and how the two hosts actually interact.</p>
<p>To recapitulate, past research on talk radio discourse has illustrated the important role of the host in shaping the expression of ‘public opinion’ in broadcast talk shows. In a host–caller dialogue, the host can be considered as structurally privileged by the basic conversational setup. Yet CA emphasizes that ‘structural privilege’ has to be realized through the actual host–caller interactions, and there can be negotiation and contestation of host power in the process.</p>
<p>For talk radio in Hong Kong, the presence of a ‘second host’ adds to the potential complexities of the conversational interactions. The co-hosting arrangement may facilitate different types of division of labor between the two hosts. In addition, within the context of the politics of public opinion in the city, an interesting question would be whether the co-hosting arrangement has facilitated a ‘balanced discussion’ in the programs. Based on these arguments, the following research questions are posed to guide the empirical analysis:</p>

<title>Methods and data</title>
<p>This article uses <italic>OLOV</italic> as a case study. Aired by the public broadcaster RTHK since the early 1990s, the program is one of the most prominent public affairs talk shows in the city. The program underwent a major hosting rearrangement at the end of 2011, but this study examined the program prior to the change. Its main host in the earlier period was Chi-sum Ng, a prominent media commentator known for his liberal orientation and critical views toward the government. A number of guest hosts took turns to co-host the program with Ng.</p>
<p>The actual sample analyzed consisted of 24 episodes aired between December 2009 and November 2010, which were selected through a systematic sampling procedure. All 24 episodes were hosted by Ng with a series of four co-hosts. Of the co-hosts, two were politicians (Ada Wong and Pui-king Lau), one was an academic (Lisa Leung), and the fourth was a professional journalist (Yin-ping Chan). <italic>OLOV</italic> is aired every weekday between 5 p.m. and 8 p.m., with a half-hour newscast inserted between 6:30 and 7 p.m. Therefore, each episode was 2.5 hours in length, and the 24 episodes combined to offer 60 hours of materials for analysis. Over 300 calls were involved in the 24 episodes.</p>
<p>As stated previously, this study applied the techniques of CA to examine the calls. CA was first developed by the British scholar Harvey Sacks, while its main intellectual inspirations can be traced to the works of sociologist Erving Goffman and anthropologist Harold Garfinkel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1750481313476599">Čmejrková and Prevignano, 2003</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1750481313476599">Garfinkel (1967)</xref> indicated that CA recognizes the importance of understanding and intersubjectivity in conversation. The basic objective of CA, as defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1750481313476599">Goodwin and Heritage (1990</xref>: 283), is ‘to describe the underlying social organization – conceived as an institutionalized substratum of rules, procedures, and conventions – through which orderly and intelligible interaction is made possible’. The underlying social structure and power relation can be observed through recorded conversational interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1750481313476599">Sacks, 1984</xref>).</p>
<p>CA, therefore, is essentially interpretive. Broadly speaking, CA shares with ethnography the aim of providing a thick description (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1750481313476599">Geertz, 1973</xref>) of empirical social and cultural phenomena. For this study, the authors listened through the programs carefully and repeatedly to look for specific patterns of conversational interactions between the hosts and the callers that were relevant to the research questions posed. Attention was paid to speaker alignment, role-differentiation between the hosts, and specific discursive strategies involved in the reproduction and/or negotiation of host power.</p>
<p>The analysis was based on Cantonese transcripts, but only the translated transcripts were reported. The English transcript largely followed the conventions used in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1750481313476599">Hutchby and Wooffitt (1998)</xref>, but only a simplified set of notations was used. This was partly because of the difficulty involved in applying some of the notations to the translated transcripts. The placements of specific words within a sentence often had to be changed in the translation process, and it made the insertion of notations closely related to the positions of specific words within a sentence very problematic. The <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1750481313476599">Appendix</xref> includes a list indicating the meanings of the notations.</p>
<p>As in most qualitative research, the most important concern of the analysis was not the frequencies of appearance of specific interactional patterns or discursive strategies; the aim was to illustrate the range of patterns involved and to interpret their significance contextually. The following sections are organized thematically based on the results of the interpretive analysis. The extracts used are representative not in the statistical sense, but in the sense of being among the most illustrative instances.</p>

<title>Power in a host–caller dialogue</title>
<p>This article is mainly interested in the triadic conversation in <italic>OLOV</italic>. However, the analysis began by focusing on the role and power of the host in a host–caller dialogue. This can illustrate the applicability of insights developed in past research to the Hong Kong case, while also illustrating certain basic characteristics of <italic>OLOV</italic>. Specifically, Extract 1 illustrates how the host’s ‘second position’ in the typical talk radio conversational sequence put him in a privileged position.</p>
<p>Extract 1, 15 February 2010 (H1: Chi-sum Ng; H2: Lisa Leung; C: Caller)</p>
<p>T1 C: The government said they’d build private universities {……} but we all know that this policy actually can do nothing to help current or future students. Because, actually, I’m afraid they can’t get recognition. Yes.</p>
<p>T2 H1: Private universities won’t be recognized by the society, you’re afraid.</p>
<p>T3 C: Yes, for example, the old ones, the eight universities, you’d probably choose them rather than the private universities. [It’s like the private universities</p>
<p>T4 H1:      [No, the private universities don’t exist yet; you claim it can’t get social recognition?</p>
<p>T5 C: No, <underline>because</underline>, for example, the Hang Seng School of Commerce, it wants to [change=</p>
<p>T6 H1: [Want to do</p>
<p>T7 H2: [Oh, okay.</p>
<p>T8 C: [=into a private university. And it now, yes, actually its reputation is okay, but after all, we don’t know what will happen. [Hong Kong has never tried this.</p>
<p>T9 H1:      [Oh, so we <underline>don’t know</underline> what will happen; you should not conclude so soon that it won’t get social recognition.</p>
<p>The caller stated early in the call that she hoped the government could increase university student quotas. At T1, the caller argued that the planned development of private universities would not solve the problem. Throughout the conversation, Ng (i.e. H1) did not express his views on the matter. Instead, at T2, he first formulated the gist of the caller’s view. He then challenged the caller at T4 by a question of logic. As the caller struggled to provide a coherent response and stated that no one knows what will happen, the host immediately picked up the caller’s ‘self-contradiction’ at T9. Notably, Ng’s assertive hosting style is shown not only by how he criticized the caller, but also by how he repeatedly started his turns before the caller finished hers. Both T4 and T9 started with overlapping speech. The caller was effectively deprived of the chance to elaborate her views.</p>
<p>Occupying the second position not only allows the host to gain the upper hand when debating with the caller, the host can also influence the direction of the conversation by asking questions strategically. Extract 2 provides an example of this. The call was about the cancellation of flights by the <italic>Viva Macau Airlines</italic> (<italic>VMA</italic>), a budget airline that sank into financial crisis. The caller detailed his experiences early in the call. Extract 2 begins from the middle part of the conversation.</p>
<p>Extract 2, 29 March 2010 (H1: Chi-sum Ng; H2: Lisa Leung; C: Caller)</p>
<p>T1 H2: There have already been some problems, right?</p>
<p>T2 C: Yes. If you look at the newspapers in August or September last year, it was mentioned. Of course, it was not as serious as this time.</p>
<p>T3 H1: There seems to be a lot of discussions online, right?</p>
<p>T4 C: Yes, because I like self-guided tours, so I know this very clearly</p>
<p>T5 H1: But do you know Viva’s background? Like who’s behind it, such things.</p>
<p>T6 C: I only know that he’s an entrepreneur in Macau as well as a red entrepreneur in mainland China.</p>
<p>T7 H2: Yes.</p>
<p>T8 H1: Yes, a red person.</p>
<p>After a couple of questions that solicited simple information from the caller, at T5 the host asked the caller whether he knew the background of <italic>VMA</italic>. The caller answered that the owner of <italic>VMA</italic> was a ‘red entrepreneur’ (i.e. an entrepreneur with close connections with the Chinese government). Although Ng did not explicitly make the claim, listeners of the program were likely, based on the principle of relevance, to take the question as a suggestion that the airline’s failure and the owner’s background were connected. Extract 2, thus, illustrates how the second position allows the host to direct the flow of the conversations through strategically placed and phrased questions.</p>
<p>Certainly, host power can be contested and negotiated. Some callers might resist by turning over the sequence and questioning the host. Extract 3 is an example of this. The subject of the call was a protest held by university students at a local university’s graduation ceremony.</p>
<p>Extract 3, 10 December 2009 (H1: Chi-sum Ng; H2: Ada Wong; C: Caller)</p>
<p>T1 C: I, I want to condemn those students.</p>
<p>T2 H1: Condemn the [students.</p>
<p>T3 C:  [They’re really, <underline>rude and impolite</underline>, um, selfish {……} the tassels on my hat were scratched, and it’s over, twenty years’ efforts, I, [I hope</p>
<p>T4 H1:     [<underline>They can keep on scratching the tassels</underline>, [No interruption</p>
<p>T5 C:   [Ah, so you, it’s so precious, [you, you, you do this</p>
<p>T6 H1:        [No interruption, ah</p>
<p>T7 H2: [No, the ceremony today was not interrupted.</p>
<p>T8 C: [You messed it up. You messed up the day. How do they feel? If, Mister Ng, your two daughters met with such things, how would you feel?</p>
<p>T9 H1: <underline>You, you ask me?</underline> I’ll answer you, okay? I would <underline>accept that WILLINGLY</underline>, of course::.</p>
<p>T10 C: You’re really, you’re really, you’re giving irresponsible comments from an onlooker’s view. Now your [daughter</p>
<p>T11 H1:    [What, what irresponsible comments? You are silly. Back in my time, there was a similar situation, and I accepted that willingly.</p>
<p>T12 C: Other people, other people’s [happy event.</p>
<p>T13 H1:     [No problem, ah.</p>
<p>T14 C: You, you, you can’t do that. Do you understand?</p>
<p>T15 H1 [What’s the problem?</p>
<p>T16 C: [You, you, you’re college students; you should save the host’s face.</p>
<p>T17 H1: College students should save others’ faces. Why should they learn it so:: early?</p>
<p>The caller was highly critical toward the protesting students. The liberal-minded Ng quite predictably disagreed. In fact, before this call, Ng had already expressed his support for the protesting students when conversing with other callers. The caller in Extract 3, however, was also assertive, resulting in the caller and Ng interrupting each other from T2 to T6. The second host jumped in at T7, but the caller disregarded her and directed a question to Ng at T8. At this point, the first–second sequence was reversed.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Extract 3 also illustrates the limited ability of the caller to contest the power relationship, especially when facing an assertive host such as Ng. Ng’s answer at T9 was highly confrontational, involving the paralinguistic devices of raising volume, emphasis, and elongation of vowels. Moreover, while providing an answer at T9, Ng did not simply accept the ‘first position’ and allow the caller to keep posting questions. He interrupted the caller at T11, preventing him from pursuing the graduating daughter question further. Ng even explicitly said the caller was silly. By T15, Ng regained the ‘second position’, and he kept challenging the caller to explain why the student protest was a problem.</p>
<p>Taken together, Extracts 1 to 3 illustrate how the first–second sequence played out, sometimes dynamically, in <italic>OLOV</italic>. The host’s power comes partly from the basic setup of the talk radio dialogue, and partly from the host’s capability to fend off the callers’ occasional attempts to reverse the sequence. Nevertheless, in the previous examples, the participation of the second host was minimal. The conversation was, therefore, mostly dyadic. The following analysis consisted of a triadic interaction between the two hosts and the caller.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1750481313476599">
<title>Second host in the triadic interactions</title>
<p>The second host seldom dominated the conversation and was sometimes simply inconspicuous. However, she or he could still play important roles contributing to the conversational flow in the program. The role of the second host could be discussed under three headings: the program conductor, the buffer, and the counterweight.</p>
<sec id="section7-1750481313476599">
<title>Program conductor</title>
<p>In the triadic setup, the second host may sometimes take up numerous minor, seemingly trifling, yet important work to maintain the quality of the conversation. These tasks can be placed under the heading of the program conductor role. For instance, it is not uncommon for the interlocutors to deviate from the original topic as the conversation evolves. As the conversation in a radio program is produced for the overhearing audience to consume, keeping the focus of the discussion can be important. If the first host is deeply involved in the conversation with the caller, he or she might not even notice a loss in focus. The second host, comparatively, is in a better position to monitor the situation and help the conversation get back on track when needed, as in Extract 4.</p>
<p>Extract 4, 26 February 2010 (H1: Chi-sum Ng; H2: Ada Wong; C: Caller)</p>
<p>T1 C: I quite support re-implementing the Home Ownership Scheme. Because the homes under the Home Ownership Scheme is really for Hong Kong citizens.</p>
<p>T2 H1: It’s more direct.</p>
<p>T3 C: Yes, it will benefit them {……} and another thing, just my personal suggestion, now, the government wants more children studying in Hong Kong so they allow the people from mainland to come to bear babies, right?</p>
<p>T4 H1: No, it’s reversed; you misunderstand the policy. Um, <underline>government</underline>, according to the Basic Law of Hong Kong, the people from mainland China bear babies in Hong Kong, then the baby is qualified to be a Hong Kong permanent resident.</p>
<p>T5 C: Oh, if the parents were not Hong Kong people [they can come to give birth to</p>
<p>T6 H1:     [They also can. {……} they have rights to study in Hong Kong. The logic is reversed {……}.</p>
<p>T7 C: No, their ultimate goal is, they want more babies living in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>T8 H1: They don’t have such a goal, but have no choice because it’s written in the law.</p>
<p>T9 C: No. According to my impression, many Hong Kong citizens don’t want to have babies, so the government has to shut down many schools. You don’t even have enough students.</p>
<p>T10 H2: Let’s talk about <underline>housing</underline>.</p>
<p>T11 H1: There’s no relationship between {……} you mistake the logic again. Talk about why it’s related to housing.</p>
<p>The caller had originally talked about the housing policy, but she jumped to immigration policy at T3. She argued that the government adopted a certain immigration policy because of the declining birth rate and its impact on the educational system. At T4, Ng corrected the caller by pointing out that the immigration policy was adopted because it was mandated by the constitution. However, the caller insisted upon her argument. A cycle of critiques and clarification ensued. As a result, the conversation moved away from the topic of housing. The second host intervened at T10 by directly suggesting the interlocutors get back to the topic of housing. Ng obliged, though only after restating his disagreement with the caller on how to understand the government’s immigration policy.</p>
<p>Besides working to keep the conversational focus, the second host sometimes took the responsibility of correcting other speakers’ mistakes, as in Extract 5, which was a conversation on whether the government should ban sky lanterns.</p>
<p>Extract 5, 24 September 2010 (H1: Chi-sum Ng; H2: Ada Wong; C: Caller)</p>
<p>T1 H1: Firecrackers are totally banned {…}. You [cannot possess or explode firecrackers.</p>
<p>T2 C:      [Yes, but now someone is exploding it, how could you punish him?</p>
<p>T3 H1: No, no, listen to me first. We have two laws; one is Forests and Countryside Ordinance, saying we can’t fly sky lanterns <underline>in the countryside parks</underline>, OK? And the Aviation Security Ordinance says we cannot do that within the range of air channel or <underline>above a certain height</underline>. It’s not like firecrackers; flying sky lanterns is not necessarily against the law. [You should know that.</p>
<p>T4 H2:      [It’s illegal only in certain venues.</p>
<p>T5 H1: Ah, you should be clear about these two regulations. {……} If it’s not, we just said Cheung Chau, holding such=</p>
<p>T6 H2: =MUI WOK, Mui Wok</p>
<p>T7 H1: Mui Wok, Mui Wok holding this is not illegal, {……}.</p>
<p>Ng, in this case, went into detail to explain the relevant regulations to the caller at T3 and analyzing the legality of flying sky lanterns at T5. Notably, at T4, the second host was already helping Ng by using a very brief sentence to summarize the point made by the first host at T3. This brief sentence could be useful not only to the caller, but also to the radio audience who had to grasp the gist of Ng’s explanation. Nonetheless, as Ng continued to speak, he misstated the place under discussion. As the law in Hong Kong would allow sky lantern in certain places but not others, the exact place of sky lantern flying is highly important. The second host, thus, corrected Ng at T6.</p>
<p>Extracts 4 and 5 illustrate how the second host could remind the speakers about the original theme, summarize arguments, and correct mistakes made in the conversation. These do not encompass the variety of tasks relevant to the role of the program conductor. They are examples of how the second host can make significant contributions to the flow of conversation without actively engaging in it.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1750481313476599">
<title>Buffer</title>
<p>The second host’s buffer role is manifested mainly when a dispute emerges between the first host and the caller. As mentioned earlier, the main host in many Hong Kong radio talk shows is a celebrated and influential public character. Because of his or her social status and reputation, the attitude of the first host might not be polite and gentle toward the caller. Especially when the caller holds a different view from the first host’s opinion or even criticizes and challenges the host’s viewpoint, the host might become aggressive and the situation could fall into a stalemate in the sense that the discussion cannot smoothly continue. Extract 3 provides an example of this. Under this circumstance, the second host might attempt to soften the conflict. Extract 6 is about the construction of a high-speed railway in Hong Kong. The caller expressed his support and confidence in the construction work early in the call. The extract begins at the middle part of the conversation.</p>
<p>Extract 6, 1 December 2009, (H1: Chi-sum Ng; H2: Lisa Leung; C: Caller)</p>
<p>T1 C: And if you make it more, you build more stations, it may become even better.</p>
<p>T2 H2: You, you think=</p>
<p>T3 H1: =BUILD more stations, &gt;what building more stations, where do you build&lt;</p>
<p>T4 H2: Where you want to build [them, build stations?</p>
<p>T5 H1:     [Where to build stations, [there’re no stations now.</p>
<p>T6 C:       [Actually, three are enough.</p>
<p>T7 H1 Actually, do you know the designed route? In fact, do you know, Mr. Tai?</p>
<p>T8 H2: In fact, do we have to design it like this? =</p>
<p>T9 H1: =No, Mr. Tai, do you know the design of the line? Do you know there is no station on Hong Kong Island? There is only [West Kowloon Station.</p>
<p>T10 H2:    [Only West Kowloon Station.</p>
<p>T11 C: Oh, then it doesn’t matter that there is no station on Hong Kong Island. On Hong Kong Island, [there are subways.</p>
<p>T12 H1: [Oh, so now IT’S THE FIRST TIME you hear about this? That is, did you know this before you agreed with the proposal, [or are you just hearing about it for the first time?</p>
<p>T13 C:      [You can take a <italic>Walawala</italic> to go across to the other side, now, don’t we?</p>
<p>{four turns omitted}</p>
<p>T18 H1: No. Which other side? I don’t really understand.</p>
<p>T19 H2: Is it West Kowloon?=</p>
<p>T20 H1: =No, no, no, you let him talk. Which other side? {……}</p>
<p>The caller and Ng held opposite views on the issue. During the conversation right before Extract 6, the caller had expressed his confidence with the economy of the city and, hence, his belief that there would be sufficient passengers for the high-speed railway. In contrast, Ng was strongly against the construction plan. However, as the discussion evolved, the caller exposed his unfamiliarity with the details of the issue by suggesting the building of more stations. Ng seized the opportunity to question the caller, at T3 and T5, regarding where the stations could be built. The caller was seemingly unprepared to face the question. Ng then directly asked the caller at T7 whether he knew the construction plan. The question further put the caller into an awkward position.</p>
<p>The second host, at T8, endeavored to alleviate the caller’s embarrassment by implying that there might be other possible routes. However, notably, Ng immediately interrupted her and continued pushing the caller to answer the question of station location. The caller then responded that it was not important that there was no station on Hong Kong Island because it was easy to go to the other side of the harbor (to the train station). Ng, at T12, first concluded that the caller did not even know the construction plan and kept asking ‘which other side’ that he had indicated. The second host tried to help the caller at T19, but Ng again rejected the second host’s intervention.</p>
<p>In this instance, the second host’s effort to cool down the conflict could be clearly observed through her two attempted interventions at T8 and T19. However, the example also showed that the second host’s attempt to serve as the buffer does not always succeed. How the first host reacts is crucial in determining whether the buffering attempt will be successful.</p>
<p>Extract 7 provides another example of buffering. The issue discussed was about the flying of sky lanterns (but a different caller from the one in Extract 5).</p>
<p>Extract 7, 29 March 2010, (H1: Chi-sum Ng; H2: Lisa Leung; C: Caller)</p>
<p>T1 C: I think maybe we could improve the sky lanterns. We could put light bulbs inside so that it would be safe. That’ll be better. We don’t have to use fire=</p>
<p>T2 H1: =But that, that won’t work. The way that sky lanterns work is just like the hot air balloons. It’s not only about the light. The fire would heat the air inside the sky lantern and make it hotter than the air outside. The hot air would be lighter than the cold air, making the sky lantern fly in the sky. [Putting a bulb cannot achieve this. Do you understand?</p>
<p>T3 H2:        [Yes.</p>
<p>T4 C: Eh, maybe we can use something like remote control helicopters to fly it, eh.</p>
<p>T5 H1: {laughter}</p>
<p>T6 H2: But how’s the atmosphere you saw and felt there? Did the visitors very patiently wait for flying the sky? Were they pleased to see the sky lanterns?</p>
<p>T7 C: Eh, I arrived there at about 7 p.m. and waited for about 45 minutes to fly my sky lantern.</p>
<p>The caller did not understand how the sky lanterns work. His suggestion of replacing candles with light bulbs at T2 was dismissed, and his suggestion of using a remote control helicopter was met with sarcastic laughter from Ng. Different from Ng, the second host did not express any attitude toward the caller’s suggestions. Instead, she helped the caller at T6 by shifting the direction of the discussion to the atmosphere of the activity, thus preventing the caller from being further embarrassed. In this case, Ng did not reject the second host’s attempt to intervene. The second host’s buffering attempt allowed the caller to continue to talk about his experience at the event.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1750481313476599">
<title>Counterweight</title>
<p>In radio talk shows in Hong Kong, as introduced previously, the broadcaster could achieve balance through the selection of co-hosts holding contrasting views. However, concerning the conversational dynamics of the program, the pursuit of balance could also be analyzed by paying attention to the second host’s role as a counterweight.</p>
<p>The conversations in phone-in radio talk shows might become ‘unbalanced’ in two types of situations. First, when disagreement arises, one side (usually the first host) might dominate the other side (usually the caller) and control the development of the argument. Second, the first host and the caller might agree with each other, creating a lack of ‘opposition’. To achieve balance, the second host would need to align with the ‘weaker side’ in the first type of situation and to act as the devil’s advocate in the second type of situation. In both cases, the second host would act like a counterweight on a scale. Extract 8, which is from a call talking about a case of medical negligence, provides an instance.</p>
<p>Extract 8, 29 April 2010 (H1: Chi-sum Ng; H2: Ada Wong; C: Caller)</p>
<p>T1 C: Yes, <underline>your attitude</underline>, I think it’s really not good.</p>
<p>T2 H1: Why?</p>
<p>T3 C: You, “so what,” “I’ve helped bath babies” {…}.</p>
<p>T4 H1: No, I have a question about why the baby didn’t cry, and why for the whole year, she didn’t use the elbow but hands?</p>
<p>T5 C: Nah.</p>
<p>T6 H1: How do <underline>you</underline> answer those two questions?</p>
<p>T7 C: Nah, now I tell you. Lots of people work, &gt;of course, we hope&lt;, people do follow the procedures, right? She didn’t use the thermometer, which she should have used on the second day. And she should have taken the temperature at the elbow.</p>
<p>T8 H1: &gt;Why she didn’t&lt;, for the whole year.</p>
<p>T9 C: But, she didn’t, so she needs to take the [consequence of that.</p>
<p>T10 H1:            [&gt;Ah, not only talking about the consequence&lt;, FOR THE WHOLE YEAR, she didn’t use it, so the problem is about the whole system, {……}.</p>
<p>T11 C: Nobody knew it, [that’s very possible</p>
<p>T12 H2:       [Or is this thing so simple that no one will notice it. The superiors did not even think it necessary to check.</p>
<p>T13 H1: Wow, nobody knew it, for the whole year.</p>
<p>T14 C: No, I mean there might not be.</p>
<p>The caller, a retired nurse, strongly disagreed with Ng’s opinion on the issue (which Ng expressed in a previous call). While Ng argued that the case illustrated a broader problem in the medical system, the caller tended to see the matter as an individual’s mistake. Notably, the sequence from T1 to T6 again involved the negotiation of the first–second sequence discussed earlier. Since Ng had already expressed his opinion, the caller began by calling Ng to account for his view. At T4, Ng tried to clarify by saying that he was only raising two questions, and while the caller did not accept the clarification, Ng took the opportunity to forward the two questions for the caller to answer. Ng, thus, gained the position of the questioner again. While the caller provided an answer at T7, Ng pursued the line of questioning further by emphasizing the point that the whole mistake made by the nurse had gone unnoticed by other workers ‘for the whole year’. At T11, the caller sounded somewhat nervous and could not provide further elaboration regarding how a medical mistake made by a nurse might go unnoticed for a long time.</p>
<p>The second host intervened at this point by asking a question that was a plausible answer to Ng’s question (i.e. the mistake was about a basic thing so no one would really notice it). In this case, what the second host did was more than serving as a buffer to cool down a conflict. She was helping one side of the dispute to answer the question posed by the other side, though she did that only indirectly (i.e. instead of jumping in an argument with Ng, the second host suggested the answer to the caller through a question). On the surface, neither the caller nor Ng seemed to have picked up the second host’s suggestion, as Ng continued to treat the fact of having the mistake go unnoticed for a year as unfathomable, whereas the caller simply reiterated that this type of situation could indeed occur. Nevertheless, the second host’s suggestion had at least stopped Ng from continuing his own line of argument.</p>
<p>As mentioned, the second host can also serve as a counterweight when the first host and the caller agree with each other. In this kind of situation, serving as a counterweight means raising questions about the ‘consensus’ already achieved by the first host and the caller. Extract 9 provides an example of this. The discussion was about the controversy surrounding a real estate developer who succeeded in purchasing a piece of land for arguably a very low price, thus raising the suspicion of collusion with the government.</p>
<p>Extract 9, 10 December 2009 (H1: Chi-sum Ng; H2: Ada Wong; C: Caller)</p>
<p>T1 C: Three-hundred million for fifty years, right? YOU SHOULD CHARGE THREE-HUNDRED BILLION. {……}</p>
<p>T2 H1: [Yes, the government didn’t do their job well.</p>
<p>T3 C: [They didn’t check it at all. It’s like the door is completely open and everyone can rob now. [Yes, you also</p>
<p>T4 H2:     [No, at that time, they said, they said it was actually a good price, because at that time, there was SARS, so they said three-hundred=</p>
<p>T5 C: =No, [you can’t say that.</p>
<p>T6 H2: [It was good enough that someone would even like to buy.</p>
<p>T7 C: No, Miss Wong, you can’t say that, [because, now I would rather they hadn’t signed it.</p>
<p>T8 H2:       [No, now I’m not, I’m just repeating</p>
<p>T9 C: I would rather they had not signed it.</p>
<p>T10 H2 No. I was also against this deal at that moment.</p>
<p>T11 C: [Yes, I would rather they had not signed it.</p>
<p>T12 H2: [But actually, the government would say something like this to refute you.</p>
<p>The caller criticized the transaction between the government and the property developer, and her attitude was shared by Ng. If the second host did not intervene, the discussion between the caller and Ng could become merely a case of mutual support and co-construction of a critique against the government. However, at T4, the second host advanced a consideration that could help explain the seemingly low price in the deal (i.e. the transaction was conducted in 2003 when Hong Kong was suffering from a serious economic downturn and an outbreak of SARS). Notably, the second host did not commit herself to the position that the price was reasonable. By saying ‘they said it was a good price’, she was merely quoting the government instead of taking the government’s view as her own. This echoed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1750481313476599">Clayman and Heritage’s (2002)</xref> finding about journalistic interviews: dissenting opinion is often raised by quoting others.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the caller disagreed with the quoted view of the government. Although the second host had already tried to distance herself from the government’s view, the caller remained seemingly provoked. At both T5 and T7, the caller used the second-person pronoun. In other words, the caller took the view expressed at T4 as the second host’s view. The caller’s reaction prompted the second host to clarify her own position at T8 and T10. In the end, neither the caller nor Ng seriously considered or tried to respond to the government’s argument cited by the second host.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the significance of the second host’s attempt to raise a counter-argument to an existing consensus should not be neglected simply because the counter-argument failed to ignite a real debate. Although the counter-argument was only mentioned and not discussed, the second host provided the radio audience with an additional consideration coming from another perspective on the issue. In cases such as Extract 9, the counterweight added to the scale by the second host might not truly help the discussion strike a perfect balance, but it enlarged the range of information existing in the discussion.</p>

<sec id="section10-1750481313476599" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The analysis in the previous sections demonstrated some basic features and important characteristics of the conversations occurring on <italic>OLOV</italic>. Part of the analysis replicated certain findings from past research in other countries on talk radio discourses, especially how <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1750481313476599">Hutchby’s (1996)</xref> first–second sequence model can help us understand the power inequality in the typical host–caller interaction. Although the callers were provided with a seemingly open and unrestrained platform, they occupied the underprivileged position in the conversation. The hosts, with the first opportunity for opposition, were in a better position to criticize and challenge the callers.</p>
<p><italic>OLOV</italic> differed from the programs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1750481313476599">Hutchby (1996)</xref> and others analyzed in that the main host, Chi-sum Ng, was a well-known critic of the government, holding largely liberal views. <italic>OLOV</italic> also typically involved consecutive callers speaking on the same topic. Therefore, Ng’s position on a topic was often known by the audience and the callers, either because the liberal stance on the matter at hand was clear, or because Ng had already expressed his view in previous calls. This fact, as our analysis showed, did contribute to occasions in which the caller could criticize and question Ng. Yet the analysis also showed that Ng was often skillful in the negotiation of the first–second sequence. He could often regain the second position after just a few turns.</p>
<p>This finding has important implications for how we understand radio phone-in talk shows in Hong Kong. Some scholars have argued that talk radio constitutes the people’s council in the city (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1750481313476599">So and Lee, 2007</xref>). The metaphor of the people’s council, however, suggests a democratic forum in which citizens have equal rights to speak. Our analysis, in contrast, suggests that the talk show hosts can be dominating. This is not to completely dismiss the forum function of talk radio in Hong Kong. Nevertheless, one should not idealize such talk radio programs or neglect questions of power and inequality in their operation.</p>
<p>More importantly, this article aims at contributing to existing research on talk radio discourses by paying close attention to the triadic characteristic of the conversation in <italic>OLOV</italic>. In summary, the second host performed important roles in the episodes analyzed. First, the second host took the responsibility of monitoring the flow of the program, correcting simple factual mistakes made by the other host or the caller, reminding the interlocutors about the central theme of the discussion, and so forth. Second, they would sometimes attempt to mediate and soften the conflict between the first host and the caller. Third, they could also act as a counterweight to balance the conversation, either by helping the weaker side (usually the caller) in a host–caller debate or by playing the role of the devil’s advocate if the first host and the caller agreed with each other.</p>
<p>As indicated in the Method section, this study did not count the frequencies with which the various patterns occurred, partly because this study did not aim at a quantitative analysis of interactional patterns, and partly because interactional patterns in reality are fluid and complicated. It would be inappropriate to classify every instance of triadic conversation into a fixed and rigid category. The analysis illustrated the most important conceptual patterns of interactions and alignments, which combine to form a range of major possibilities of how the triadic conversations proceed in <italic>OLOV</italic>.</p>
<p>These findings also have implications for how we understand talk radio and the politics of public opinion in Hong Kong. As discussed in the background section, one plausible ‘intended function’ of having a second host is to achieve a degree of balance in the setup of the program. Although two of the four guest hosts of <italic>OLOV</italic> in the time under analysis could also be regarded as liberal oriented, they were arguably less critical and radical than Chi-sum Ng. One guest host of <italic>OLOV</italic> was even a conservative politician. Our analysis showed that the second host would occasionally try to act as a counterweight to balance the discussion somewhat.</p>
<p>This does not mean, however, that for <italic>OLOV</italic> the overall effect of having a second host is the reduction of the ‘critical edge’ of the program and the main host Ng. As illustrated in the analysis, Ng remained dominant in many discussions, and sometimes Ng would even fend off the second host’s attempts to act as a buffer or counterweight in the discussion. There could be a few reasons for the second host not being more assertive. They might see themselves as ‘guest hosts’ only and still regard <italic>OLOV</italic> as ‘Ng’s program’. The guest hosts might indeed be less skillful than Ng in engaging in live, mediated debates, especially since three of them were essentially ‘part-time’ media workers. At least two of the three guest hosts were themselves liberals, and hence they may not have seen the necessity of balance in some discussions. In any case, balancing through the presence of a second host, though being an occasionally realized possibility, was by no means a dominant pattern in the program.</p>
<p>On the other hand, one might even argue that the presence of the second host freed up Chi-sum Ng to focus on playing the role of social and government critic. Given that RTHK is a public broadcaster providing a public service to the people of Hong Kong, if Ng were the only host of the program, he might have been under stronger pressure to refrain from going too far in expressing his own views. Besides, if Ng were the only host, he would also have needed to pay attention to the flow and other technical details of the program himself. However, when a second host was present, much of Ng’s burden was lifted, leaving him more space to express his own views. In this sense, one might actually see how the presence of a second host could contribute to the critical function of a talk radio program in Hong Kong (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1750481313476599">Lee, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1750481313476599">2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Admittedly, the talk radio scene in Hong Kong is continually changing. Ng left <italic>OLOV</italic> at the end of 2011, and the program format of <italic>OLOV</italic> changed. <italic>OLOV</italic> is not necessarily the most typical talk radio program in the city. However, beyond the single case and the Hong Kong context, this study illustrated how paying attention to the actual number of participants involved and the associated range of dynamics in a broadcast conversation could help us understand the characteristics and implications of the conversation.</p>
<p>In line with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1750481313476599">Simmel’s (1950)</xref> classic discussion of the differences between the dyad and the triad, our analysis showed how the addition of the ‘third element’ into a conversation can open up a range of possibilities. At the same time, also in line with the CA approach, this article does not intend to argue that triadic conversations must follow a fixed set of dynamics. Rather, the contents of talk radio (i.e. the conversations going on in the program) result from how individual agents react and respond to each other against the background of the institutional setting. Future research in other countries would be useful for us to understand what characteristics triadic conversations in broadcast media would display in varying institutional settings and socio-political contexts.</p>
