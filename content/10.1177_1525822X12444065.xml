<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In July 2008, I landed in Madagascar with the aim of studying non-elite perceptions of democratic development. Although Madagascar was considered a budding democracy at that time, it quickly became apparent that ordinary people were fearful of speaking openly about anything even remotely related to politics. The mixed bag of qualitative methods I had assembled previously, including semistructured interviews and focus groups, proved incompatible with this new, unexpected context. In short, I faced the grim prospect of failing to collect the data I was after not because they were elusive but because I was unequipped to even begin the chase. With 5 months remaining before I could get on a plane and fly home, I opted to experiment with a research method that I had stumbled across in an article about the impact of international organic food chains in Madagascar—the modified Thematic Apperception Test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1525822X12444065">Farnworth 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The visual interpretation narrative exercise (VINE)<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1525822X12444065">1</xref>
</sup> resulted from a process not entirely unlike the childhood game Telephone (also known as Chinese Whispers), where an original phrase is invariably altered as it is whispered from ear to ear. The phrase revealed at the end of the game by the last player generally bears only limited resemblance to the original, while some deviations can be traced back to the reinterpretation of individual players. In this case, the Thematic Apperception Test (TAT), a method developed and principally deployed in clinical psychology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1525822X12444065">Murray 1943</xref>), was picked up by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1525822X12444065">Nazarea et al. (1998)</xref>, modified slightly for their research on indigenous understandings of sustainability in the Philippines, and then published alongside their findings. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1525822X12444065">Farnworth (2007)</xref> then adopted the method piloted by Nazarea et al., making further modifications to suit her particular research and circumstances. Finally, I used Farnworth’s published account of a modified TAT as the foundation for my own research technique. Therefore, rather than systematically preparing a research methodology rooted in the TAT, I developed and piloted my method in the field—largely off the cuff—with access to only reinterpretations of the TAT published by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1525822X12444065">Nazarea et al. (1998)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1525822X12444065">Farnworth (2007</xref>). Consequently, although the VINE technique echoes its TAT predecessors, several features distinguish it as a new research procedure.</p>
<p>I begin by setting out how the VINE technique evolved as a direct response to the challenges posed by investigating a highly sensitive topic with non-elite research participants. In so doing, I situate this tool among visual research methods found across several social science disciplines to address issues including image selection, interview procedure and instructions, and audio recording. While VINE is primarily a data-collection technique, I discuss how I sorted and analyzed the VINE data using a combination of Framework and thematic networks. Finally, I briefly recount some of my research findings, pointing out instances where VINE data proved particularly unexpected or revealing. Although this article is primarily about my own use of the VINE technique for a single research project, I conclude by suggesting that visual research methods could play a more prominent role in policy-driven research.</p>

<sec id="section2-1525822X12444065">
<title>The VINE Pilot</title>
<p>The VINE technique was designed and piloted in Madagascar, during 5 months of doctoral research in late 2008. My research objective was to uncover how ordinary people in Madagascar interpret democracy and their own political experience. Although the country consistently ranked relatively well on a number of democracy indices in the years preceding 2008, when I arrived I encountered a tense political climate and found freedom of expression severely curtailed. People were generally reluctant to speak candidly about overtly political topics and were sometimes openly fearful of being overheard saying the “wrong” thing.</p>
<p>The abstract nature of the VINE technique enabled me to approach political themes in a nonthreatening, roundabout way that was acceptable to research participants and resulted in the collection of nuanced data inaccessible via more direct questioning. It also resulted in an informal collaboration between me and the people I interviewed that, while guided by my broad research themes, reflects local perceptions of democracy and the genuine concerns ordinary citizens have about their country’s political future. VINE is, therefore, designed to facilitate research of sensitive topics in challenging environments where traditional research techniques may prove inappropriate or unreliable.</p>
<p>Like all image-based research tools, the VINE technique relies on the principle of projective interpretation; what we recognize in the present is invariably influenced by past perception and experience organized and stored in our memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1525822X12444065">Bellak 1975</xref>:15; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1525822X12444065">Berger 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1525822X12444065">Eggert 2001</xref>:310; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1525822X12444065">Pittenger et al. 1960</xref>:3). When research participants tell short stories about abstract images during a VINE interview, they naturally construct narratives derived from their own personality traits and unique experience. Visual research methods like the VINE technique are, therefore, particularly suitable for identifying the inherently subjective ways in which people tacitly “name and frame” their (sociopolitical) environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1525822X12444065">Schön and Rein 1994</xref>:26; also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1525822X12444065">Nuijten 2003</xref>:12).</p>
<p>Moreover, storytelling is an intuitive process not formally taught or learned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1525822X12444065">Fforde 2010</xref>). Consequently, visual tools that ask research participants to tell a story can be particularly appropriate in “other language cultures” (Farnworth, personal communication, 2008) as the ability to “read” an image transcends educational and, to a point, linguistic barriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1525822X12444065">Banks 2001</xref>:9–10). Feelings, opinions, and the respondent’s perceptions of reality are all displaced onto the image, facilitating the discussion of complex or sensitive material. As a result, this type of research has the potential to yield new findings about the way non-elites—particularly low literacy–level groups—perceive their social reality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1525822X12444065">Farnworth 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1525822X12444065">Ramos 1999</xref>). The image also deformalizes the interview by transforming an interrogative process into a more congenial storytelling exercise. Additionally, it provides an escape route from awkward silences; there is always something to talk about (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1525822X12444065">Banks 2007</xref>:65; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1525822X12444065">Collier and Collier 1986</xref>:105–7; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1525822X12444065">Gold 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Therefore, the first step in piloting the VINE technique was to commission a set of visual prompts. The number and style of images I used was primarily determined by two factors: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1525822X12444065">Farnworth’s (2007)</xref> experience of the modified TAT in Madagascar and my own time constraints. First, although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1525822X12444065">Nazarea et al. (1998)</xref> mirrored the original TAT procedure and used 20 images, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1525822X12444065">Farnworth (2007)</xref> cautions that interviewing with 8 images was time consuming and challenging for research participants and the research team alike. Consequently, from the outset I decided not to use more than 8 images, and possibly fewer as I had a larger target sample.</p>
<p>The second factor in determining the number of images I used was the time it took to collect them. Nazarea’s team and Farnworth had both used photographic images of the local environment taken from an unusual angle “to capture everyday yet slightly defamilarized scenes in a familiar landscape” (Farnworth, personal communication, 2008). I had likewise initially intended to use photographs and, as the sorts of scenes I was interested in (e.g., voting lines, political rallies) were not visibly apparent, I allocated the task of finding a selection of photographic images to a research assistant who I knew had access to newspaper archives. After several weeks, it became clear that this was a dead end. Fortunately, fieldwork has a proclivity for serendipitous encounters. Just as my frustration peaked, I met a young artist who agreed to draw cartoons for me. In commissioning the images, I initially discussed general themes of particular interest with the artist (e.g., elections, political authority, freedom of speech, etc.); she was then at liberty to interpret these themes in a way she deemed locally appropriate. This collaborative process resulted in a set of five contextually relevant sketches that people of all socioeconomic classes and educational backgrounds could interpret relatively easily. Two of the cartoons are reproduced in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1525822X12444065">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1525822X12444065">2</xref>.</p>

<p>When using visual research techniques, it is essential that the images used “are either owned by subjects of research or very strongly connected to them in some way” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1525822X12444065">Banks 2007</xref>:66; also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1525822X12444065">Aronow et al. 2001</xref>:67). In other words, the images must not only reflect the intentions of the researcher, they must also be accessible and stimulating to research participants. In this respect, the cartoons drawn by a local artist were remarkably successful. After seeing the cartoons, most people immediately accepted that I was not going to probe into their perceptions of particular events or political figures that they remained wary of speaking about directly. They often went on to volunteer their views on democracy in the context of one or more VINE stories, despite never being asked to do so.</p>
<p>Having selected my visual prompts, the interview process was relatively straightforward. At the outset of the VINE interview procedure, research participants were handed the stack of cartoons and instructed simply to tell a short story about what they saw in each image. Research participants were then free to respond to the images in any sequence they chose, sometimes stringing stories about two or three images together. When encountering visual research methods for the first time, people commonly begin to assess an image descriptively, applying labels to the things that they most confidently recognize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1525822X12444065">Banks 2001</xref>:3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1525822X12444065">Bellak 1975</xref>:7). I noticed, however, that research participants often became more confident as the interview progressed, sometimes returning to an image at the end to expand on the original story. Interviews lasted around 30 minutes on average, with stories about each image taking approximately 5 minutes to tell.</p>
<p>The success of any interview depends on the quality of engagement between interviewer and interviewee, and the presence of a visual prompt can only enhance this relationship if the researcher allows it to (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1525822X12444065">Pittenger et al. 1960</xref>:3). In particular, the instructions offered at the outset reveal the cultural credibility of the researcher and can “markedly influence compliance [thereby] rendering the stories useful for the intended purposes, or not if rapport and cooperation have been minimal” (Dana, personal communication, 2009; also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1525822X12444065">Murray 1943</xref>:3–4). Nazarea (personal communication, 2009) and her team began their modified TAT interviews with the simple instruction: “Please tell me what you see” or “Tell me a story about what you see”; no follow-up questions were asked. Farnworth (personal communication, 2008) likewise stuck quite closely to Murray’s prescribed interview format in which research participants are shown the images and asked to respond “by themselves, with a tape-recorder running, in the presence of a silent facilitator.”</p>
<p>While my initial instructions to research participants were similar to those of Nazarea’s team and Farnworth, I deviated from their protocol to converse with research participants during the VINE interview. I would, for example, sometimes inquire about what had led up to the event described. At other times, I sought clarification or probed for meaning. Crucially, neither my research assistants nor I ever attempted to correct or otherwise interfere with a research participant’s interpretation of the images. In this respect, the VINE technique is not dissimilar to photo elicitation, which encourages the researcher to actively engage with research participants in the collaborative process of discovering the meaning of an image together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1525822X12444065">Collier and Collier 1986</xref>:105; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1525822X12444065">Harper 2002</xref>:23). Through this collaboration, the typical power dynamic between researcher and researched is turned on its head and the research participant becomes the acknowledged authority (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1525822X12444065">Clark-Ibáñez 2004</xref>:1512). This can lead to the discovery of relevant or even crucial issues that would have otherwise remained undetected by the researcher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1525822X12444065">Clark-Ibáñez 2004</xref>:1517; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1525822X12444065">Samuels 2004</xref>:1542).</p>
<p>I used the VINE technique with 51 people (27 men, 24 women) from two sites (one rural: 11 interviews; one urban: 40 interviews) in the Antsinanana region of eastern Madagascar. All research participants were non-elites of various backgrounds and professions. While some research participants were highly educated, others had received very little formal education. One advantage of the VINE technique is that it is equally accessible to people of all socioeconomic backgrounds; it worked just as well in the rural village as it did in the urban center. Stories were generally told and recorded in French; when a research participant preferred to tell his or her stories in Betsimisaraka, the local dialect of Malagasy spoken in the region where I did my research, a research assistant provided simultaneous translation in French. Findings resulting from this pilot research challenge popular democracy assistance priorities and raise serious questions about how accurately external expert assessments of democratic development reflect local perceptions, beliefs, and expectations.</p>
<p>Restraints set by time and circumstances limited my opportunities for rigorous triangulation. In addition to the VINE interviews, I conducted semistructured interviews with senior project managers from CARE and KMF-CNOE, an indigenous nongovernmental organization (NGO) that focuses on electoral monitoring and civic education efforts. Structured follow-up interviews were also completed with 10 key non-elite research participants. Most of these interviews were agreed to on the condition that I provided a list of questions that could be answered by anonymous, written response. I also took extensive ethnographic field notes.</p>

<title>Interpreting Interpretations: Data Analysis</title>
<p>Collaborative, visual research methods like the VINE technique pose particular challenges when it comes time for data analysis. All social scientists are in the business of interpreting interpretations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1525822X12444065">Keating 2008</xref>:110). In the context of visual research, however, the researcher must carefully balance the desire to achieve a shared understanding of a particular reality with research participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1525822X12444065">Farnworth 2007</xref>:273) and the likelihood that the story communicated to research participants by the image may not necessarily reflect what the researcher had intended or anticipated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1525822X12444065">Banks 2001</xref>:11; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1525822X12444065">Collier and Collier 1986</xref>:99). In other words, the researcher must not let the objective of establishing a common interpretation blind him or her from identifying unexpected or alternate points of view.</p>
<p>When analyzing VINE stories, I endeavored to build a schematic framework or model capable of accurately depicting local political logic and how this logic might become manifest in behavior. All the while, I remained acutely aware that my own expectations of the images must not influence my analysis of what research participants had actually said. This delicate balance was achieved using a three-stage analysis strategy entailing: (1) systematic deconstruction of VINE stories into thematic text segments using Framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1525822X12444065">Spencer et al. 2003</xref>); (2) exploration of pervasive themes and theme clusters using thematic networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1525822X12444065">Attride-Stirling 2001</xref>); and (3) interpretation and analysis of the information. This tiered data analysis process facilitated the identification and examination of concepts that ordinary people commonly use to interpret their sociopolitical environment. It also shed light on how concepts commonly associated with democracy (e.g. elections, political competition) are reappropriated by local actors.</p>
<p>First, the 244 short stories collected using the VINE technique were transcribed, deconstructed using Framework, and analyzed for particular traits (Tier 1). Framework is an approach to data organization whereby themes derived from textual data are used to create a set of standardized matrices. The cells of each matrix contain excerpts from the text relevant to that particular theme. Patterns can then be identified across matrices either by theme or by source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1525822X12444065">Spencer et al. 2003</xref>). Once complete, I analyzed my Framework matrices for competences and dispositions in the spirit of reconstructive democratic theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1525822X12444065">Dryzek and Berejikian 1993</xref>). <italic>Competences</italic> include knowledge of and access to the political sphere as well as beliefs or convictions about one’s ability to act in particular circumstances and what those actions signify. Put another way, they are known facts and available actions. <italic>Dispositions</italic>, by contrast, encompass feelings, inclinations, tendencies, and attitudes. They are more emotive than competences and are only indirectly linked to action or agency.</p>
<p>The classification of a word or phrase as a competence or disposition was not arbitrary but rather reflects the context of this particular idea within the VINE story. I distinguished, for example, between whether research participants indicated that they could do something (i.e., a competence) or that they wanted to do it (i.e., a disposition). To illustrate, saying that people <italic>can</italic> take part in protests (i.e., a competence) is not the same as indicating that people <italic>want</italic> to protest (i.e., a disposition) but are not actually able to do so. The competences and dispositions then became codes for first-order themes. In an effort to remain true to the original stories for as long as possible, I completed initial data extrapolation and organization in French, switching to English only after themes had been identified.</p>
<p>Next, competences and dispositions included in stories told by research participants were analyzed for more abstract meanings using thematic networks (Tier 2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1525822X12444065">Attride-Stirling 2001</xref>). Thematic networks, which emphasize the interactive and nonlinear aspects of themes, organize discrete competences and dispositions into a sophisticated, web-like blueprint that transparently links the language used by research participants to more abstract analytical ideas. Though analytical constructs, thematic networks nevertheless approximate the ways in which people likely view the political sphere, allowing for an assessment (albeit provisional) of the distribution of corroborative interpretations among social groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1525822X12444065">Keesing 1974</xref>:89; also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1525822X12444065">Aronow et al. 2001</xref>:27).</p>
<p>The story told by thematic networks is, however, more than a simple aggregation of individual points of view (Tier 3). Systematic interpretation and exploration of the thematic networks alongside the stories that contributed fundamentally to their creation “take[s] the researcher deeper into the meaning of the texts,” or VINE stories in this case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1525822X12444065">Attride-Stirling 2001</xref>:393). This method of data analysis balances description and interpretation by creating a web of interconnected themes of varying orders of abstraction. Furthermore, first-order themes (i.e., competences and dispositions) can be displayed in proportion to their frequency using the free, web-based word cloud generator <italic>Wordle</italic>, suggesting how variations among individual points of view relate to shared interpretations. As demonstrated below, themes can also be easily contextualized using VINE story excerpts as a way of grounding abstract analysis in the source data. The result is new depth of insight into how the familiar ideas and language can be reappropriated by local actors. Instead of relying solely on the researcher’s own theoretical and linguistic traditions, this model emphasizes indigenous concepts and codes of meaning.</p>

<title>What Did VINE Stories Reveal?</title>
<p>Although people in Madagascar were unprepared to answer direct questions about politics and democracy, the stories that they told during VINE interviews reveal a great deal about how they perceive their government and their own political agency. Moreover, as the admittedly limited discussion below illustrates, the language used by research participants sometimes differed from the language that I would have chosen had I questioned them directly. By giving research participants freedom and authority when interpreting the images, the VINE technique avoids limitations otherwise imposed by the researcher’s own limited knowledge or point of view. In this section, I will briefly discuss two examples of this from my own research.</p>
<p>First, to prompt VINE stories indicative of people’s attitudes toward and expectations for electoral processes the artist drew a scene recognizable as the interior of a polling place (see Image 1). Candid responses to this image demonstrate a clear dichotomy between research participants who indicated that they held a generally affirmative view of voting and those who were more skeptical about the value of electoral participation. More importantly, the stories go beyond simply revealing whether a particular individual finds voting worthwhile to explain the context and rationale behind a particular point of view.</p>
<p>The overwhelmingly dominant disposition in approximately half of VINE stories told about the image in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1525822X12444065">Figure 1</xref> was that some people are happy to vote. This belief was supported in VINE stories by other competences and dispositions broadly suggestive that people are generally positive about voting and confident in electoral outcomes. Occasionally, these research participants specified that people reflect on their choice before casting their vote, indirectly implying that the names of multiple candidates appear on the ballot.<def-list>

</def-item>
</def-list>People who told generally positive VINE stories about elections also commonly described voting as a duty. Reflecting a typical partial response in this vein, Jo continued: “People have to vote, it is how they fulfill their duty as citizens.” Classifying voting as a duty, however, sometimes coincided with a marked diminishment of enthusiasm among these research participants. Daniel explained that the woman (second in the line) was very enthusiastic about voting. The man wearing a hat behind her, however, thinks (in Daniel’s estimation) that voting is not very important, an infrequent—though not insignificant—theme to emerge from VINE stories that shone a generally positive light on electoral participation. Interestingly, none of the three people in the image was singled out more consistently than the others, negating the likelihood that something particular about the image provoked these observations.</p>
<p>The remaining research participants, by contrast, told VINE stories notable for their prevalent depiction of voting as a wearisome exercise and expressions of voter fatigue.<def-list>

<p>It’s always elections, all the time. It’s tiring. The people [in the picture] are tired. The first one is angry or fed up.</p>

<term>Severiny</term>
<def>
<p>They think that it is always the same. Even if someone new gets elected, it is always the same thing.</p>
</def>
</def-item>
</def-list>For many research participants whose VINE stories suggest that they perceive elections in this way, the monotony of voting is augmented by a clear conviction that elections in their country are neither free nor fair. As Léa explained “A lot of people are discouraged. There is always cheating during elections.” These story excerpts reveal more than individual perceptions of elections in Madagascar, they provide an explanation for voter apathy that could be explored with additional research.</p>
<p>Concern about transparency was particularly common among more educated research participants. From their point of view, lack of transparency facilitates cheating, and the party in power always wins.<def-list>
<def-item>
<term>Julien</term>
<def>
<p>Every time there are elections, you have to go vote but the result is already decided. It’s always the same story. In my opinion, the president is a dictator: it’s the government that decides, not the people.</p>

<def>
<p>Elections don’t change anything</p>
</def>
</def-item>
</def-list>Had I simply asked whether research participants voted or whether they thought that elections were fair, I expect that I would have received a one-word response. The ambiguity of the image coupled with a storytelling exercise encourages research participants to explain the logic behind their perceptions to reveal why they harbor particular attitudes.</p>
<p>For a second example of how the VINE technique can facilitate better communication between researcher and research participant, I will briefly discuss responses to the image in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1525822X12444065">Figure 2</xref>. I had originally commissioned an image depicting a policeman to learn how people perceive the rule of law at street level. Before my plans to conduct semistructured interviews were halted by conditions on the ground, I had anticipated asking questions about corruption. It is notable, therefore, that only one research participant (who worked as an anticorruption officer) used language of corruption and bribery in his VINE story.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether they respected police authority unconditionally or thought that the police regularly abused their position of power, research participants universally expected that the man walking his dog would pay the policeman.<def-list>
<def-item>
<term>Léa</term>
<def>
<p>The man just looks at the policeman and doesn’t have anything to say because he knows he is at fault. He knows that he has to accept the fine. He accepts the law of the police.</p>
</def>
</def-item>
<def-item>
<term>Voary</term>
<def>
<p>The police always look for problems so that they can demand money from people. If someone who has done something bad pays the police quickly, it’s all finished. It is money that counts for the police.</p>
</def>
</def-item>
<def-item>
<term>Botozaza</term>
<def>
<p>So, the man walking his dog pretends that he doesn’t know the rule and that’s why I think that he will bribe the police. I think that he is an intellectual or he is rich and that he has an easy life. [This excerpt is taken from a story told by the anticorruption officer mentioned above.]</p>
</def>
</def-item>
</def-list>These excerpts demonstrate that although the implications of being stopped by the police vary depending on one’s perspective, people taking part in this research anticipated a single outcome. Moreover, each of these excerpts reflects differently on the rule of law. Although it is not possible to discuss the implications of these points of view for democratic development in any detail here, the potential for a multifaceted analysis is clear.</p>
<p>On reflection, this turned out to be the least successful of the images used in this research. While I can only speculate as to why, it is possible that the obvious portrayal of a government official (i.e., a policeman) increased the perceived risk associated with interpreting this image. Alternatively, this image contains fewer characters with which people might identify as part of the projective exercise.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>“Then you should say what you mean,” the March Hare went on.</p>
<p>“I do,” Alice hastily replied; “at least—at least I mean what I say—that’s the same thing you know.”</p>
<p>“Not the same thing a bit!” said the Hatter. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1525822X12444065">Carroll 2000</xref>:69)</p>
</disp-quote>Images can create an atmosphere in which research participants feel at ease to mean what they say, and the researcher can be confident that she or he understands what they mean. Data collected using visual methods have much to contribute to social science and policy-driven research—particularly with regard to better understanding how people make sense of their own lives. The VINE technique is an innovative tool for investigating whether policy makers and non-elite stakeholders perceive problems in the same way and, indeed, if they perceive the same problems. This method could be applied alongside traditional research techniques in order to gain a more nuanced appreciation for how people in developing democracies interpret and understand their own political context. I have demonstrated elsewhere, for instance, how careful analysis of VINE data provided much needed context for the political turmoil in Madagascar that unseated President Ravalomanana in the spring of 2009 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1525822X12444065">Hinthorne 2011</xref>). The VINE technique could also be meaningfully integrated into country-led democracy assessment exercises like those encouraged by United Nations Development Program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1525822X12444065">UNDP 2009</xref>) and International IDEA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1525822X12444065">Beetham et al. 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>I encountered the modified TAT in isolation. Finding it innovative, exciting, and better suited to the particularities of my research context than traditional methods, I proceeded with the development of what would eventually become the VINE technique completely unaware of the range of similar tools trialed elsewhere.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1525822X12444065">3</xref>
</sup> I now know that this experience is not unique or even unusual. Scattered haphazardly through disciplines ranging from sociology to health science, anthropology to clinical psychology, an array of image-based visual research methods have evolved essentially in parallel with only limited reference to their cousins situated in other fields (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1525822X12444065">Gotschi et al. 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together, these varied research experiences clearly demonstrate the consistency with which visual techniques draw out data not attainable by other means. However, because this veritable cache of information remains disaggregated and buried deep in journal archives, visual research techniques linger like “waifs at the margins” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1525822X12444065">Harper 2002</xref>:15). I have discussed the VINE technique with several people working in the democracy assistance industry and they seemed genuinely interested. Not having encountered visual methods before, however, what policy makers require is an interdisciplinary review of visual research methods that consolidates the existing literature and establishes best practice. Collecting the scattered resources on visual techniques would not only make them more accessible to the policy community but would also go some way in challenging the stereotype that visual research as a methodology remains experimental.</p>
<p>The expectations laid down by democratic institutions, whether implicit or explicit, are neither neutral nor universal. Likewise, how individuals construct and interpret their political reality has direct bearing on “the roles they think they can, do, and should play in relation to that reality” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1525822X12444065">Dryzek and Berejikian 1993</xref>:50). During research in Madagascar, the VINE technique proved to be an invaluable research tool, both for learning about how ordinary people interpret commonplace sociopolitical situations and for creating an environment in which they felt safe to speak openly.</p>
