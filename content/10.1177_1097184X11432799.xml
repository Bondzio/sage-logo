<italic>Men, Law and Gender</italic> offers a significant theoretical challenge to dominant feminist and critical ways of thinking about men, masculinity, and law while also providing compelling empirical accounts of three important aspects of men’s lives: school, work, and family. At root, Collier’s account of men and law highlights the complexity and nuances of men’s lives, of what men actually do, something he argues most theories of men and masculinity fail to do. To show the importance of this turn toward a fuller picture of men’s real lives and their interaction with law, Collier offers original and detailed empirical analyses of law school trends and culture, law firms' missions and work-life balance within them, as well as the reshaping of family law that has inflamed so many fathers' rights advocates. These insights provide a thought-provoking reconceptualization of what it means to talk about men and law in light of the currently favored norms of formal equality and gender neutrality.</p>
<p>On the theoretical level, Collier starts with a lengthy and comprehensive overview of the literature about men, masculinity, and law. For this chapter alone, the book is worthwhile, as it covers substantial ground from a variety of disciplines, ranging from feminist legal theory to sociology to psychology to critical theories of masculinity. His survey culminates with his exploration of two different critical theories of masculinity, both of which feature prominently in the remainder of his book. The first is the concept of hegemonic masculinity, first developed by the extremely influential gender and masculinities theorist Raewyn Connell. Within a world in which men and women engage in varied forms of masculinities, hegemonic masculinity is the most culturally exalted form, the form that exerts pressure upon all men to conform with it. As many theorists have pointed out, hegemonic masculinity does this through a variety of cultural institutions, including law. The second theory Collier engages is what he calls the psychosocial theory of men and masculinity. That theory explores the individual biographies of men, in particular the “psychic dimensions of [their] (masculine) subjectivity” (p. 39), to answer why some men aspire toward traditional masculinity and others do not.</p>
<p>Collier critiques both of these models and instead advocates throughout the book a position that navigates between these two. He critiques hegemonic masculinity as ignoring the complexity of individual men’s lives as well as the fact that bodily difference is the recipient of different messages about masculinity and femininity, something a purely social constructivist theory fails to acknowledge. He critiques the psychosocial theory as being too divorced from notions of power and social structure. His solution is the adoption of Carol Smart’s idea of “turning personal,” a sociological theory that Collier adopts for the study of men, masculinity, and law. He argues for “integrating an appreciation, at both a theoretical and political level, of the complexity and often contradictory nature of ‘personal life’” (p. 44), something he claims theories of hegemonic masculinity do not accomplish. Moreover, to differentiate this turn from the psychosocial account he criticizes, Collier argues that “turning personal” captures how different social structures are shaped by ideas of “power and entitlement” (p. 45), but that those structures are differentially available to individual men based on their personal stories.</p>
<p>Collier’s theory of men, masculinity, and law offers a substantial challenge to these dominant theories, and he backs up his theoretical position with six detailed chapters deeply exploring the personal lives of men in relation to law. He devotes two chapters each to school, work, and family. In the first of the school chapters, he explores the changing nature of British law schools and how legal education reform is remasculinizing legal education by emphasizing quantifiable knowledge, productivity, and bureaucratization. In the second school chapter, he explores the importance of socioeconomic class in the lived experiences of faculty members within law schools, arguing that talking about men and masculinity in law without talking about class ignores a full picture of men’s lives.</p>
<p>Turning to work, Collier explores two aspects of the world of high-end law firm practice. First, he conducts an original empirical analysis of law firm recruiting materials to explore the messages about gender, sexuality, bodies, and achievement these materials give to candidates considering employment with the firms. Then, through another original empirical analysis, he looks at work-life balance issues within big law firms, exploring the pressure around being a “successful man” that accompanies work that is often high-pressured and all-consuming. He argues that law must take account of the different “gendered experiences” that inform men and women’s decisions in this area and not just assume gender neutrality will work (p. 193).</p>
<p>In the first of his two chapters on family law, Collier details the way law has reconceptualized fathers as merely providers to now being both caregivers and providers. He then, in his last and most developed chapter, discusses the conflict that many men feel when trying to live with this reconceptualized fatherhood in the context of marital dissolution. He ultimately concludes that fathers' rights groups, rather than being the object of feminist scorn, should be an indication of the “tension between the <italic>ideals</italic> of desirable parenting contained in law and the <italic>realities</italic> of their own social experiences as gendered subjects” (p. 231). This, according to Collier, puts men in a difficult position, one that explains the anger and conflict within fathers' rights groups. He argues that their concerns should not be quickly dismissed, as many have.</p>
<p>Collier’s empirical exploration of men and law does an excellent job demonstrating the complex nature of masculinity and how law can (or cannot) resolve difficult issues about gender. Though his examples are all based in British society and law, most are easily generalized to similar countries and cultures. On a theoretical level, Collier’s challenge to the now-ubiquitous concept of hegemonic masculinity is likely to be the most lasting contribution of this book. I remain convinced of the concept’s utility (despite its imperfections) in explaining how law helps shape men’s and women’s interactions with gender expectations and roles, especially given the evidence Collier musters about men’s conflicting responses to changing messages about masculinity. Moreover, I question whether the complexities of lived masculinity that Collier explores are as inconsistent with hegemonic masculinity as he claims. As developed by many theorists, hegemonic masculinity is not a universal and is itself a highly contextual concept. Nonetheless, his sophisticated and layered treatment of the issue offers new insight into men, gender, and law by exploring the personal gendered lives of men as they interact with law. The argument that this focus offers a better way to understand gender than the others covered in the book will be one that theorists will have to grapple with in the future.</p>
