<title>Background:</title>
<p>Triple arthrodesis through a 2-incision approach has been the primary salvage procedure for rigid hindfoot malalignment resulting from posterior tibialis dysfunction. However, complications like calcaneocuboid joint nonunion, lateral wound dehiscence, and adjacent joint arthritis have been reported after triple arthrodesis. Hence we adopted single-incision medial approach arthrodesis of subtalar and talonavicular joints, sparing the uninvolved calcaneocuboid joint and lateral skin.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1071100712468564">
<title>Method:</title>
<p>We report the results of a series of 18 feet with posterior tibialis dysfunction that had correction of malalignment by this approach. Mean age at surgery was 65 years. The mean follow-up was 24 months.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1071100712468564">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>There was statistically significant improvement in all the radiological parameters measured. There were no wound-related complications. The union rate was 89%. There were 2 malunions, and 2 feet developed valgus ankle deformity. The overall satisfaction rate among patients was 78%.</p>

<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>We present a case series of treatment of posterior tibialis tendon dysfunction by arthrodesis of the subtalar and talonavicular joints through an isolated medial approach. The results were not encouraging enough to recommend adopting this approach as an alternative to triple arthrodesis.</p>

<body>
<p>Triple arthrodesis has been the primary salvage procedure for symptomatic severe or rigid malalignment of hindfoot resulting from posterior tibialis tendon dysfunction (PTTD). The traditional approach is to use 2 incisions: 1 on the medial side of foot to arthrodese the talonavicular joint (TNJ) and 1 on the lateral side to arthrodese both the subtalar joint (STJ) and the calcaneocuboid joint (CCJ). Although triple arthrodesis is an effective procedure, complications like CCJ nonunion and lateral wound dehiscence have been reported following triple arthrodesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1071100712468564">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1071100712468564">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1071100712468564">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1071100712468564">18</xref></sup> At our institution, 2 of the senior authors adopted a single-incision medial approach double arthrodesis instead of triple arthrodesis as a way to avoid these potential complications and to preserve the CCJ.</p>
<p>The purpose of this study was to review the short-term results of our single-incision medial approach double arthrodesis in patients with PTTD to determine whether satisfactory results like those reported in other similar studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1071100712468564">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1071100712468564">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1071100712468564">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1071100712468564">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1071100712468564">22</xref></sup> could be achieved with a lesser procedure that spares a normal CCJ and avoids a lateral incision. Our hypothesis was that in patients with rigid planovalgus deformity and an intact calcaneocuboid joint, arthrodesis of the subtalar and talonavicular joints would correct the malalignment, relieve symptoms, and provide a functional plantigrade foot.</p>

<title>Patients and Methods</title>
<sec id="section7-1071100712468564">
<title>Chart Review and Questionnaire</title>
<p>Institutional review board approval was obtained. We reviewed medical records of all patients with PTTD operated by the above approach by 2 senior surgeons in our institute between January 2007 and August 2010. Inclusion criteria were rigid or severe deformity, no arthrosis of the calcaneocuboid joint, unresponsiveness to a minimum of 6 months of conservative treatment, and no history of hindfoot arthrodesis surgery. Severe deformity was defined as talonavicular subluxation of more than 50% on a weight-bearing anteroposterior (AP) or lateral radiographs.</p>
<p>Twenty-four feet in 23 patients were identified from the medical records. All these patients were contacted by mail or telephone and were asked to complete a short-form 12-item survey (SF-12) outcome questionnaire and also custom questions about patient satisfaction. Patient satisfaction was graded as very satisfied, satisfied with minor reservations, satisfied with major reservations, and dissatisfied. Patients were asked to grade their pain as none, mild-occasional, moderate-daily, or severe-almost daily. Finally, patients were asked to grade the appearance of foot as better, same, or worse.</p>
<p>Of 23 patients, 19 were available for follow-up and 2 among them declined to participate in the study. The final study population included 18 feet in 17 patients—5 men and 12 women. The mean age of patients was 65 years (range, 32-83 years). The average duration of follow-up was 24 months (range, 10-52 months). Pre- and postoperative radiographic assessment was available in all 17 patients. However, 1 patient’s preoperative foot radiographs were judged as being unsuitable for radiographic assessment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1071100712468564">
<title>Radiographic Assessment</title>
<p>Radiographic evaluation consisted of measurements of the AP talocalcaneal, AP talo-second metatarsal, lateral talocalcaneal, and lateral talo-first metatarsal angles from the standard weight-bearing AP and lateral radiographs obtained preoperatively and at the 12-week postoperative follow-up (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1071100712468564">Figure 1</xref>). All the angles were measured as described by Sangeorzan et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1071100712468564">20</xref></sup> with GE Centricity PACS software (General Electric, Austin, TX). Successful arthrodesis was defined as absence of pain at the fusion site and unequivocal bony bridging across the fusion site as determined by the first author, who was not directly involved with the surgery. Computed tomography was performed when nonunion was clinically suspected.</p>

<p>Statistical analysis was performed using paired t tests to compare the preoperative and postoperative values of SF-12 and radiographic angle measurements.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1071100712468564">
<title>Operative Technique</title>
<p>The patient was placed supine on the operating table. A pneumatic thigh tourniquet was used in all cases. Gastrocnemius recession or percutaneous tendo-Achilles lengthening was performed initially when needed depending on whether there was isolated gastrocnemius tightness or both gastrocnemius and soleus tightness, respectively. The skin incision was made from just posterior to the medial malleolus to just distal to the navicular bone, parallel to and just above the tendon of posterior tibialis. The tendon sheath was opened and the tendon inspected. Only in cases of marked tendinosis was the tendon excised. A longitudinal incision was then made in the capsule of the talonavicular joint, which exposed the head of the talus and the navicular bone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1071100712468564">Figure 2</xref>). This capsular tissue and the posterior tibialis tendon were then sharply peeled off the talus and navicular bone to expose the TNJ and STJ. The TNJ was then distracted using lamina spreaders or pin distractors, and the articular surfaces of the talus and navicular bone were denuded of cartilage with the use of curettes, periosteal elevator, and/or burr under cool saline irrigation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1071100712468564">Figure 3</xref>). With the use of pin distractors or lamina spreader between the neck of talus and the calcaneus, the interosseous ligament was transected. This facilitated an anterior to posterior approach to all 3 facets of the subtalar joint while preserving the tibiocalcaneal fibers of the deltoid ligament (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1071100712468564">Figure 4</xref>). All the surfaces of the underside of the talus and the superior side of the calcaneus were now denuded of cartilage and soft tissue.</p>

<p>At this point, all joint surfaces were prepared for arthrodesis by drilling with a 2.5-mm drill and/or using an osteotome to break up the subchondral bone. Cancellous allograft bone chips were then placed into the subtalar and the talonavicular joints in all the cases. Other osteobiological adjuvants like demineralized bone matrix, platelet-rich plasma, or bone morphogenic protein we used in the majority of cases. The TNJ and STJ were aligned to reestablish a near-normal talo-second metatarsal angle and talar declination angle, and guide pins were driven across these joints to maintain the reduction. The foot alignment and guide pin placement were then confirmed under fluoroscopy.</p>
<p>The STJ was fixed with 1 or 2 cannulated screws from the posterior calcaneus into the talar body, and the TNJ was fixed with 2 or 3 cannulated screws (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1071100712468564">Figure 5</xref>). In some cases, the TNJ fixation was augmented by adding an additional cannulated naviculocalcaneal screw.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1071100712468564">12</xref></sup> If the fixed forefoot deformity could not be corrected using this technique and if the medial column was still supple, a first tarsometatarsal (TMT) or naviculocuneiform arthrodesis was added. All wounds were closed in layers.</p>

<title>Postoperative Treatment</title>
<p>The leg was placed in a well-padded short leg cast at the conclusion of surgery with non-weight-bearing for 6 weeks. The patients were gradually mobilized to full weight-bearing in a CAM walker over the next 3 to 6 weeks, at which time they could begin wearing regular shoes. Patients were systematically followed with regular postoperative clinical visits at 3 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="section12-1071100712468564">
<title>Union</title>
<p>Our overall union rate for patients was 89% (16/18 feet). One patient developed isolated TNJ nonunion and opted against reoperation because he had minimal associated functional limitations. One patient developed both subtalar and talonavicular nonunion and underwent another arthrodesis surgery 16 months later. One patient had delayed union of the TNJ.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1071100712468564">
<title>Time to Union</title>
<p>At 3 months follow-up, 8 of 18 feet (44 %) had fused and at 6 months follow-up another 7 feet (39%) had fused. Thus, 83% were solidly healed at both arthrodesis sites at 6 months, and the other patient with a delayed union of the TNJ eventually healed, increasing the union rate to 89% at final follow-up.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1071100712468564">
<title>Complications</title>
<p>One patient developed varus malunion due to overcorrection of deformity and had reoperation with a midtarsal arthrodesis along with a calcaneal closing wedge osteotomy. One patient developed valgus malunion due to undercorrection and underwent reoperation with a medial calcaneal slide. Three patients underwent surgery for removal of symptomatic hardware. Two patients developed valgus ankle deformity postoperatively. There were no wound-related complications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1071100712468564">Figure 6</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Posterior tibialis tendon dysfunction (PTTD) is the most common cause of planovalgus deformity in adults. Patients with PTTD can slowly progress to a severe or rigid deformity, characterized by dorsolateral subluxation of the navicular on the talus, lateral column shortening in relation to the medial column, fixed supination of the forefoot, and potential arthritis of the hindfoot joints. If conservative measures fail in such patients, acceptable operative intervention includes a triple arthrodesis where the STJ and both transverse tarsal joints are fused.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1071100712468564">17</xref></sup> Among the 3 hindfoot joints in triple arthrodesis, the position of the TNJ arthrodesis is considered the keystone for hindfoot and midfoot alignment. A properly positioned isolated arthrodesis of the TNJ has been shown to be effective in correcting all of the deformities of a flexible planovalgus foot, as shown by O’Malley et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1071100712468564">14</xref></sup> and Harper and Tisdel.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1071100712468564">8</xref></sup> However, in a rigid planovalgus foot, adequate correction of malalignment in the coronal plane cannot be achieved with just an isolated TNJ arthrodesis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1071100712468564">2</xref></sup> and therefore the STJ needs to be fused along with TNJ to achieve a well-positioned plantigrade foot. This calls into question the need for fusing the CCJ in triple arthrodesis to correct the planovalgus deformity.</p>
<p>By sparing the CCJ we avoid the inherent risk of its nonunion and also avoid further shortening of the lateral column of the foot, which in turn facilitates reduction of the abducted forefoot in planovalgus deformity. Adjacent joint (midfoot and ankle joints) arthritis as a result of abnormal stresses after triple arthrodesis ranges from 30% to 50%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1071100712468564">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1071100712468564">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1071100712468564">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1071100712468564">21</xref></sup> The small amount of motion that remains in the lateral column of the foot by sparing the CCJ, although not notable,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1071100712468564">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1071100712468564">23</xref></sup> may protect these adjacent joints by dissipating the forces during ambulation. Sammarco et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1071100712468564">19</xref></sup> found results supporting the above hypothesis in their study involving double arthrodesis at an average follow-up of 40 months.</p>
<p>The traditional approach for triple arthrodesis is to use 2 incisions, 1 on the medial side and 1 on the lateral side. In previous studies of triple arthrodesis, breakdown of lateral skin has been one of the complications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1071100712468564">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1071100712468564">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1071100712468564">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1071100712468564">18</xref></sup> This problem arises especially in severe valgus deformity when correction results in increased tension on the lateral side. By using a single medial incision to approach both the TNJ and STJ, the risk of lateral skin complication is reduced. Yet, there are often concerns about adequate preparation of these joints from the medial approach. A cadaver study on the normal foot by Jeng et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1071100712468564">10</xref></sup> showed that 91% of the STJ and 91% of the TNJ could be prepared by the medial approach. Moreover, in a planovalgus foot, the abducted forefoot and valgus hindfoot would further facilitate the exposure of these joints.</p>
<p>Given the above factors and the reports of excellent results after similar medial approach double arthrodesis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1071100712468564">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1071100712468564">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1071100712468564">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1071100712468564">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1071100712468564">22</xref></sup> the 2 senior authors began using this approach instead of traditional triple arthrodesis. We have used radiological parameters as described by Sangeorzan et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1071100712468564">20</xref></sup> to show that adequate correction of planovalgus deformity can be achieved by TNJ and STJ arthrodesis without the need for CCJ arthrodesis. These improvements in radiological angles are in fact comparable with the results seen in other similar medial approach double arthrodesis studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1071100712468564">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1071100712468564">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1071100712468564">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1071100712468564">22</xref></sup> However, the patient’s own assessment of appearance of the foot did not correlate with the radiological improvement. The appearance of only 5 feet (28%) out of 13 feet was believed to be better after surgery. One possible explanation is that it is difficult to assess the loss of the arch from the vertical view, and patients simply fail to notice the correction after surgery. None of the other studies reported the patients’ own assessments of the appearance of the foot.</p>
<p>There were no cases of wound complication or nonunion in any of the studies that used this approach. We, too, had no wound-related complications, supporting the hypothesis that skin complications occur less frequently with this procedure compared with triple arthrodesis. However, we had 2 cases of nonunion and 2 cases of malunion. Two patients in our series also developed valgus ankle deformity, similar to that noted by Jeng et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1071100712468564">11</xref></sup> using a medial approach for triple arthrodesis. We believe that during the medial approach to the subtalar joint, if the tibiocalcaneal part of deltoid ligament is damaged, deltoid laxity that might not have been clinically apparent in patients with long-standing planovalgus deformity would be further aggravated and manifest as progressive valgus tilt of the tibiotalar joint. Any residual hindfoot valgus after double arthrodesis can further accentuate the risk of development of tibiotalar valgus deformity. Hence, during exposure for this approach, care should be taken not to damage the tibiocalcaneal fibers of deltoid ligament.</p>
<p>The improvement in the postoperative physical component SF-12 score showed that the patients’ overall perception of their physical health and well-being improved. However, the overall satisfaction rate in our study was only 78%. All the 4 patients who were dissatisfied stated that they had moderate or severe daily pain, and 3 among them believed that the appearance of their foot was worse. Only Knupp et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1071100712468564">13</xref></sup> among the other studies reported patient satisfaction, and it was 53% excellent, 30% good, 13% fair, and 3% poor. Thus, the results in our small group of patients with PTTD were not unequivocal enough to support our hypothesis that arthrodesis of the subtalar and talonavicular joints corrects the malalignment, relieves symptoms, and provides a functional plantigrade foot.</p>
<p>There are number of limitations to this study. The most important limitation is the lack of a triple arthrodesis comparison group. The study population was small and retrospective, and follow-up was short. The patient population was from 2 different surgeons, and hence there are some variations in the operative techniques, fixation methods, and osteobiologics used. Several patients had associated procedures, and this may have affected the clinical outcome. The strengths of our study are that we included a homogenous group of patients with only PTTD for our medial approach double arthrodesis, and we placed greater emphasis on patient-reported outcomes in addition to objective results.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our results of single medial incision double arthrodesis in patients with posterior tibialis tendon dysfunction did not equal the better results reported in similar studies. Hence, we cannot recommend its routine use for rigid deformity secondary to posterior tibialis tendon dysfunction in lieu of triple arthrodesis. A prospective randomized study is essential to determine whether this approach is a good alternative to triple arthrodesis in nonparalytic planovalgus deformity.</p>
