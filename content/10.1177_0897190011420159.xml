<p>
<italic>Purpose:</italic> To report the cases of 2 hospitalized patients with chronic psychotic disorders who developed neuroleptic-induced catatonia (NIC), a catatonic-extrapyramidal syndrome occurring after administration of a D2-receptor antagonist, and delineate the importance of prompt recognition and treatment. <italic>Methods:</italic> Two patients with chronic psychotic disorders were admitted to the hospital for unstable medical conditions at which time their maintenance antipsychotic therapy was discontinued. Following administration of intravenous haloperidol, both patients developed catatonic and extrapyramidal signs. Both patients developed catatonia, rigidity, hyperthermia, leukocytosis, and elevations in creatine kinase. In both cases, the patients met the criteria for catatonia as evidenced by motoric immobility, stupor, mutism, and negativism. The syndrome resolved within a few days of stopping haloperidol and initiation of lorazepam. <italic>Conclusion:</italic> Neuroleptic-induced catatonia is underrecognized and can lead to potentially severe complications, although early recognition and treatment may prevent progression and complications. Previous reports do not underscore the importance of prompt recognition and treatment.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>Catatonia, with its diverse manifestations including motoric immobility or excitement, negativism or mutism, peculiarities of voluntary movement, and echolalia or echopraxia, is a neuropsychiatric syndrome that is underrecognized by many clinicians.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190011420159">1</xref>
</sup> Although clinicians are generally familiar with catatonic stupor, many do not appreciate the more complex manifestations. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0897190011420159">Table 1</xref>
 contains a list of catatonic signs and their definitions. There is also a misconception that catatonia occurs only in persons with schizophrenia; however, catatonic signs are recognized as a manifestation of a wide range of functional and organic illnesses that disrupt signaling pathways between the cerebral cortex, striatum, and thalamus.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0897190011420159">2</xref>
</sup> Functional disorders associated with catatonia include schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders as well as bipolar disorder, especially during episodes of mania and mixed mania. Medical causes include encephalitis, seizures, metabolic disturbances, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Drug-induced causes include phencyclidine, corticosteroids, disulfiram, and dopamine receptor antagonists.<sup>

<p>Malignant or lethal catatonia is a catatonic syndrome first reported in 1832. It is characterized by hyperthermia; muscular rigidity; autonomic disturbances, including increased or labile blood pressure, tachycardia, and diaphoresis; and altered levels of consciousness, ranging from confusion to coma. Although it is conceptualized primarily as a complication of long-standing psychosis, malignant catatonia may also occur as a complication of infectious diseases and other medical conditions.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0897190011420159">4</xref>
</sup> Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is an iatrogenic condition that occurs after administration of a dopamine receptor antagonist and may present in a similar and often indistinguishable fashion from malignant catatonia.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0897190011420159">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0897190011420159"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0897190011420159">6</xref>
</sup> Conceptualized as a state of profound reduction in dopaminergic tone, risk factors for NMS generally affect dopamine signaling in the central nervous system.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0897190011420159">5</xref>
</sup> Antipsychotic agent-related risk factors for NMS include high dosages, use of high-potency agents, and parenteral administration.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0897190011420159">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0897190011420159">8</xref>
</sup> Other pharmacologic risk factors that alter dopaminergic tone include concurrent therapy with lithium or metoclopramide and withdrawal of dopamine agonists or anticholinergic agents.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0897190011420159">5</xref>
</sup> Catatonia, organic brain syndrome, brain injury, extrapyramidal movement disorders, iron deficiency, dehydration, and use of restraints are also known risk factors.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0897190011420159">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0897190011420159">9</xref>
</sup> Severe and life-threatening complications of NMS include aspiration pneumonia, acute renal failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, and cardiac arrest.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0897190011420159">5</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Additionally, a catatonic-extrapyramidal syndrome associated with the administration of dopamine receptor antagonists called neuroleptic-induced catatonia (NIC) was first reported in 1958. In this report, Berry et al described 2 children that developed catatonia and dystonia after the administration of perphenazine, which resolved completely upon discontinuation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0897190011420159">10</xref>
</sup> Subsequent reports describe NIC with various other extrapyramidal symptoms including parkinsonism<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0897190011420159">11</xref>
</sup> and dyskinesias,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0897190011420159">12</xref>
</sup> occurring mainly after administration of high-potency antipsychotic agents. The true incidence of NIC is unknown, but is probably rare, as the literature is comprised mostly of isolated case reports. A recent report by Lee describes, for the first time, the clinical manifestations and treatment response of a group of patients with NIC.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0897190011420159">13</xref>
</sup> The report provides evidence of a progression from simple catatonic and extrapyramidal signs to a more malignant form consisting of hyperthermia, delirium, and autonomic disturbances, with 17% of patients meeting the criteria for NMS. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0897190011420159">Table 2</xref>
 lists the manifestations of malignant catatonia, NMS, and NIC. We describe 2 hospitalized patients who, after discontinuation of prior antipsychotic therapy and administration of haloperidol intravenously (IV), developed NIC with hyperthermia, leukocytosis, and an elevated creatine kinase (CK).</p>

<title>Case Report 1</title>
<p>A 48-year-old female was transported to the emergency room from a psychiatric institution following a foreign body ingestion. Her past medical history was significant for schizoaffective disorder, mild mental retardation, borderline personality disorder, seizure disorder, type 1 diabetes mellitus, multiple small bowel resections following foreign body ingestions, and chronic bronchitis. Oral medications upon admission included clozapine 150 mg twice a day, famotidine 20 mg twice a day, diphenhydramine 100 mg at bedtime, glimepiride 4 mg/d, lamotrigine 100 mg twice a day, and paroxetine 40 mg/d. On admission, she appeared restless, lethargic, and vomited coffee ground-like material. Her vital signs were stable with a body temperature of 36.6°C, blood pressure of 105/90 mm Hg, heart rate of 67 beats/min, and respiratory rate of 12 breaths/min. Admission laboratory data were significant for an elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 69 mg/dL (normal range 7-23 mg/dL), serum creatinine of 5.6 mg/dL (0.5-1.3 mg/dL), white blood count (WBC) of 19.8 × 10<sup>3</sup> per mm<sup>3</sup> (4-10.610<sup>3</sup> per mm<sup>3</sup>), and blood glucose level of 245 mg/dL (70-99 mg/dL). Physical examination was unremarkable, except for multiple abdominal scars. Abdominal X-ray showed multiple foreign bodies. She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for observation, for treatment of dehydration, and to rule out upper gastrointestinal bleed.</p>
<p>After arriving in the ICU, she remained awake, alert, and compliant with the procedures prescribed. She was hallucinatory and responded to voices as she mumbled intermittently between answering questions. Her medication regimen in the ICU included subcutaneous heparin 5000 units every 12 hours, lamotrigine 100 mg twice a day, pantoprazole 40 mg IV every 12 hours, and haloperidol 5 mg IV as needed for agitation. The patient received 6 doses of haloperidol for agitation during the first 3 days of her ICU stay. All other medications, including her psychiatric medications were discontinued.</p>
<p>On the morning of ICU day 4, the patient was withdrawn, completely mute, and unresponsive to commands. Her last dose of haloperidol was given 12 hours prior. Her physical examination was unremarkable except rigidity in the upper extremities. Laboratory data and vital signs were unremarkable, except for a temperature of 38.6°C; a mild, but resolving leukocytosis (WBC 13 × 10<sup>3</sup> per mm<sup>3</sup>); a mild CK elevation of 723 U/L (normal range 30-200 U/L), and a normal CK myocardial-band (CK-MB) isoenzyme (1.98 ng/mL, normal range &lt;6.7 ng/mL). Paroxetine 20 mg/d and diphenhydramine 50 mg/d were reinitiated, haloperidol was discontinued, and lorazepam 1 mg IV every 6 hours was initiated for the treatment of catatonia. After 2 days, fever, leukocytosis, and muscular rigidity resolved and the patient was able to initiate conversation and follow commands. Psychiatry was consulted and recommended continuing lorazepam 1 mg orally every 6 hours, increasing the paroxetine dose to 30 mg/d, changing diphenydramine to 50 mg at bedtime, and restarting clozapine 25 mg twice a day. The patient was discharged back to the psychiatric institute without any further complications.</p>

<title>Case Report 2</title>
<p>A 38-year-old white male with a history of schizoaffective disorder and hypertension presented with a 2-week history of bilateral lower extremity weakness, urinary retention, and constipation. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a thoracic intramedullary tumor at the level of T11-T12, for which IV dexamethasone 4 mg every 8 hours was started and neurosurgery was scheduled for removal of the tumor.</p>
<p>Upon admission, the patient was receiving the following oral medications: aripiprazole 30 mg/d, zolpidem 5 mg at bedtime, venlafaxine XR 150 mg/d, mirtazapine 45 mg at bedtime, quetiapine 550 mg/d at bedtime, atenolol 25 mg twice a day, tamsulosin 0.4 mg at bedtime, and docusate 100 mg 3 times a day. The patient remained on all admission medications, except quetiapine, mirtazapine, and venlafaxine, which were tapered down to quetiapine 100 mg at bedtime, mirtazapine 15 mg at bedtime, and venlafaxine XR 75 mg/d over a 3-day period. During the 3-day tapering period, the patient became restless and paranoid for which he received a total of 4 mg of IV haloperidol and 2 mg of IV lorazepam.</p>
<p>Neurosurgery was performed on hospital day 4. The patient received the following medications during surgery: midazolam, propofol, cefazolin, ephedrine, morphine, fentanyl, remifentanil, succinylcholine, dexamethasone, phenylephrine, and ondansetron. Haloperidol 5 mg IV twice a day was initiated after surgery to treat restlessness and paranoia. Over the next 2 days, the patient progressively deteriorated, where he became withdrawn, completely mute, and unresponsive to verbal or aggressive tactile stimulation. Upon physical examination, he had mild rigidity. His laboratory data and vital signs were within normal limits, except for a temperature of 38.6°C, an elevated WBC of 14 × 10<sup>3</sup> per mm<sup>3</sup>, and a total CK level of 1377 U/L. His CK-MB isoenzyme (4.02 ng/mL) and serum creatinine (0.9 mg/dL) were within normal limits. Haloperidol was discontinued and the patient was started empirically on the following IV antibiotics: metronidazole, vancomycin, and ceftriaxone, later switched to meropenem and vancomycin for possible meningitis. An MRI of the spine was negative. On hospital day 8, the patient’s WBC count started to normalize (11.2 × 10<sup>3</sup> per mm<sup>3</sup>) but hi,s CK increased to 1980 U/L and CK-MB isoenzyme further increased to 8.47 ng/mL. The patient was placed on lorazepam 1 mg IV as needed and received a total of 5 mg over a 3-day period. Over the next couple of days, his CK started to normalize to 574 U/L, and his CK-MB isoenzyme normalized to 6.34 ng/mL. On hospital day 12, the patient became more responsive and had no signs of rigidity. Results of blood and urine cultures were negative, and a lumbar puncture revealed no evidence of infection; therefore, antibiotics were discontinued. Dexamethasone was discontinued 2 days later and the patient was discharged to rehabilitation.</p>

<sec id="section4-0897190011420159">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Both patients developed signs consistent with NIC after intravenous administration of haloperidol. Our first patient developed catatonia, rigidity, hyperthermia, and mild elevations in leukocyte count and CK shortly after administration of IV haloperidol. We do not suspect her elevated leukocyte count to be exclusively related to NIC, as it was elevated prior to administration of haloperidol and trending down when the patient developed catatonic and extrapyramidal signs. The second patient developed catatonia, mild rigidity, hyperthermia, leukocytosis, and CK elevation shortly after intravenous administration of haloperidol. Due to the magnitude of the increase in CK, we suspect the surgical procedure played only a minor role in contributing to muscle injury with the major contributor being NIC. In both the cases, the patients met the criteria for catatonia as evidenced by motoric immobility/stupor, mutism, and negativism. No attempt was made to illicit any additional catatonic signs such as gegenhalten, mitgehen, echopraxia, and waxy flexibility. Each patient received a score of 4 on the Naranjo probability scale,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0897190011420159">14</xref>
</sup> indicating that the catatonic-extrapyramidal syndrome experienced by each patient was possibly caused by haloperidol.</p>
<p>Treatment of NIC is similar to the treatment of other catatonic syndromes in that both typically involve identification and reversal of any underlying causes and administration of adjunctive benzodiazepines.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0897190011420159">3</xref>
</sup> In both the patients, signs of NIC resolved within a few days of stopping haloperidol and initiation of lorazepam. This is in accord with the experience of Lee who reported that 78% of patients with NIC showed full response to benzodiazepine treatment within hours to 3 days.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0897190011420159">13</xref>
</sup> Indeed, recent neuroimaging data implicate reduced density of γ-amino butyric acid (GABA<sub>A</sub>) receptors in the left sensorimotor cortex of patients with akinetic catatonia compared with psychiatric patients and normal controls.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0897190011420159">15</xref>
</sup> High doses of benzodiazepines seem to be necessary to relieve signs of catatonia; a reasonable starting dose of lorazepam is 1 mg every 6 hours titrated to a maximum of 12 mg/d with careful monitoring so as not to oversedate the patient. Therapy should be continued until the underlying cause is treated.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0897190011420159">3</xref>
</sup> Other drugs that may be useful for NIC include anticholinergic agents and amantadine.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0897190011420159">13</xref>
</sup> We were not able to identify any reports on the effectiveness of electroconvulsive therapy, an established treatment for catatonic syndromes, for NIC.</p>
<p>Although neither patient met the criteria established by the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic> (Fourth Edition, Text Revision)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0897190011420159">16</xref>
</sup> for NMS due to the absence of severe rigidity, it is reasonable to suspect that the signs of NIC represented a harbinger of NMS. Catatonia is recognized as a prodromal sign of NMS and both patients had additional risk factors for NMS: the first patient was agitated, dehydrated, had her antiparkinsonism medication recently discontinued, and received a parenteral, high-potency antipsychotic agent; the second patient was also agitated and received a parenteral, high-potency antipsychotic agent.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0897190011420159">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0897190011420159">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0897190011420159"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0897190011420159">9</xref>
</sup> Lee reported simple NIC—catatonic and extrapyramidal signs—progressed to a syndrome consistent with NMS including autonomic instability, delirium, and hyperthermia in 17% of patients.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0897190011420159">13</xref>
</sup> Both the patients presented with signs that, although not severe, may represent an impending NMS. Rapid recognition and treatment, as exemplified in these 2 patients, may reduce the risk of progression to NMS with its severe and life-threatening complications.</p>
<p>A common factor in both the cases was rapid discontinuation of antipsychotic agents, clozapine in the first patient and quetiapine in the second. Rapid tapering and discontinuation of antipsychotic medication in patients with schizophrenia is associated with psychotic exacerbations. Clozapine seems to be unique in that psychotic exacerbations tend to be severe and may occur shortly after discontinuation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0897190011420159">17</xref>
</sup> A literature search also revealed several cases of emergent catatonia associated with discontinuation of clozapine therapy.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0897190011420159">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0897190011420159"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0897190011420159">20</xref>
</sup> In one report,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0897190011420159">18</xref>
</sup> a 30-year-old man developed florid psychotic symptoms and catatonia 36 hours after discontinuation of clozapine. After treatment with a combination of first-generation antipsychotic agents, the patient developed NMS. This case demonstrates the danger of rapid discontinuation of antipsychotic agents and underscores the risk of NMS with aggressive use of conventional antipsychotic agents in patients with catatonia. It is possible that our patients' catatonic syndrome may be related to rapid withdrawal of antipsychotic agents, as signs of catatonia emerged after about 8 half-lives of both clozapine and quetiapine. However, we feel the more likely etiology is IV haloperidol, given the closer temporal relation with haloperidol administration and rapid resolution of symptoms following haloperidol discontinuation.</p>
<p>It is unlikely that the catatonic-extrapyramidal syndrome experienced by these patients is related to the discontinuation of other psychoactive medications; however, rapid withdrawal of various psychoactive medications is associated with distinct somatic withdrawal symptoms. Rapid tapering of antipsychotic agents with significant anticholinergic properties (eg, clozapine and quetiapine) is associated with somatic symptoms thought to be due to cholinergic rebound.<sup>

</sup> Clozapine withdrawal symptoms were assessed in patients completing a 28-day pharmacokinetic study. Following abrupt discontinuation of 200 mg/d of clozapine, withdrawal symptoms noted over a 7-day period included agitation, headache, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.<sup>

</sup> Case data reveal symptoms such as nausea, dizziness, headache, anxiety, and choreic dyskinsia occurring with quetiapine withdrawal.<sup>

</sup> A literature search did not yield any report of aripiprazole withdrawal symptoms. Mirtazapine withdrawal symptoms include anxiety, restlessness, irritability, nausea, vomiting, and insomnia.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0897190011420159">24</xref>
</sup> Venlafaxine withdrawal symptoms include dizziness, anxiety, paresthesias, irritability, flu-like symptoms, hallucinations, hypomania, and psychomotor agitation.<sup>

</sup> Clinicians who are not familiar with the withdrawal symptoms of psychoactive agents may misinterpret these symptoms as a manifestation of psychopathology or an underlying medical problem. We cannot speak confidently about whether or not the patients in this report experienced any of these withdrawal effects, as catatonia likely prevented them from spontaneously reporting such side effects.</p>
<p>Corticosteroid administration is associated with catatonia,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0897190011420159">26</xref>
</sup> but the second patient’s catatonic signs resolved despite continued treatment with dexamethasone, indicating dexamethasone administration most likely did not play a role in the genesis of catatonia in this patient. The second patient also received a single dose of succinylcholine (120 mg), which is associated with malignant hyperthermia.<sup>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Neuroleptic-induced catatonia, a catatonic-extrapyramidal syndrome occurring after administration of a D2-receptor antagonist, can lead to potentially severe complications. Increased familiarity with the signs of catatonia will facilitate prompt identification and treatment of catatonic syndromes such as NIC. These cases exemplify the fact that prompt recognition and treatment may prevent symptomatic progression and complications. Rapid tapering and discontinuation of antipsychotic medication should be discouraged, as it is associated with withdrawal symptoms and may create issues in the interpretation of somatic symptoms.</p>
