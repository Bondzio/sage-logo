<p>The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of a shortened version of the Raven Standard Progressive Matrices (SPM) under an item response theory framework (the one- and two-parameter logistic models). The shortened Raven SPM was administered to <italic>N</italic> = 453 cognitively healthy adults aged between 24 and 83 years. The IQ point estimates that were obtained under the one- and two-parameter logistic models were very similar (<italic>r</italic> = .97), but the two-parameter logistic-based test version had a higher measurement precision. The results showed that older age and being female were associated with a lower Raven SPM test performance. A user-friendly computer program was provided to facilitate the scoring and norming of the shortened Raven SPM under the different frameworks.</p>

<p>The Raven Standard Progressive Matrices (SPM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1073191111415999">Raven, 1938</xref>) is a test of nonverbal reasoning ability and general intelligence (the so-called <italic>g</italic> factor; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1073191111415999">Spearman, 1927</xref>) that minimizes cultural bias. The Raven SPM contains 60 items that are arranged in five sets of 12 items each (Sets A, B, C, D, and E). Each item requires the examinee to infer a rule relating to a collection of elements and then use this rule to verify that a presented element is a legitimate relative to the rule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1073191111415999">Alderton &amp; Larson, 1990</xref>). There are three versions of the test: the “classic” SPM, the Colored Progressive Matrices (a simplified version of the test for those of limited intellectual ability), and the Advanced Progressive Matrices (a more difficult version of the test that discriminates between the top 25% of the SPM distribution). Administration and scoring procedures of the Raven tests are straightforward, and their reliability and validity are well established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1073191111415999">Raven, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1073191111415999">Strauss, Sherman, &amp; Spreen, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast to most other intelligence tests, the Raven SPM lacks a strong dependence on auditory perception, manipulative skills, or verbal output. This makes the Raven SPM suited for use in a wide range of practical settings, for example, in neuropsychological settings with brain damaged people who suffer from paresis or aphasia. However, a drawback of the Raven SPM is that its administration time is relatively long (between 40 and 60 minutes). In clinical practice, shorter tests are generally preferred because many people who are referred for cognitive evaluation are not able to undergo long test sessions (e.g., people with brain dysfunction). In the present study, a shortened version of the Raven SPM was administered to a large sample of community-dwelling healthy adults. The shortened Raven SPM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1073191111415999">Bouma, Mulder, &amp; Lindeboom, 1996</xref>) comprises 36 items (Sets B, C, and D) rather than 60 items (Sets A, B, C, D, and E), which reduces the test administration time by about 40% (as compared with the full 60-item SPM test).</p>
<p>Two statistical frameworks are often used to evaluate the psychometric properties of psychological tests, that is, classical test theory (CTT) and item response theory (IRT). In CTT models, the test score of a person <italic>s</italic> is assumed to consist of the sum of the true trait score of this person and some measurement error (i.e., <italic>X<sub>s</sub></italic> = <italic>T<sub>s</sub></italic> + <italic>E<sub>s</sub></italic>). Both the true score and the measurement error are unobserved (or latent) variables, so the equation is not solvable unless some simplifying assumptions are made. CTT models generally assume (a) that the true trait scores and the error scores are uncorrelated, (b) that the average of the error scores in the population is zero, and (c) that the error scores on parallel tests are uncorrelated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1073191111415999">Hambleton &amp; Jones, 1993</xref>). After making these assumptions, the true test score of an individual can be defined as the expected test score over parallel tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1073191111415999">Lord &amp; Novick, 1968</xref>). CTT models have several advantages. For example, they are well known to most psychologists and intelligence researchers, they make relatively weak theoretical assumptions (and are thus easily applicable in many different testing situations), they use simple mathematical procedures, and they require relatively small samples of examinees to establish the required item parameter estimates. However, there are also some disadvantages to CTT models. For example, the person statistics (i.e., the estimated ability levels) are test-sample dependent, and the item statistics (i.e., the estimated item difficulty and item discrimination parameters) are examinee-sample dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1073191111415999">Embretson &amp; Reise, 2000</xref>). These dependencies may pose some problems, for example, in the context of establishing unbiased normative data or in the context of setting up computerized adaptive testing procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1073191111415999">Hambleton &amp; Jones, 1993</xref>). Moreover, CTT-based tests assume that the measurement precision of a test is identical for each ability level, but this assumption is often not realistic. For example, a very intelligent person who is administered a relatively easy IQ test will often obtain a very high or the maximum score. This score should however be considered a lower bound of the intelligence of this person rather than an accurate estimate.</p>
<p>IRT models may help solve some of these problems, at least theoretically. IRT models are a general class of multivariate regression models that link item responses to unobserved ability estimates and unobserved item parameters. Most IRT models assume (a) that the test performance of an examinee can be described by his or her underlying ability and (b) that the relationship between examinee item performance and ability can be described by specific mathematical equations. For example, the two-parameter logistic (2PL) IRT model assumes that the probability that examinee <italic>s</italic> solves item <italic>i</italic> can be modeled as <italic>P</italic>(<italic>X<sub>is</sub></italic> = 1|θ<italic><sub>s</sub></italic>, β<italic><sub>i</sub></italic>, α<italic><sub>i</sub></italic>) = exp[α<italic><sub>i</sub></italic>(θ<italic><sub>s</sub></italic> − β<italic><sub>i</sub></italic>)]/(1 + exp[α<italic><sub>i</sub></italic>(θ<italic><sub>s</sub></italic> − β<italic><sub>i</sub></italic>)]). In this equation, θ<italic><sub>s</sub></italic> is the ability level of the person <italic>s</italic>, α<italic><sub>i</sub></italic> is the item discrimination value, and β<italic><sub>i</sub></italic> is the item difficulty level. The one-parameter logistic (1PL) model is a simplification of the 2PL model, in which all item discrimination parameters are assumed to be constant (i.e., the α<italic><sub>i</sub></italic> parameter in the previous equation is replaced by parameter α). The interpretation of the item discrimination (α<italic><sub>i</sub></italic>) and item difficulty (β<italic><sub>i</sub></italic>) parameters is graphically illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1073191111415999">Figure 1</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1073191111415999">Figure 1</xref> (left) presents the item characteristic curves (ICCs) of two hypothetical items that were calibrated under a 1PL model. Suppose that these items had difficulty levels β<sub>1</sub> = −2 and β<sub>2</sub> = 2, respectively, and discrimination value α = 1. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1073191111415999">Figure 1</xref> (left), the item difficulty parameters refer to the ability levels (θ<italic><sub>s</sub></italic>) that are needed for an individual to answer the item correctly with a 50% probability. Thus, a person with an ability level θ<italic><sub>s</sub></italic> = −2 has an expected probability of .50 to answer Item 1 correctly (and an expected probability of .02 to answer Item 2 correctly), and a person with an ability level θ<italic><sub>s</sub></italic> = 2 has an expected probability of .50 to answer Item 2 correctly (and an expected probability of .98 to answer Item 1 correctly). Under the 1PL model, the slopes of all ICCs are identical (i.e., the item discrimination parameter α is fixed for all items), which means that the expected probabilities of a correct response for Item 1 are always higher when compared with the expected probabilities of a correct response for Item 2 (conditional on the ability level θ<italic><sub>s</sub></italic>).</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1073191111415999">Figure 1</xref> (right) presents the ICCs for two other hypothetical items (Items 3 and 4), which were now calibrated under the 2PL model. Suppose that these items had difficulty levels β<sub>3</sub> = β<sub>4</sub> = 0 and discrimination values α<sub>3</sub> = 0.50 and α<sub>4</sub> = 1.50, respectively. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1073191111415999">Figure 1</xref> (right), the interpretation of the item difficulty level under the 2PL model is exactly the same as under the 1PL model (i.e., the ability level that is needed to answer an item correctly with a 50% probability). The item discrimination parameter α<italic><sub>i</sub></italic> is proportional to the slope of the ICC at point β<italic><sub>i</sub></italic>. Item 4 has a higher discrimination value than Item 3, which means that changes in the ability level (around point β<italic><sub>i</sub></italic>, i.e., around 0) result in larger changes in the probabilities to answer Item 4 correctly when compared with the changes that occur in the probabilities to answer Item 3 correctly. For example, a change in ability level from −1 to 0 results in an increase of .31 and .12 of the probabilities to answer Items 4 and 3 correctly, respectively.</p>
<p>It has been argued that IRT models have several advantages when compared with CTT models. First, IRT models allow for estimating item-invariant and person-invariant parameters. This means that the parameters that characterize the examinees (i.e., their ability levels θ<italic><sub>s</sub></italic>) are <italic>in</italic>dependent from the specific items that were administered, and the parameters that characterize the items (i.e., their difficulty levels β<italic><sub>i</sub></italic> and discrimination levels α<italic><sub>i</sub></italic> or α) are <italic>in</italic>dependent of the ability distribution in the normative sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1073191111415999">Hambleton, Swaminathan, &amp; Rogers, 1991</xref>). Second, the IRT difficulty parameters (β<italic><sub>i</sub></italic>) and examinee ability levels (θ<italic><sub>s</sub></italic>) are placed on the same scale, which makes it relatively straightforward to design tests that discriminate maximally among examinees within the desired ability range, set-up computerized testing procedures, or equate different test versions. Third, IRT models facilitate an item-based interpretation of the examinee’s ability level (θ<italic><sub>s</sub></italic>). For example, an ability level equal to zero (i.e., θ<italic><sub>s</sub></italic> = 0) does not simply indicate that the examinee has an “average” ability level but also allows an interpretation of the probability by which the particular test items will be correctly answered (see above). Fourth, IRT models do not assume an equal measurement precision across the entire ability range but allow for different measurement errors as a function of ability level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1073191111415999">Embretson &amp; Reise, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>The aim of the present study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of the shortened Raven SPM under the 1PL and 2PL IRT models, based on a sample of <italic>N</italic> = 453 cognitively healthy adults (aged between 24 and 83 years). Previous studies have suggested that age and sex were associated with Raven SPM test performance (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1073191111415999">Lynn &amp; Irwing, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1073191111415999">Strauss et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, the effects of these demographic variables on the Raven SPM performance were also evaluated in the present study, so that normative IQ conversions could be established, which took these demographic influences into account.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>The data were derived from the Maastricht Aging Study, a prospective study into the determinants of normal cognitive aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1073191111415999">Jolles, Houx, Van Boxtel, &amp; Ponds, 1995</xref>). All participants were recruited from the Registration Network Family Practices, which includes 80,000 people who live in the Netherlands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1073191111415999">Metsemakers, Höppener, Knottnerus, Kocken, &amp; Limonard, 1992</xref>). Physicians from this network classify medical conditions according to the International Classification of Health Problems in Primary Care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1073191111415999">Lamberts &amp; Wood, 1987</xref>). Based on this information, an eligible study sample was selected (i.e., individuals with medical conditions known to interfere with cognitive functioning—such as cerebrovascular pathology, epilepsy, and dementia—were excluded beforehand). A total of 10,396 eligible individuals aged between 24 and 83 years were subsequently randomly drawn from the registration network. These people were informed about the study by their general practitioner (which was expected to improve compliance), and they were asked to return a prepaid postcard indicating their willingness to participate in the study. The 4,490 people who agreed to participate in the study were further screened in a semistructured interview to check for additional exclusion criteria that were not coded in the Registration Network Family Practices (i.e., a history of transient ischemic attacks, brain surgery, hemodialysis for renal failure, electroconvulsive therapy, and chronic psychotropic drug use). Of the remaining 4,189 individuals, 1,856 people were randomly selected for participation in the Maastricht Aging Study. The data were collected in four smaller panels instead of in a single large panel for logistic reasons. The shortened Raven SPM test was administered to one panel (<italic>N</italic> = 470 participants).</p>
<p>Not all data for the 470 participants were analyzed: a score below 24 on the Mini-Mental State Examination (a screening tool for cognitive impairment and dementia; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1073191111415999">Folstein, Folstein, &amp; McHugh, 1975</xref>) and the occurrence of technical problems during test assessment resulted in exclusion. After these corrections—which excluded the data of an additional <italic>n</italic> = 13 and <italic>n</italic> = 4 participants, respectively—the data of <italic>N</italic> = 453 participants were available for the analysis. Basic descriptive data for the sample are provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1073191111415999">Table 1</xref>. Level of education (LE) was grouped as follows: those with at most primary education (LE low), those with junior vocational training (LE average), and those with senior vocational or academic training (LE high). This LE system is often used in the Netherlands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1073191111415999">De Bie, 1987</xref>) and is comparable with the International Standard Classification of Education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1073191111415999">United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation, 1976</xref>). All participants were native Dutch speakers, and all were of Caucasian background.</p>

<title>Procedure and Instruments</title>
<p>The shortened Raven SPM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1073191111415999">Bouma et al., 1996</xref>) was individually administered by trained test assistants at the neuropsychological laboratory of the School for Mental Health and Neuroscience in Maastricht (the Netherlands). The shortened Raven SPM consisted of three sets of items of the original Raven SPM (Sets B, C, and D). Each item presented a matrix of black and white elements. The examinee was required to infer a rule relating to the collection of elements and verify that a presented element was a legitimate relative to the rule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1073191111415999">Alderton &amp; Larson, 1990</xref>). Each item set contained 12 multiple choice items (Items B1-B12, C1-C12, and D1-D12) with 6 (Set B) or 8 (Sets C and D) response options. Each item was scored as 1 (correct response) or 0 (incorrect response). All examinees were allowed to complete the entire test without a time limit being set.</p>

<sec id="section4-1073191111415999">
<title>Statistical Analyses</title>
<p>Two IRT models were fitted to the data, that is, a 1PL model and a 2PL model. In the 2PL model, the dependent variable was the dichotomous item score and the independent variables were the person’s ability score (θ<italic><sub>s</sub></italic>), the item difficulty levels (β<italic><sub>i</sub></italic>), and the item discrimination levels (α<italic><sub>i</sub></italic>). In the 1PL model, the restriction was set that the discrimination levels should be equal for all items (i.e., α<italic><sub>i</sub></italic> = α). Item fit was evaluated with Bock’s χ<sup>2</sup> index (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1073191111415999">Bock, 1972</xref>). A Monte Carlo procedure with 500 replications was used to approximate the distribution of the item–fit statistics under the null hypothesis (i.e., under the assumption that the observed data were generated under the 1PL or 2PL model). Items that did not fit the model (i.e., items with <italic>p</italic> values of the Bock χ<sup>2</sup> index &lt;.01) were excluded one after the other, starting with the item that had the highest Bock χ<sup>2</sup> index and with parameter re-recalibration after exclusion of an item. Unidimensionality was evaluated by testing the null hypothesis that the second eigenvalue of the tetrachoric correlation matrix of the observed data was not significantly different from the average second eigenvalues of the data generated under the assumed IRT model (using Monte Carlo approximation with 500 replications; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1073191111415999">Drasgow &amp; Lissak, 1983</xref>). Expected a posteriori (EAP) scoring with 21 quadrature nodes was used to estimate the ability levels of the examinees under the 1PL and 2PL models (referred to as θ<sub><italic>s</italic>.1PL</sub> and θ<sub><italic>s</italic>.2PL</sub>, respectively). The EAP is a Bayesian estimator derived from the mean of the posterior distribution. The standard errors of the EAP trait-level estimates were derived by computing the posterior standard deviations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1073191111415999">Bock &amp; Mislevy, 1982</xref>). Test information curves were provided to evaluate the measurement precision of the shortened Raven SPM over the entire range of the θ<sub><italic>s</italic>.1PL</sub> and θ<sub><italic>s</italic>.2PL</sub> levels. The SEMs in IRT are derived from these information curves (i.e., SEM(θ<italic><sub>s</sub></italic>) = 1/√Information(θ<italic><sub>s</sub></italic>)).</p>
<p>The effects of age and sex on the shortened Raven SPM performance were evaluated by regressing the ability estimates (i.e., θ<sub><italic>s</italic>.1PL</sub> and θ<sub><italic>s</italic>.2PL</sub>) on Age, Age<sup>2</sup>, Sex, and the Age × Sex and Age<sup>2</sup> × Sex interaction terms. Age was centered (age = calendar age − 50) before quadratic terms and interactions were calculated to avoid multicollinearity. Age<sup>2</sup> was included in the model to evaluate the occurrence of nonlinear effects of age on shortened Raven SPM performance. Sex was coded as <italic>male</italic> = 1 and <italic>female</italic> = 0. Nonsignificant predictors (<italic>p</italic> &gt; .01) were excluded from the full models (i.e., the models that included all predictors), but no predictor was removed as long as it was also included in a higher order term in the model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1073191111415999">Aiken &amp; West, 1991</xref>). The assumptions of regression analysis were tested for each model. Homoscedasticity was evaluated by grouping the participants into quartiles of the predicted scores and applying the Levene test. Normality of the residuals was investigated by conducting Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests on the standardized residuals. The occurrence of multicollinearity was checked by calculating variance inflation factors (VIFs), which should not exceed 10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1073191111415999">Belsley, Kuh, &amp; Welsch, 1980</xref>). Potential influential cases were identified by calculating Cook’s distances.</p>
<p>Normative conversions of the shortened Raven SPM ability scores (i.e., θ<sub><italic>s</italic>.1PL</sub> and θ<sub><italic>s</italic>.2PL</sub>) into age- and sex-corrected IQ scores were established by means of a four-step procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1073191111415999">Van Breukelen &amp; Vlaeyen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1073191111415999">Van der Elst, van Boxtel, van Breukelen, &amp; Jolles, 2005</xref>). First, the predicted shorted Raven SPM ability scores were computed by means of the final regression models (=<italic>B</italic><sub>0</sub> + <italic>B</italic><sub>1</sub><italic>X</italic><sub>1</sub> + · · · + <italic>B<sub>n</sub>X<sub>n</sub></italic>, with <italic>B</italic><sub>0</sub> = the intercept, <italic>B<sub>n</sub></italic> = the regression weight(s), and <italic>X<sub>n</sub></italic> = the predictor values). Second, the residuals were calculated (<italic>e<sub>i</sub></italic> = observed ability score − predicted ability score). Third, the residuals were standardized (<italic>Z<sub>i</sub></italic> = <italic>e<sub>i</sub></italic>/<italic>SD</italic>(residual), with <italic>SD</italic>(residual) = the standard deviation of the residuals in the normative sample). If heteroscedasticity occurs, the <italic>SD</italic>(residual) values to be used in the standardization of the residuals are computed per quartile of the predicted scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1073191111415999">Van Breukelen &amp; Vlaeyen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1073191111415999">Van der Elst et al., 2005</xref>). Fourth, the standardized residuals were linearly transformed and placed on an IQ scale (with <italic>M</italic> = 100 and <italic>SD</italic> = 15). The obtained IQ estimates of person <italic>s</italic> under the 1PL and 2PL models are referred to as IQ<sub><italic>s</italic>.1PL</sub> and IQ<sub><italic>s</italic>.2PL</sub>, respectively.</p>
<p>The relation between the age- and sex-corrected IQ scores under the 1PL and 2PL models was evaluated by means of a scatterplot matrix, by computing the correlation between both IQ measures, that is, <italic>r</italic>(IQ<sub><italic>s</italic>.1PL</sub>, IQ<sub><italic>s</italic>.2PL</sub>), and by evaluating the percentage of pairwise agreement. Agreement was defined as a maximum discrepancy of 10 points between two IQ estimates.</p>
<p>All analyses were conducted with the R 2.11.1 software package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1073191111415999">R Development Core Team, 2010</xref>) for Linux. The <italic>ltm</italic> library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1073191111415999">Rizopoulos, 2006</xref>) was used to conduct the IRT analyses. An α level of .01 was used in all analyses.</p>

<title>Regression-Based Normative Data for the Shortened Raven SPM</title>
<p>Normative conversions of the shortened Raven SPM ability scores into age- and sex-corrected IQ scores are established by means of the four-step procedure described above. For example, suppose that a 50-year-old male obtained a θ<sub><italic>s</italic>.2PL</sub> score equal to 0. The user of the regression-based norms first calculates the expected θ<sub><italic>s</italic>.2PL</sub> score for this person, that is, 0.23 (= −.04 + (50 − 50) * −0.03) + (1 * 0.27)). Second, the residual is calculated, that is, −0.23 (= 0 − 0.23). Third, the residual is standardized, that is, −0.31 (= −0.23/0.74). Fourth, the standardized residual is placed on an IQ scale with <italic>M</italic> = 100 and <italic>SD =</italic> 15, that is, IQ<sub><italic>s</italic>.2PL</sub> = 95 (= −0.31 * 15 + 100).</p>
<p>The four-step normative procedure provides accurate norms but lacks user-friendliness because the user of the norms has to actively make the required computations. Moreover, the IRT ability scores are to be estimated using EAP scoring. This scoring method requires a large number of computations, which is difficult to do by hand and which is prone to error. We therefore devised a computer-based algorithm, which makes all the required computations automatically. The user of this algorithm simply types in the age and sex of an examinee together with his or her shortened Raven SPM item scores, and the algorithm automatically computes the θ<sub><italic>s</italic>.1PL</sub> and θ<sub><italic>s</italic>.2PL</sub> scores and generates age- and sex-corrected normative conversions (i.e., IQ<sub><italic>s</italic>.1PL</sub> and IQ<sub><italic>s</italic>.2PL</sub>). This algorithm runs under Microsoft Excel and can be downloaded from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://home.deds.nl/~wimvde/">http://home.deds.nl/~wimvde/</ext-link>.</p>

<title>The Measurement Precision of the Shortened Raven SPM Test Under the 1PL and 2PL Models</title>
<p>The test information curves for the 1PL- and 2PL-based ability estimates are provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1073191111415999">Figure 4</xref>. As shown, the highest measurement precision (information &gt;10, corresponding with a level of reliability &gt;.90) was obtained with the 2PL-based shortened Raven SPM in the ability range between −2.1 and 0.20. The SEMs of the ability estimates are a function of the test information that is obtained at these particular ability levels, that is, SEM(θ<italic><sub>s</sub></italic>) = 1/√Information(θ<italic><sub>s</sub></italic>). For example, the SEMs for a θ<sub><italic>s</italic>.2PL</sub> and θ<sub><italic>s</italic>.1PL</sub> score equal to −1 were .24 and .35, respectively (corresponding with a level of reliability of .94 and .88, respectively).</p>

<p>In most cases, a clinician or researcher will be more interested in knowing the SEM for an IQ score rather than for an ability level (i.e., θ<sub><italic>s</italic>.2PL</sub> and θ<sub><italic>s</italic>.1PL</sub>). The SEMs for the IRT-based IQ scores are again a function of the ability levels. As noted, the measurement precision was the highest with the 2PL-based test in the ability range between −2.1 and 0.20. There is no one-to-one relation between an ability estimate and an IQ estimate (because IQ estimates also have to take the effects of age and sex into account), so it is not possible to determine an exact IQ interval in which the measurement precision with the 2PL-based test will always be higher than with the 1PL-based test. An approximate IQ interval was determined by computing the percentiles 5 and 95 of the distribution of the IQ scores in the normative sample for people who obtained an θ<sub><italic>s</italic>.2PL</sub> score between −2.1 and 0.20 (percentiles 5 and 95 were used rather than the minimum and maximum values to avoid a disproportionate influence of extreme scores on the established IQ interval). The θ<sub><italic>s</italic>.2PL</sub> interval between −2.1 and 0.20 corresponded with an IQ interval between about 75 and 110. Thus, the 2PL-based shortened Raven SPM will mostly—but not always—provide the most accurate IQ estimate when the person’s tested IQ is roughly between 75 and 110.</p>
<p>Our automatic scoring program (see above) provides the exact SEMs (and 95% confidence intervals) for the IQ<sub><italic>s</italic>.1PL</sub> and IQ<sub><italic>s</italic>.2PL</sub> scores, so the user of the scoring sheet can immediately compare the measurement precision that is obtained with the 1PL- and 2PL-based tests in his or her particular case.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results of the present study showed that the IQ point estimates of the 1PL- and 2PL-based tests were very similar (that is, <italic>r</italic>(IQ<sub><italic>s</italic>.1PL</sub>, IQ<sub><italic>s</italic>.2PL</sub>) = .97; percentage of pairwise agreement = .99), but there were substantial differences in their measurement precision (SEMs). Measurement precision is important in the context of interpreting test scores, for example, it allows clinicians and researchers to evaluate whether or not the IQ scores of two examinees are significantly different from each other. The highest measurement precision was obtained in the ability range between −2.1 and 0.20, with the 2PL-based shortened Raven SPM. This ability interval corresponded with an approximate IQ interval between 75 and 110. Outside this range, the measurement precision was quite low for both the 1PL- and 2PL-based tests. This finding is in agreement with the Raven SPM test manual, which states that the test has a limited discriminative power in the lower and upper regions of the intelligence distribution. In agreement with the manual, we recommend the use of the Colored Progressive matrices and the Advanced Progressive Matrices to accurately estimate the IQ of people with an a priori expected low and high level of intelligence, respectively.</p>
<p>In agreement with previous studies, our results indicated that older age and female sex were adversely associated with Raven SPM test performance (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1073191111415999">Table 3</xref>). The male advantage probably reflects the visuospatial nature of the test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1073191111415999">Abad, Colom, Rebollo, &amp; Escorial, 2004</xref>). The effects of age and sex on both IRT-based ability estimates were very similar (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1073191111415999">Table 3</xref>). The normative data were corrected for these demographical influences, and a computer-based algorithm was provided to increase the user-friendliness of the normative procedures.</p>
<p>Several remarks and recommendations for future studies can be given. First, not all items of the shortened Raven SPM had a good fit with the 1PL- and 2PL-IRT models. As noted in the Introduction, IRT models make highly specific assumptions about the relation between the observed item scores and the latent item and person parameters. It is important to thoroughly check these assumptions, because the desirable features of IRT models (e.g., their item- and person-invariant parameter estimates) are only obtained when the model adequately fits the data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1073191111415999">Embretson &amp; Reise, 2000</xref>). Eight and three nonfitting items were excluded from the 1PL- and 2PL-based shortened Raven SPM test versions, respectively. The exclusion of the nonfitting items from the models (and thus also from the IQ estimation procedures), however, does <italic>not</italic> imply that these items should also be excluded from the test <italic>administration</italic> procedure itself. Indeed, apart from considerations of test standardization and comparability with other studies, it is important to note that the Raven SPM is constructed in such way that an examinee learns the appropriate item solving strategies in a gradual way. That is, the Raven SPM item sets share a common theme of relations of which the complexity gradually increases. Examinees who are only administered the model-fitting items no longer have the same opportunity to gradually learn the appropriate item solving strategies when compared with examinees who are administered all items. The psychometric properties and normative data of a shortened Raven SPM test version in which all items were administered are thus no longer comparable with a test version in which only the model-fitting items were administered.</p>
<p>Second, we used EAP scoring to estimate the IRT-based ability levels, but other scoring procedures exist as well. For example, maximum likelihood (ML) and maximum a posteriori (MAP) scoring are often used. The different scoring methods have advantages and disadvantages. For example, ML scoring has the advantage that all examinees who have the same raw test score will also obtain the same ability level estimate under the 1PL model (note that this is <italic>not</italic> the case under the 2PL model). This property of ML scoring makes it straightforward to convert simple sum scores (i.e., the total number of correctly answered items) into θ<sub><italic>s</italic>.1PL</sub> scores (and vice versa) and establish “traditional” normative data tables (i.e., a computer program would no longer be needed to estimate the θ<sub>1.PL</sub> scores). However, a drawback of ML scoring is that no ability levels can be estimated for examinees who endorsed all items correctly (or all items incorrectly). MAP scoring is not hampered by this latter problem, but MAP scores may be biased when the number of items in the analysis is relatively small (e.g., ≤20 items). EAP scores may also be biased when the number of items is relatively small (i.e., the ability-level estimates may be regressed toward the mean; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1073191111415999">Wainer &amp; Thissen, 1987</xref>), but we nevertheless used this method because it yields finite ability-level estimates for all item response patterns (in contrast to ML scoring), and because it is a noniterative procedure (in contrast to ML and MAP scoring). The latter property is important from a practical viewpoint, because iterative procedures are much more difficult to implement in user-friendly test scoring algorithms that run on standard computer software (such as Microsoft Excel). Note also that it has been suggested that the use of IRT scores in regression analyses may lead to bias in the parameter and standard error estimates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1073191111415999">Hoijtink &amp; Boomsma, 1996</xref>), but simulation studies have suggested that the bias is acceptable when the number of test items is quite large (e.g., <italic>n</italic> ≥ 30; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1073191111415999">Lu, Thomas, &amp; Zumbo, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Third, research has shown that Raven SPM norms that are obtained in countries with a similar degree of literacy are comparable (for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1073191111415999">Raven, 2000</xref>). This finding suggests that our normative data are also applicable in other Western countries (outside the Netherlands), but more research is needed to back up this claim empirically.</p>
<p>Fourth, we did not evaluate differential item functioning (DIF) in the present study. In an IRT framework, DIF is said to occur when an item does not have the same relationship to a latent variable across two or more examinee groups (e.g., when a male and female who have an identical ability level have a different probability of endorsing an item). DIF was not evaluated in the present study because it requires the splitting of the data in two or more groups (e.g., males and females, or young, middle-aged, and older adults) and our sample size was too small for data splitting. It is, however, unlikely that substantial DIF occurred because the leading cause of DIF is multidimensionality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1073191111415999">Roussos &amp; Stout, 1996</xref>) and there was no evidence of multidimensionality in our analyses. Nevertheless, future studies should evaluate the occurrence of DIF in more detail.</p>
<p>Fifth, previous studies have shown that educational level is associated with IQ (for a recent review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1073191111415999">Strenze, 2007</xref>). In the present study, educational level was also significantly correlated with the Raven SPM IQ estimates (i.e., Kendall’s tau <italic>r</italic>(level of education, IQ<sub><italic>s</italic>.1PL</sub>) = .35 and <italic>r</italic>(level of education, IQ<sub><italic>s</italic>.2PL</sub>) = .35, all <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01; see also <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1073191111415999">Table 1</xref>). Nevertheless, we did <italic>not</italic> correct the shortened Raven SPM norms for educational level, because this would alter the regular interpretation of IQ. For example, the use of education-corrected normative conversions would result in the conclusion that the mean IQ scores of low, average, and highly educated people (of the same age and sex) are all the same (i.e., equal to 100). Or as another example, suppose that two individuals (of the same age and sex) with a different educational level (person 1: low, person 2: high) answered exactly the same items correctly on the Raven SPM. The use of education-corrected norms would result in the conclusion that the low educated person has a higher IQ than the highly educated person. From a psychometric viewpoint, there is nothing “wrong” with using education-corrected norms (in fact, the norms of many psychological tests are corrected for educational level, see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1073191111415999">Mitrushina, Boone, Razani, &amp; D’Elia, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1073191111415999">Van der Elst et al., 2005</xref>), but for the specific case of an intelligence test such a correction would not be appropriate because the “traditional” interpretation of the IQ concept would be altered.</p>
<p>Sixth, in the present study we only administered Sets B, C, and D of the Raven SPM (i.e., the shortened Raven SPM). The full Raven SPM includes two additional sets of items (Sets A and E). It would be interesting for future studies to administer all Raven SPM item sets, as this would allow for an evaluation of the association between the IQ point estimates that are based on the shortened and the on full Raven SPM test versions.</p>
<p>In conclusion, in the present study we evaluated the psychometric properties of a shortened version of the Raven SPM under two different IRT frameworks, that is, the 1PL and 2PL models. The IQ point estimates that were obtained under both frameworks were very similar, but the measurement precision was generally higher with the 2PL-based Raven SPM. IRT-based tests have several advantages when compared with CTT-based test (see the Introduction), but there are also some disadvantages. For example, not all psychologists are familiar with IRT models, IRT models are mathematically more involved than CTT models, and IRT-based tests require larger sample sizes to obtain reliable parameter estimates (when compared with CTT-based tests). Perhaps the most important problem with IRT-based tests is that their scoring procedure is cumbersome, which hampers their use in clinical practice and in applied settings. In the present study, we tried to circumvent this problem by providing an automatic scoring program in a software environment that is well known to most psychologists (Microsoft Excel) and which requires no computations whatsoever by the user.</p>
