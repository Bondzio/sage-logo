<p><italic>As the democratic transition stalls in Turkey, the press learns it is better not to cause trouble, and is losing credibility in the process</italic></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Whether in Turkey or elsewhere, you would be unlikely to find a press outlet that has been as badly scarred by harassment and persecution at the hands of the state as <italic>Özgür Gündem,</italic> or <italic>Free Agenda,</italic> an Istanbul-based newspaper with a strong leftist and pro-Kurdish slant. The paper was launched in April 1992, at the height of Turkey's war with the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK (the conflict, which began with a PKK insurgency in 1984, has since claimed more than 40,000 lives). Having committed itself to documenting the Kurdish struggle and abuses by Turkish security forces, <italic>Özgür Gündem</italic> suffered ruthless repression from day one. In the three months that followed its launch, says Bayram Balcı, one of the paper's editors, “we faced all sorts of assassinations, bombs, attacks, torture and kidnappings. Eight or nine of our colleagues were killed, and hundreds more were arrested”.</p>
<p>By the end of the 1990s, says Balcı, 76 of the paper's employees had been killed, some by hit squads linked to Turkish security forces. (The figure may be inflated: the Committee to Protect Journalists cites no more than 21 confirmed cases of journalists killed in Turkey since 1992.) The victims included “our correspondents, distributors, and even young paperboys,” says Balcı. The terror was intended to silence the paper, he adds, “but we refused to fold”. <italic>Özgür Gündem</italic> was banned several times. Each time, it picked up the pieces and reopened, albeit usually under a different name.</p>
<p>The Turkey of today is worlds removed from that of the 1990s. Buoyed by an economy that has grown at roughly 5 per cent a year over the past decade, the country has emerged as a confident regional power. The military, which had governed behind the scenes for several decades, and which had set the agenda for Turkey's policies towards the 12–15 million strong Kurdish minority, has been driven back into the barracks. The Kurds, though still unimpressed with the half-baked reforms designed to appease them, enjoy unprecedented cultural and language rights. With the government having recently launched talks with the PKK, a solution to the war in the predominantly Kurdish southeast – now in its third decade – finally appears to be within reach. The extrajudicial killings, the sort that claimed so many lives at <italic>Özgür Gündem</italic>, have come to an end.</p>
<p>Yet Bayram Balcı still has plenty of reason to worry about the fate of his paper and its reporters. In what Turkish prosecutors refer to as a crackdown against the PKK's urban wing, arrests have netted thousands of Kurdish activists, politicians and journalists since 2009. Of the journalists, five are from <italic>Özgür Gündem</italic>. “They're trying to silence us and the rest of the Kurdish press,” says Balcı. “In the 1990s they would kill us; now they are throwing us in jail.”</p>

<title>Who did these people attack?</title>
<p>At the beginning of May [2013], 67 media personnel remained behind bars in Turkey, according to Johann Bihr of Reporters Without Borders (RWB), making the country the world's top jailer of journalists, ahead of the likes of China and Iran, and earning it a lowly 154th place (out of 179 countries) on the RWB's Press Freedom Index. The government insists that virtually all of the journalists in question have been imprisoned for crimes that have nothing to do with their reporting. Most are heavily wedded to the Kurdish cause and have been charged with membership in, or aiding and abetting, a terrorist group. (The PKK has been designated as such by Turkey, as well as the US and the EU.) Balcı believes this is a gross distortion. “The government calls them terrorists. But who did these people attack, where did they plant bombs, and who did they kill?” he asks. His colleagues' only crime, he argues, was to report on the Kurdish issue in a way that didn't please the people in power. Some of the journalists might sympathise with the PKK, he says, but that doesn't make them accessories to terror.</p>
<p>Human rights groups tend to agree. Of the 67 journalists in jail, most (meaning “at least 35”), were being held in connection with their media activities, Bihr wrote in an email. Emma Sinclair-Webb, a senior Turkey researcher at Human Rights Watch, has followed the on-going trials of Kurdish journalists suspected of PKK links. “Much of the evidence in these cases is evidence which directly relates to their professional duties,” she says. “You can't say that they're not being tried for their journalistic activities.”</p>
<p>The problem with Turkey's laws, says Sinclair-Webb, “is that all sorts of people get prosecuted and convicted for their political opinions as terrorists when they committed no act that could or should be described as terrorism in any conceivable sense”. The wording of the laws is vague and the threshold of evidence unacceptably low. Sometimes, all it takes to be charged with aiding or abetting a terrorist group, she says, is to be seen as identifying with its political ideas or statements. That isn't nearly enough. “You may share some of the ideological outlook and political arguments with an armed group, but that doesn't mean you're one and the same with them and it doesn't mean you've committed or incited any act of terrorism.”</p>
<p>I asked Sinclair-Webb whether any of the Kurdish journalists currently standing trial would have been prosecuted under terrorism laws in the West, the UK included. “Some of these journalists may have been investigated and possibly tried in other countries,” she said, “but it's very difficult to conceive that any of them could possibly be held in prolonged pre-trial detention.” There is “no suggestion that they have incited acts of terrorism or been involved in violent activities”. Much of the evidence used in the trials, including news clippings or transcripts of meetings, should have been ruled inadmissible from the very beginning, she added.</p>
<p>With the adoption in April 2013 of a package of judicial reforms aimed at improving Turkey's woeful record at the European Court of Human Rights – the country ranks second only to Russia in terms of number of ongoing cases before the Court – there is some cause for optimism. The new amendments have redefined the notion of terrorist propaganda, partially lifting restrictions on publishing statements by illegal groups, and criminalising only those that legitimise, incite or praise violence. “That's a welcome move,” says Sinclair-Webb, “but it's still very much at the discretion of the courts to decide whether you, by shouting such and such slogans or carrying such and such banner, have made terrorist propaganda or not.” When it comes to the jailed Kurdish journalists, the impact of the new laws may be quite limited, she warns. Most have been charged with membership of an armed organisation, not propaganda crimes.</p>
<p>As the peace talks between the government and the PKK kick into full swing – as part of a ceasefire deal, the rebels began withdrawing from Turkey to their bases in northern Iraq at the beginning of May – there is also some hope that Kurdish journalists may be set free as part of a political bargain. Bayram Balcı appears to place more faith in such a scenario than in the law itself. Under legislation already on the books, he says, “all of our colleagues should have been released a long time ago”. But with the ruling party in need of public support for the peace process, the government may find it expedient to let the Kurdish journalists go. “They need us,” he says. “They know that the Kurds won't believe what the mainstream newspapers write, but that they'll believe it if it's printed in <italic>Özgür Gündem</italic>.”</p>
<p>Kurdish journalists form the largest contingent of jailed media workers, but they aren't the only detainees. Others, including a parliamentary deputy, are on trial on bloated charges of fomenting a coup against the government of the Islamist-rooted Justice and Development Party (AKP). Others seem to have ended up in the dock for reporting on the growing power of an Islamic community that – thanks to a marriage of convenience with the AKP – has acquired considerable influence within the Turkish judiciary and the police.</p>

<title>Self-censorship has taken root</title>
<p>As far as the woeful state of the Turkish press is concerned, however, the headline-grabbing arrests and trials are “just the tip of the iceberg,” as one Turkish columnist recently put it. With the AKP consolidating its power across the whole political and economic spectrum, an equally troubling and even more prevalent trend – censorship and self-censorship – has taken root.</p>
<p>Over the past year, Turkish newspapers have dumped some of their biggest hitters, notably for their falling foul of the government. In early 2012, <italic>Habertürk</italic> daily parted with Ece Temelkuran, a feature reporter and columnist who had slammed the authorities for the death of 34 Kurdish smugglers on the Iraqi border. (The villagers perished in a hail of bombs after Turkish fighter pilots mistook them for a column of PKK militants). Nuray Mert, an equally outspoken columnist at <italic>Milliyet</italic>, was fired shortly thereafter. This spring, <italic>Milliyet</italic> parted ways with yet another veteran writer, Hasan Cemal, who had defended the paper's decision to publish the minutes of a meeting between a group of Kurdish politicians and Abdullah Öcalan, the PKK's jailed leader. In April, Amberin Zaman, another writer openly critical of the government's handling of the Kurdish file, was sacked by <italic>Habertürk –</italic> just as she began penning a piece on Turkey's press-freedom crisis for <italic>The Economist</italic>, her other employer. Other reporters have been “let go” for far less. Many in the profession admit there are some issues they simply won't touch – the Kurds, the government's backing of Syrian rebels, and the cosy relationship between the AKP and a number of large companies – for fear of losing their jobs.</p>
<p>The underlying problem seems not only to be government pressure – several journalists report that their dismissal was preceded by a phone call from one of the Prime Minister's advisers – but the structure of the media sector in Turkey. Precious few press outlets in Turkey can claim to be fully independent. The vast majority belong to companies with considerable interests in sectors such as energy, education or construction. For their editors and proprietors, the logic is straightforward. When your building firm brings in the lion's share of your profits – and particularly when you are competing for public tenders worth billions of dollars – it's worth thinking twice about criticising state policy or exposing corruption scandals. It is a lesson that hasn't been lost on the Dogan Group, the country's biggest media conglomerate.</p>
<p>In autumn 2008, some of the group's papers ran a series of stories on alleged links between the AKP government and a German-based Turkish charity accused of embezzling nearly $25 million worth of donations. In response, Turkey's quick-tempered Prime Minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, called for a boycott of Dogan. Almost exactly a year later, the government slapped the media group with a crippling and disproportionate fine of $2.5 billion for unpaid taxes. Few observers failed to connect the dots.</p>
<p>For proof of the malaise of Turkish journalism, look no further than the newspapers themselves. Stories that should feature on a paper's front page are often pushed to the back, or tucked away in opinion columns. Those that threaten to annoy the government are sometimes reported first in the foreign press, and only then reprinted in Turkish. Bona fide investigative reporting is most noticeable by its absence. The Turkish press appears on the verge of losing its most precious resource – its credibility.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, there has been mounting concern that Turkey's democratic transition – which took off in early 2000 after the country became a candidate for EU accession – has stalled. With membership of the EU now increasingly undesirable and remote, and with the AKP complacent and reform-weary after more than a decade in power, it may be up to Turkish civil society to pick up the slack. Without a free, independent press by its side, it will find the going impossibly tough.</p>
