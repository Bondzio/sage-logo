<p>The last time I saw Derek Jameson was at an <italic>Oldie</italic> editorial lunch when he kept Richard Ingrams and his staff chortling with a non-stop fusillade of reminiscences and anecdotes. In one of these he described how, when he was managing editor of the <italic>Daily Mirror</italic>, editor Mike Molloy and I – then an assistant editor of something or other – had thwarted an especially brilliant Jameson idea. I had no recollection of the occasion but did my best to look suitably shamefaced when disapproving stares from almost all present – not Derek, who was already off on another flight of fancy – were launched in my direction. I didn't mind. Jameson in full flow wasn't one to let facts get in the way of a good yarn.</p>
<p>Such was his own good – indeed, remarkable – story that it didn't require embellishment, which is not to say that he didn't polish it here and there over the years. Illegitimate and dirt poor, he left school at 14 and progressed from running messages during the London Blitz for the Reuters news agency to becoming a reporter at 16, and then swashbuckling his way to three national newspaper editorships and a broadcasting career that established him as a fully-fledged celebrity. You, and probably even Derek, couldn't make that up.</p>
<p>I first encountered him when I was at the <italic>Daily</italic> and he the picture editor of the <italic>Sunday Mirror</italic>. Even back then his self-confidence was bordering on a perpetual ego trip and he had already begun often to refer to himself in the third person. Great company, with a rumbustious laugh like a foghorn, he was impossible to dislike and we became friends. He reminded me of the Pickwick Club interloper Mr Jingle, described in a foreword to one edition of Dickens's novel as “a strolling actor and charlatan, noted for telling bizarre anecdotes in a distinctive, extravagant, disjoined style,” although in Derek's case “charlatan” was certainly not applicable.</p>
<p>That ego may have determined that when it came to writing his memoirs he struck a two-book deal with Ebury and, overall, I wish he hadn't. <italic>Touched By Angels –</italic> Ma Wren, the harbourer of waifs and strays who took him in as a child, told him divine assistance would always be his – is an intriguing book and his recounting of an almost Dickensian upbringing (he was more Artful Dodger than Jingle in his youth) both evocative and moving. The volume ends before his editorships and, despite an opening chapter that winningly reveals his life-long love affair with newspapers and Fleet Street, <italic>Last of the Hot Metal Men</italic> is a disappointment, frequently wandering from its narrative to offer what read like space-fillers – Jameson's flattering views on the national newspaper editors at the time of publication, for example – and embarking on over-long descriptive passages of third wife Ellen's often grisly battle with alcoholism.</p>
<p>What does emerge from the books, however, is a portrait of a warm and sensitive man who, because of his accent and background, was subjected to intellectual snobbery for much of his life. The first volume begins with a blow-by-blow account of his unsuccessful libel action against the BBC after a Radio 4 programme had lampooned him as an “East End boy made bad” who thought erudite was a glue. He emerged from the case with dignity intact but bank balance decimated. The fact that he loved and knew a great deal about opera and could quote the Russian poet Vladimir Mayakovsky (as he does in <italic>Touched By Angels</italic>) did not equip him to take on sharp-tongued and equally sharp-clawed lawyers.</p>
<p>Long before he became editor of the <italic>Daily Express</italic>, launch editor-in-chief of the <italic>Daily Star –</italic> he resigned when proprietor Lord Matthews, another rough diamond, refused to give him back the <italic>Express –</italic> and, uncomfortably, editorial boss of the <italic>News of the World</italic>, Jameson was making waves over the air. He appeared on a chat show with “James Savile, OBE,” who told him he was wasted in newspapers: “You should be in my business.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps that's where the idea came from,” muses Jameson, and one can only now reflect that Savile's business, with its sordid ancillaries, was one from which to run screaming.</p>
<p>Leslie Bricusse's lyric to Jingle's song in the musical <italic>Pickwick</italic> described him as “a bit of a character,” whereas Jameson writes in <italic>Last of the Hot Metal Men</italic>, “Me. I'm just an ordinary bloke. Nothing special. As I always say, the ugliest man on television and the world's worst DJ … That does not matter. The important thing is that I am being myself.”</p>
<p>Ordinary? Perhaps not. Few ordinary blokes arrive at their funeral in a black-lacquered, restored Victorian hearse drawn by two black, decoratively-harnessed horses – Jingle with bells on. It was the beginning of a flamboyant departure of a Marmite personality – there were critics outside the loyal fan-base who loathed his daily Radio 2 greeting, “Mornin', mornin', Jameson here” – that continued at a St Bride's memorial service where his personality still loomed large.</p>
<p>His wish was that his ashes should be scattered in Fleet Street, but by-laws and health and safety being what they are, it was announced that they would instead find a home in the churchyard, as indeed most were. But the Jameson family are as determined as he had been.</p>
<p>The last time I saw Derek Jameson – well, a small part of him – was when two relatives, clenched fists deep in pockets, walked briskly from St Bride's and strode, with arms now swinging, into the slow-moving traffic of the Street.</p>
<p>“… taking myself off on the No 6 bus from Hackney Wick to Ludgate Circus proved the single most important act of my entire life,” he had written. “Fleet Street made me.” Sometimes life really can come full circle.</p>
