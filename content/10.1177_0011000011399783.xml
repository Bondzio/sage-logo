<body>
<p>This article represents an exploration of the relationships between therapists and clients with a critical eye toward expanding our commonly understood notion of professional boundaries. The boundaries between therapist and client are seen as providing the safe foundation for the therapeutic relationship. Within the professional literature, cautionary tales abound exhorting therapists to avoid crossing therapeutic boundaries. Boundary crossings are thought to be risky because of the potential for the exploitation of clients. Thus, from a risk management perspective, boundary crossings are to be avoided to prevent a descent down the “slippery slope” to eventual sexual misconduct with clients. Often missing in this commonplace understanding of boundaries is a consideration of culture and context within the therapeutic relationship.</p>
<p>My (and it’s not just mine) contention (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0011000011399783">Barnett, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0011000011399783">Vasquez, 2007</xref>) is that culturally competent practice necessitates a different, broader understanding of therapeutic boundaries than the somewhat narrow and limited view currently and commonly espoused. Boundaries are complex, involving much more than managing risk. In fact, the placement, management, flexibility, and negotiation of therapeutic boundaries constitute a cultural enterprise. The cultural context provides the structure from which to consider the therapeutic relationship and its boundaries. In this article I take a decidedly conversational tone and personal approach to examine the boundaries supporting the therapy relationship. I introduce the notion of solidarity as a culturally congruent means to understand boundaries, their placement, and management. For me solidarity centers the connection between individuals, thereby providing an underlying basis for culturally congruent therapy boundaries.</p>
<p>My frame of reference as an African American, heterosexual, middle-class woman both informs and limits my perspective on these issues. I draw directly from my most recent clinical experiences in a community setting with African American children, teenagers, adults, and families. Consequently, to effectively examine the complexity of boundaries when joined by the idea of solidarity, I must expose my own subjectivity personally, culturally, and professionally. Thus, this article begins with a brief discussion of my personal background, moves to a discussion of boundaries, explores the construct of solidarity, and concludes with a synthesis of the two.</p>
<p>I grew up in a family that emphasized being active within the community, our small town in western Pennsylvania. My parents did not call this “social justice work”; rather it was called “doing the right thing,” “helping people who need help,” or “doing what needs to be done.” My parents led by example. My brother and I saw them taking food to a family, lending money, accompanying someone to a doctor’s appointment, checking on a church member who was ill, going to community meetings, and providing rides to the bank or to the store. My parents were and are spiritual, collectivistic, practical, caring, and above all pragmatic. They taught my brother and me about race, racism, sexism, and African American history. I learned that I had a responsibility, an obligation to others in my community. These lessons influenced me tremendously. Hence, helping others was deeply embedded in my psyche and propelled me into the field of psychology.</p>
<p>When I began my academic career I was greatly influenced by the department chair at Loyola University Chicago, the late Dr. Carol Harding, a developmental psychologist, whose scholarship was in the arena of mother and baby attachment. Dr. Harding was responsible for a multifaceted, large intervention and research program within a high-rise apartment building in a Chicago neighborhood known as the entry point for new immigrants. Her program involved qualitative and quantitative research, after-school programs, and psychoeducational groups with teens, groups with parents, and parent–child interaction groups involving graduate students. Dissertations, master’s theses, conference presentations, and publications were the products stemming from this project. As a new faculty member, I had never seen or heard of anything like this. Dr. Harding was a psychologist whose work was truly based in the community and actually benefiting that diverse community. She used her degree, her expertise to actually help people in a practical way. I was impressed, inspired, and provoked by her example.</p>
<p>I was challenged to ask myself, “What kind of psychologist do I want to be?” Even now, this question keeps me honest in striving to line up my actions with my own values. Thus, during my first year as a faculty member I found a family support center, Family Focus Evanston, in my own community whose mission I supported. I joined the local board and then volunteered at the center weekly. After I was licensed, I started a small private practice at the center where I consulted with parents, conducted short-term and long-term individual counseling, provided group counseling with teen girls, led staff development workshops, dealt with crises, and sometimes answered the agency telephone. For more than 10 years, I did whatever needed to be done just like my parents taught me. My ongoing involvement with this family support center influenced me to re-vision myself and my professional work as a counseling psychologist. As an African American psychologist working in a community center with African American clients within my own community, I repeatedly questioned my boundaries, my roles, and my relationships with my clients and my place within the community.</p>
<p>Therefore, this article examines therapeutic boundaries and the relationship between therapists and clients through the lens of solidarity. I rely on case examples, personal experience, and literature from a variety of disciplines (e.g., philosophy, sociology) to explore the complexity of therapeutic boundaries and the therapy relationship through the lens of solidarity.</p>
<sec id="section1-0011000011399783">
<title>Boundaries</title>
<p>Boundaries are fundamental to the counseling or therapy process. Boundaries are set and maintained by the clinician according to accepted professional standards and are intended to provide a “therapeutic frame which defines a set of roles for the participants in the therapeutic process” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0011000011399783">Smith &amp; Fitzpatrick, 1995</xref>, p. 499). Boundaries are thought to promote effective treatment because they protect client welfare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0011000011399783">Borys, 1994</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0011000011399783">Simon (1992)</xref> one of the basic principles underlying boundaries is the rule of abstinence, where the therapist refrains from obtaining personal gratification from the client. There is also a duty to neutrality, which means knowing one’s place and allowing the client’s agenda to take center stage. The clinician’s relative anonymity does aid this neutrality. The clinician is expected to maintain an objective, professional distance while developing an effective working relationship with the clients.</p>
<p>The field has differentiated among types of boundary concerns. There are boundary crossings that are deviations from traditional and commonly accepted practice that may or may not be beneficial for the client. Boundary violations, on the other hand, are those departures from accepted practice that are harmful and exploitative of the client (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0011000011399783">Smith &amp; Fitzpatrick, 1995</xref>). This distinction is important, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0011000011399783">Gottlieb and Younggren (2009)</xref> pointed out, because it emphasizes that “boundary crossings were not necessarily sexual or improper” (p. 566). Moreover, the implication is that clinicians can and should make judgments about the utility of a given boundary crossing rather than automatically in a “knee-jerk fashion” assuming that any boundary crossing is countertherapeutic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0011000011399783">Zur &amp; Lazarus, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>This viewpoint runs counter to the idea of the “slippery slope,” the widely held notion that seemingly minor boundary crossings eventually progress into major violations that harm and exploit clients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0011000011399783">Gutheil &amp; Gabbard, 1993</xref>). Thus, from a purely risk management perspective, the prudent therapist would be wise to avoid any boundary alteration or crossing since it could be the first step on the “slippery slope” leading to sexual misconduct with a client. For this reason, any altering of therapy boundaries is negative and potentially dangerous for clients. Therapists who cross, alter, or violate boundaries are seen as attempting to obtain gratification of their own personal needs. Perhaps the therapist is trying to make the client feel special or trying to rescue the client. Whatever the motivation, clinicians have been strongly cautioned to avoid boundary crossings. As mental health professionals we are responsible for establishing and strictly maintaining the boundaries of our therapeutic relationships. This conservative view has greatly influenced how the field conceptualizes and discusses boundaries.</p>
<p>Rural or small community psychologists are widely acknowledged to experience boundary crossings and to have overlapping, dual relationships with their clients because of their heightened visibility and lack of anonymity. These overlapping, dual relationships are seen as predictable dilemmas that rural psychologists will inevitably experience. Rural psychologists are encouraged to preserve clear expectations and boundaries and talk through the out-of-session contact with their clients, to gain informed consent, and to continually monitor themselves through consultation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0011000011399783">Schank &amp; Skovholt, 1997</xref>). Similarly, gay and lesbian therapists working within lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgendered communities are also cautioned to expect overlapping relationships with clients and to develop strategies to negotiate these (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0011000011399783">Graham &amp; Liddle, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0011000011399783">Kessler &amp; Waehler, 2005</xref>). These “complicated” relationships with former or current clients may arise from the close-knit nature of some gay and lesbian communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0011000011399783">Graham &amp; Liddle, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0011000011399783">Kessler &amp; Waehler, 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0011000011399783">Morrow (2000)</xref> suggested that the shared experience of being a member of a stigmatized group could lead some gay and lesbian therapists to not establish appropriate boundaries because of overidentification and feelings of familiarity with clients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0011000011399783">Morrow, 2000</xref>). Gay and lesbian therapists are encouraged to be vigilant and not relax their boundary standards when working with members of their own community and to develop clear decision-making and coping strategies to prevent problems with overlapping roles. Although anticipated and understandable, multiple relationships are potentially problematic.</p>
<p>It is interesting that the literature on working in small communities focuses primarily on the management of dual or multiple relationships, that is, when the clinician already has a professional role with a client and might enter into another role with the same person. For instance, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0011000011399783">Graham and Liddle’s (2009)</xref> research, gay and lesbian psychotherapists described incidental social contact, preexisting connections, work or service overlaps, and third-party linkages as potentially problematic dual issues arising from practicing within a small community. There is not much discussion or research on where these boundaries are actually located in the first place when working within small communities.</p>
<p>Thus, we are left with a picture where clear boundaries are critical to effective therapy and the altering of boundaries is to be avoided because of the real danger of client exploitation. If you are practicing in a rural area, overlapping, dual relationships and boundary crossings are unavoidable and regrettable, but not the “fault” of the psychologist. If you are a gay or lesbian therapist practicing within your community, you must exercise good decision making, prevention, and coping strategies to avoid (preferably) and manage (minimally) dual relationships and boundary crossings. Taken together, the current view is that dual relationships, overlapping boundaries, and/or boundary crossings are at a minimum problematic. Rarely are boundary crossings discussed as beneficial, therapeutic, or positive events within therapeutic relationships.</p>
<p>In addition, there is little conversation in the professional literature about the actual type or location of the boundaries clinicians should foster. What is the amount of distance versus closeness the clinician should maintain? How close is too close, and how far is too far? The current discourse about boundaries frequently tends to universalize the concept, as if all mental health professionals have the same connotation or agreement about what “good” or “right” boundaries look like. It is unlikely that clinicians agree on what constitutes good boundaries. It might be more accurate to say that we just do not talk much about our various views about boundaries. My guess is that we are reluctant to talk about our various interpretations of boundaries because we would not want anyone to think that we are being unethical or inappropriate with our clients.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0011000011399783">Lazarus (1994)</xref> vehemently disagreed with the universal notion of boundaries and argued that a blind adherence to artificial boundaries, motivated by risk-management concerns, can be inhumane. Lazarus recounted that while providing couples therapy, a husband talked about having a biopsy of a possible cancer and that the results would be known in the next few days. With the next session scheduled for 2 weeks away, Lazarus telephoned the clients after a couple of days to inquire about the lab results. The man was grateful for the concern; the woman (herself a clinical psychologist) was dismayed, characterizing Lazarus’s phone call a boundary violation. Lazarus bemoaned that his “simple act of human decency and concern had been transformed into a clinical assault” (p. 256). Lazarus reached out in a compassionate manner to inquire after a fellow human being about whom he genuinely cared. Ordinarily the traditional notions of boundaries are characterized by the therapist’s professional distance, authority, nonreciprocity, and relative anonymity. Lazarus did not maintain the expected distance or anonymity with his clients in this situation. Lazarus asserts that an overly fear-based, risk-management approach to defensive practice actually interferes with basic human caring for our clients. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0011000011399783">Lazarus (2007)</xref> warned that “genuinely caring and skillful clinicians, anxious to steer clear of any action that could be construed as an ethics infringement, may provide a sterile and artificial relationship that lacks much of what helps it to be a clinically effective one” (p. 406).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0011000011399783">McGuire (1996)</xref> claims that “context—not content—often determines the appropriate boundary” (p. 7). Consequently, the type of intervention, the stage of the therapy relationship, the clinician’s theoretical orientation, the cultural background of the participants, the type of agency, the relative mental health of the client all might influence the placement of the boundary. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0011000011399783">Kertész’s (2002)</xref> firsthand descriptions of therapy relationships in Latin America are particularly instructive. Kertész indicates that Latin cultures emphasize strong, warm, and close community and familial bonds, which result in overlapping, multiple relationships between clients and therapists. The mixing of roles, therapist self-disclosure, socializing at important events together are all seen as normal and expected. Rigid, formal, distant boundaries by the therapist might convey a lack of caring or concern. Kertész concludes that flexibility in therapeutic relationships fosters and increases authenticity and that the avoidance of multiple or overlapping relationships by a clinician would be likely viewed as being rude or aloof. He questions whether limiting ourselves to a “single, antiseptic modus operandi” of appropriate therapy boundaries is in fact providing the best service to clients (p. 334), suggesting that a flexible, individualized and culturally informed approach to boundary management would be most beneficial.</p>
<p>In fact, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0011000011399783">Glass (2003)</xref> suggested a more precise definition of boundary crossings reflecting a very different clinical perspective: “Boundary crossings are the therapist’s attempts to adapt an existing therapeutic alliance to foster the patient’s capacity to work in therapy” (p. 435). Boundary crossings according to Glass are “benign, discussable, nonprogressive departures . . . that are creative and conscientious attempts to adapt the treatment to the individual patient” (pp. 433-434). Thus, stretching, adapting, and flexing the therapy boundaries is a process of individualizing the treatment to best meet the needs of the client. “Failing to cross certain boundaries due to rigid rule adherence, when doing so is culturally consistent for certain patients, risks harm and is unnecessary” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0011000011399783">Gottlieb &amp; Younggren, 2009</xref>, p. 569).</p>
<p>Clinicians in all likelihood locate their boundaries depending on which aspects of the counseling relationship they value or prioritize. Based on my theoretical standpoint, I tend to emphasize the real relationship between myself and my clients. The real relationship has been defined as “personal relationship existing between two or more people as reflected in the degree to which each is genuine with the other and perceives the other in ways that befit the other” (Gelso, 2004, p. 6, as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0011000011399783">Gelso et al., 2005</xref>). Genuineness and realistic perceptions are key features of real relationships. Genuineness is the “ability and willingness to be what one truly is in the relationship—to be authentic, open, and honest.” Realistic perceptions are “those perceptions that are uncontaminated by transference distortions and other defenses . . . the therapy participants see each other in an accurate, realistic way” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0011000011399783">Gelso et al., 2005</xref>, p. 641). Close boundaries between therapists and clients may allow for both participants to be themselves and to interact with one another as “real” people even within the formality of the professional relationship.</p>
<p>“Being real” conjures notions of congruence, integrity, being honest with yourself, being true to what you think is right and wrong, not pretending to be something you are not, being plain, being forthright, and showing your true feelings. Being real can be freeing because there are no extra layers, and no extra energy is needed since you are being your true self and not changing the core of yourself. Recent research with African Americans highlights the potential importance of “being real” to the counseling process and outcome. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0011000011399783">Earlise Ward’s (2005)</xref> groundbreaking qualitative investigation about the experiences of African American community mental health center clients provides some compelling illustrations of what clients want in counseling. The clients were concerned with counselors’ responsiveness, particularly questioning, “[D]id the counselor respond to the client as a ‘person’?” (p. 477). One 44-year-old female client stated,</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>I’m meaning to see who I’m talking to [counselor], that’s what I’m looking for. I am looking to feel you and I know that I can feel things through pictures, through things and just being around the person’s office and everything. So I’m looking to see who you are. That’s what I’m looking for. I’m looking to see you cause I don’t wanna share myself with someone that I can’t see. . . . So I’m looking to see you, to feel you. I am assessing to see if that person [counselor] is willing to go that extra mile and speak my language and talk about my Blackness and I’m looking at that person and I’m watching and assessing. (p. 476)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>This woman wants a mental health professional who is real to her and reciprocally also sees her as a real person.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0011000011399783">Thompson, Bazile, and Akbar’s (2004)</xref> investigation of 201 African Americans’ perceptions of therapy and therapists through focus groups found, among many interesting things, that the participants believed psychologists to be “older White males, who were unsympathetic, uncaring, and unavailable” (p. 23). Psychologists were commonly thought of as “impersonal,” “elitist,” and “too far removed from the community to be of assistance to most African Americans” (p. 23). About half of the participants believed that “psychologists, unlike social workers and counselors, failed to participate in community education, prevention and outreach” and were, therefore, reluctant “to trust professionals not active in the African American community” (p. 23). One participant explained, “It doesn’t seem like they’re truly concerned about you, what you could possibly be going through. You know it’s just like ‘I’m about to get paid . . . your hour is up’” (p. 23). Another participant expressed concern about the psychologist’s ability to understand them: “You know if you made an appointment to see a therapist, more likely than not you are going to be sitting down talking to someone who can’t relate to you” (p. 23). The participants really doubted psychologists’ ability to be sensitive to their needs and the realities of their lives.</p>
<p>The distance and anonymity maintained through a traditional notion of boundaries was apparently viewed negatively by these African Americans. Traditional professional distance might be viewed as a lack of sincere care or concern. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0011000011399783">Thompson et al. (2004)</xref> concluded that there is a “need to examine the relationship boundaries maintained by the profession, which may be misunderstood and perceived as a lack of caring” (p. 25). The African Americans in this study wanted a therapeutic relationship that was consistent with their cultural expectations for close relationships. The participants wanted a sense of warmth, reciprocity, and understanding where they would be truly known and treated as a “real” person, not as just some interchangeable client working with an anonymous distant psychologist.</p>
<p>The real relationship with my clients, the bond we shared together, facilitated our agreement on the tasks and our ability to achieve the goals of the therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0011000011399783">Bordin, 1979</xref>). When I think of myself as a clinician, I was neither distant nor anonymous, nor did I desire to be. In fact, clients sought me out precisely because they knew me or knew of me. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0011000011399783">Zur (2007)</xref> asserts that clients in close-knit communities “choose their therapist because they are familiar, because they respect and appreciate their background, values, and conduct” (p. 25). I valued being able to be more of myself with my clients. The boundaries I established with my clients were qualitatively different from the boundaries I was taught to maintain in graduate school. The boundaries cocreated by myself and my clients felt closer and warmer than I was taught.</p>
<p>I have done things for clients, on behalf of clients, and with clients because of our close boundaries, actions that from a traditional mainstream viewpoint I “should” not have done. However, “many of these actions arise seamlessly (and unremarkably) out of the culturally expected human dimension of therapy” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0011000011399783">Glass, 2003</xref>, p. 434). I was flexible with my boundaries, in a way that felt entirely consistent culturally but was inconsistent with my prior training and education. No longer was I a distant, detached professional, but I was an engaged and involved counseling psychologist, and this was just “the type of psychologist” I wanted to be. For instance, I have, along with the director of the community center, used my SUV to help a teenage client move to a safe, nonabusive house with the permission of her mother. I did this because I felt it was the right thing to do and I owed a duty to help my client. I felt close to this client, and she needed my help outside of the therapy hour. My instrumental help was entirely consistent with my personal values, cultural expectations, and the therapy relationship. It most certainly was a deviation from traditional therapy, but my aid was indeed therapeutic. Neither am I aware of a need for personal gratification that I was fulfilling via the client nor were my actions a precursor to exploiting the client.</p>
<p>Moreover, I have talked with colleagues anecdotally about their own close professional boundaries with clients. For instance, an African American colleague, when she was a trainee, visited an African American adult client who had been hospitalized because of a sudden medical illness after her supervisor told her that visiting the client would be wrong and inappropriate. The client and the client’s family were so pleased that she paid this brief visit to the hospital. She visited the client anyhow (without telling her supervisor) because she thought it was the right thing to do and claims that she would do it again. She believes that this visit strengthened the therapeutic relationship. Her action, however, begs the question, “What if the visit had gone poorly?” This example certainly illustrates the serious dilemma encountered by trainees whose supervisors disagree with the location of the trainees’ therapy boundaries. Trainees cannot violate the dictums of the supervisors under whose license they practice; the legal and ethical stakes are much too high. On the other hand, how does a trainee “expand the therapeutic context and process by addressing the needs of their diverse clients in way that may challenge the therapeutic status quo” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0011000011399783">Gallardo, 2009</xref>, p. 429)? This is an especially troubling predicament that crystallizes the difficulty in shifting from traditional notions to more culturally responsive modalities. My colleague had a therapeutic rationale for visiting the client based on a culturally congruent and expansive view of her role as therapist with which her supervisor disagreed. How does the field reconcile these divergent perspectives? For Gallardo, cultural competence and its concomitant culturally responsive practice are our ethical obligations and “should be our standard and norm and not the exception” (p. 429). Culturally responsive therapy will necessitate a reexamination of the taken-for-granted, traditional ideas of boundaries, boundary crossings, and the therapist’s role.</p>
<p>In my work at the community center, I came to discover that close, warm boundaries were, in fact, typical within my cultural context. Walking outside with clients, attending special events, seeing clients at church or at community events, sharing food during sessions, giving birthday presents, introducing my family members to clients, receiving gifts, offering rides home, and hugging all became common occurrences within my community-based practice. From a traditional standpoint, these were boundary crossings, actions outside of the standard parameters. Conversely, from a culturally responsive and culturally congruent standpoint all of these actions were well within the normal parameters of my therapeutic relationships. Essentially, these actions became my “new normal.” The close boundaries forged between myself and my clients arose from my sense of connection and obligation as a member of my community, what I now recognize as solidarity. I surmise that this solidarity provides a compelling motivation and foundation for so-called boundary crossings within a culturally responsive practice.</p>

<sec id="section2-0011000011399783">
<title>Solidarity</title>
<p>Generally, solidarity is “a feeling of connection whereby other human beings are seen as ‘one of us’” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0011000011399783">Cooke, 1995</xref>, p. 337). Solidarity refers to the ties within a society that bind people to one another. Solidarity is often thought of as related to workers’ resistance to their exploitation through unfair labor practices. Workers have effectively engaged in collective action ultimately toward a more just society, most notably the Polish Solidarity Trade Union Federation led by Lech Walesa in the 1980s. Solidarity also has a larger religious, ethical, moral, and philosophical grounding. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0011000011399783">Pope John Paul II (1987)</xref> talked about the basic solidarity among humans that comes from the recognition that “we are one human family.” In this sense, solidarity involves an affirmation of the fundamental truth about humanity, the radical equality of all men and women.</p>
<p>Within philosophical, sociological, and political frameworks, “‘solidarity’ is a term that is widely used, but notoriously hard to define” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0011000011399783">Derpmann, 2009</xref>, p. 304). Solidarity implies that “members of a group <italic>are</italic> or at least <italic>feel</italic> obliged to promote the well-being of other members, even incurring significant sacrifices for themselves. Further, they might be sanctioned, if they forgo obligations of solidarity” (p. 305, italics original). These obligations fall on only members of the particular community. Accordingly, solidarity does not exist without community. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0011000011399783">Blum (2007)</xref> summarized, there are three important bases for solidarity: (a) identity group, (b) shared experience, and (c) political commitment. As related to the therapy relationship, identity group and shared experience appear particularly germane. Any social identity can form the basis of a solidarity group, although a sense of solidarity is not automatic for members of any identity group, as psychologists know from the theory and research on identity development. The shared experience of being racially discriminated or racially profiled can propel a sense of solidarity for members of a group. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0011000011399783">Shelby (2005)</xref> highlights the historical and contemporary experiences of racism, discrimination, and stigmatization as forming the basis of solidarity for African Americans. Shelby advocates for a politically based solidarity for African Americans as “identifying, correcting and ultimately eliminating race-based injustices” (p. 151). According to Shelby this solidarity is not based on mere group identity but rather is based on “the common experience of antiblack racism and the joint commitment to bringing it to an end” (p. 206). For Shelby this is a political (or emancipatory) solidarity that is distinguished from a social solidarity, which is not a means to some other end but a valuable objective in itself. Social solidarity nurtures communal relations, social interaction, and feelings of community among Americans of African descent. There is an expectation of common understanding based on an assumed cultural familiarity that many African Americans feel with one another. This common bond, reciprocity, and interdependence is fittingly captured by the West African proverb, “I am because we are and because we are, therefore, I am.” Researchers have attempted to capture this sense of solidarity.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0011000011399783">Hughes and Heuman (2006)</xref> conducted a qualitative investigation of African American women’s friendships, finding that solidarity was a central concept in the women’s descriptions of their relationships. These close, intimate relationships functioned to construct solidarity. This solidarity was communicated in three ways: (a) uniqueness of intragroup friendship, (b) use of Black vernacular, and (c) “authentic communication.” Friendships formed and maintained solidarity. These intraracial friendships recreated and nurtured Black women’s history and identity, such that staying connected was also staying connected to this history. As one participant described, “[O]ur color is more than just similarity it is a bond” (p. 37). It was important to these women to be close to friends who could relate to their experiences because of a shared understanding. The use of particular language expressed solidarity. One participant described, “[It’s] the way we speak, we use different words and different rhythms with our Black friends” (p. 38). The communication between African American women must be authentic, that is, it must be true to their identity. The uniqueness, the use of particular language, and real communication within these friendships build solidarity and community. These friendships were seen as critical to the women’s sense of self and well-being. In a similar vein, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0011000011399783">Orbe’s (1994)</xref> qualitative study of African American males’ communication found that the men highly valued connection with other African Americans because they are able to understand the common problems, situations, and pressures because of the “multigenerational history of lived experiences with revolves around acts of racism, discrimination, and oppression” (p. 291).</p>
<p>Thus far, I have discussed “in-group” solidarity, the type of solidarity that members of a given group have toward one another. This solidarity is based “on close relations and moral responsibility” to those which we feel an emotional connection; it is direct and personal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0011000011399783">Juul, 2010</xref>, p. 255). The support that comes from one’s own in-group, from those who share the experience of the same adversity, can be empowering: “One’s sense of damaged self-worth can be restored, at least partially, by a community of solidarity of [with] others in a similar plight” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0011000011399783">Blum, 2007</xref>, p. 56). Blum also examines “out-group” solidarity as expressed from members of one group toward members of another group. Out-group members can express solidarity with others in a variety of private or public means. Affirmation and recognition of the out-group’s struggle and providing instrumental support to the out-group are meaningful contributions to the alleviation of the out-group’s suffering. The knowledge that others understand and empathize with one’s plight can be very important to members of the victimized group.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0011000011399783">Min (2005)</xref> argued that to promote justice and liberation, a more universal sense of solidarity, centered on our interdependence on one another as human beings, is required. This sense of solidarity goes beyond similar group identity or shared group experience. For Min “there are deeper, wider, and more enduring solidarities among humanity based on human nature” (p. 844). Consequently, we must recognize our interdependence and common destiny and exercise deliberate “acts of solidarity as fellow citizens and human beings” (p. 846) to provide the conditions of life necessary to ensure the essential dignity of all. We all have a stake in the common struggle for social justice and liberation. This larger, more inclusive solidarity can create a sense of social cohesion in a culturally diverse society. Tolerance, openness, responsibility, and justice for (even) strangers would characterize a society organized around solidarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0011000011399783">Juul, 2010</xref>). Min claims this solidarity is intrinsic to humanity given our social nature that simply needs to be (re)activated and provided with avenues and structures to support its expression.</p>
<p>In a similar vein, Erich Fromm, noted psychoanalyst and social critic, was concerned with solidarity, which he conceptualized as the ultimate ideal of feeling and acting. For Fromm, solidarity is essential for individual well-being and for a peaceful and productive world.</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>Only when man succeeds in developing his reason and love further than he has done so far, only when he can build a world based on human solidarity and justice, only when he can feel rooted in the experience of universal brotherliness, will he have found a new, human form of rootedness, will he have transformed his world into a truly human home. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0011000011399783">Fromm, 1990</xref>, p. 60)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Fromm held a rather utopian vision for society seeking after justice, equality, and freedom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0011000011399783">Wilde, 2004</xref>). Solidarity, caring profoundly about the condition of one another, is the apex of human social behavior. In our modern and postmodern individualistic society, however, solidarity is exceptional as we are typically preoccupied with narrow, short term self-interests. Fromm laments that we function in the “having mode,” seeking material possessions and power that lead to greed, envy, and aggression, rather than the “being mode,” based on love, sharing, and productive activity. The “being mode” is necessary for happiness and solidarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0011000011399783">Fromm, 2002</xref>). Fromm speculates that the tendency to “have” is rooted in the biological need for survival, whereas the tendency to “be” is rooted in the specific communal condition of human existence and “the inherent need to overcome one’s isolation by oneness with others” (p. 86).</p>
<p>Solidarity has a key affective foundation, that is “caring <italic>sincerely</italic> and <italic>intensely</italic> about the varieties of human misery that have always been a part of human societies” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0011000011399783">Rodger, 2003</xref>, pp. 411-412, italics original). In fact, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0011000011399783">Rodger (2003)</xref> claims that we have entered an era of postemotionalism where there is a tendency for feelings to be intellectualized rather than sincerely felt. Rodger calls postemotionalism both a cultural and structural feature of Euro-Western society where false niceness, politeness, political correctness, and social restraint prevent emotional disorder through the management of feelings. We are able to keep human suffering out of our direct experience. Knowledge of the plight of those who are oppressed, disadvantaged, and poor is often gained from a safe distance via the media, which cultivate a detached concern. This distance and the resulting detachment do not foster a deep concern for others. Routine daily interaction would foster an intimate knowledge of the true experiences of others. Interestingly, this detachment is often seen as a key characteristic of being an objective and effective professional. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0011000011399783">Greenspan (2002)</xref> calls this the hegemony of the “distance model,” where “the less the therapist contaminates the therapeutic process with his [or her] presences the better. Distance is enshrined; connection is seen as inherently tainted and untrustworthy” (p. 427).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011000011399783">Coulehan (2009)</xref> specifically disparaged physicians’ professional approach of “detached concern” as interfering with their ability to connect compassionately with patients. Coulehan called for a “compassionate solidarity” that would allow physicians (and other health professionals) to truly appreciate and respond to human suffering: “The creation of an empathic connection is in itself a healing action” (p. 597). Coulehan emphasizes allowing the development of a real relationship between the person of the physician connecting with the person of the patient rather than the cultivation of professional detachment and objectivity, which devalue the role of solidarity within the healing process. Solidarity necessitates a deep sense of empathy with the Other. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0011000011399783">Freire (2001)</xref>, solidarity “requires that one enter into the situation of those with whom one is in solidary: it is a radical posture” (p. 49). Coulehan asserts that physicians must develop this posture of solidarity and connect with their patients. Fortunately for psychologists, in our training as therapists, this empathic understanding forms the foundation for much of our professional work with clients.</p>
<p>I believe that this sense of solidarity can be experienced between clinicians and clients. “Solidarity begins with caring, compassion, community, and a deep sense of humility on the part of professionals” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0011000011399783">Nelson, Prilleltensky, &amp; MacGillivary, 2001</xref>, p. 653). Solidarity between myself and my clients both allowed and required me to be myself, to give primacy to the real relationship, to establish close boundaries, and to act in clients’ best interests. The solidarity between an African American clinician and an African American client may be based on a view of their shared identity, history, and experience. This solidarity may be communicated and maintained through authenticity, genuineness, warmth, and closeness within the therapeutic relationship. Close, flexible boundaries may be a reflection of positive, affirming, adaptive feelings owing to solidarity between the therapist and client.</p>
<p>It is important to make clear that the dominant, hegemonic view of professional boundaries represents just one particular approach to boundaries that is culturally bound. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0011000011399783">Gallardo (2009)</xref> criticized the “therapeutic status quo” based on a traditional Eurocentric model that may hinder well-meaning therapists’ ability to provide culturally competent care to members of culturally diverse communities. The therapeutic status quo defines the parameters and the nature of therapy relationships, naming what is normal, good, proper and standard, rendering any deviations from its traditional view of therapy relationships as problematic and suspect. The traditional notion of “what belongs inside and outside of psychotherapy” must be challenged if clinicians are to provide culturally responsive treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0011000011399783">Carter, 2009</xref>). As Gallardo astutely observed, this is a dispute about what constitutes the “standard of care with a multicultural framework” (p. 427). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0011000011399783">Carter (2009)</xref> asserts that “we are obligated to re-envision our fundamental understanding of the boundaries and parameters that contain the psychotherapy” (p. 434). From a flexible, culturally responsive perspective where my boundaries are closer, some of my actions might not be considered boundary crossings because they were the expected, normal behaviors arising from within the particular cultural context. To illustrate, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0011000011399783">Parham (2009)</xref> discussed hugs or embraces between clients and therapists from a traditional perspective are discouraged; however, from a culturally responsive perspective the traditional prohibitions against this physical contact are not particularly relevant because of the cultural meaning of the gestures and the lack of exploitative intent.</p>
<p>Culturally speaking, Americans of African descent, because of the legacy of their African heritage, the historical and contemporary racism they have experienced, and their need to cope, resist, and adapt to oppressive conditions, have developed a unique worldview that values affective experience and sociability. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0011000011399783">Jones (1979</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0011000011399783">2003)</xref> described a context-dependent theory of being-in-the-world, TRIOS, which captures both the African cultural legacy and the mechanisms for coping with slavery and racism for African Americans. TRIOS, an acronym for five dimensions of experience, is composed of attitudes, beliefs and values about time, rhythm, improvisation, orality, and spirituality. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0011000011399783">Jones and Block (1984)</xref> delineated the potential implications of the TRIOS model for therapeutic relationships. Rhythm is “recurring patterns of behavior set in time and gives shape, energy, and meaning to psychological experience” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0011000011399783">Jones, 2003</xref>, p. 226). For instance, one important aspect of rhythm is feeling; thus, relationships have to “feel right.” Clients may be looking for a synchronicity, a compatibility of rhythms with the clinician. Improvisation is “goal directed creative problem solving under time pressure” (p. 219) and is “a way to structure interactions among people” (p. 226). Improvisation allows for spontaneous, creative adaptations and the expression of one’s soul and spirit. Thus, within a therapeutic relationship personal style, individual distinctiveness, humor, wit, and other verbal improvisations may be important. “There may be a stronger need to be responded to as an individual” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0011000011399783">Jones &amp; Block, 1984</xref>, p. 61). Orality refers to preferences for oral face-to-face communication, personal expression, and the meaningful role of spoken words (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0011000011399783">Jones, 2003</xref>). Orality places a higher value on experience and interpersonal relations rather than “book learning” and abstract analysis. Thus, clients would likely trust as competent a clinician who really knew from experience about “my problems, where I’m coming from” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0011000011399783">Jones &amp; Block, 1984</xref>, p. 61).</p>
<p>Thus, TRIOS provides a particular lens for examining the cultural foundations potentially influencing the counseling relationship between African American clinicians and clients. Furthermore, mainstream notions of the “proper” therapy relationship and its “appropriately distant” boundaries might not be applicable to participants who adhere to what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0011000011399783">Jones (2003)</xref> would call a TRIOS worldview. Clients and therapists who uphold these particular African American cultural notions might draw on solidarity in their therapeutic relationship. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0011000011399783">Zur (2007)</xref> described, it is the sense of affiliation, interdependence, mutuality, and affiliation between members of particular communities that contributes to the location of the therapeutic boundaries. Expectations of similar experiences, shared understanding, and cultural familiarity all likely establish, maintain, and reinforce a sense of solidarity between African American clients and therapists that then influences the location of the therapeutic boundaries that they co-construct.</p>

<title>Therapy Applications</title>
<p>This section provides a few illustrations of the complexity involved in judgments about therapeutic boundaries based on an understanding of solidarity. Almost 40 years ago, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0011000011399783">Kincaid (1969)</xref> suggested effective therapy requires that African American clinicians and clients see that they have something common. This sense of commonality, or solidarity, may lead to boundaries that are congruent with cultural expectations about close albeit professional relationships.</p>
<p>An African American doctoral student, Shana (a pseudonym), consulted with me about an experience she had in supervision as a result of an encounter in a counseling session. Shana described an African American teenage girl, a patient in the hospital whose mother was in jail and a chronic substance abuser and whose father had recently been released from prison. The girl had been acting up, made a suicide attempt, and was acting out sexually. In the hospital for only a few days, the girl had gained a reputation for being rather difficult and guarded. In a joint session with the girl, her father, the family therapist, and Shana (who was the girl’s therapist), there came a very emotional and tense moment. The girl was angry and crying, the father was frustrated, and the girl became silent and withdrawn as her father was admonishing her to not go down the same road as he had. Shana was also filled with emotion, her own eyes rimmed with tears, and she reached her hand out and touched the girl on her forearm and said, “You know what, baby, we can’t help you if you don’t tell us what going on with you.” I was very curious about Shana’s rationale for why she physically reached out, switched codes (i.e., used Black vernacular), and showed her emotions. Shana said, “I am an older female, a big sista, and this is my little sista. It was like a big sista talking to a little sista.” Shana said she was affected personally by the girl and that her actions felt very natural. Shana was quite torn, however, by the divergent reactions of her supervisors.</p>
<p>One supervisor thought the comment flowed from Shana being effectively in the here and now, in the immediacy of the moment, and thought the comment was indeed therapeutic. The second supervisor thought Shana’s comment and touch were problematic since perhaps the client could not handle the therapist’s emotions. Moreover, and most telling, was the supervisor’s belief that it was not professional for Shana to talk in that manner and asked if Shana was trying to be a psychologist or a mentor. Apparently, Shana’s supervisors, both African American women, worked from two different theoretical perspectives resulting in varying views of the “proper therapist role.” I am glad that Shana had one supervisor who validated her emotions and actions and did not tell her that what she did was wrong. However, I was concerned that the second supervisor’s traditional view of appropriate professional behavior might have been unduly restricting of Shana’s development as a therapist. Yet the supervisor raises some valid questions: What was motivating Shana’s comment? What role was Shana attempting to play with the client? Was the client in a position to receive Shana’s expression of concern? Was Shana’s desire for and expression of solidarity appropriate? I think that Shana’s experience illustrates the complexity of the connections among culture, solidarity, and therapy boundaries.</p>
<p>As a clinician I learned a lesson about being restrictive in an attempt to maintain “proper” boundaries. I was providing individual therapy through the community center to two older adolescent girls who were close friends. (The fact of their friendship and having the same therapist would itself be seen as a boundary crossing by some.) They often utilized their respective therapy appointments with me as a place to meet and touch base with each other. Occasionally, one would say to me in the presence of the other, “Make sure she tells you about what happened this weekend” and sometimes go on to give details. Obviously, neither client had signed consent forms to allow this level of communication. The girls came to me with a proposal for the three of us to go out to lunch together to celebrate the end of the school year. I completely balked! For several weeks they each would raise the issue in their therapy sessions, and they orchestrated a couple of joint conversations to attempt to persuade me to go to lunch. My refusal was all about proper and appropriate boundaries; I saw no therapeutic benefit to going out to a restaurant. I was concerned about turning our therapy relationship into a social one. What would we talk about at a restaurant? I forthrightly expressed my concerns to the girls. They even seemed to understand my hesitation but thought that going to lunch might actually help to deepen our relationships. One of the girls conveyed that she knew we were not friends but that going to lunch was something that friends did, so it would be like “sort of” being friends.</p>
<p>I finally gave myself permission to stretch my boundaries when one of the young women said exasperatedly, “Dr. Suz, it’s just lunch.” I relented for several reasons. First, I felt our working relationships were very strong and characterized by high levels of trust and honesty. I experienced myself as very forthright and genuine with both of these clients and I frequently provided a stern, caring, motherly mentor role for them. Moreover, I felt that therapeutically both of them were in good places, and although dealing with serious issues, both were relatively stable. There had been numerous so-called boundary crossings already within our therapy relationships because of my involvement in the community center; thus, I knew these relationships were already “different” and that both of them had the capacity to discuss our therapy process. Finally, I was confident that I could in therapy sessions adequately process the meaning of the lunch and any potential fallout as a result. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0011000011399783">Vasquez (2007)</xref> (and my client) aptly noted, “Sometimes a taco is just a taco.” There was no danger of me exploiting the young women and there might even be a therapeutic benefit to the lunch. So we went. We had a nice relaxed time together; they felt validated. Our conversation was light and chatty; in fact, they talked more to each other than they did to me. It was empowering to them for us to be out in the world, together. I had not realized how important the lunch was to them. In a subsequent therapy session, one of the teenagers said that she really enjoyed the lunch because it made her feel normal, like she was not “just” a person with problems. Were the young women looking for an expression of solidarity from me?</p>
<p>Within a therapy relationship, I know that I can be close and genuine and feel connected without being inappropriate and exploitative. I can tolerate complexity and role flexibility in my professional relationships. I can be in solidarity and maintain boundaries simultaneously. I can be authentic and professional, maintaining and managing close and appropriate boundaries for the client’s benefit.</p>
<p>For instance, my colleague, Dr. Elizabeth Vera, and I conducted focus groups with therapists at a few community-based agencies asking how they tailored their services to meet the needs of the community they served (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0011000011399783">Speight, Vera, Caldwell, Clarke, &amp; West, 2006</xref>). We had a fascinating conversation with a group of primarily African American clinicians who mostly provide home-based services, and they talked adamantly about the importance of solid boundaries and personal rules. These therapists might ride a client in their car, provide therapy at the kitchen table, or use self-disclosure but would never think of hugging the client or eating while at the client’s house. The therapists had clear lines that they would not cross as professionals even while being and feeling close to their clients. Another group of primarily South Asian clinicians talked about “loving” and “adoring” their South Asian female clients, feeling very close to them. They were quick to add, “but it’s not like [the clients are] visiting us at home or that stuff.” Thus, solidarity fuels the close connections between the therapy participants even while the professional maintains the security of boundaries.</p>
<p>It is solidarity that allows one to be real and to be closer “supposed” to be according to the conventional notions of therapy boundaries. The boundaries might be close and they might be warm, but they are there and they are solid, even if flexible. Close boundaries are not the first step on that slippery slope to sexual misconduct simply because “close” does not mean inappropriate. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0011000011399783">Glass (2003)</xref> articulated, key to any discussion of boundary crossings is the idea of appropriateness of the therapist’s behavior. Inappropriate behavior is behavior that is not in the client’s best interests. All of these clinical examples demonstrate therapist behavior that was intended to be in the client’s best interests. Certainly, one could imagine clinical situations where solidarity is utilized as an excuse for inappropriate therapist behavior. Therapists bent on harming clients are adept at using any number of excuses for exploiting clients. Moreover, there are some clients who because of their psychopathology, presenting problem, past experiences, or the stage of the therapy, for instance, might require a more conventional boundary approach. A key issue here is one of reflective decision making around issues of boundaries, one that acknowledges various approaches to boundaries and is centered on the need for culturally competent treatment.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This critique of a universal conception of therapy boundaries has offered a more culturally congruent view of boundaries rooted in solidarity. As was earlier stated, the placement, management, and negotiation of therapeutic boundaries constitute a cultural endeavor. A critical examination of the therapeutic boundaries we all variously establish with our clients seems in order. Many authors have attempted to stimulate a dialogue around flexible, context-sensitive, culturally congruent boundaries in therapy. A productive discourse around these issues is sorely needed, particularly as relates to cultural competence, graduate education and training, ethics, continuing education, and supervision. It would be exceedingly useful to hear the voices of African American clinicians and other clinicians of color, for instance, to read case reports about the process of the therapy and the clinicians’ internal process in shaping close, flexible boundaries. Similarly, it would be critical to hear from clients of color about their pretherapy expectations, their positive and negative incidents in therapy, and their experience of the therapy boundaries and the therapist’s role. Research in this arena is sorely lacking.</p>
<p>This particular exploration of solidarity and therapy relationships has focused on African American therapists with African American clients; however, I surmise that much of this discussion is applicable to other groups of therapists and clients. It might be possible to assess counseling participants’ feelings of solidarity through the Interpersonal Solidarity Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0011000011399783">Wheeless, 1978</xref>) or perhaps the Collective Self Esteem Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0011000011399783">Luhtanen &amp; Crocker, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>Clinicians must be ever mindful of the line being walked between boundaries that are too close and those that are too distant. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0011000011399783">Backlar (1996)</xref> talked about the difficulty of “being both involved and objective” (p. 509). The practical “clean, well-lit room” standard might provide a useful yardstick to make rough judgments about boundaries. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0011000011399783">Welfel (2006)</xref>, if you would mind your peers or colleagues observing what you are doing in a “clean, well-lit room,” then you probably should not be doing it. Clinicians ought to feel comfortable with their peers and colleagues observing the boundaries they establish between themselves and their clients, and they ought to have a clear rationale justifying their boundary judgments. Moreover, there must be space for therapists to discuss their boundary locations and boundary crossing without fear of being judged as sliding down that dreadful “slippery slope.” Clinicians would benefit from a network of colleagues with whom they could discuss boundary placement, negotiation, and management. Ironically, this increased dialogue would allow clinicians to make boundary decisions “in solidarity” with like-minded peers.</p>
<p>The field must be open to hearing about the range of locations and the management of therapeutic boundaries by ethical therapists. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0011000011399783">Lazarus (1994)</xref> was a courageous pioneer to discuss his clinical experiences of “unconventional” boundaries. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0011000011399783">Greenspan (2002)</xref> mentioned, “[I]n my own practice, I worry that some of the most feminist and innovative aspects of my work are the most likely to be construed as unethical” (p. 427). The field must hear from those therapists who routinely negotiate and flex boundaries to serve their clients’ best interests. Otherwise, therapists in training will not learn ways to guide their decision making around boundary issues in actual therapy relationships. Building a network of culturally competent practitioners is the means by which the therapeutic status quo will expand to include a wider definition of appropriate boundaries in therapy. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0011000011399783">Gallardo (2009)</xref> asserts, “[C]ulturally responsive practice should be our standard and norm and not the exception” (p. 429). Ultimately this new emergent standard of care, incorporating close, warm, flexible boundaries associated with solidarity, will form the basis for judgments regarding effective and ethical culturally responsive therapy. The need for a new more inclusive standard of care becomes important when considering issues of risk management and legal liability.</p>
<p>There are many unanswered questions that stem from my examination of boundaries and solidarity. Can the solidarity that I have discussed be experienced by therapy participants who hold different social identities and are not members of a group that shares solidarity? Can or should solidarity be fostered if it does not “naturally” exist? Is solidarity a necessary and/or sufficient condition for constructing close boundaries in culturally responsive therapy? What if the counseling participants have different investments in solidarity? The answers to these questions will prove instructional as we move forward in our exploration of solidarity and boundaries.</p>
<p>Finally, close, warm boundaries grounded in solidarity might be critical for effective therapeutic relationships with members of oppressed communities. A commitment to the promotion of social justice requires an expansion of our professional role not only within the therapy relationship but also beyond the therapy session and into the community. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0011000011399783">Vera and Speight (2003)</xref> asserted, mental health professionals might need to do “more” than individual counseling (e.g., advocacy, prevention) to meet the needs of clients from oppressed communities. In fact, solidarity may oblige a psychologist to actually “be more” given the bond of unity shared with the client. “It is not what is <italic>said</italic> that is valued but what is <italic>done</italic> in therapy. It is what the therapist does that conveys trustworthiness, cultural sensitivity, congruity of expectations” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0011000011399783">Jones &amp; Block, 1984</xref>, p. 61, italics original). Our actions, empathic understanding, compassion, flexibility, and willingness to meet the clients at their need all reveal our sense of solidarity with our clients. Solidarity provides the basis for a critical reexamination of how the boundaries between therapists and clients might be constructed in a culturally meaningful and congruent manner. To provide culturally responsive services our notion of boundaries must expand to include the influence of solidarity between the participants. I hope that what I have learned and shared about boundaries and solidarity contributes to the ongoing discourse around the placement and management of therapeutic boundaries in culturally responsive therapy.</p>
