<abstract>
<p>Political parties have substantial influence on which issues the news media cover during election campaigns, while the media have limited influence on party agendas. However, we know little about why some parties are more successful than others in passing the media’s gates and being covered on sponsored issues. On the basis of content analyses of election news coverage (812 news stories) and press releases published by political parties (N = 334) during the 2007 national election campaign in Denmark, we analyse which parties were successful in appearing in the news on issues on which they published press releases. Using Sartori’s notion of relevant parties, we conclude that the more relevant parties have more success, that there is a positive spillover effect from other parties’ press releases, but also a negative interaction effect between a party’s own and other parties’ press releases. The results are discussed with respect to their generalizability and arising challenges for future research.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>While media scholars and political scientists have studied the process of agenda-setting for more than four decades, there has been less focus on why some parties are more effective than others when it comes to influencing the issue agenda of the media. Such knowledge is important primarily because extant research shows that the media agenda has a substantial influence on which policy issues the public perceives as important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1354068810380097">McCombs and Shaw, 1972</xref>; Weaver et al., 2004). Since party strategists know this, they try to influence media coverage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1354068810380097">Asp, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1354068810380097">Brandenburg, 2003</xref>), and multiple studies indicate that parties can indeed have substantial influence over the media agenda (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1354068810380097">Brandenburg, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1354068810380097">Walgrave and van Aelst, 2006</xref>). Moreover, we know that voters associate different parties with different policy issues, which, in turn, may affect voting behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1354068810380097">Budge and Farlie, 1983</xref>). One important causal factor behind associating different parties with different issues is the extent to which parties are covered in the media in relation to the different issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1354068810380097">Walgrave and de Swert, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1354068810380097">Walgrave et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>It is therefore important for both the political scientist and the political parties to gain a better understanding of the factors that condition the ability of parties to put their preferred issues on the media agenda. This ability to influence the media agenda undoubtedly varies across parties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1354068810380097">Asp, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1354068810380097">Brandenburg, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1354068810380097">Harris et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1354068810380097">Semetko et al., 1991</xref>), but we do not know why. The present article is thus an important step towards providing new insights in this regard. Drawing on datasets measuring daily television news coverage and political parties’ press releases during the 2007 Danish national election campaign, we analyse <italic>whether and, if so, why parties have differing success in appearing in the news on the issues they sponsor themselves</italic>.</p>
<p>Even though this article presents a one-country study, the ultimate goal is to identify explanations that are likely to apply to parties in other multiparty systems with similar patterns of party competition. In addition, although the interplay between the media and politicians may be different during elections and non-election times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1354068810380097">van Aelst and de Swert, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1354068810380097">Walgrave and van Aelst, 2006</xref>), the study of election campaigns is of central importance in representative democracies and therefore constitutes an obvious point of departure when illustrating parties’ varying agenda-setting capacities.</p>
<p>The article proceeds in four sections: first, the theoretical framework and a number of hypotheses are presented. Second, the empirical data and the applied methods are described. Third, the findings are reported and, finally, the wider implications of these findings are discussed.</p>

<title>Theoretical framework and hypotheses</title>
<sec id="section3-1354068810380097">
<title>The agenda-setting approach and efforts to set the media agenda</title>
<p>The basic idea of agenda-setting studies is that the salience of issues on the media agenda influences the salience of issues on the public agenda, that is, in the minds of voters. A number of studies have shown that this assumption in general holds true (for an overview, see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1354068810380097">Weaver, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1354068810380097">Weaver et al., 2004</xref>). We also know that the salience of issues can influence the party choices of voters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1354068810380097">Brandenburg, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1354068810380097">Green and Hobolt, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1354068810380097">Kleinnijenhuis and de Ridder, 1998</xref>). Given this knowledge, it is not surprising that political parties try to control or at least influence the media agenda. This process has been described as parties’ ‘media agenda-setting’ or ‘agenda-building’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1354068810380097">Brandenburg, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1354068810380097">Dearing and Rogers, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1354068810380097">Walters et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1354068810380097">Weaver et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Empirically, studies have repeatedly found high correlations between the agendas of political parties and the media during election campaigns: in a study of the 1979 Swedish parliamentary election, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1354068810380097">Asp (1983</xref>: 339) finds that: ‘The parties (..) seem to be powerful agenda setters for the news media.’ Analysing the British general election of 1983, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1354068810380097">Semetko et al. (1991)</xref> found a strong correlation between British party and television news issue agendas. Similarly, the media’s issue coverage during the 2002 Irish election was quite close to the political parties’ agendas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1354068810380097">Brandenburg, 2005</xref>). In sum, such studies confirm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1354068810380097">Walgrave and van Aelst’s (2006)</xref> conclusion that political parties are quite successful in shaping the media agenda during election campaigns, while the media have limited or no power to influence the issue agendas of the political parties. Thus, our first hypothesis argues that on the aggregated level parties influence the media agenda during election campaigns more than the media influence the party campaign agendas (H1).</p>
<p>Parties may differ, however, in their capacities to set the media agenda. Following the increasing number of studies on political agenda-setting looking for contingent factors (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1354068810380097">Vliegenthart and Walgrave, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1354068810380097">Walgrave and van Aelst, 2006</xref>), we look for factors that allow some parties to be more influential vis-à-vis the media than others. In multiparty systems with several parties, intuitively it seems implausible that all parties are equally successful in influencing the media’s issue coverage. The literature provides some evidence that this, indeed, is not the case: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1354068810380097">Asp (2006)</xref> shows that the agenda of the news coverage during the 2006 Swedish national election campaign was closer to the conservative parties than to the socialist parties. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1354068810380097">Brettschneider (2002)</xref> shows that issue coverage during the 2002 German <italic>Bundestag</italic> election campaign was more in line with the incumbent left-wing parties’ agenda than with the liberal–conservative opposition agenda.</p>
<p>A closer look at these studies reveals a shortcoming. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1354068810380097">Brandenburg (2004</xref>: 7) notes, ‘debates of salience manipulation are lacking (...) a clear understanding of the mechanism by which political actors actually influence public salience’. Most studies analyse <italic>correlations</italic> between the party and the media agendas; they do not analyse <italic>causal</italic> mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1354068810380097">Asp, 1983</xref>: 351). An exception, and thus valuable contribution, is <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1354068810380097">Brandenburg’s (2002</xref>: 40) study of television and press issue coverage during the 1997 British general election: as he emphasizes, ‘[t]he problem with previous research into party–media relationship is that campaigns have not been treated as <italic>processes</italic> but as <italic>events</italic>’ (italics in original). Using time-series analysis, Brandenburg shows that, on the one hand, ‘the major parties [Labour and Conservatives] were the driving forces behind the overall agenda dynamics rather than being driven, at least not by the media’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1354068810380097">Brandenburg, 2002</xref>: 46). On the other hand, the (smaller) Liberal Democratic Party had no success with influencing the media agenda.</p>
<p>Studies on Irish and German election news coverage also reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1354068810380097">Brandenburg (2004</xref>: 25) show similar results. In Germany, the then incumbent red–green government and the major opposition party ‘exerted significant influence on the news agenda of the public television station ARD’. In Ireland, it was the dominant Fianna Fail that set the media agenda. Moreover, in Ireland the media agenda apparently also had an effect on the party agendas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1354068810380097">Brandenburg, 2004</xref>: 22).</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the important insights from Brandenburg’s and others’ studies, the majority of works mentioned are primarily empirical, which means that the party differences are under-theorized and explained <italic>post hoc.</italic> Thus, the following subsection theorizes about the varying ability of parties to set the media agenda. A graphical overview of the theoretical model we present – and subsequently test empirically – is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1354068810380097">Figure 1</xref>

<title>The relevance of parties</title>
<p>Studies have shown that incumbent parties experience a bonus in terms of media attention, as is the case in for example The Netherlands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1354068810380097">van Praag and van der Eijk, 1998</xref>), Italy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1354068810380097">Djerf-Pierre and Weibull, 2005</xref>), Spain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1354068810380097">Díez-Nicolás and Semetko, 1999</xref>), the United Kingdom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1354068810380097">Brandenburg, 2006</xref>), Denmark (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1354068810380097">Hopmann et al., 2010</xref>) and Germany (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1354068810380097">Schneider et al., 1999</xref>). While parties in power act, those in the opposition merely talk and, hence, incumbent parties are more newsworthy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1354068810380097">Schönbach and Semetko, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1354068810380097">2000</xref>). Accordingly, when incumbent parties are more present in election news <italic>because</italic> they are incumbent, it might be assumed that incumbent parties also have most success in appearing in the news on issues they publish press releases about (H2A).</p>
<p>Notwithstanding this intuitive logic, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1354068810380097">Brandenburg (2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1354068810380097">2004</xref>) suggests that focusing simply on incumbency might be too simple: first, obviously it cannot explain why (some) also oppositional parties appear to be successful. Second, the incumbency effect might be smaller in times of election campaigns because incumbent parties are not only ‘the commanders in chief’ but also ordinary parties in open competition with other parties that are able to gain office (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1354068810380097">van Aelst and de Swert, 2009</xref>). Finally, looking at incumbency alone is to ignore that the size, the political power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1354068810380097">Powell, 2000</xref>) and the goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1354068810380097">Strøm, 1990</xref>) of parties vary greatly in most multiparty systems. Unlike the American case, in multiparty systems not every party competes for governmental office, and a range of parties have never held office; our case, Denmark, is no exception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1354068810380097">Skjæveland, 2003</xref>). Thus, some parties are more relevant than others in both the government formation process and everyday law-making.</p>
<p>In his seminal work on party systems, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1354068810380097">Sartori (2005</xref>: 107–10) formulates two attributes defining so-called ‘relevant parties’: they need to have coalition or blackmailing potential. Thus, small parties that are redundant to form a government, and/or are anti-system, can be seen as largely irrelevant. Following in Sartori’s footsteps, political scientists have designed more sophisticated measures by which to count the number of relevant parties in a given political system (for an overview, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1354068810380097">Blau, 2008</xref>). For our present purpose, we subscribe to the parsimonious classification of Sartori and argue that when some parties are more relevant than others in the political system the media may reflect these differences: with limited space in the news bulletins and a wide range of parties to cover, journalists may simply pick up the agendas of the most relevant parties. In fact, this line of thought jibes well with Bennett’s indexing theory of press–politics relations (1990). According to this theory, the news media ‘open the gates wider or close them more tightly as they perceive potentially decisive challenges or a lack of challenges to the most powerful institutional players and their agendas’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1354068810380097">Bennett et al., 2007</xref>: 49). Therefore, we suggest the following hierarchy: parties with coalition potential are more successful in influencing the media agenda than parties with blackmailing potential. The latter group of parties is, nevertheless, still more successful in influencing the media agenda than irrelevant parties (H2B) (for similar reasoning, see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1354068810380097">Brandenburg, 2003</xref>: 113).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1354068810380097">
<title>The competition between parties</title>
<p>Parties’ success in appearing on issues they focus on themselves may not simply reflect their general newsworthiness, as H2A and H2B imply: both hypotheses ignore that any given party competes against other parties for attention from the same journalists. The second set of hypotheses therefore takes the party competition perspective.</p>
<p>Extant research tells us that journalists are concerned, especially during election campaigns, with achieving more politically balanced news coverage by including candidates from different parties in their news reports (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1354068810380097">Donsbach and Klett, 1993</xref>: 65; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1354068810380097">Walgrave and van Aelst, 2006</xref>: 98). Hence, if party A publishes a press release on a given issue and subsequently is interviewed on this issue, journalists may also turn to party B or party C to balance the statements by party A. Thus, we expect to find a spillover effect from other parties’ press releases (H3A).</p>
<p>Having said this, more parties focusing on the same issue may also have the opposite effect. In their study on the effects of news on voters’ perceptions of issue-ownership, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1354068810380097">Walgrave et al. (2009)</xref> argue that voters can be more affected by news items containing only one politician claiming ownership of a given issue than on balanced news where one party’s claims are countered by another party. That is, possible effects on the audience of parties’ appearances are cancelled out by a balance between the parties. If we adopt this reasoning for the present study, the proximate audience of the political parties is the gate-keeping journalists. Hence, it follows that when too many parties publish press releases on the same issues on a given day, the success with influencing journalists by an individual party diminishes. Parties’ efforts to influence media coverage using press releases may have the characteristics of a zero-sum game: as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1354068810380097">Figure 1</xref>, we hypothesize that there is a negative interaction effect on a party’s media appearances on a specific issue of the number of press releases by that party on that issue and other parties’ press releases on the same issue (H3B).</p>

<title>The media agenda</title>
<p>For all 20 days of the 2007 national election campaign, we conducted a content analysis of all political news stories raised in the four major evening news bulletins on Danish television (DR1: 18.30, 21.00; TV2: 19.00, 22.00; N = 812). Television news bulletins were chosen because televised news is the public’s main source of political information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1354068810380097">Lund, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1354068810380097">Mazzoleni and Schulz, 1999</xref>). We included all political news stories regardless of the focus, that is, both election news and other types of political news stories. Given the very short duration of Danish election campaigns, journalists refer to the upcoming election in virtually all news stories.</p>
<p>For each news story, we coded the day of the campaign, the length, the dominant issue and all actors featuring.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1354068810380097">1</xref>
</sup> To test hypotheses 2 to 4, we use the daily number of times a party is mentioned together with an issue as the dependent variable. In order to have a reasonable number of news stories each day, we first aggregate the results for all four news bulletins.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1354068810380097">2</xref>
</sup> Second, the range of small issues categories is collapsed into nine border issue categories: (1) economy and employment, (2) welfare and social politics, (3) value politics (such as immigration and foreign aid), (4) education and science, (5) environment and infrastructure, (6) the European Union, (7) defence and terrorism, (8) campaign (i.e. voter and campaign trail stories; the definition follows previous research, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1354068810380097">D’Angelo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1354068810380097">Esser and D’Angelo, 2006</xref>) and, finally, (9) other issues. The last two categories are not included in the analysis: it is difficult to conceive how and why the news media would ‘copy’ issues within the campaign category. If the television media responds to, for example, press releases on photo opportunities, they most likely do not report on them, but simply use the information to put their cameramen to work.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1354068810380097">3</xref>
</sup> We also exclude ‘other issues’ because it is a residual category which by definition contains all kinds of issues – hence, it makes no sense to compare it across different issue agendas.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1354068810380097">
<title>Party agendas</title>
<p>Here, we study the agendas of the different parties by using their press releases as published during the election campaign. Press releases are analysed for a number of reasons. First, a number of studies capture party agendas using party election manifestos (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1354068810380097">Klingemann et al., 2006</xref>), but this source does not allow dynamic analysis of the developments in the course of the campaign. It is therefore necessary to choose a source of communication that is used every day, which narrows the possible choices to campaign ads, speeches, letters-to-the-editor and press releases. Ads (typically televised) are frequently used in the Anglo-American literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1354068810380097">Kaid, 1999</xref>), but televised political ads are prohibited in many European countries, including Denmark (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1354068810380097">Kaid and Holtz-Bacha, 1995</xref>). Moreover, small parties often cannot afford ads in the print media, which would invalidate an analysis drawing solely on this source. Speeches are extremely difficult to get, since no central archive exists – not even within the individual parties. Finally, the issues of parties’ letters-to-the-editor can be biased by newspaper editors who may have good reason to publish letters about issues covered by their newspapers. None of the mentioned problems applies to press releases.</p>
<p>Second, journalists have limited resources and work under considerable time pressures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1354068810380097">Brandenburg, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1354068810380097">Neveu, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1354068810380097">Plasser, 2005</xref>). Hence, journalists rely on routine and readily accessible channels of news material, such as party press releases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1354068810380097">McLeod et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1354068810380097">Sigal, 1973</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1354068810380097">Shea and Burton (2001</xref>: 173) emphasize that ‘[t]he most important tool for selling a candidate is the news release. (...) This form of communication (...) plays a central role in any campaign’s earned media strategy’. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1354068810380097">Walters et al. (1996</xref>: 9) note that ‘political campaigns (...) require many vehicles to transmit issue and image salience to voters. (...) Properly used, releases have the potential to amplify themes and images stressed by the campaign’. The sheer number of press releases published by all parties indicates that these are indeed considered important channels of communication in election campaigns (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1354068810380097">Table 1</xref>). The two minor parties – New Alliance (NA) and the Christian Democrats (KD) – published only five press releases each, so we are forced to exclude them from the following analyses. The remaining major parties published at least 40 press releases each, that is, on average at least two a day, indicating that these parties treat this channel of communication as important.</p>

<p>In their ‘war rooms’, parties monitor the campaign activities, issues and media appearances of their opponents in order to be able to respond immediately (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1354068810380097">Farrell and Webb, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1354068810380097">Gould, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1354068810380097">Jønsson, 2006</xref>). Obviously, a party cannot completely ignore issues that are sponsored by other parties. Therefore, a party will also publish press releases on issues it would like to avoid highlighting in general. However, when still publishing press releases on such issues it frames them to its own advantage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1354068810380097">Sides, 2007</xref>: 467). A party issuing a press release on a non-preferred issue probably aims at presenting it with its own slant rather than letting other parties express their opinions on it unopposed – if that was not the goal, it would not make much sense to publish a press release on the issue. Hence, the definition of a party-sponsored issue is an issue on which a party released a press release.</p>
<p>Each press release is coded the same way as individual news stories in the televised broadcasts, that is, we coded which party published the release, the day of the campaign and the dominant issue.<sup>

<title>The case and its political context</title>
<p>Apart from data availability, the 2007 Danish national election is chosen as our case because a large number of parties competed in this campaign. At the same time, however, in Denmark there are two ‘government nucleuses’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1354068810380097">Skjæveland, 2003</xref>). We are therefore able to see whether several parties with similar roles in the party system are equally successful in influencing media coverage.</p>
<p>On 24 October 2007, with 20 days’ notice, the then prime minister, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, announced that the next national election would be held on 13 November. Two government alternatives were running against each other: on the one side, the incumbent right-wing government consisting of the Liberals (V) as major partner in the coalition, and the prime minister’s party, and the Conservatives (K) as the minor partner. This government is a minority coalition supported by the Danish People’s Party (DF). The possible alternative government composition presented to the voters consisted of the Social Democrats (S) and the Social Liberals (RV). This coalition would also have been a minority government, in this case their supporting parties are two left-wing parties (the Socialist People’s Party [SF] and the minor Red–Green Alliance [EL]). An overview of the parties included in our study, and their status within the political system in the 2007 Danish national election, is given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1354068810380097">Table 2</xref>

<p>With the information given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1354068810380097">Table 2</xref>, we can specify H2A and H2B: H2A assumes that incumbent parties are successful in appearing in the news on issues they sponsor. Hence, we expect the Liberals (V) and the Conservatives (K) to be most successful. H2B takes a more detailed approach, arguing that there is a difference between non-relevant and different types of relevant parties. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1354068810380097">Sartori (2005)</xref>, all six parties in our analysis are relevant. In Denmark, no anti-system party is represented in parliament and all other parties in the analysis are involved in government formation. H2B can therefore be specified stating that parties with coalition potential (V, K, S, RV) are more successful than parties with blackmailing potential only (DF, SF).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1354068810380097">
<title>Statistical considerations</title>
<p>For each party, the datafile resembles a pooled time-series structure with time-points (days) nested within issues. Specifically, we test for each party separately whether it appears in the evening news on the same issues (the dependent variable) it and other parties published press releases on during the day. To establish the most appropriate analytical technique that takes into account the nested structure as well as the possible dynamic structure of the series, several steps have to be taken (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1354068810380097">Wilson and Butler, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The first question that needs to be addressed is whether the dependent variable resembles a normal distribution. This is not the case. Rather, we are dealing with highly skewed count data with a fairly large variance, making a negative binomial regression a viable option (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1354068810380097">Long, 1997</xref>). However, results demonstrate that results from this type of analysis largely resemble the same analysis using a linear regression. Since results from the latter have a more straightforward interpretation, we chose to report those analyses.</p>
<p>The second question that needs to be addressed is whether the series are stationary, that is, whether the mean of each medium-level series is unaffected by a change of time origin and thus the expected value is the same for all time-points. The relevant Fisher tests indicate that all our series are stationary and do not have to be differenced.</p>
<p>In addition, we find heterogeneity in the series which indicates the presence of panel-specific (in our case issue-specific) differences in the dependent variable that are not captured by the independent variables in the model. From a substantial point of view, this finding is no surprise: there are substantial differences across issues with some issues receiving more party attention than others. Other reasons than party–media dynamics are likely to account for those variations (e.g. classification of issues). Taking into account this heterogeneity, we have to choose between a fixed-effects or a random-effects analysis. The Hausman test indicates that both types of analysis – the fixed effects resembling a regression with dummies for each of the issues and the random effects resembling a regression for which the intercept is allowed to randomly differ across issues – yield largely similar results. In that case, random effects are more efficient. Finally, for most of the parties, the dependent variable has some moderate first-order autocorrelation, which we handle by including a lagged dependent variable as an independent variable. Overall, this results in pooled linear regressions with random effects and a lagged dependent variable. To test our hypotheses, we execute the analysis for each party in three steps. First, we look at a model that includes the lagged dependent variable and the party’s own press releases. Second, we add the number of press releases other parties published on the issue. Third, we include an interaction term between the party’s own press release and the other parties’ press releases.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1354068810380097">
<title>Findings</title>
<p>It is asked how successful parties are in appearing in the evening news on the issues of their press releases published the same day. As a first step, we analyse the hypotheses that parties as such are able to influence the media agenda, and that the media have little impact on the party agendas (H1). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1354068810380097">Table 3</xref>
 (left column) gives the results when all press releases of all parties are pooled: first, no autocorrelation is found in the media agenda, indicating little stability; therefore no lagged term of the dependent variable is included in the model. This finding supports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1354068810380097">Brandenburg’s (2002</xref>: 43) conclusion that ‘agenda stability and continuity appears to be a short-term process during campaigns’. Second, a significant effect on the evening news bulletins of all press releases published the same day is found. That is, the issue agenda of the parties’ press releases apparently has a systematic effect on the issue agenda in the evening news.</p>

<p>Results for the opposite causal direction are shown in the right column of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1354068810380097">Table 3</xref>: first, over time, parties are more stable in their issue focus than the evening news is; tests revealed that including a lagged term for their own issue focus is appropriate. Second, no significant effect of the media agenda in the news on parties’ issue agenda in their press releases the following day is found. Summing up, we find empirical support for H1: parties indeed influence the media agenda, whereas the media do not influence the parties’ campaign agendas.</p>
<p>Turning to the main question of the present article, we test the remaining hypotheses formulated above. Looking at the first model in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1354068810380097">Table 4</xref>
 (first column for each party) including each party’s own press releases, we find in all instances positive coefficients confirming the basic assumption that parties are successful in influencing the media agenda – not only at the aggregate party-system level (as shown above) but also at the individual party level. With regard to the relevance of parties, this finding clearly shows that not only incumbent parties (Liberals, Conservatives) exert a significant impact on news coverage. We also find significant results for other parties, thus H2A on incumbency remains unsupported.</p>

<p>The more elaborate H2B on the relevance of parties suggests that a hierarchy exists: the more relevant a party is, the more success it will have with its press releases. There are some indications: first, we find positive and significant effects for three out of four parties with coalition potential (Social Democrats, Liberals and Conservatives). Moreover, it seems that the ‘big brother’ in each government coalition alternative has the most influence on the media coverage (Social Democrats and Liberals, respectively). Second, significant results are found for only one of the two parties with less relevance, that is, blackmailing potential only (Socialist People’s Party, but not Danish People’s Party). The Socialist People’s Party had enormous momentum throughout the 2007 election campaign gradually altering the party’s position in the political system from a blackmailer to a party with coalition aspirations (comparable to the Socialist Left in the rather similar Norwegian political landscape; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1354068810380097">Sitter, 2006</xref>). Possibly, the media saw this change coming during the election campaign. That said, the effects for the Socialist People’s Party are much smaller than for the Social Democrats and the Liberals. In sum, keeping in mind that we compare six parties only, we find partial support for H2B.</p>
<p>Next, testing the effects of party competition, we present a second set of models in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1354068810380097">Table 4</xref> (second column for each party). In this model we include a term for other parties’ press releases, and as expected once more we find positive coefficients in all instances. This finding clearly supports H3A: there is indeed a spillover effect from other parties, implying that the more other parties emphasize an issue, a given party will also be covered in the news on this issue – even though it did not publish press releases on the issue. One might also note that the coefficients are significant in three out of the four cases when looking at parties with coalition potential (Social Democrats, Social Liberals and Liberals), but none when looking at blackmailing parties, which corroborates the assumption that journalists pay more attention to more relevant parties (H2B).</p>
<p>Finally, we hypothesized a negative interaction effect between parties’ own press releases and other parties’ press releases (H3B). This effect would imply that the effects of publishing press releases have the characteristics of a zero-sum game: if everybody shouts, single voices drown. The appropriate interaction term is included in the third model in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1354068810380097">Table 4</xref> (the third column of each party). We find negative signs in all but one instance (significant for Social Democrats, Social Liberals and Conservatives). The one exception is the Prime Minister’s party (the Liberals), which does not fit into this general picture. Here, we find a positive coefficient possibly reflecting the especially exposed position of this party.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1354068810380097">Figure 2</xref>
 illustrates the negative interaction effect between the party’s own press releases and other parties’ releases for the Social Democrats. Of course, the results differ for the other parties, but in general they show a similar pattern. The graph shows the positive effect of other parties’ press releases when the party itself does not issue any releases on the issue under consideration: the more press releases, the larger the intercept in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1354068810380097">Figure 2</xref> – when other parties do not issue any press release on the issue either, the predicted media attention is close to zero (line with □), while if other parties release a total of six press releases it is close to 2 (line with △). Furthermore, the slope of the various lines indicates the effects of issuing press releases for different levels of other parties’ press releases. When the other parties release no press releases on the issue, each press release results in a 0.69 higher predicted number of media appearances on that issue. For the case where other parties release three press releases, this effect is only 0.32, while for six press releases by other parties, the effect is even negative: –0.05.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>On the aggregated level, our data support <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1354068810380097">Brandenburg’s (2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1354068810380097">2004</xref>) finding that in election times party agendas affect the issue agenda in the news media but not vice versa. The fact that Brandenburg’s and our study investigate both different countries (Germany, Ireland, the UK, Denmark) and different media outlets (press, television) renders this conclusion quite robust. But these findings do not in and of themselves explain why some parties are more successful in influencing the media agenda than other parties.</p>
<p>Therefore, it was asked how to explain that some parties are more successful in appearing on television news on issues they focus on themselves. First, the findings show that the more press releases a party publishes on a specific issue, the more often this party will appear on this issue in the evening television news. This finding seems to hold more for parties with coalition potential than for parties with blackmailing potential only, but the results are mixed. Second, if other parties publish press releases on a specific issue, this, too, raises the chances of being covered on this issue, especially with respect to more relevant parties. Third, the more press releases are published by other parties on a specific issue the less the effect a given party will experience by publishing yet another press release, leading eventually to an overall negative effect of an increased number of press releases.</p>
<p>Obviously, the media are not independent actors acting autonomously but are engaged in an interaction with political actors who are their central sources in election campaign coverage. Inspired by the emerging research focusing on the contingent factors that determine the size of the mass media’s influence on politics and vice versa, we set out to identify factors that condition a party’s success in influencing media coverage: we find that systemic party characteristics indeed make a difference. It does make a difference whether a party has coalition potential rather than having blackmailing potential only. Moreover, it even seems to make a difference which party is the larger coalition member.</p>
<p>These findings have major implications for democracy in broader terms as well as how parties can set the media agenda. First, it raises the important question of how inclusive media coverage can and should be. If more relevant parties have more success with influencing the media agenda and hence influence the public agenda in their favoured direction we might be observing a self-sustaining circle – because you are relevant you have influence and because you have influence you are relevant.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1354068810380097">5</xref>
</sup> Depending on which ideal of democracy one adheres to, such a dynamic can be seen as problematic as it potentially disfavours new, emerging political voices (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1354068810380097">Strömbäck, 2005</xref>). Second, the findings help us to understand by which dynamics the media agenda is shaped and whose agenda the public effectively is following when influenced by media coverage. During election periods, the media indeed appear to be receptive to the issue attention of the parties rather than setting the agenda for the parties. From a practical perspective, party strategists can take advantage of this fact. Moreover, our results indicate that if too many parties publish press releases on the same issue, publishing yet another press release does not help gain media attention; party resources can be used elsewhere.</p>
<p>We expect our empirical conclusions to hold true in other multiparty systems with similar patterns of party competition: first, there is no reason to assume that journalists in general use press releases much differently in other countries: it is not just Danish journalists who work under considerable time and resource pressure (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1354068810380097">Neveu, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1354068810380097">Plasser, 2005</xref>). Likewise, journalists in many other countries are, as mentioned above, concerned with objectivity, political neutrality and hence aim at balancing their news reports (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1354068810380097">Donsbach and Klett, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1354068810380097">Splichal and Sparks, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>Notwithstanding, the study in hand has limitations: first, we studied news coverage of an election campaign. Recent research shows that campaign news is more balanced than routine news (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1354068810380097">van Aelst and de Swert, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1354068810380097">Walgrave and van Aelst, 2006</xref>), which might affect the possibility for parties to manipulate the media agenda in a negative direction for incumbents and a positive direction for other parties. Second, to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the press–politics nexus, future studies might look at second-level agenda-setting and the parties’ ability to influence not only issues in the media but also the framing of these issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1354068810380097">Strömbäck and Nord, 2006</xref>). Next, from our study, one cannot infer that, for example, the Danish People’s Party in general was less successful in being covered on self-sponsored issues, only that this was the case with respect to the party’s press releases. Hence, future studies should try to account for the fact that the media–party relationship also involves other communication channels than press releases. Finally, future studies should also try to account for exogenous factors such as ‘real-world events’: one could argue that simultaneous issue attention by parties is not caused by their strategic reactions to one another, but by a third factor or ‘external shocks’ such as developments outside the political sphere, for example, the publication of new unemployment figures or an incident in a war. Nevertheless, from the journalists’ point of view, this does not change much, as press releases, for whatever reason published, still signal that parties want to speak on specific issues and therefore suggest themselves to the media as interviewees.</p>
<p>In sum, we have shown that, during election times, parties have a substantial effect on the media agenda, but also why some parties appear to be more successful than others in setting the media agenda. The next steps are to compare our results with those of other countries across time and to include more detailed information on party communication and media content.</p>

This finding is in line with previous research on Danish television broadcasters concluding that the coverage is similar at both stations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1354068810380097">Hopmann et al., 2010</xref>).</p>

<p>Similarly, it could be suggested that parties have more success with publishing press releases on issues which they hold ownership. Following findings from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1354068810380097">Hayes (2008)</xref> for several US presidential election campaigns, journalists are more sceptical towards parties when they trespass on other parties’ issues. For each party included in our analysis, we selected the issue to which they devoted most attention in their party manifestos and assessed whether the effects of press releases were larger for that issue. Although we find that parties are more covered on issues they own, there is no interaction effect between issue-ownership and success with influencing news coverage with press releases on owned issues. Apparently, the issue-ownership logic does not influence journalists in their decisions about what to cover, as it is argued to influence voters, at least in a multiparty context as Denmark, in which issue-ownership can be considered to be more divided and diffuse.</p>
