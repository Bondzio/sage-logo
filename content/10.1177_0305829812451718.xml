<p>Tarak Barkawi has recently enjoined International Relations and security studies scholars to embark upon a critical study of the phenomenon of war. There is much to agree with in his argument and the idea of ‘critical war studies’ seems particularly apposite in a world where war and other forms of organised or dispersed violence have become increasingly constitutive of daily life. However, the turn to ‘critical war studies’ works by silencing disagreements and homogenising the heterogeneity of critical security studies. Instead, I propose a dialogue that brings to the fore the political stakes of a critique of war, security and violence. Not only have security and war been entwined in complex ways, but I argue that they need to be analysed within a continuum of violence that includes insurrections, revolts, revolutions, insurgencies, rebellions, seditions, disobediences, riots and uprisings.</p>

<p>Tarak Barkawi has recently enjoined International Relations (IR) and security studies scholars to embark upon a critical study of the phenomenon of war. This means, in Barkawi’s view, analysing war per se and its effects along several dimensions. There is much to agree with in his argument and the idea of ‘critical war studies’ seems particularly apposite in a world where war and other forms of organised or dispersed violence have become increasingly constitutive of daily life. However, the way critical war studies are located in opposition to critical security studies ends by reproducing old hierarchies between military and non-military interests, state and non-state actors, and reifies war as the ‘father and king of all things’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0305829812451718">1</xref></sup> Barkawi admonishes critical security studies for participating ‘in the dissociation of war from security, a dissociation that assists liberal societies and their leaderships in imagining that war is not, and has not been, central to the formation, course and character of Western states and societies – and much else – in world politics’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0305829812451718">2</xref></sup> Thus, critical security studies not only become complicit with liberal imaginaries about war and peace, but they appear woefully inadequate to tackle the ‘proper’ study of war:
<disp-quote>
<p>In sharp contrast to the civilian strategists who dominated the national security debate during the Cold War, securitisation theory has helped to spawn a generation of security studies specialists many of whom know little about weapons systems or military operations. With minors in the philosophy of inquiry, they focus on topics like culture and identity, the environment and immigration, human trafficking and gender.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0305829812451718">3</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>By fostering generations of students unprepared for dealing with the ‘hard’ issues of weapons systems and military operation, securitisation theory and critical security studies stand accused of being unable to deal with war. Both practically and theoretically, securitisation ‘decisively breaks the link between security and war’ by a ‘beguiling and apparently irresistible combination of the objectivism of positivism with the relativism of constructivism’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0305829812451718">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, the critical security scholars who lack the knowledge of the civilian strategists remain unmentioned. Nor are their arguments explored in any further detail. The making invisible of critical security scholars who bear the brunt of the critique is coupled with a process of homogenisation of critical security studies. Yet, one of the most exciting things about critical security studies is that it is a heterogeneous field, traversed by contestations and debates about the logic of security, its practices, meanings and political effects.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0305829812451718">5</xref></sup> My criticism is not simply that the representation of critical security studies effaces heterogeneity. Rather, I would like to argue that what happens in this move is a different erasure: that of the relation between politics and violence, with war and security being two of its most visible instantiations.</p>
<p>Thus, I would like to suggest that a double move is needed. On the one hand, critical security studies can offer important insights for a critical analysis of war. However, this cannot be a pared-down version of critical security studies, equated either with securitisation theory or a vague ‘constructivist security studies’. Understood as a site of disagreements, critical security studies could be mobilised productively for a debate on a critical study of war as well as a critique of war. On the other hand, a process of ‘de-bordering’ is needed, which implies attention to criticality and violence. Analysing a continuum of violence that incorporates security and war alongside insurrections, revolts, revolutions, insurgencies, rebellions, seditions, disobediences, riots and uprisings affords a relocation of discussions within broader critical debates about politics and violence. To this end, the rejoinder proceeds in two steps. It starts with a discussion of critical security studies and its contributions. In a second step, rather than leaving the discussion of linkages between security and war to security studies and war studies, it offers a suggestion for engagement with common problematisations of critique and violence.</p>
<sec id="section1-0305829812451718">
<title>Critical Security Studies: One or Many?</title>
<p>Barkawi’s rendition of critical security studies as a homogeneous field emerges through a technique of ambiguous equivalences. Critical security studies are at times the wideners, at times securitisation theory or even constructivist security studies. In the development of the argument, all these become equivalent, while feminist and poststructuralist security studies for instance disappear from the critical purview.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0305829812451718">6</xref></sup> This move effaces the heterogeneity of critical security studies, their productive disagreements, and simultaneously forecloses an important contribution, in my view, about the relation between security and politics. This is not to make an argument, as David Mutimer puts it, about whose ‘critique is bigger’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0305829812451718">7</xref></sup> but to point out that the developments of critical security studies were made possible by a whole series of disagreements. Disagreement, contestation and heterogeneity have been constitutive of critical security studies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0305829812451718">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>For instance, critical security studies have been traversed by a series of debates about the constitutive role of security, which problematise the relation between security and war in particular ways. Rather than equivalent to a demand for broadening, critical security scholars have questioned the criticality of this move. Jef Huysmans remarked that the all-pervasive talk of security – human security, societal security, environmental security, military security, individual security, global security – had not been matched by an in-depth exploration of security as an organising concept that constitutes a field of knowledge, practices and technologies through which certain events are rendered intelligible and governable as security issues.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0305829812451718">9</xref></sup> For Krause and Williams too, broadening risked turning security into a ‘grab bag of different issue areas’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0305829812451718">10</xref></sup> In contradistinction to a widening move, security was conceptualised as a specific way of problematising social issues.</p>
<p>In drawing attention to security as a specific problematisation, critical security studies have sparked debates about the logic of security and the political effects of security discourse and practice. For securitisation theory, the logic of security emerges through the social and political processes of naming something as security and responding to the threat it poses. For feminist and poststructuralist security studies, security is both constituted and constitutive, a performance, regime of practice or dispositif that needs to be investigated in its concrete manifestations. For sociologically inspired approaches, security requires a Bourdieuian-inspired analysis of fields and logics of security professionals.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0305829812451718">11</xref></sup> The aspect of discursive constitution is surprisingly absent from Barkawi’s discussion of war. The choices of war that he offers by way of illustration (such as World War II) eschew the problem of naming, of what counts as war and what not or how naming a conflict as war carries political effects.</p>
<p>Securitisation theory, for instance, makes this work of discursive constitution visible in particular ways, which connect war and security. Issues are securitised by virtue of discursive construction or, in the formulation of Buzan, Waever and de Wilde, ‘[s]ecurity is a quality actors inject into issues by securitising them, which means to stage them on the political arena and then to have them accepted by a sufficient audience to sanction extraordinary defensive moves’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0305829812451718">12</xref></sup> This definition draws attention to the importance of language, and naming (and one could add knowledge in a more sociological vein), to the understanding of both war and security. As Étienne Balibar has aptly put it, any analysis of war needs to get to grips with the ‘complex relationship between the performative act of declaring war and the retroactive qualification which gives a war its proper name, thus (partially at least) defining its meaning (not always forever)’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0305829812451718">13</xref></sup> It is significant for such discussion how wars are included in particular legal and political taxonomies through the exclusion of other forms of violence and insecurity. It is also significant how some wars are never named as such, their violence disavowed as constitutive of community: insurrections and revolutions are perhaps two of these disavowed cases. Naming violence in particular ways can reproduce dominant understandings of the political community, power relations and gendered subjectivities. As Laleh Khalili mentions in relation to Stathis Kalyvas’s often invoked analysis of civil wars:
<disp-quote>
<p>In order to emphasize the ‘civil war’ element [the Greek state’s suppression of the Communist insurgency in the 1940s], Kalyvas neglects to mention that the US provided Greece with $467 million in military aid, a ‘flood of arms and Equipment’ and a corps of military advisers under the auspices of the Truman Doctrine.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0305829812451718">14</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Naming this violence as civil war obscures the relations of power and international inequalities that are constitutive of violence and not simply constituted by it. Similar arguments have been made by critical scholars regarding migration, human trafficking or terrorism. In Bigo’s view, ‘The relation between migration and security is fully and immediately political. The wording is never innocent’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0305829812451718">15</xref></sup> Aradau and van Munster have also argued that expert knowledge – of crisis, disaster, risk, contingency or emergency – is mobilised and deployed to render the ‘next terrorist attack’ thinkable and actionable.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0305829812451718">16</xref></sup> The ‘war on terror’ is thus inseparable from the modes of knowledge that make it imaginable and manageable. War and security are both constituted through and constitutive of modes of knowledge, power relations and political subjectivities</p>
<p>War can also not be disentangled from security, when security is understood as a discursive practice by means of which an actor presents an issue as an existential threat that justifies extraordinary measures to neutralise that threat. While the functional realm of threat management coexists with other domains of social life, securitisation theory distinguishes security from other ways of dealing with issues because of its intense relationship to an issue, which elevates it above politics and everyday haggling. The speech act of security simultaneously opens up and limits the agenda of security. Speech acts can make a whole array of issues into security issues. At the same time, the securitisation of social issues is limited by both the efficacy of security claims (depending on the social position of actors and on the events and situations which these actors mobilise) and by the logic of security, which is modelled upon that of war. Not all claims are security claims – rather, securitisation is limited by the logic of war and its associated concepts of existential threat, survival and defence. In this approach to security, security and war are mutually constitutive. Rather than purely separate objects of governance and inquiry, security and war appear in a much more perfidious entanglement. This understanding of security bears a significant (and problematic) intellectual similarity to Schmitt’s rendering of the political as the exceptional decision that constitutes the border between friend and enemy and is best captured by the metaphor of ‘war’. For, although war need not be actually present between friends and enemies, ‘the ever present possibility of combat’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0305829812451718">17</xref></sup> grounds the domain of the political and constitutes the authentic self-delineation of a political community.</p>
<p>War has also been inseparable from security in the effects that contemporary regimes of practice entail. War and security become increasingly blurred in analyses of the surveillance, risk profiling, data collection, biometrics, visa and other practices of threat management. Several scholars have placed these developments within the broader frame of biopolitics and have analysed how security practices go beyond the territorial and geopolitical dominant understanding of national security.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0305829812451718">18</xref></sup> Security functions in ways that complexify and disturb the state’s taken-for-granted ‘right to kill’, as it becomes defined around the welfare of populations (with its underside – the elimination or containment of those who impede or disturb its welfare) and risky conduct. Yet, independent of where we place the temporal line of transformation – whether in 18th-century capitalist development or in the more recent globalisation of war – these literatures draw attention to the imbrication of security practices and everydayness. If indeed we live ‘in a world in which everything from passenger air travel to religion is fundamentally informed by war’, then the extension and dispersion of war in to ordinary, everyday life, and the intensification of surveillance and of social practices of monitoring, need to be investigated as social and political processes that are inseparable from war.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0305829812451718">19</xref></sup> As regimes of practice are simultaneously increasingly global and increasingly dispersed, taken-for-granted distinctions find themselves challenged, as Vivienne Jabri has noted:
<disp-quote>
<p>As the global becomes the terrain of confrontation, the inside/outside distinction disappears and with it a number of other certainties that we have come to associate with modern subjectivity and modern reason, namely the sovereign state, citizenship, the public/private divide, the secular nation as the primary mode of affiliation, the distinction between war and criminality, war and security.… The global aspect of late modern war is no longer simply international, but connects the proximate and the distant, the familiar and the foreign where the global terrain of confrontation reaches the everyday and the routine.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0305829812451718">20</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In the face of this extension and dispersion of war, and the increasing indistinguishability of war and security, war and risk, war and peace, war and disaster, war and crime – the question to be posed is not only what a critical study of war could be but also what a critique of war could be, particularly when peace has been increasingly incorporated within liberal projects of governance.</p>
<p>Critical studies of security have shown the political effects that practices of security entail: security as reproducing the logic of ‘political realism’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0305829812451718">21</xref></sup> security as the other of democracy,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0305829812451718">22</xref></sup> security as power and domination,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0305829812451718">23</xref></sup> security as inherently gendered and violent,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0305829812451718">24</xref></sup> security as a fetish.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0305829812451718">25</xref></sup> As generative of modern political subjectivity, security presupposes trust and identity between members of a community, while it relegates indeterminacy, fear and anarchy to an imaginary locus outside of the social order. This critical focus on the political effects of security has then led to many calls for abandoning the vocabulary of security, being anti- or counter-security, unmaking security, dismantling security, desecuritisation, emancipation and so on.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0305829812451718">26</xref></sup> Critical analyses of security have thus opened a space for the contestation of dominant knowledge and practice. This raises an interesting question about whether critical studies of war can be restricted to an analysis of the war’s generative effects, without inventing a political vocabulary of resistance to war. While devising such a vocabulary would require a different project, the rich vocabulary that critical security studies have already experimented with can be helpful to both map disagreements and start a discussion of common problematisations.</p>

<title>Critique and Violence</title>
<p>This section proposes two common problematisations for critical approaches to war and security: the first one focuses on the role of critique and the second on the concept of violence. One of the strongest challenges that Barkawi raises against securitisation theory, drawing to some extent on Didier Bigo’s work, is that ‘it uncritically reflects the security politics of liberal democracies’ and ‘participates in this defensive liberal politics of war by obfuscating the possibility of <italic>aggression</italic>, or what are sometimes called wars of choice’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0305829812451718">27</xref></sup> Bigo is indeed critical of the Copenhagen School as their ‘critical vision of security … introduces into the academic field military discourse on societal and internal security’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0305829812451718">28</xref></sup> What is at stake here for both Barkawi and Bigo is the function of critique.</p>
<p>The relation between critique and security plays out differently in critical security studies, depending on the understanding of politics underpinning it. Bigo has raised the question of the inefficacy of critical discourses against the securitisation of migration, asking ‘why the production of academic and alternative discourses has so little effect in either the political arena or in daily life’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0305829812451718">29</xref></sup> implicitly raising the question of the role that critical discourses can play. It seems to me that the political problem here is that of (re-)description. In re-describing security discourses, Buzan et al. run the risk of reinforcing the rationale of security rather than offering a critique. The Bourdieuian-inspired answer to this dilemma is, for Bigo, that of the ‘struggle within the field of power’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0305829812451718">30</xref></sup> which places hopes of social change in the complexity of the social field or rather in the interaction between different fields. This does not mean that securitisation theory is unaware of the perils of (re-)description: it can indeed be read as opposing those perils through a politics of publics, audiences and public spheres.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0305829812451718">31</xref></sup> Ultimately, struggles are not excluded, only their location is different. Securitisation takes place in the discursive interaction between elites and masses, within a communicative space where the elites need to convince the masses about their security claims. Within this communicative space, there can be other discourses that would compete for the (re-)description of security. The question to confront concerns the success of different speech acts; Bourdieu’s social capital and struggles among professionals return by stealth.</p>
<p>Those constructed as dangerous, as abject, are missing from both theorisations, their actions rendered by and large immaterial to the continued reproduction or change of fields or political processes of securitisation. A field where structural positions are occupied by security professionals has no space for those constructed as dangerous. Although they understand how security functions, they would not have access to the field of security professionals and would not even be recognised as ‘amateurs’. How would the dominated enter a field to enact change given that their actions are limited by the volume of capital to be placed on the symbolic market?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0305829812451718">32</xref></sup> The public space of communication is also limitative to incursions by those deemed dangerous except as referent objects of securitisation rather than agential beings.</p>
<p>Feminist and poststructuralist voices in critical security studies have offered a different understanding of critique, located in the dissensual and dissonant discourses and practices of the abject, dangerous or those silenced by security discourses.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0305829812451718">33</xref></sup> They have listened to these voices and practices and explored the silences, dominations but also resistances that practices of security entail. Yet another critique has seen security as not just a political process that is constitutive of gendered subjectivities and states, but a process that changes (liberal) politics. It is in this sense that one can understand the critique of the security promise in liberal politics by exposing the role that ‘authoritarian rule has always played in the government of states that declare themselves to be committed to the maintenance and defense of individual liberty’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0305829812451718">34</xref></sup> These critical approaches are also not without challenges and problems of their own. It is not my purpose here to propose a conclusive argument about critique but to sketch out, in the limits of space, some of the tensions and commonalities around the question of critique.</p>
<p>As a second move, the problematisation of violence could offer a productive springboard for a debate about critical studies of security and war. Violence is often invoked as that which is implicated in the liberal politics of security, war and peace. At the same time, the historical developments of war studies and security studies have led to particular erasures of the problematisation of violence in peace studies, for instance.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0305829812451718">35</xref></sup> This is not to say that violence has not been problematised and investigated in IR.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0305829812451718">36</xref></sup> However, violence as a concept that is intimately related to security, war and the possibility of critique has received less attention. Claire Thomas has also recently noted the absence of the language of violence in traditional IR, due to the supposed ‘illegitimacy of violence’, and has proposed to introduce a ‘narrow’ definition of violence to recognise the harm done to individuals.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0305829812451718">37</xref></sup> Although Thomas’s proposal runs into a series of problems as it rejects both notions of structural violence as proposed by peace research (thus effecting an erasure of the Marxist legacy of thinking violence and politics) and metaphorical uses of violence in everyday language, it makes the important point that we need to rethink violence in international relations.</p>
<p>My contention is that the concept of violence allows for a more complex conceptualisation of security, war and politics. In this, I draw upon feminist work that has inserted violence in discussions of peace, war and security. Laura Shepherd has drawn attention to the need to theorise security in relation to violence.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0305829812451718">38</xref></sup> Cynthia Cockburn has spoken about a gendered continuum of violence running through the social, political and economic.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0305829812451718">39</xref></sup> Inserting the concept of violence within critical security studies has a ‘de-bordering’ effect as it reinserts the debates into the tradition of critical theory and rebuilds the link with peace research. Placing violence at the heart of debates about war also avoids the euphemistic ‘war fighting’. Moreover, violence places both war and security in a continuum of insurrections, revolts, revolutions, insurgencies, rebellions, seditions, disobediences, riots and uprisings as all worthy of attention and critical analysis. This avoids the reification of war. Interestingly, at the end of the Cold War, Fred Halliday noted the marginal referencing and theorisation of revolutions in IR in comparison with the quasi-ubiquity of war.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0305829812451718">40</xref></sup> If the same observation could be made today, the ‘continuum of violence’ has the potential to undo this erasure in three ways.</p>
<p>First, violence can constitute a common problematisation that does not hierarchise the continuum and cannot be easily disciplined and disciplinarised. This is not a claim for ‘critical violence studies’, but a suggestion of opening critical analysis to a continuum of violence and counter-violence which includes a multitude of social and political processes closely linked with war and security. Too often violence fades against the primacy of war, force and security.</p>
<p>Second, the concept of violence requires attention to other languages and processes made invisible or less visible by security and war. Rather than focusing on wars per se, the problematisation of violence understands war relationally as both dependent on and constituted itself through the ‘inclusive exclusion’ of a whole series of other forms of violence. Violence also brings to the fore one of the problems that alternative languages of peace and desecuritisation have failed to tackle: that of the relation between resistance and violence.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0305829812451718">41</xref></sup> Jef Huysmans has recently argued that security needs to be increasingly understood as a process of dispersion, requiring the analyst to turn a critical eye to the mundane, the everyday, the detailed, that which might escape dominant discourses or practices.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0305829812451718">42</xref></sup> These changes in practices of security and war necessitate new languages that comprise similarly dispersed violence.</p>
<p>Finally, the common problematisation of violence also opens up the possibility of disentangling politics and war, politics and security. ‘Politics as war’ negates the liberal relegation of war outside politics at the expense of a ‘preventive counter-violence’ against social struggles.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0305829812451718">43</xref></sup> It also negates the supposedly peaceful liberal politics of negotiation and discussion with a view to achieving consensus, as it shows that civil peace is underpinned by warring forms of power. The state organises another form of violence, the violence necessary to maintain or re-establish an order threatened by destruction or subversion. The entire organisation of the state can therefore be understood ‘as a system of preventive defence against the mass movements that form the basis of civil wars (of classes and of religions) and of revolutions’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0305829812451718">44</xref></sup> The problematisation of violence introduces this secondary violence in response to the primary violence of war, while challenging and attempting to displace these hierarchies. Violence also frames the relation to politics in different ways. Balibar has coined the terminology of counter-violence, non-violence and anti-violence to render different modalities of political engagement with violence.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0305829812451718">45</xref></sup> This vocabulary of violence, counter-violence, anti-violence and non-violence is one proposal that can avoid taken for granted distinctions between politics and war without collapsing the two into each other.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This rejoinder has argued that critical security studies can be an ally rather than a foe in debates about critical studies of war. Disagreements and contestations cannot be based, however, upon a pared-down and univocal version of critical security studies. Debates about discourse and regimes of practices, about knowledge, subjectivity and political effects, can bridge rather than fracture critical analysis. At the same time, a field of common problematisation could be created around the function of critique and the concept of violence. Security and war can be analysed within a continuum of violence that does not reify war but understands it in relation to other forms of violence: insurrections, revolts, revolutions, insurgencies, rebellions, seditions, disobediences, riots and uprisings. In so doing, the concept of violence raises a question about how to understand and critique these processes, linkages and continuities/discontinuities. At the same time, it reconnects critical approaches to security and war with critical theorising about violence and politics.</p>

<title>Author Biography</title>
<p><bold>Claudia Aradau</bold> is Senior Lecturer in International Relations in the Department of War Studies, King’s College London, UK. Her research interrogates the effects of security practices for political subjectivity and emancipation. Most recently, her work has focused on the role of anticipatory knowledge in governing catastrophes to come, materialities of (in)security and critical methods in security studies. She is the author of <italic>Rethinking Trafficking in Women: Politics out of Security</italic> (Palgrave, 2008) and co-author, with Rens van Munster, of <italic>Politics of Catastrophe: Genealogies of the Unknown</italic> (Routledge, 2011).</p>

<p>Ibid., 703. I use ‘critical security studies’ as an encompassing terminology to approaches that question the object of security, its effects on social and political relations, and the assumptions that underpin it.</p>

<p>See, for instance, the C.A.S.E. collective, ‘Critical Approaches to Security in Europe. A Networked Manifesto’, <italic>Security Dialogue</italic> 37, no. 4 (2006): 443–87 and the responses by Christine Sylvester, Mark Salter and Rob Walker in <italic>Security Dialogue</italic> 38, no. 4 (2007) that challenge the delimitations and limits of critical security studies. It is perhaps not negligible for the strength of debates and disagreements in critical security studies that it had become impossible for the C.A.S.E. collective to continue writing collectively when questions of politics and security were tackled, bringing out unbridgeable differences between the different approaches and concepts of politics.
