<abstract>
<p>Fingolimod-related bradycardia is usually asymptomatic, reaches its nadir within 6 hours post-dose and recovers spontaneously. Here we report the case of a 30-year-old MS patient with vagotonia who developed symptomatic bradycardia with 33 beats per minute at nadir 39 hours after a single dose of fingolimod. Bradycardia was responsive to atropine, but returned within 2 hours. Overall, it took a week until the patient recovered. Extended monitoring is advised in patients with symptomatic bradycardia.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>Fingolimod is an oral sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor (S1PR) modulator that reduces relapses and disability progression in relapsing–remitting MS. The first dose is associated with a mean and mostly asymptomatic decrease in heart rate (HR) of 8 beats per minute (bpm) at nadir 4–5 hours post-dose. Therefore, a 6-hour observation period is advised at treatment initiation. With continued dosing, possibly due to receptor desensitization, HR returns to baseline within 1 month.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458512447596">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458512447596">2</xref></sup> Sometimes, transient slowing of atrioventricular (AV) conduction can be observed. Cardiac effects are thought to result from activation of G-protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels mediated by S1P<sub>1</sub> on atrial myocytes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1352458512447596">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Here we report a MS patient with vagotonia who developed a significant and symptomatic reduction of HR with 33 bpm at nadir 39 hours post-dose that slowly recovered within 1 week.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458512447596">2</xref></sup></p>

<title>Case report</title>
<p>Fingolimod was started in a 30-year-old MS patient following two relapses and contrast-enhancing lesions on MRI imaging. Preceding immunomodulatory treatments included subcutaneous interferon beta-1a and glatiramer acetate. Apart from vagotonia, no individual risk factors could be identified. No concomitant medication was applied. Family history revealed coronary heart disease with stenting in the patient’s mother and grandfather. Both the patient’s father and brother are free of cardiovascular diseases. Of note, the patient’s younger brother had been diagnosed with MS, too. A profound cardiovascular exam was performed at the patient’s request, because he was worried about cardiovascular side effects of fingolimod in view of his family history: 5 weeks prior to treatment, blood pressure was 110/70 mmHg and HR was 74 bpm. An incomplete right bundle branch block was apparent on the ECG. No pathologic changes were detected on Holter monitoring. An echocardiogram did not reveal any abnormalities apart from a clinically insignificant mitral valve prolapse. Response to exercise stress testing was normal. The cardiologist agreed with starting fingolimod. At treatment initiation, baseline HR was 72 bpm. During the 6-hour observation period, HR dropped to 40 bpm. Three hours after having left our outpatient department, the patient complained of bradycardia in conjunction with dizziness. At the emergency department, HR dropped to 33 bpm at nadir 39 hours after having taken fingolimod (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1352458512447596">Figure 1</xref>). Neither arrhythmia nor slowing of AV conduction could be detected. HR immediately recovered to 70 bpm after infusion of atropine, but dropped again within 2 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1352458512447596">Figure 1</xref>). No second dose of fingolimod was applied. HR remained responsive to external stimuli. On day 8, HR had recovered to baseline and on day 10, the patient reported to be free of dizziness. Blood pressure was stable at any time. After 4 weeks, treatment with natalizumab was started. HR remained within the range prior to treatment with fingolimod on repeated measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1352458512447596">Figure 1</xref>). Three months later, the cardiologist confirmed that the patient had fully recovered.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Following a single dose of fingolimod, our patient developed symptomatic bradycardia that was remarkably pronounced and sustained: While the onset of bradycardia 2 hours after the first dose was within the expected range, a HR reduction by more than 50% from 72 bpm pre-dose to 33 bpm at nadir has not been described before: pooled data from FREEDOMS and TRANSFORMS revealed a mean HR decline by just 8 bpm at nadir in the fingolimod 0.5 mg group.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458512447596">4</xref></sup> Unlike our patient, most cases of bradycardia were asymptomatic. In the fingolimod 0.5 mg group of both phase III trials, a total of 4 cases of symptomatic bradycardia all recovered within 24 hours.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458512447596">4</xref></sup> No decline in HR had been observed beyond 24 hours in renal transplant patients having received just one dose of fingolimod.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1352458512447596">5</xref></sup> By contrast, in our patient, nadir in HR decrease was reached 39 hours after a single dose of fingolimod. It took more than a week until dizziness disappeared and HR returned to baseline. Until now, a 6-hour monitoring period was considered sufficiently safe. Our observation and the recent series of several unexplained deaths after treatment initiation stress the importance of an extended monitoring period once any clinically relevant heart problem has occurred.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1352458512447596">6</xref></sup> Moreover, a lethal case of ventricular arrhythmia and a 7.5 second period of asystole have recently been described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1352458512447596">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1352458512447596">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>In our patient, common causes of bradycardia such as thyroid dysfunction, the use of concomitant medication and a sick sinus syndrome could be excluded. AV conduction was unaffected. Of note, bradycardia can occur independently of conduction disturbances as fingolimod directly affects pacemaker activity in sino-atrial node cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1352458512447596">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Regular endurance training, low blood pressure and early repolarization on repeated ECGs support a state of vagotonia in our patient. Following a profound exam, his cardiologist did not object to treatment with fingolimod. In renal transplant patients treated with fingolimod, an increased frequency of bradycardia was observed in patients with borderline bradycardia at baseline.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1352458512447596">5</xref></sup> For MS patients, clinical data from the phase III trials is absent since patients with a resting HR of &lt;55bpm were excluded.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458512447596">4</xref></sup> In a small study presented at the 64th AAN Annual Meeting in 2012, however, symptomatic bradycardia was only seen in patients with sinus bradycardia on screening ECG.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1352458512447596">10</xref></sup> In a 4-month, open-label study on cardiac safety that will soon be published in full detail, no case of symptomatic bradycardia comparable to our patient has been observed (Novartis, personal communication). A synergistic effect of fingolimod and augmented acetylcholine release during vagotonia on bradycardia is conceivable as GIRK channels in atrial myocytes are both activated by sphingosine 1-phosphate and muscarinic receptors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1352458512447596">3</xref></sup> This might have contributed to the extensive HR reduction in our patient.</p>
<p>The prolonged state of bradycardia may at least in part be explained by impaired receptor desensitization as fingolimod was stopped after the first dose.</p>
<p>In accordance with a study on healthy subjects, our patient was immediately responsive to atropine, but the counteracting effect was short-lived.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1352458512447596">11</xref></sup> In cases of sustained and symptomatic bradycardia, atropine may therefore need to be applied repeatedly. Of note, despite significant and sustained bradycardia, responses to external stimuli remained unaffected. HR increase in response to exercise was normal in healthy volunteers treated with fingolimod.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1352458512447596">12</xref></sup> Both the regular responses to atropine and to external stimuli argue against a sick sinus syndrome in our patient. As reconfirmed by our patient’s cardiologist, all cardiovascular symptoms were fully reversible. In summary, our case illustrates that clinically relevant bradycardia can occur and persist far beyond the currently applied 6-hour observation period. Patients with vagotonia may be at greater risk developing symptomatic and prolonged bradycardia.</p>
