<abstract>
<p>The idea of reducing public punitiveness through providing information and encouraging deliberation has attracted considerable interest. However, there remains no solid evidence of durable changes in attitude. The study presented here provides a test of the hypothesis that information combined with deliberation can affect general measures of punitiveness, confidence in the courts and acceptance of alternatives to imprisonment (the three dependent variables). The study involved a pre-test, post-test experimental design. Participants were randomly allocated to either an intervention group or a control condition. Statistically significant changes in the dependent variables were observed immediately following the intervention but these changes were not sustained when measured at follow-up nine months later. Further, at the time of the follow-up the differences between the control group scores and the intervention group scores were not significantly different. The observed changes immediately following the intervention are seen to be a function of the changed relationship of the respondent to the task. The implications of the results for integrating public perspectives into policy are discussed. It is argued that rather than a focus on public education, a more productive direction is to focus on the way the public is engaged on matters concerning punishment.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1462474511434430" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Policies on crime and justice are often limited by policy makers’ perceptions of public opinion. This has led to efforts not only to provide accurate measures of public opinion but also to examine what the public might approve of when properly informed. Support for the prospect that informed public opinion may be more tolerant and open to alternatives to imprisonment comes from the findings of studies that date back to the pioneering work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1462474511434430">Doob and Roberts (1983)</xref> in Canada. Findings from the deliberative poll undertaken in Manchester in 1994 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1462474511434430">Fishkin, 1996</xref>) added support to the argument that the public is less punitive when more informed. Some criminologists (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1462474511434430">Green, 2006</xref>) have argued that the use of deliberative polls could provide for a major shift in the direction of penal policy. In England and Wales the Home Office has sponsored a series of studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1462474511434430">Chapman et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1462474511434430">Mirrlees-Black, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1462474511434430">Salisbury, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1462474511434430">Singer and Cooper, 2008</xref>) in the hope that providing information and encouraging deliberation may provide a remedy to falling levels of public confidence in the courts.</p>
<p>However, questions remain as to the reliability and durability of effects observed as a result of these efforts. In general what has been developed so far is on a very small scale and there are questions as to whether the findings from small experimental samples would generalize to a fair sample of the public. There is also the central question of whether any observed changes can be attributed to those aspects of the interventions that are purported to produce the change.</p>
<p>The current study is designed to address these methodological issues and provide a sound test of the proposition that information combined with deliberation can make a difference to punishment attitudes. We begin with a brief overview on what has been attempted in regard to influencing attitudes towards punishment through the provision of information and start this discussion with some background on the key issue of ‘informed public opinion’.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-1462474511434430"><title>Informed public opinion</title>
<p>Superficial opinion polls by their nature either assume that respondents have all the necessary information to be able to answer the question or the questioner is not interested in attitudes that depend on information. Broad questions posed in a simplistic way bring to mind stereotypes and tap into assumptions that may be neither relevant nor accurate. It perhaps should be of little surprise that shifts in ‘top of the head’ opinions or preferences are easy to demonstrate. In various experiments on public sentencing preferences it has consistently been shown that when given sufficient relevant information and asked to consider alternative scenarios, the expressed opinion regarding the desired quantum of punishment for certain crimes changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1462474511434430">Doob, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1462474511434430">Doob and Roberts, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1462474511434430">Indermaur, 1987</xref>).</p>
<p>Doble and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1462474511434430">Doble and Klein, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1462474511434430">Doble et al., 1991</xref>) found that respondents’ expressed sentencing preference could be changed simply by providing information about the full range of sentencing options available. It appeared that respondents often chose imprisonment as their preferred sentencing option because they were unaware of what other options were available. However, it is also possible that respondents in these experiments chose imprisonment less often because it was now only one of many options available – in other words, the change was simply a result of the change in the context of the choice. Such experiments have led to the oft cited conclusion that public attitudes on crime and justice are ‘malleable’ or ‘mushy’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1462474511434430">Cullen et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Sociologists from Durkheim to Garland have pointed out how attitudes towards punishment reflect social values and perform an ‘expressive’ function for the individual. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1462474511434430">Tyler and Boeckmann (1997)</xref> found that public support for the three strikes law in California was not primarily based on respondents’ perceptions of the effectiveness of these laws in reducing crime. Rather the best predictor of support for the laws was a scale that reflected personal concerns and values. Tyler and Boeckmann concluded that support for the laws functioned, for the individual respondent, as an expression of support for the symbolic statement these laws were seen as making. This conclusion concurs with the view that punitive laws are not popular because they control crime but because they declare the ascendancy of certain values. Research on death penalty attitudes also supports the view that such attitudes are ‘value-expressive’. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1462474511434430">Vollum et al. (2004: 541)</xref> concluded that the tenacity of Texan support for the death penalty is linked to ‘deeply held beliefs and values’.</p>
<p>Most of the work on changing attitudes may actually be seen as an effort to move the focus from the expression of mood, emotion or values to providing rational assessments. One way to achieve this is to engender responsibility and accountability in respondents by creating the expectation that they will have to explain their ‘decision’ to other people. This comes closer to the inquiry across a number of policy areas into ‘informed public opinion’.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1462474511434430">Price and Neijens (1998)</xref> argue that there are three elements of informed public opinion: information; deliberation; and responsibility taking. The two process variables of deliberation and responsibility concern the relationship of the respondent to the task. Deliberation has been incorporated into a range of methods that have been designed to elicit informed public opinion. These include, ‘planning cells’, ‘deliberative polling’, ‘consensus conferences’, ‘citizen panels’ and ‘citizens’ juries’. Common to all these is the deliberative component where participants are provided with information about the issue being considered, encouraged to discuss and challenge the information and consider each other’s views before making a final decision or recommendation for action. Interestingly, a form of such public engagement has been used in the field of criminal justice for centuries in the form of the jury. This group of citizens is engaged in a particular manner so that they become highly informed and responsible and, as much as possible, they are encouraged to deliberate deeply.</p>
<p>Placing respondents into a position where they need to weigh up competing goals, sensitivities and constraints to arrive at a responsible decision provides a task that invites a considered response. Studies of public attitudes have found this to be a crucial shift that informs and colours the outcome significantly. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1462474511434430">Durham et al. (1996)</xref> found that support for the death penalty decreased substantially when respondents were placed in more of a decision-making role by being presented with a case vignette rather than with a simple ‘do you favour…?’ question. The notion that deliberation is central to informed public opinion emerges in the work of a number of scholars and most notably in the distinction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1462474511434430">Habermas (1989 [1963])</xref> makes between ‘mere opinion’ and ‘public opinion’. In this distinction, what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1462474511434430">Habermas (1989 [1963]</xref>: 219) calls ‘public opinion’ is not the simple collection of individual views (mere opinion) but rather the ‘evolution’ of such individual views as a result of rational critical debate.</p>
<p>One distinct problem for those proposing that more information leads to a fairer measure of public preferences is the charge that the public is simply being persuaded to provide a desired response. Here we do need to accept that information is never ‘just’ information. The simple provision of information communicates to a respondent what is considered relevant in answering a question. The nature of the question itself is vital in giving clues about the kind of response required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1462474511434430">Schwartz, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1462474511434430">2008</xref>). Although access to relevant information can be justified it needs to be relevant to the particular decision. If a posture of responsibility is desired then what is needed is a procedure that carefully signals to the respondent that they are being engaged as a decision-maker and are expected to be concerned with a decision that they are responsible for (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1462474511434430">Barabas, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Although the refinement of the concept of ‘informed public opinion’ helps us understand what is needed for good public judgements it also makes the task of determining the effect of information harder. Only a carefully constructed test can assure us that any observed change in stated policy preferences is a result of the information and not persuasion. This becomes more difficult as we introduce more variables into the mix. It is vital however to establish the evidential base if we are to argue for an information ‘effect’. In the following section we review the evidence for this effect.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec3-1462474511434430"><title>Evidence for the effect of information on punishment attitudes</title>
<p>A number of studies have examined the effect of information on expressed attitude and policy preferences in the field of criminal justice. These range from intensive efforts in England and Wales to the numerous experimental studies in the United States that examine the effect of information on respondents’ attitudes to the death penalty. There are advantages and disadvantages with each approach. Taken together they help illuminate the potential of information to result in changes to punishment attitudes.</p>
<p>The issue of informed public opinion is nowhere more relevant and pressing than in the United States where it pertains to matters of life and death. Public opinion becomes relevant due to the Eighth Amendment of the US constitution which prohibits cruel and unusual punishment. The US Supreme Court brought this issue to the fore in 1972 in the case of <italic>Furman v. Georgia</italic> (408 US 238 (1972)). Rarely has a matter of otherwise academic interest resulted directly in the decision as to whether people live or die. The Court’s decision led to the lifting of death sentences for over 600 prisoners who had been sentenced to death between 1967 and 1972. Justice Thurgood Marshall claimed: ‘it is imperative for constitutional purposes to attempt to discern the probable opinion of an informed electorate’ (<italic>Furman v. Georgia</italic> 1972: 365, fn 145). Marshall thus established the notion that if public opinion is to be used as a basis for policy, and that opinion will be influenced by information, then the only suitable basis for policy is informed public opinion.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly there has been a wealth of research on this topic in the United States following the decision in <italic>Furman v. Georgia</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1462474511434430">Cochran and Champlin (2005)</xref> reviewed 18 published studies over almost three decades. They concluded that there is mixed support for notion that death penalty attitudes are affected by information. The studies reviewed all involved a pre-test measure of attitudes towards capital punishment, exposure to information about capital punishment and a post-test measure of death penalty attitudes. The most common experimental design involved a control group and the most common sample was undergraduate college students. Despite differences in methodology, consistent findings emerge which give confidence as to their reliability. Information, it appears, does have an immediate effect in reducing support for the death penalty. However, when followed up at a later time changed death penalty opinions reverted to their original pre-informed positions. Thus information had an effect on attitude but it was not a durable effect. Although questions remain concerning the generalizability of most of these research studies, as they rely on college students in a college environment, the consistency of findings suggests that information alone is unlikely to produce large and sustained shifts in public attitudes.</p>
<p>In England and Wales the effect of information on attitude has been the subject of intense interest. The most widely known and cited effort concerns one deliberative poll conducted in Manchester in 1994 which remains the only such poll undertaken on attitudes to crime and justice. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1462474511434430">Luskin et al. (2002</xref>: 458–459) describe the basic formula of the deliberative poll:<disp-quote>
<p>Select a national probability sample of the citizen voting age population and question them about some policy domain(s). Send them balanced, accessible briefing materials to help inform them and get them thinking more seriously about the same subject(s). Transport them to a single site, where they can spend several days grappling with the issues, discussing them with one another in randomly assigned moderated small groups putting questions generated by small group discussion to carefully balanced panels of policy experts and political leaders. At the end question the participants again, using the same instruments as at the beginning. Excerpt portions of the proceedings to make a television programme.</p></disp-quote>As suggested in this brief overview of the strategy only one element actually involves exposure to information. The other four key elements which may affect attitude change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1462474511434430">Luskin et al., 2002</xref>: 459) are: anticipation of the event; small group discussions; opportunity to hear and question panels of policy experts and; conversational spillover.</p>
<p>The Manchester poll was sponsored by a television company which produced a programme from the event. The procedure began with a regular public opinion survey. Originally 869 respondents were interviewed representing a 74 per cent participation rate out of those approached. All of these respondents were invited to take part in the deliberative poll and offered inducements of £50, an expense paid weekend at a good hotel in Manchester, a tour of the Granada Television Studios and the prospect of appearing on television. Ultimately this led to a self-selected sample of 301 respondents who accepted the offer and appeared in Manchester. This represents an ultimate response rate of 25 per cent.</p>
<p>Following the extensive discussion and debate, participants were invited to complete the same attitude survey that they completed prior to the exercise. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1462474511434430">Luskin et al. (2002)</xref> report the results mainly in terms of changes on single items. However they also reported changes on the five policy-related scales which were small but statistically significant. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1462474511434430">Hough and Park (2002)</xref> examined the durability of these effects by analysing survey results conducted 10 months after the deliberative poll. Naturally not all of the individuals who attended the poll could be reached or were willing to respond but most (81%) could and were. Hough and Park compared their measures with the results of single item measures from before the deliberative poll. Using a Wilcoxon signed rank test for changes on a single item the researchers reported that three out of the seven items concerning the use of imprisonment and 14 out of 19 criminal justice items moved in the expected direction. However, apart from the continuing selection effect, which becomes amplified with every layer of attrition, it is not possible to test out the impact of the deliberative poll as there was no control group and we cannot be sure that the results were not a function of expectancy effects.</p>
<p>The other major effort in attempting to change public attitudes on sentencing stems initially from the major review of sentencing in England and Wales in 2000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1462474511434430">Home Office, 2001</xref>). The series of studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1462474511434430">Chapman et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1462474511434430">Mirrlees-Black, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1462474511434430">Salisbury, 2004</xref>) commissioned by the Home Office investigated the differences in attitudes towards sentencing where the public were given accessible information about sentencing. More recently the Ministry of Justice has continued to explore ways of increasing public confidence in the criminal justice system through providing information booklets designed to correct misinformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1462474511434430">Singer and Cooper, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The initial research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1462474511434430">Chapman et al., 2002</xref>) involved a survey of 1022 people designed to assess knowledge and attitude in regard to the criminal justice system. From this sample, three subgroups were formed for each of the three information modalities: booklet (109 participants); video (74 participants); and seminar (37 participants). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1462474511434430">Chapman et al. (2002: 50)</xref> concluded:<disp-quote>
<p>Although there were marked improvements in attitudes to the CJS, there was little evidence that the shifts in attitudes found here could be attributed solely to improved knowledge about crime and justice. The sheer act of engaging people in this type of exercise appears to be sufficient to bring about an improvement in attitudes.</p></disp-quote>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1462474511434430">Mirrlees-Black (2002)</xref> noted, despite participants attributing their improved confidence to the information there was little evidence of a direct statistical link between improved knowledge and confidence. Those who had shown no improvement on the knowledge question were as likely to have increased their confidence as those who had shown a large improvement.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1462474511434430">Salisbury (2004)</xref> reported on the next Home Office sponsored effort to change attitudes through providing information. By this stage the booklet (a 20 page booklet of facts and information about crime and sentencing) was isolated as the one modality of information, presumably for convenience and also because it has been found to be an effective form of intervention in the earlier studies. The numbers problem was also overcome by linking the experiment with the British Crime Survey (BCS). In all 845 respondents who were interviewed for the 2002/2003 BCS were followed up, however only 421 of these had actually been asked questions on violence, crime trends and sentencing in the BCS. The booklet was given to a sub-sample of 645 respondents (321 who had been asked the BCS crime questions and 324 who had not). The control group only comprised 200 respondents (100 who had been asked the BCS crime questions and 100 who had not). Respondents were followed up after two weeks and asked the BCS questions on crime and justice. Modest improvements in confidence in the courts and satisfaction with sentencing were observed among those who received the booklet and looked through it.</p>
<p>One of the most telling findings of this research was that increases in confidence in the criminal justice system were almost as large for the group who had not received the booklet – suggesting that the process of being involved in the BCS was perhaps the most active ingredient. Furthermore, the changes to punitiveness, measured by the degree to which respondents thought sentences handed down by the courts were about right, was even greater for the control group than the experimental group. Unfortunately the numbers in some of the cells of the Salisbury study were not large enough to allow a full range of statistical tests. The study also included the confound that the respondents who were motivated to look through the booklet were selected as the experimental group, thus introducing a substantial selection bias.</p>
<p>The recent Home Office effort evaluated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1462474511434430">Singer and Cooper (2008)</xref> adopted a similar approach to Salisbury in using the BCS as a base and providing an information booklet designed to rectify public misconceptions about crime and justice. Although this research involved a considerably larger number of respondents (701 in the control group and 543 to 802 completions in each of the three intervention groups) the research still relied on looking at changes on single item measures and did not test for the durability of observed changes.</p>
<p>To sum up, the literature on changing attitudes to punishment by providing information raises questions about what we want to change, what can be changed and how change might occur. Principally there are a number of methodological problems with the studies to date testing the effect of information on attitudes to sentencing and criminal justice more generally. These are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1462474511434430">Table 1</xref>. The Home Office effort is represented in the table by the Singer and Cooper study as this achieves more of the methodological criteria than earlier Home Office studies. While each of the three categories of studies shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1462474511434430">Table 1</xref> have addressed some of these methodological requirements, none have addressed all the necessary requirements for a convincing test of the hypothesis that information combined with deliberation will make a difference to attitude. Most studies have not included a representative sample and, where attempts have been made to achieve one, response rates make the findings questionable. Most studies have not included a control group but where these have been included their importance has been demonstrated.

<p>The durability test is most advanced with the death penalty attitude studies. Efforts were made in both the death penalty studies and in the Singer and Cooper study to control for expectancy effects. The death penalty studies and the deliberative poll worked hard to engender deliberation. The Home Office studies also attempted to get respondents thinking about the issues but it was perhaps limited as there was no requirement for respondents to actually read the booklet that was given to them.</p>
<p>We are clearly not yet at a point where the evidence is strong enough to assert confidently that more information combined with deliberation leads to less punitiveness. The summary of problems covered in the preceding discussion points to the areas that need to be addressed in any attempt to link changes in information with changes in attitudes in this area.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec4-1462474511434430"><title>The current study</title>
<p>The methodology of the current study was designed to overcome the limitations of previous studies in attributing changes in public opinion to the addition of information and deliberation. It does this in four ways. First, by presenting information in a way which succinctly engenders the three elements of informed public opinion. Second, by measuring the sustainability of any effect on attitude over a reasonable period of time. Third, the inclusion of a control group allows us to be confident that any observed changes can be attributed to the specified intervention. Fourth, the current study provides for a large statistically representative sample of the population. The current study comprised a representative sampling of the Australian population requiring the recruitment of 6005 participants. The current study constitutes one of the largest tests of the proposal that information could affect punishment attitudes. It is also the largest study of public attitudes to criminal justice matters conducted in Australia.

<sec id="sec6-1462474511434430"><title>Research design</title>
<p>This study employed a pre-test, post-test experimental design examining the combined effect of information and deliberation (the independent variable) on three dependent variables: punitiveness; confidence in sentencing; and acceptance of alternatives to imprisonment. Measures were administered at Time 1 (pre-test) to control and experimental groups, at Time 2 immediately following the intervention for the experimental group only and at Time 3 (post-test) for control and experimental groups. Time 1 measures were administered between November 2008 and March 2009, Time 2 measures between September and November 2009 and Time 3 measures between April and May 2010.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec7-1462474511434430" sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title>
<p>A stratified random sample (stratification by States and Territories of Australia) of 6005 participants aged 18 years or older participated. This represented a response rate of 76 per cent of all the valid telephone numbers where participants were physically able to participate. Of the 6005 participants interviewed at Time 1, 73 per cent (<italic>n</italic> = 4384) agreed to further contact for later stages of the project. Of these, 2400 were randomly allocated to either the control group (<italic>n</italic> = 1200) or the intervention group (<italic>n</italic> = 1200) to achieve a desired quota of 800 in each group. For the intervention group, 815 participants completed interviews at Time 2 and 88 per cent of these (<italic>n</italic> = 717) also completed interviews at Time 3. The control group was made up of 859 interviews obtained at Time 3. There was some loss of sample due to missing data. The final number of cases with complete records for analysis was 696 from the intervention group and 844 from the control group.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec8-1462474511434430"><title>Measures</title>
<p>The attitudes of both groups on a range of topics associated with crime and sentencing were measured. The scales measuring the three dependent variables are detailed below. The response options available were in the usual five-point Likert scale (e.g. strongly agree to strongly disagree). For each scale Principal Axis Factoring supported the unidimensional scale structure.</p>
<p>The <italic>Confidence in Sentencing Scale</italic> comprised seven items designed to measure an individual’s confidence in the sentencing of criminal cases. A sample item is ‘I am satisfied with the decisions that the courts make’. Item responses were added to compute a scale score for each respondent with a possible range of seven to 35 (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.83). The <italic>Punitiveness Scale</italic> comprised seven items designed to measure an individual’s desire for harsher punishment. A sample item is ‘People who break the law should be given stiffer sentences’. Item responses were added to compute a scale score for each respondent with a possible scale range of seven to 35 (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.86). The <italic>Acceptance of Alternatives to Imprisonment Scale</italic> comprised five items designed to measure an individual’s willingness to accept the use of alternatives to imprisonment such as community supervision orders. A sample item is ‘Instead of going to prison, non-violent offenders should be given community corrections orders’. Item responses were added to compute a scale score for each respondent with a possible scale range of five to 25 (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.68).</p></sec>
<sec id="sec9-1462474511434430" sec-type="methods"><title>Procedure</title>
<p>The sampling frame for this research was a public listing of residential telephone numbers in Australia. For Time 1, a random selection of numbers stratified by State and Territory was selected. For each selected number, the household was sent an information letter about the survey. This was followed by a telephone call inviting a member of the household to participate in the research. Interviewers first asked to speak to the youngest adult male in the household; a selection strategy adopted to overcome difficulties in obtaining representative samples of males in general, and young males in particular, experienced in previous Australian Computer Assisted Telephone Interview (CATI) surveys. If there was no male member of the household the interviewer selected an adult member of the household using the ‘last birthday’ method, a form of random sampling. A policy of no replacements within the household was enforced where the individual selected refused to participate. A minimum of 10 call-backs was made to contact each household before deeming them non-contactable.</p>
<p>The interviews were conducted using CATI and were administered by an independent survey company. To control for response order effects, items were delivered in blocks and the order of presentation of these blocks was randomized as was the order of presentation of items within each block. Demographic items were administered as a block in a fixed position at the end of the survey. The interviewers continued to call numbers from each State and Territory until the target quota for each jurisdiction was reached.</p>
<p>After completion of Time 1 data collection, a random selection of participants was assigned to the experimental and control conditions. The information questionnaire was administered to the experimental group approximately nine months later (Time 2). The questionnaire consisted of three components. The first component was designed as a warm-up and to encourage considered judgements. Participants were provided with information on the five main purposes of sentencing. They were then presented with eight sentencing scenarios and instructed: ‘So imagine you are the judge. I will be presenting you with the case and want to know what YOU think should be the most important purpose of sentencing?’ Following the scenarios participants were asked two open-ended questions about (a) other purposes of sentencing and (b) other information they felt was necessary to answer the question.</p>
<p>The second component was introduced to attempt to engender considered judgement. Participants were presented with information on two key policy areas related to sentencing: the use of imprisonment versus alternatives and achieving justice and judicial discretion (Appendix 1). In each of these policy areas participants were provided with three key facts relevant to the area. They were then presented with key arguments for and against the dilemma and asked to rate the importance of each of the arguments. For the ‘building more prisons’ dilemma, respondents were provided with three key arguments for building more prisons and three key arguments against building more prisons. Respondents were asked to consider the importance of the arguments to the decision to direct policy in one way or another. For the mandatory imprisonment dilemma, respondents were provided with two key arguments for mandatory imprisonment and two key arguments against mandatory imprisonment.</p>
<p>The presentation of the three key facts naturally may create an expectation in the respondent of the socially desirable response. Therefore, the experiment was constructed to avoid tapping any specific responses within this deliberation component of the survey to ascertain opinion. In other words no measure of the respondent's particular response to these dilemmas were used in the analysis. Rather than eliciting an opinion about mandatory imprisonment or building more prisons the aim of this section was to engender a greater level of reflection about matters in this area generally. The responses to the arguments put in this component were designed simply to achieve this greater level of deliberation. The effect of this deliberation and information, if any, was measured through the three general punishment attitude scales (the three dependent variables) which followed in the next component of the survey. Approximately seven months later (Time 3) both control and experimental groups were surveyed again and the measures of punitiveness, confidence in sentencing and acceptance of alternatives to imprisonment were re-administered.</p></sec></sec>

<p>The mean scores with standard deviations for each of the dependent variables at each of the three time periods are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1462474511434430">Table 2</xref>. For each dependent variable a repeated measures <italic>t</italic>-test with an α of 0.05 was conducted comparing the Time 1 and Time 2 scores. This is designed to test any immediate changes that might be attributable to the intervention at Time 2. To examine whether the changes were maintained over time and whether these changes differed from those observed in the control group a hierarchical multiple regression with Time 3 scores as the criterion variable was conducted. As a control, Time 1 scores were entered in the first step of the hierarchical multiple regression.

<sec id="sec11-1462474511434430"><title>Confidence in sentencing</title>
<p>On average, participants scored higher in confidence in sentencing at Time 2 following the intervention than in Time 1. This difference was statistically significant, <italic>t</italic>(695) = −10.91, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, and represents a small effect size, <italic>d</italic> = .35. In the hierarchical multiple regression Time 1 scores were entered in the first step and accounted for a significant 50.6 per cent of the variance in Time 3 scores, <italic>R<sup>2</sup></italic><sup> </sup>= .506, <italic>F</italic>(1, 1538) = 1575.48, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. In the second step, condition (control versus intervention) was entered and was non-significant, accounting for no additional variance in Time 3 scores, <italic>R<sup>2</sup></italic>change = .000, <italic>F</italic>change (1, 1537) = 0.29, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05.</p>
<p>These results show that the experimental group participants provided with the intervention at Time 2 had increased levels of confidence in sentencing immediately after the intervention. However, confidence levels for the experimental group at Time 3 had slipped back to a level equivalent to that prior to the intervention and also equivalent to that of the control group who had not been presented with the intervention.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec12-1462474511434430"><title>Punitiveness</title>
<p>On average, participants scored lower in punitiveness at Time 2 following the intervention than at Time 1. This difference was statistically significant, <italic>t</italic>(695) = 8.82, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, and represents a small effect size, <italic>d</italic> = 0.22. In the hierarchical multiple regression Time 1 scores were entered in the first step and accounted for a significant 65 per cent of the variance in Time 3 scores, <italic>R<sup>2</sup></italic><sup> </sup>= 0.650, <italic>F</italic>(1, 1538) = 2855.71, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. In the second step, condition (control versus intervention) was entered and was significant, accounting for an additional 0.1 per cent of variance in Time 3 scores, <italic>R<sup>2</sup></italic>change = .001, <italic>F</italic>change (1, 1537) = 5.17, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05.</p>
<p>These results show that the experimental group participants provided with the intervention at Time 2 scored lower in punitiveness immediately after the intervention. However, punitiveness levels at Time 3 had reverted back to a level almost equivalent to that prior to the intervention and equivalent to that of those members of the initial sample who had not been presented the intervention. While statistically significant, an intervention accounting for 0.1 per cent of variance in scores may be considered trivial.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec13-1462474511434430"><title>Acceptance of alternatives to imprisonment</title>
<p>On average, participants scored higher in acceptance of alternatives to imprisonment at Time 2 following the intervention than at Time 1. This difference was statistically significant, <italic>t</italic>(695) = −17.09, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, and represents a medium effect size, <italic>d</italic> = 0.62. In the hierarchical multiple regression Time 1 scores were entered in the first step and accounted for a significant 31 per cent of the variance in Time 3 scores, <italic>R<sup>2</sup></italic><sup> </sup>= 0.310, <italic>F</italic>(1, 1538) = 690.08, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. In the second step, condition (control versus intervention) was entered and accounted for an additional 0.4 per cent of variance in Time 3 scores, <italic>R<sup>2</sup></italic>change = 0.004, <italic>F</italic>change (1, 1537) = 9.69, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01.</p>
<p>These results show that the experimental group participants who were provided the intervention at Time 2 displayed an increase in their level of acceptance of alternatives to imprisonment immediately after the intervention. There was some evidence to suggest that a proportion of this increase was maintained in Time 3, although this was small, accounting for only 0.4 per cent of the variation in scores.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec14-1462474511434430" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>On the surface the results reported here suggest that information combined with an attempt to encourage deliberation can make a difference on attitudes towards sentencing. However, these observed effects were short lived. No substantial differences could be observed between the group exposed to the intervention and the control group some six to nine months after the intervention. The results therefore confirm the findings reported earlier from the death penalty attitude studies in the United States and add further weight to the importance of testing the durability or sustainability of observed attitude change associated with any approach aimed at influencing expressed punishment attitudes. As noted earlier, the attempt to examine the durability of changes following the 1994 Manchester deliberative poll on crime and punishment faced a number of methodological problems and therefore the results that were derived could not be considered conclusive.</p>
<p>It remains possible that more information and more deliberation in the study reported here would have produced a durable effect. Another possibility is that the results observed immediately after the intervention reflected the task demands of the intervention. This might explain why global opinions, measured by the three scales at Time 3, reverted to their previous position as these task demands were not present at the time of re-testing.</p>
<p>The focus on task demands or roles is perhaps warranted as it is reasonable to expect that when placed in the context of decision making and providing considered judgements members of the public will respond differently than when being asked for very general opinions. One may espouse punitive opinions in a survey but also respond in a sober fashion to tasks requiring the exercise of judgement. One interpretation of the results, therefore, is that engaging in deliberation and making judgements has an immediate carry-on effect to the responses on the general attitude measure but this effect does not persist. It is possible, if we accept this view, that information and deliberation has its effects on the general attitude measures observed at Time 2, not because beliefs have changed, but because respondents were approaching the attitude measure while still in a state of mind that was more reflective, cautious and considered. Engendering this state of mind was indeed the intention of the intervention. Creating a task context of decision making may reduce respondents’ tendency to access personal values or affect when responding to items in the general attitude measure. This interpretation fits with some of the research reviewed in the introduction that emphasized the importance of engagement. Indeed it may be possible that our attempts to engender informed public opinion have perhaps focused too much on adding some material that was missing previously (information) where really the most relevant factor is the level of engagement and the nature of the respondent’s orientation to the task.</p>
<p>If there is a fundamental change in orientation from asking someone’s opinion to asking them to provide judgements maybe what fundamentally changes in deliberative procedures is not opinions but postures. Such a view would help make sense of the apparently paradoxical findings from the BCS studies that were discussed in the introduction. The theme emerging from these studies was that it was the level of engagement that was the most important factor associated with increased confidence and decreased punitiveness. Similar findings emerge from other studies where even greater levels of engagement and responsibility are required, such as sitting on a jury (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1462474511434430">Warner et al., 2011</xref>)</p>
<p>This opens a large discussion on the nature of attitude change. The proposition that change occurs as a function of the relationship or some other ‘process’ rather than information content or some static factor has been extensively discussed in the field of psychology and behaviour change and it is beyond the scope of this article to explore this discussion. Suffice to note that further research is needed to explore whether it is engagement or information that is more productive in regard to changes in punishment attitudes. An experiment, not unlike the one presented here, could be developed with two experimental groups and one control group. In one of the experimental groups engagement could be optimized and in the other information. The effects on the dependent variables could then be studied and this would help us understand a little more as to whether any of the changes to attitudes typically associated with deliberation are more a function of content or process.</p>
<p>The interpretation discussed above may also offer more hope in breaking out of public debates that are media dominated and emotionally polarized. It is unlikely that against the myriad forces the public is subject to, anything that may come in the way of an information ‘campaign’ would weigh heavily in such a way to alter the policy status quo.</p>
<p>Assumptions that the public is misinformed and should be either dismissed or ‘educated’ may actually contribute to the stalemate. If the public is to be a vital ingredient or even ‘partner’ in the development of policy we may need to focus more on the level and nature of engagement with the public and consider what democratization of policy in this area might look like (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1462474511434430">Indermaur, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>However, in the current policy environment political actors dealing with emotive issues like crime and punishment may see polls of ‘top of the head’ opinion as being more important to their work. Appreciation of this reality may provide a more relevant focus for those who have concerns about the direction of policy in this area. For example, rather than question the use of all ‘top of the head’ polls it may be more productive to question how superficial opinion is tapped and used. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1462474511434430">Beckett (1997)</xref> provided a detailed exploration of the way various political interests in the US construct a convenient image of ‘the punitive public’ through a selective use of superficial opinion polls. The media also benefit from a construct of a punitive public as it provides a focal point for public discussions around crime and punishment which are primarily emotional.</p>
<p>Emotions of fear, anger and disgust are certainly easy to elicit on topics of crime and punishment and, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1462474511434430">Karstedt (2002)</xref> points out, can provide strong ground for ever more repressive policies. However, to reduce public input to that of emotional reaction denies the more pragmatic public interest in the effectiveness of sentencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1462474511434430">Doob, 2000</xref>). This interest can also be tapped in superficial opinion polls but is not so popular with the media because it lacks the quality of conflict and outrage needed for sensational stories. The exclusive interest in the emotional dimension of public attitudes is revealed by the relentless focus on whether the public want ‘tougher’ or more ‘lenient’ sentencing and whether they ‘trust’ or ‘don’t trust’ the courts. By continuing to focus only on the emotional or expressive dimensions of public attitudes media and political entrepreneurs are able to exploit ‘the voice of the people’ for their purposes. This is fundamentally disrespectful of the public and dismisses it as a viable force for policy development. The public as an entity is reduced to a repository of raw emotion. For this to change the public does not need to be ‘informed’ or ‘educated’ rather the expectations of the role of the public must be different.</p>
<p>The investigation of informed public opinion cannot reasonably be divorced from its uses. People understand the difference between giving an opinion and taking responsibility for official action affecting people’s lives. The former provides a suitable platform for expressive opinion and the latter for sober judgement. What we see of public opinion is what is refracted through the lens of the media and political agents pursuing their interests. The value of informed public opinion for the development of criminal justice policy will be realized not through force feeding information but by changing the nature of the relationship with the public. Eliciting the engagement of the public in the form of a jury works to support the legitimacy of criminal trials, it could also work to support the legitimacy of criminal justice reforms.</p></sec>

<p>A big issue in Australia today, as more people are being sent to prison, is prison overcrowding. Two solutions proposed to address this problem are (1) build more prisons OR (2) increase the use of alternatives to imprisonment such as supervision, counselling, treatment or community work. For this section please think of yourself as someone who has the power to influence policy and has to justify their position and their decision. We will be presenting you with some different views on this issue but firstly we would like to present you with three important facts:
<list id="list1-1462474511434430" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>First, there is no evidence to suggest that higher imprisonment leads to lower crime.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Second, the total crime rate has fallen across Australia over the last 10 years.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Third, it costs over $75 thousand dollars per year to keep each adult offender in prison and it costs less than $5 thousand dollars per year to supervise each offender in the community.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>The third issue we would like to look at is whether judges should have more or less flexibility when sentencing criminals. Laws are sometimes brought in to restrict judges’ choices and to make sure that all offenders convicted of a particular offence get sentenced to prison regardless of the circumstances of the case. These laws are known as ‘mandatory imprisonment’ laws.</p>

<list-item><p>First, there is no evidence to suggest that mandatory imprisonment reduces crime.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Second, mandatory imprisonment will make it impossible for the courts to prevent the imprisonment of an offender even when special circumstances are involved.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Third, even with mandatory imprisonment laws, offenders may still avoid prison by plea bargaining with the police or prosecution.</p></list-item>
