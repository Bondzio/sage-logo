<title>Technical Article: Unlocking the Potential of Stem Cells in Neuroscience Research</title>
<p>A new technical article from AMSBIO can enable neuroscience researchers to learn more about a new method to control and direct differentiation of physiologically relevant neural cell types using stem cell–qualified reagents. The new method describes how to differentiate adult neural stem cells and pluripotent ES cells using 3D extracellular matrices and reagents from AMSBIO.</p>

<title>Cultrex 3D Cell Proliferation Assays</title>
<p>According to AMSBIO, its new Cultrex Cell Proliferation Assays provide more physiologically relevant assessments when using cell models in the screening process for compounds that influence toxicity, cell survival, tumorigenicity, and new tumor formation. They offer a flexible, standardized, high-throughput format for quantitating the degree to which pharmacologic compounds influence toxicity or tumorigenicity in an in vivo–like environment. The methodology has been adapted to multiple formats so that cell proliferation may be evaluated against different extracellular matrices. The assay is available for 3D growth in basement membrane extract (BME), laminin I, and collagen I formats.</p>

<title>Three New Cell-Based Kinase Assays</title>
<p>Cisbio Bioassays has added three kinase assays to its cell-based kinase screening platform. All three are based on its HTRF technology. The assays, Phospho-STAT3 (Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3; Tyr705), Phospho-p38 MAPK (Thr180/Tyr182), and Phospho-IKKβ (Ser177/Ser181) involve targets that are associated with many diseases, including cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn’s disease, pulmonary fibrosis, and acute lung injury. Specifically, the assays provide a target in a physiological environment and enable the analysis of signaling pathways in response to drug treatment.</p>
<p>As with all HTRF-based assays, the three new cellular kinase assays are homogeneous, nonradioactive, and non–bead based. Their mix and read protocol eliminates washing steps and the long signal stability and flexibility allow for multiple experiments—including small series—without special equipment, saving.</p>

<title>Black 1536-Well Cycloolefin Microplate</title>
<p>According to Greiner Bio-One, this new microplate was developed for fluorescence measurements and light-protected compound storage in highly automated systems. Cycloolefins are considered ideal for sensitive fluorescence measurements because of their quartz glasslike properties and their particularly low autofluorescence in the lower UV range. Their low water vapor permeability and resistance to polar solvents such as DMSO make them well suited for sample storage in high-throughput screening. The new black 1536-well cycloolefin microplate has no alphanumerical coding and is considered ideal for automated sealing techniques using metal cover plates such as those used in the ultra-high-throughput screening system (uHTS) of automation supplier GNF Systems.</p>

<title>Low-Dead-Volume Reservoir</title>
<p>INTEGRA’s new 10 mL disposable multichannel reagent reservoir has a low dead volume (650 µL) that can generate savings on reagent use. One side of the 10 mL reagent reservoir is molded into a pour back spout to help control liquid flow and return excess fluid to a source container. A transparent polystyrene design allows the crisp graduations on the inside of the reservoir base to be clearly seen, enabling accurate fluid measurement and reduced reagent waste. For maximum fluid recovery, a full-length, extra deep trough is more easily accessible for pipette tips. Now available in 10 mL, 25 mL, and 100 mL, the reservoirs are designed to nest within one another without sticking. Compact packaging options include portable, standalone sleeves, which are considered ideal for lab benches or hoods and individually sealed bags for sterile applications.</p>

<title>High-Grade Polypropylene Flip-Cap Centrifuge Tubes</title>
<p>A new range of high-grade polypropylene flip-cap centrifuge tubes combine ease of use, chemical resistance, and high speed tolerance. Designed for one-handed operation, the secure leak-proof flip-cap lid on each centrifuge tube can also be unscrewed. Available in a range of standard sizes, the dimensions of the Porvair flip-cap centrifuge tubes are compatible with almost all centrifuge rotors, can be spun up to 9400<italic>g</italic>, and will withstand repeated autoclaving at 121 °C or long-term storage at −80 °C. Each centrifuge tube has a solvent-resistant writing area. Porvair 15 mL and 50 mL flip-cap centrifuge tubes have thin clear polypropylene walls and can withstand 8000<italic>g</italic> and 12 000<italic>g</italic>, respectively. Self-standing centrifuge tubes are available in a 50 mL size with conical bottoms and an outer collar that allows the tube to stand on a bench and can withstand 6000<italic>g</italic>. Production of the Porvair flip-cap centrifuge tubes is carried out in a Class 10000/ISO Class VII clean environment to ISO 9001:2008 and EN ISO 13485:2003 manufacturing standards to ensure all products are free from DNA/RNA, DNase/RNase, and Pyrogen contamination. Porvair centrifuge tubes are supplied gamma irradiated sterile packaged in zip-sealed bags.</p>

<title>Gas-Permeable Adhesive Seals for Live Cell Assays</title>
<p>The new 500120 series gas-permeable adhesive microplate seals allow uniform air and carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) exchange but prevent moisture evaporation. Porvair considers them to be ideal for Eukaryotic cell culture and long-term live cell assays. The gas-permeable film in the new seals is bonded to an adhesive sheet with adhesive-free windows, which align over the wells. Available with 96 round windows for a 96-well plate and 384 square windows for a 384-well plate, the seals provide high-integrity microplate closure from −20 °C to 80 °C. Supplied sterile in packs of 50 (5 × 10 sheets), Porvair gas-permeable adhesive seals are easily peelable, ensuring straightforward application onto microplates.</p>

<title>Five New Infectious Disease Panels</title>
<p>SeraCare Life Sciences now offers a performance panel for parvovirus B19, HIV, HBV, HAV, and CMV markers. The Parvovirus B19 Mixed Titer Performance Panel (PVP201) is, according to SeraCare, the world’s first commercially available performance panel for Parvovirus B19 markers with naturally occurring plasma samples. Designed to help users evaluate parvovirus assays, the panel contains 21 samples characterized for multiple IgM and IgG assays as well as B19 DNA, a marker used to screen plasma collected for fractionation.</p>
<p>The HIV Genotype Performance Panel (PRD201) provides researchers with a diverse set of samples, both geographically and in terms of genotypes: eight of the nine panel members are HIV-positive, representing eight different HIV-1 genotypes from seven countries. Made from cultured virus diluted in defibrinated plasma, this panel is designed to help users develop, evaluate, and troubleshoot a variety of HIV assays, including those for HIV RNA and the newest screening tests for combined HIV antigen and antibody.</p>
<p>The Worldwide HBV DNA Performance Panel (WWHD301) adds a worldwide hepatitis B panel to SeraCare’s panel portfolio. The 20-member panel includes samples from 10 countries with HBV genotypes ranging from A through H. SeraCare delivers the broadest range of data available for a panel of this kind, with information on genotype, drug resistance mutations, and test results for HBV DNA, HBsAg, and HBeAg.</p>
<p>The Anti-Hepatitis A Virus Mixed Titer Performance Panel (PTH202) offers users a 21-member panel that includes members positive for IgG and IgM, contains specimens collected from 2000 to 2010, and represents a diverse range of HAV reactivities (from low to medium to high). Data are available for both new and established test methods.</p>
<p>The Anti-CMV (Cytomegalovirus) Mixed Titer Perfor-mance Panel (PTC203), available exclusively from SeraCare, provides 21 naturally occurring panel members with data from 12 commercially available anti-CMV assays. It also features a detailed graphical representation of test member results.</p>
