<p>Speech is an intuitive way to communicate and interact with others. It is with this premise that speech is taken as a desired way to interact with technology. <italic>Practical Speech User Interface Design</italic> takes us on a journey toward becoming familiar with using speech as an interaction channel.</p>
<p>The book is both a primer and an advanced companion. Whether you are a scholar looking to study various aspects related to the use of speech recognition technology in interactive systems or a practitioner working on designing and implementing interactive speech recognition technology, Lewis’s book is definitely your starting point. It can also be used as a companion while implementing speech technologies.</p>
<p>Lewis positions speech user interfaces (SUIs) within the self-service technologies domain. That means that SUIs must be highly usable, and the book addresses very well the importance of SUIs and the significance of their usability. The book also covers relevant speech technologies, scientific and theoretical fundamentals of language and speech, and issues of design and development of speech technologies and speech-based user interfaces.</p>
<p>If you want to know what is unique about the process of designing and developing SUIs, turn to the relevant chapter. What does it mean to develop a conceptual design when it comes to SUIs? The answers, such as how to design the dialogue and the persona of the “machine,” can be found, along with suggestions and insights, in a chapter devoted to this topic. The discussion on detailed design can be used as your checklist when deliberating about topics, such as how to design prompts and turn-taking, or the details of menu design.</p>
<p>As Lewis writes at the end, “Books are static. The world is not.” I look forward to the next edition of the book, in which issues such as integrating SUIs with other modalities (vision, touch) and mobile contexts will be covered.</p>
