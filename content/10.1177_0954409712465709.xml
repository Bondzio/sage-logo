<abstract>
<p>Renewals and especially enhancements of rail signalling and control systems are increasingly including a strong programme of human factors integration. One contribution to the human factors work that is required is work analysis – the understanding of what tasks and functions exist in current work systems, the artefacts (controls and displays used) and the strategies employed by skilled operators. One increasingly common approach to such work systems analysis is cognitive work analysis (CWA), used to develop understanding of a work domain and tasks in a structured fashion and as a basis for new design recommendations. The purpose of this paper is to explain, for an engineering and systems developer audience, the basis for and use of CWA. This is done in the context of rail electrical control rooms and especially the use made of various information display elements including alarms.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0954409712465709" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Rail systems engineers, operations specialists and business analysts are increasingly using ergonomics/human factors in the planning, development and implementation of new railway systems. The human factors contribution is very often in terms of forming a human factors integration plan, contributing to a safety case, providing user requirements (in light of standards, best practice or new research), carrying out formative test and evaluation and supporting implementation. The socio-technical nature of the railway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954409712465709">1</xref></sup> is such that there is a clear need to understand human factors issues in order to apply new technologies in the most effective way possible.</p>
<p>Technological advancements have changed the look and functionalities of the control room, however, the complexity often caused by these technologies can, and indeed have, dramatically affected safety and performance. Therefore, it is important to understand the tasks and functionalities of these technologies as well as the cognitive demands imposed on the operators.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954409712465709">2</xref></sup> After a number of accidents (e.g. Three Mile Island) human factors assessments became a mandatory precursor to the development of control rooms (new or modified technologies), railways is no exception. Often methods used by engineers and human factors specialists to achieve this understanding include workload assessment, human error evaluation, and task analysis. One significant human factors contribution to rail systems design over the past few years has been to carry out work analyses. Such work analyses are particularly important in process and transport control systems which collect data remotely from complex environments. The analyses determine:
<list id="list1-0954409712465709" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>what tasks/functions must be carried out in what circumstances, in order to support decisions on what human and computer resources are required;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>how these should be integrated into an effective work system;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>how information display interfaces should be designed (for form and content);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>what human roles and crew sizes are needed;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>what loading might be placed on operators in normal, abnormal and emergency scenarios.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>With reference to the last of these, advanced technologies based on highly reliable sensors and the application of sophisticated algorithms enable operators to monitor, intervene, correct and optimise as necessary, within a supervisory control framework<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954409712465709">3</xref></sup>, but have increased the volume of data available to operators in their decision-making. While this creates opportunities for more efficient and proactive control, it also can place an increasing cognitive demand on the operator.</p>
<p>The focus of this paper is the use of a particular human factors approach to work systems analysis: the cognitive work analysis (CWA) approach. The paper has three main contributions. The first and major contribution is to present - for a largely non-human factors audience - the approach of CWA as a means to incorporate thorough knowledge about tasks, functions, roles and strategies into systems development and the system life cycle, producing formative guidelines for the design of complex supervisory control systems. When appropriate the findings of the stages of CWA are linked to the design process phases introduced in ISO 11064-1:2001: Ergonomics design of Control Centres. The case chosen to illustrate CWA for this paper is the challenging one of information display in railway electrical control rooms (ECRs), with particular reference to the design of effective alarm systems used by ECO operators (ECROs). Specifically the application of this work within the company (Network Rail) was to understand alarm handling and inform future remote condition monitoring technologies (i.e. railway intelligent infrastructure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954409712465709">4</xref></sup>). The second contribution is that in addition to presenting the method itself, we discuss some of the considerations around the successful application of CWA. This includes how to implement CWA within a design and development process, the benefits and limitations of the approach, and some of the resource requirements. A final contribution is to provide some initial analysis for those working in the area of rail electrical control of the domain characteristics, operator strategies and therefore some of the emergent human factors considerations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0954409712465709"><title>Background</title>
<p>CWA is a conceptual and system-based approach to the analysis of human information interaction in highly dynamic socio-technical work places.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954409712465709">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954409712465709">6</xref></sup> It was initially proposed by Rasmussen et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954409712465709">7</xref></sup> and subsequently modified by Vicente<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954409712465709">8</xref></sup> and Lintern<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954409712465709">9</xref></sup> amongst others. It has been applied in several domains and industry sectors, including by our own group previously in rail and air transportation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954409712465709">10</xref></sup>, and has also been widely used by the Network Rail Ergonomics Team in contributions to new rail traffic management systems development. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0954409712465709">Table 1</xref> shows three different schemes for CWA stages, and also presents the stages used in this study, covering the structure of the work domain, the work tasks within the work organisation, task performance requirements, cognitive processes and strategies.

<p>CWA enables designers and developers to get a clear understanding of the work domain and to specify its functionalities. It is particularly useful when designers want to introduce new technologies to support existing cognitive functions. For example, the case that was studied in the ECR informed the implication of adding a fourth information display on the controllers’ workstation. However, it can be used to obtain a general understanding of an existing system as well. Human factor specialists should conduct CWA and work closely with the general engineer to understand and specify the functionalities.</p>
<p>ISO 11064 reports five phases of design life cycle of control centres as clarification, analysis and definition, concept design, detailed design and operational feedback. CWA can support some aspects of these phases, the purpose of using CWA is that it describes ‘what goes on’ or ‘what should go on’ in a system in a structured and repeatable manner. Done well it can support decisions in the systems development process over who performs a task (allocation of function), people’s support needs (such as information), the loading on them, where a human-centred automation can have benefits, and design of the information displays. An important aspect of CWA is that it is formative rather than prescriptive, and so it can address unpredicted events or system states. It also facilitates an in—depth understanding of the context as well as the hierarchy of tasks and information that supports them. The early stages of CWA provide the designer with an overview of the system where design constraints can be easily detected (this is similar to the clarification phase in ISO 11064). Nirula and Woodruff<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954409712465709">11</xref></sup>) considered CWA as an ‘integral precursor to any design iteration’. Later stages will examine in more detailed features such as operator cognitive processes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954409712465709">12</xref></sup> These findings can be used to inform the identification of sources of human error or guide training (similar to the concept design phase of the ISO 11 064). CWA has been used successfully as a tool to guide the procurement process and tender evaluation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954409712465709">13</xref></sup> CWA has already been used in a number of rail contexts including signalling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954409712465709">10</xref></sup>, train driving<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954409712465709">14</xref></sup>, and engineering and track worker protection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954409712465709">15</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>This paper illustrates the use of CWA for rail applications using the case of a redesign of a rail ECR. This was within the context of a change management project to update the current control layout to one more suitable for more integrated rail control.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954409712465709">16</xref></sup> This required an understanding of the cognitive task of how electrical control is carried out, the implications of expanding the area of control and the subsequent potential increase in information presented to the ECRO. One objective of CWA was to understand constraints and bottlenecks occurring with the current system and operator’s strategies to cope with these situations. In terms of process, the initial requirement for the CWA came from the change management function within the larger redesign project, and the users of the output would be system developers working on future control interfaces. It is important to note that the purpose of the CWA was not to replace existing design standards (e.g. EEMUA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954409712465709">17</xref></sup>) but instead to give the developers context in order to effectively apply the detail of these standards.</p>
<sec id="sec3-0954409712465709"><title>Rail ECRs</title>
<p>ECRs ensure the supply of electricity to traction and vehicles on the rail network. In the UK there are 13 ECRs and operators are mainly responsible for safe, reliable and efficient supply of electricity. The main task of the operator is to monitor the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems and to isolate track under maintenance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954409712465709">18</xref></sup> Alarm management is a major part of this work (and see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954409712465709">Figure 1</xref> for an illustration of the control panel).
<fig id="fig1-0954409712465709" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Rail ECR workstation and display area.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954409712465709-fig1.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>Rail ECR alarms are events configured in the system that require the operator’s attention because they signify any form of abnormality in the rail network’s electricity supply system (e.g. through overhead wires or a third rail). They are announced by sounding an audible alarm, updating any related symbols on an alarm banner on the display as well as via live indications on the SCADA which is responsible for remotely controlling the electricity supply through remote monitoring equipment.</p>
<p>The total number of alarms generated in one UK ECR (Lewisham) in one week from 29 January 2009 to 05 February 2009 was 1884, approximately 10 per hour. Many of these alarms take anything between 40 s and 3 min to handle. This number includes alarms and events that operators need to notice but do not necessarily require immediate intervention or response. Cases which require immediate intervention can be as few as two or three alarms per hour. In normal situations many of the apparent alarms may be spurious or confirmations of pre-planned events such as testing, and so the operator needs to be vigilant for the high priority, less frequent real alarms amid these much more frequent low-priority events. In emergencies, such as major power failures, the number of incoming events may peak at 200 alarms per hour, which means that the main operator requires support from relief operators and there is major service disruption while the alarms are processed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954409712465709">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>The dynamic nature of alarm handling emphasises the need to understand the cognitive and collaborative work involved.<sup>19-21</sup> For example, ECR alarm handling involves collecting information from signal boxes as well as from the maintenance team on track, and constantly monitoring the SCADA system. A complete and qualitative understanding of work in the real-life setting is required to include the complexities of these systems. The next section explains the methodologies that were adopted in this study in order to develop such in-depth understanding.</p>

<p>Five stages of CWA, largely as adapted by Lintern<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954409712465709">9</xref></sup>, were used for the purpose of this study. A work domain analysis, organisation of work, and cognitive transformation analysis were developed to provide an initial understanding of the domain. Cognitive strategies and processing modes were also identified to develop an understanding of human information processing and some insights on information presentation and formats. Social transaction analysis was not carried out as it was not central to the work being studied. The stages of CWA can be conducted in the sequence as numbered in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0954409712465709">Table 2</xref>. The output from one stage feeds the next one, therefore it structures the way the researcher collect and analyse the data.

<p>At the rail ECR in Lewisham near London, two ECROs at any one time are responsible for providing electricity supplies to rail tracks and ensure railway safety for trains and maintenance. Six ECROs participated in this study, details of the participants can be found in Dadashi et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954409712465709">18</xref></sup> Pre-study briefing visits were conducted in order to familiarise the researcher (first author ND) with the control room and tasks as well as to brief the ECROs about the study. This was followed by four 4.5-h duration visits. During the 18 h of observation of these operators a total of 22 alarms occurred and were subsequently analysed. Videos of episodes of alarm handling cases were recorded. These videos captured operators’ interactions with the interfaces and other people within the control room. The sequence of these interactions was recorded and was confirmed through retrospective talk aloud methods. A Microsoft™ Excel spreadsheet was designed to structure the results obtained from the field studies. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0954409712465709">Table 3</xref> shows an example taken from the spreadsheet. The observational checklist was developed to organise task allocations, alarm handling durations and information flows. These data served various forms of analysis depending on the particular stage of CWA being carried out, and the analyses are described in the following section.

<p>In addition to the observation, operators were interviewed about how they handled alarms and managed their information interface generally. This took place as convenient, and without interrupting active work, during or after each relevant work activity, with questions based on the critical decision method.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0954409712465709">22</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="sec8-0954409712465709"><title>Work domain analysis</title>
<p>Work domain analysis (WDA) focuses on the functional (activity independent) structure of the work and consists of an abstraction hierarchy (AH) with five levels: domain purpose, domain values and priorities, domain functions, physical functions, and physical objects. Domain purpose refers to the overall objectives of the system, domain values and priorities refer to necessary characteristics of the system while achieving its objectives. Domain function describes what needs to be achieved within the control domain at an abstracted level whereas physical functions describe the physical expression that needs to be performed in order to facilitate those domain functions. Finally, physical objects are the artefacts and tools used in the control room to enable the physical functions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954409712465709">9</xref></sup> Overall this analysis facilitates an understanding of the work domain, and the contextual constraints that may influence performance of the work.</p>
<p>Interviews conducted in the briefing sessions provided the researcher with the knowledge to identify physical objects (e.g. SCADA, maps, logs, etc.) and physical functions required to meet the domain functions. The observational checklist used throughout this study showed the connection between different physical objects and their use for achieving different goals. In addition, operators’ comments and talk aloud sessions highlighted the values and purposes associated with each function.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954409712465709">Figure 2</xref> shows an AH of alarm handling in a rail ECR. Artefacts utilised by operators during alarm handling include SCADA, log book, phone, map, regulations and isolation requests. Also, the operator might consult with his/her colleagues within the control room or call someone on-site to obtain more information. Use of these artefacts enables the operator to achieve an understanding of system status as well as the optimum plan he/she ought to develop and follow. Alarm handling can be broken down into two main functions, alarm recognition and alarm clearance, with the purpose of ensuring safety and efficiency for the supply and optimising the use of resources within the railway. All of this activity is embedded within the overall goal of providing a continuous supply of electricity to the rail network.
<fig id="fig2-0954409712465709" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>AH for alarm handling in railway ECRS.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954409712465709-fig2.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>The AH offers an early understanding of domain functions and its purposes; relating to the ‘what’ and the ‘why’ of alarm handling in a railway ECR. Therefore, this AH gives us a structured approach to understanding both the types of constraint that impinge on the operator’s work and the relationships between those constraints. For example, one of the constraints is that both of the domain functions (alarm recognition and alarm clearance) are relevant to all of the domain priorities and values (safety, efficiency and optimisation). Therefore, any change to a domain function or its underpinning physical function and artefacts must consider the potential impact on all these priorities. Although to a general engineer this may seem as common sense, CWA and more specifically AH, provides developers with an overview of the technology and its effect on the overall goals and values of the system. The Network Rail Ergonomics Department developed a work domain map visualisation tool (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.ergotools.co.uk">www.ergotools.co.uk</ext-link>) in order to benefit from obtaining this broader overview of the domains and their associated activities. The AH also feeds into the second stage of cognitive work analysis: work organisation analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-0954409712465709"><title>Work organisation analysis</title>
<p>Work organisation analysis is used to associate tasks required for the domain functions, identified in the AH, with the situations in which the work takes place. It is common to associate these situations with physical locations. For example, in an air traffic control study performed by Vicente<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954409712465709">8</xref></sup>, work situations refer to three different locations: pilot’s cockpit, air traffic control room and the on-ground maintenance team. Since in our study the work examined takes place in only one physical location (the ECR) we elected to use the situation axis for different physical systems that might be used to support the work functions. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954409712465709">Figure 3</xref> is an example of a contextual activity matrix which is the product of this stage.
<fig id="fig3-0954409712465709" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Alarm handling contextual activity matrix.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954409712465709-fig3.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>The boxes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954409712465709">Figure 3</xref> show the overall spectrum of the artefacts that can potentially be used for each task, the shaded circles highlight the most used artefact for each task and the whiskers show the distribution of the artefacts that are more likely to be used.</p>
<p>This analysis allows the work functions identified at the AH stage (alarm recognition and alarm clearance) to be tied to specific work contexts and artefacts. By using the matrix in this way, we are able to provide greater clarity on where each of the constraints identified in the AH may be most relevant. For example, the main display is used in all work tasks, whereas the phone is only used in two stages (identify priority and information collection) as is face-to-face communication (information collection and assess the alarm). These two work situations are of particular interest as they both involve contact with other human agents in the system, usually for the purposes of clarification or enhanced information gathering. Therefore, the matrix allows us to represent that, for certain tasks (and not for others), there is a critical role for cooperation in managing the alarm. Similarly, we can see that the work task ‘information collection’ is relevant to all but one of the work situations. This indicates that the operator needs multiple forms of information to successfully recognise the alarm, though it is not necessarily the case that all of these types of information are required for every alarm.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-0954409712465709"><title>Cognitive transformation analysis</title>
<p>Cognitive transformation analysis identifies the cognitive activity associated with work tasks identified in the previous stage. The seven tasks noted in the contextual activity matrix were used as the basis for this stage. Operators were asked, retrospectively, to describe the reasoning behind their decisions during these tasks. This provided an understanding of the processes required for each task and the associated states. For each task, operators’ comments led into development of state process diagrams (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954409712465709">Figure 4</xref>, where ovals represent cognitive states and arrows show the cognitive processes that guide the transitions between cognitive states). These state process diagrams were then compiled in the form of a decision ladder (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954409712465709">Figure 5</xref>). The decision ladder is a template that frames potential cognitive states and processes within a standardised model of cognition comprising attention, interpretation, evaluation and decision-making, planning and action. For example, the states and processes shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954409712465709">Figure 4</xref> conform to the evaluation stages of the decision ladder. The decision ladder can also represent shortcuts through cognitive processing, known as shunts and leaps, therefore supporting the expression of the kind of cognitive activity that is typical of an expert’s performance. It also enables prediction of the impact of automation on cognitive processing, by demonstrating the impact of interventions on specific cognitive sequences.
<fig id="fig4-0954409712465709" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Example of a state process diagram for the work task of information requirement assessment.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954409712465709-fig4.tif"/>
</fig>
<fig id="fig5-0954409712465709" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Alarm handling decision ladder.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954409712465709-fig5.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>The example state process diagram demonstrates some of the cognitive states and processes associated with the functional task of ‘information requirement assessment’. The type of alarm is being recognised (cognitive state) earlier and the search is being performed (cognitive process) to evaluate (cognitive process) the level of information available (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954409712465709">Figure 4</xref>).</p>
<p>The value of presenting the cognitive activity of alarm handling in this manner is that it allows higher- order groupings or stages of processing to be presented. In this case these are notification, acceptance analysis and clearance. These stages broadly correspond to the alarm-initiated activities identified by Stanton.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0954409712465709">20</xref></sup> These higher-order stages serve as the basis of the strategy analysis, conducted next.</p>
<p>The decision ladder provides a sequential representation of the cognitive processing relevant to alarm handling. However, it also supports the representation of different routes through the generic process. For example, the bold arrow represents a leap between alarm acceptance and alarm clearance and reflects the handling of expected maintenance alarms, where the operator has prior knowledge of the likely occurrence of the alarm before the actual generation of that alarm. As a result of this existing prior knowledge, no evaluation or analysis is required. By extension, none of the information sources relevant to evaluation or analysis are therefore required. This also demonstrates the additional steps (and information sources) that will be required when the alarm is genuine (i.e. the additional steps required for alarm acceptance and alarm analysis).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-0954409712465709"><title>Strategies analysis</title>
<p>Human operators tend to adopt strategies and shortcuts to overcome the limitations imposed by technical systems including those of inefficient information presentation. On the rare occasions of an incident, the alarm load is densest and operators have to focus on a number of key information sources concurrently. Hence, they cannot cope with system anomalies as they usually do in normal situations, and must adopt strategies to manage the alarm. Hollnagel and Woods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0954409712465709">23</xref></sup> listed the strategies potentially applied by operators in joint cognitive systems to cope with any sort of complexity, such as the high information density observed in the ECR. Prior to the field studies, participants were introduced to the different types of strategies. In the initial observations, participants were prompted during alarm cases to specify which strategy they were using at any given point. This made it possible in the final two observation sessions to infer the strategies from participants’ talk aloud and video recordings. A number of the potential strategies (filtering, queuing, categorising, similarity matching, and extrapolation) emerged in the majority of the cases, and from this it was possible to assign specific strategies to high-level cognitive processing stages (strategy types are highlighted in bold in the following discussions), later validated with an ECRO familiar with the strategy classification.</p>
<sec id="sec12-0954409712465709"><title>Notification</title>
<p>Several information sources notify operators of the existence of an alarm. These include the flashing alarm banner, colour codes, acronyms of alarm type and location, sirens, phone calls, flashing circle around the location on the overview display, etc. Operators have to categorise and filter these sources to achieve a basic understanding of the alarm. In the case of multiple alarms operators queue them based on their experience.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec13-0954409712465709"><title>Acceptance</title>
<p>The situation awareness that we assume is built into the previous stage (notification) is the basis on which the operator almost immediately accepts the alarm and silences the siren without informing an authorised person. In the rare cases of an alarm where immediate on-site action is required, operators use their local knowledge (of the track, the electrical equipment, the work which might be taking place out there and the train service running) and their experience of previous similar cases in order to assess the criticality. The strategy at this stage is mostly similarity matching which is highly related to operators’ experience. Usually this stage is tightly coupled with the analysis and assessment of the alarm.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec14-0954409712465709"><title>Analysis</title>
<p>Information presented to the operator is being used by them for the purpose of assessing and evaluating the underlying meaning and causes of alarms. Operators usually analyse alarms by stretching the existing evidence to match them with similar cases (extrapolation). Unlike similarity matching where all of the evidence is matched with a similar previous alarm, here the operator has to use his/her imagination to fill the gaps until a similarity is perceived.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec15-0954409712465709"><title>Clearance</title>
<p>The operator identifies possible courses of actions, evaluates them and executes the optimum action to clear the alarm. The operator remembers similar cases and tries to match the stretched evidence to other potential (similarity matching and extrapolation) causes and trials the corrective actions of those cases (trial and error).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec16-0954409712465709"><title>Cognitive competency analysis</title>
<p>Cognitive competency analysis aims to identify the operator’s processing mode while attending to work tasks. This stage provides designers with the information that operators will mostly require based on the cognitive processing modes they are using. Cognitive processing mode is categorised into rule-based, skill-based and knowledge-based behaviour.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954409712465709">7</xref></sup> Therefore, each of the tasks identified in a contextual activity matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954409712465709">Figure 3</xref>) and their associated strategies would relate to a cognitive processing mode. Identifying these processing modes can then be used to inform design recommendations.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954409712465709">Figure 6</xref> shows the cognitive processing modes associated with various tasks, artefacts required to conduct those tasks and an exemplar of design implications in order to support the corresponding cognitive processing mode. For example, categorising, similarity matching and filtering are rule-based processing modes since the operator has to apply a set of instructions. In this level the operator has to see the pattern but that does not necessarily lead into a recognised and clear set of actions as, after identifying the pattern, the operator has to set an action plan.

<sec id="sec17-0954409712465709" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>This paper has described the use of five stages of CWA to capture operators’ cognitive processing relevant to alarm handling in a rail ECR. As we have gone along we have illustrated the value of each analytical form and how it can help with subsequent design of alarm systems. What emerges from using these analyses in combination is how the analytical forms work together to build a detailed view of the cognitive requirements of a given work domain. The AH gives us functions embedded in a physical and organisational context. These functions are elaborated in the contextual activity matrix, in terms of corresponding tasks and work situations. The cognitive transformations underlying these tasks are represented in the decision ladder, which highlights higher-order stages of processing. These higher-order stages inform strategy analysis and, from this, processing modes which can lead to design requirements. Having presented the specific case, the following section reflects on the usefulness of CWA for rail in terms of its application, benefits, limitations and resource requirements.</p>
<sec id="sec18-0954409712465709"><title>Application</title>
<p>CWA can provide designers with a holistic understanding of the socio-technical environment in which their interfaces will be used. It attempts to use this cognitive approach and identifies the challenges imposed by the environment and also identifies operators’ strategies. Thus, the designers and developers can apply this knowledge to guide a more successful implementation of existing design principles. An example of findings obtained from the case study described in this paper are summarised in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0954409712465709">Table 4</xref>.

<sec id="sec19-0954409712465709"><title>Benefits and limitations</title>
<p>CWA provides developers with high-level guidance regarding the functionalities and potential of the existing system as well as the cognitive challenges that it imposes on the operators. Moreover, through determining current obstacles and the ways operators deal with them, developers can make more informed future designs. However, in order to convert these recommendations into tangible guidelines, each of the stages of CWA can be dealt with in isolation. For example, the contextual activity matrix can be used to guide the engineer when setting the artefacts in the control room in order to correspond with their sequence of use. However, it is necessary to conduct the same analysis for other tasks within the ECR to avoid any contradictions.</p>
<p>In fact, there is no ‘one way’ to conduct a CWA, and the skilful human factors analyst uses what is appropriate to the case and with resources used commensurate to the needs. For instance, in our own previous rail work we developed and employed a considerably simplified version of CWA in the context of understanding strategies and skills of rail network controllers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954409712465709">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0954409712465709">24</xref></sup> However, the focus here on one particular type of work (alarm handling) and one particular set of displays and display elements (alarm information interfaces) meant that the more traditional and fuller form of CWA had significant potential.</p>
<p>CWA is a framework rather than a method; therefore, there are few guidelines about what data collection methods should be deployed or analysis routines adopted. Within our ECR case a total of 18 h of observation was carried out together with interviews with subject matter experts to provide an appropriate level of understanding. Video recording analysis checklists were used to structure the findings. However, in line with much research in live, socio-technical systems environments, the success of the analysis is very much dependent on the experience of the researcher both in the domain he/she is investigating as well as good understanding generally of the principles of human information processing.</p>
<p>There are a number of challenges associated with the use of CWA. The effectiveness of a CWA is highly dependent on the availability of data, subject matter experts and the expertise of the researcher in performing the analysis. This may place limits on the viability of performing all stages within the timescales and resources of a project. It may also be the case that as the stages progress they become more conceptual and based on inferences and interpretations of non-observable cognitive processes which may undermine the accessibility of some of these forms of analysis. Whatever the approach taken, it is clear that data collection and analysis are resource-intensive and time-consuming. The stages of the CWA for such a focused scope (only alarm handling amongst the many ECRO activities), took approximately 6 months in this study. However, if the researcher is relatively familiar with the domain or is accompanied by an engineer with knowledge of the domain, an AH can be developed in a matter of days or weeks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954409712465709">15</xref></sup> To get around this, only a few CWA stages may be carried out or, as in our case, only certain job functions in a domain are analysed. This paper has described only one of the functions of ECR operation (alarm handling) and it might have proved impossible or of limited use to apply CWA to elaborate every ECR function. The risk is that by focussing on only one aspect of the system, critical interdependencies between people, technology and functions within the overall system will be lost. For example, a fuller understanding of how people handle alarms might be gained from the joint analysis of their everyday monitoring, planning and optimisation activities. Therefore, it may have been valuable to conduct a WDA of the control system as a whole, in order to determine these interdependencies and also to prioritise the functions which require more analysis.</p>
<p>The analysis has identified strategies adopted by rail ECROs to cope with information presentation inefficiencies during handling alarms. The strategies are: categorising, filtering, similarity matching, extrapolation, and trial and error. The last three (similarity matching, extrapolation, and trial and error) are tightly coupled with the operator’s experience and local knowledge and alarm systems should be designed to better support them (e.g. providing historical and statistical information adjacent to the alarm). Ultimately, the strategies can be mapped to particular processing modes, which can inform design requirements.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0954409712465709">25</xref></sup> They also demonstrate potential risks; for example, when extrapolation may be leading operators to apply inappropriate prior knowledge.</p>

<sec id="sec20-0954409712465709" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This paper has described use of the five stages of CWA in the context of rail ECR operations, and particularly handling alarms. Various data collection methods such as field study, video recording analysis, observational checklist, talk aloud and semi-structured interviews were applied to identify, structure and interpret the cognitive behaviours of operators while alarm handling in a rail ECR. The process of data collection, analysis and interpretation suggests that CWA has value in this case in supporting an understanding of those domain features, and subsequent cognitive implications, which can inform design. However, we recommend flexibility in the way that the stages of CWA are implemented and indeed which stages are used in order that the study resource expended is proportionate to the value of design life cycle insights gained.</p>
