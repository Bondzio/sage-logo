<abstract>
<p>Lyme disease is a tick-borne illness found throughout North America and other countries. Symptoms range from the physical and cognitive (e.g., severe fatigue; stomach, vision, and balance problems; memory loss; “Lyme fog”) to the social and emotional (e.g., withdrawal, behavior problems, mood swings, anxiety, shame). Gifted and talented students, like all students, are susceptible to the effects of Lyme disease. However, their experiences may be more intense and life altering, depending on the severity of the Lyme disease. In this article, the phenomenological experience of two gifted boys with Lyme disease gives educators, counselors, and parents insight into how this disease impacts the intellectual functioning, social status, and identity of gifted children with this bacterial illness. The author emphasizes the important role that educators, counselors, and parents have in understanding Lyme disease, recognizing the symptoms, and supporting gifted children and their families whose lives are changed by the bite of a tick. They may observe changes in academic performance, a decrease in school attendance, altered social status, an increase in maladaptive perfectionism, and existential depression in those affected gifted children. Potential program modifications, accommodations, and services for this particular group of twice-exceptional students are provided so that educators, counselors, and parents can work collaboratively to promote resiliency at the same time they enact specific strategies for gifted students recovering from Lyme disease.</p>

<p><italic>Zack and Sean are pseudonyms for two gifted boys with Lyme disease. The author wishes to thank them, their parents, and Zack’s teachers for their generosity in sharing their experiences</italic>.</p>
<p><italic>Seventh grade was not supposed to start this way for Zack: headaches, joint soreness, severe fatigue, trouble sleeping, waves of nausea, lack of ability to focus and remember, noise sensitivity, irritability, and feelings of hopelessness</italic>.</p>
<p><italic>The end of sixth grade and the summer were not so hot either. Bouts of strep throat and not feeling well meant many visits to many doctors. Different diagnoses were given, including parasites or postinfectious gastro paresis. Nothing helped Zack</italic>.</p>
<p><italic>He was no longer the bright, creative, 12-year-old preteen boy whose sharp wit delighted everyone. He needed a cane to walk, panic attacks were common, and he no longer believed he was at the top of his class. He was now “stupid.” Zack and his parents were in despair. In the fall, testing came back positive for Lyme disease</italic>.</p>
<p><italic>Sean knew all too well the symptoms that Zack experienced: fatigue, light and sound sensitivity, eye strain, heat sensitivity, sleep disorder, distractibility, memory retrieval and sequencing difficulties, tics, and monitoring of his responses. What a way to start high school! All because of Lyme disease</italic>.</p>

<title>What is Lyme Disease?</title>
<p>Lyme disease is the most common tick-borne disease in North America, and is found in all 50 states as well as Europe, Australia, China, Japan, and parts of the former Soviet Union. It is a bacterial illness caused by a “spirochete” spread by ticks when they bite the skin. Lyme disease can cause a rash, flu-like symptoms, migratory joint pain, neurological problems, and even skin, eye, and heart abnormalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1076217512465288">Lyme Disease, n.d</xref>.). The incidence is highest in two age groups: adults between 55 and 69 and children between 5 and 14, particularly boys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1076217512465288">Crowley, 2011</xref>). If begun early, treatment is most effective. However, for those like Zack and Sean, Lyme disease may become chronic and treatment varied and prolonged.</p>

<p><italic>Sean, a voracious reader, could no longer open a book and remember what he read. Writing became tortuous. Forget about math. Try to find the right word or phrase. Gone. Homework? Overwhelming. Don’t even think about it. Sleep? If only it happened. Can’t go to school regularly. Have to leave from class. No energy. Lights and sounds hurt. Terrible headaches that last for days. Can’t concentrate</italic>.</p>

<p><italic>Is Sean really sick? Some days he is right on target. Other days he is like the old Sean. How can we help him if we are not sure he is just trying to get out of work? He just does not look sick. What should we be looking for?</italic></p>
<p>If educators and counselors are to help gifted children recover from Lyme disease, they must develop a comprehensive knowledge of Lyme and how it manifests in the gifted student population. The first important aspect to understand is that Lyme disease is a multisystem illness. It affects cognitive, affective, social, and identity issues of individuals (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1076217512465288">Table 1</xref>). Perhaps the biggest issue they will encounter with a gifted student is the decline in personal functioning. What may be observed first is the significant cognitive dysfunction in their student.</p>

<p>Areas of cognitive impairment include attention and mental, memory, receptive language, expressive language, visuospatial processing, abstract reasoning, and speed of mental and motor processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1076217512465288">Rissenberg &amp; Chambers, 2008</xref>). Problems in these areas can impact note taking, conversations, reading comprehension, finding the right word, problem solving, making decisions, planning, and meeting deadlines.</p>
<p>For gifted students with Lyme disease, it may look like a switch has been abruptly turned off for intellectual tasks. Having been identified as very bright or gifted, their expectations are pretty well set for high-level performance in their classes. Their verbal precocity, rapid learning rate, depth of perspective, powers of concentration, complex thought processes, and facility of abstraction are seen and expected in their daily school lives. Lyme disease can change all that. Behaviors may be subtle or drastic.</p>
<p>Teachers and parents may observe changes in their once bright and productive gifted student. The following behaviors may be seen in the classroom, especially if Lyme disease is undiagnosed: lethargy, fatigue, speaking and writing difficulty, withdrawal from peers, problems learning new information, and attention problems. Early morning absences, declining school attendance, erratic academic performance, and lowered grades may also be noticed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1076217512465288">Blanchard, 2006</xref>). For some gifted students, a radical change in emotional status may occur because of their intense reactions to new and frightening sensitivities. Moodiness, anxiety, and depression often follow.</p>
<p>Counselors may see similar behaviors. They should be alert to gifted students who suddenly develop conduct problems or who have difficulty remaining in class. Sometimes gifted kids with Lyme disease may opt out of higher level classes because they are exhausted from dealing with medical problems associated with Lyme disease. What may be perceived as underachievement may be the consequences of having Lyme disease.</p>
<p>It is not unusual for teachers to hear a student talk about his or her “Lyme fog.” Some liken it to the difficulty those with an attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) experience—difficulty concentrating, learning new material, remembering, and organizing work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1076217512465288">Pietrucha, 2005</xref>). For those who had ADHD before they contracted Lyme disease, their ADHD behaviors can become exaggerated by the illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1076217512465288">Berenbaum, 2002/2003</xref>).</p>

<title>Social</title>
<p><italic>Zack’s misery was reflected in his remarks whenever he talked about Lyme: I don’t fit anymore. Everybody’s always looking at me because of my cane. I can’t run and play with my friends at recess anymore. I know I’m more sarcastic now. I just feel so alone sometimes</italic>.</p>
<p>Educators and counselors may observe withdrawal from peers and more behavioral problems in their gifted students with Lyme disease. It is not unusual for their competitive drive to decrease dramatically, or they may attempt to be more competitive to demonstrate that they still can do well in spite of feeling terrible. For gifted boys and girls who are athletic, this is especially difficult because their teammates may also be their social peers. No longer able to even take physical education, they have lost their bearings and perhaps their social network.</p>
<p>Like Zack, some gifted students with Lyme disease may become sarcastic and rude to their classmates at times, because their social status has changed. They are acutely aware they are no longer like their energetic, bright peers who may seem oblivious to their suffering. The loss of their safety net can be devastating for gifted students with Lyme disease who are more introverted. Issues of abandonment and lack of social support only add to their intense hatred of their situation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1076217512465288">
<title>Emotional/Identity Loss</title>
<p><italic>It’s like an episode of the Twilight Zone. I used to know who I was. Bright, funny, kind. Now, I’m stupid, sad and mad, and I don’t feel much like being nice to anyone. I can’t do my schoolwork. I feel panicked and angry all the time. I am so drained. It’s just not fair</italic>.</p>
<p>Characteristics and behaviors associated with giftedness may become magnified as the symptoms of Lyme disease intensify. The irrational beliefs of maladaptive perfectionism can increase the stress and anxiety they may normally feel into deeper isolation, depression, and guilt. Like Zack and Sean, gifted students who have a high need for independence may deny offers of help. Their sensitivity for nuances may plunge them into intense and exhausting introspection.</p>
<p>Children with chronic Lyme disease have higher rates of anxiety and mood and behavioral disorders than children without the illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1076217512465288">Tager et al., 2001</xref>). If a gifted boy or girl is identified as having Lyme disease, teachers, counselors, and parents should look for loss, mourning, underachievement, and identity shift issues.</p>
<p>Like other gifted students with Lyme disease, Sean experienced intense loss. He grieved the loss of his health, social life, ability to learn rapidly, to comprehend what he read, to write well, and to enjoy life as a typical bright teenager. He discovered, as the crying boy stated in the film Under Our Skin—A Story of Lyme Disease, “The worst part is knowing you’re not a normal person.” Sean believed his personality was changing. He was no longer who he was before. He became distraught and frightened.</p>
<p>Since Lyme entered Zack’s life, he worried constantly. It was becoming even harder for him to determine what role he should have as a seventh grader. He started middle school as the funny, laid-back, intelligent, clever, everybody’s friend. Now he could not shake the questions that haunt gifted kids with Lyme disease. Would he ever get back his health, social status, and especially his “smartness?” When or would his amazing ability to analyze and synthesize ever return? Would he have to suffer the humiliation of no longer being the bright, mellow, quick-witted Zack who did so little to receive high praise for nominal performances? He worried that his teachers now saw him as lazy instead of who he really was—a really bright “imposter” who was very sick.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1076217512465288">Kerr and Cohn (2001)</xref> discussed the challenges of gifted boys, including managing the passage into manhood without feeling isolated and learning ways to connect with their communities, and not disengaging from them. Because he was so sick and could not make the required intense commitment, Zack had to postpone his bar mitzvah, his initiation rite into manhood. It was another loss and another blow to his identity. He was at risk for alienation and existential depression.</p>
<p>At the time when most gifted students are starting the process of separating from their parents, Sean became physically dependent on his parents. There were days when he could not walk up stairs without their assistance or carry his backpack into school. He felt guilt for his parents’ ever-present anxiety and fears, their financial burden for medical bills, and the disruption of family plans. His relationship with his younger sibling became even more tenuous. Sean often obsessed in amazement how the bite of one small tick was causing such devastation in his life. There were days when all he wanted to do was just sleep, because he was overwhelmed with racing thoughts. He felt so depressed.</p>

<title>Treatment and Recommendations</title>
<sec id="section7-1076217512465288">
<title>Physical</title>
<p><italic>Zack’s treatment is diverse and, to him, ever changing. He struggles with nausea, diarrhea, itching, fatigue, insomnia, and sound sensitivity when he has “Herx” reactions. Stomachaches are constant. He had to overcome his obsessive fear of giving blood and have a peripherally inserted central catheter line installed for IV therapy. Physical therapy and acupuncture were eventually added to his list of treatment strategies</italic>.</p>
<p>Because Lyme disease is a multisystem illness, it requires a variety of treatments, including medical, psychological, and educational approaches for children and adolescents. Depending on the severity of the Lyme disease, medical treatment may encompass high doses of antibiotics and other medications that may cause gastrointestinal (GI) problems.</p>
<p>The flare up of symptoms when spirochetes are being killed off by antibiotics is called a Jarisch-Herxheimer (Herx) reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1076217512465288">Bransfield, 2005</xref>). More and worse symptoms may develop resulting in different treatments. For many students, this can be even more distressing, because they believe that medical management should be making them better not worse. Some kids with GI problems may develop eating disorders because they feel so sick when they eat. Others may self-medicate with stimulants to gain energy or deal with loss of focus. Some use alcohol, marijuana, or other drugs to escape their physical and emotional pain related to Lyme disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1076217512465288">Berenbaum, 2002/2003</xref>).</p>
<p>A comprehensive approach is necessary to treat chronic symptoms of Lyme disease. Not just medical treatments are involved, but also daily routines, school, peer relationships, family dynamics, exercise, and psychotherapy are required for recovery. Normalizing the circadian rhythm, depression, and anxiety often entail psychopharmacological or alternative medicine interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1076217512465288">Bransfield, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Educators, counselors, and parents need to look beyond the behaviors they observe in a gifted child or adolescent identified with Lyme disease. Like Zack and Sean, they should be considered twice exceptional, that is, they demonstrate giftedness and have a medical exceptionality. Understanding the physical healing process is critical for those who work with gifted kids who have a chronic illness, because it impacts how they are treated—intellectually, socially, and emotionally in the classroom.</p>
<p>In addition to late arrival or early dismissal from school, students with Lyme disease need the attendance policy waived during times of increased illness. Access to the school nurse for medication treatment and during times of “herxing” should be available. Exemption or reduced participation in physical education may also be necessary.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1076217512465288">
<title>Intellectual</title>
<p><italic>How should we deal with Sean in school? We feel so uncertain about how to proceed. We want to help him but he’s so inconsistent in his attendance and performance. One hour he’s fine, the next he looks like he’s “faking it.” He’s just not doing enough work. Should he drop his advanced courses? Should he be retained?</italic></p>
<p>Because of the nature of Lyme disease, helping a gifted student who has it requires a great deal of flexibility in developing a school plan to meet their needs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1076217512465288">Berenbaum (2002/2003)</xref> noted that school staff must look at the functional impairment of a student with Lyme disease in determining interventions. The long-term plan is for the student to get permanently better, whereas the short-term plan examines accommodations.</p>
<p>Before plans can be implemented, the issue of baseline performance for children with Lyme disease must be addressed. For pre-teens and adolescents identified as gifted when they were young, a baseline of intellectual, academic, social, and emotional abilities and performance may be well established before they contracted Lyme. For preschool and young children, however, finding a baseline may be complicated unless formal testing for giftedness occurred. A reliance on behavioral checklists may be the best way to determine pre-Lyme gifted behaviors.</p>
<p>School psychologists can help determine the functioning levels of gifted students with Lyme disease or who are suspected of having the illness. This is especially true in areas endemic with Lyme. Because of the difficulty in finding an accurate diagnosis, it is important that testing goes beyond that of a possible attention deficit, behavior problem, or even autism. Six areas of difficulty to be examined include (a) attention and concentration, (b) speed and efficiency of processing information, (c) learning and memory, (d) auditory processing and language expression, (e) planning and organization, and (f) multitasking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1076217512465288">Shea &amp; Leventhal, n.d</xref>.).</p>
<p>Children and adolescents with Lyme disease often have significantly lower scores on attention, concentration, perceptual, and organizational abilities. Deficits in working memory, visual memory, mental tracking, and visual and auditory processing are also seen in this population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1076217512465288">Tager et al., 2001</xref>). When gifted children are found to have difficulties in these areas, it should be a red flag to evaluators that perhaps a once healthy, highly functioning gifted child may have Lyme disease, and a referral should be made to a physician specializing in tick-borne illness.</p>
<p>Functional impairment in school, at home, and within peer groups must be explored using formal instruments, observation, and interviews. This will help the school staff, parents, and gifted student understand the child’s cognitive strengths and weaknesses and determine what services are required.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1076217512465288">
<title>Informal or Formal Accommodations?</title>
<p>Once the impact of Lyme disease on a gifted student is determined, a plan needs to be developed. A Section 504 plan, which is a federal civil rights legislation, or an Individual Education Program (IEP) through a district’s Committee on Special Education may be appropriate as a formal plan. Depending on the severity of the educational impact, a gifted child with chronic Lyme disease may qualify as “other health impaired,” “learning disabled,” or in extreme cases, “multiple disabilities” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1076217512465288">Tagliabue, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The key to determining academic services for gifted students with Lyme disease is to provide high-level or “gifted” programming in their areas of strength and at the same time recognizing their Lyme-related difficulties. Placement in classes or courses should be based on a gifted student’s pre-Lyme abilities. Quality of performance is more important than quantity according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1076217512465288">Smith (2005)</xref>, who described the Lyme experience in children as “transitory learning disabilities” because of the frequency of change in symptoms. Home instruction and part-time home/school instruction while using advanced materials or taking honors and advanced courses need to be considered.</p>
<p>Modifications or accommodations should address areas of disability. Effective classroom practices can be used to address the instructional, physical, and emotional aspects of a supportive learning environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1076217512465288">Baum &amp; Owens, 2004</xref>). Many are similar to those provided for students with ADHD or cognitive impairments who have difficulty processing what is being taught, trouble focusing or sustaining concentration, and problems with memory and producing schoolwork (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1076217512465288">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<p>An important but often overlooked part of a student’s IEP is training for all staff who interact with the student. Under the <italic>Support for School Personnel on Behalf of Student</italic> section, it should state that an annual presentation or in-service on Lyme disease as manifested in gifted students be held for the student’s teachers and staff, including bus drivers and playground and lunchroom monitors.</p>
<p>Some schools, like Zack’s private school, opt to create an informal plan that is not dependent on extensive testing or formal meetings. The administrators and teachers were willing to work with Zack, his parents, and an educational consultant with experience in working with gifted students with Lyme disease.</p>
<p>The unofficial arrangements for Zack included a flexible school schedule dependent on his symptoms; abbreviated or excused homework assignments; exemption from physical education; watching videos or films for content input; oral presentations instead of written output; opportunities to go to the school library when he felt sensorily, intellectually, or emotionally overwhelmed; and a summer tutoring plan that allowed him to demonstrate his knowledge of content and skills covered in his classes.</p>
<p>Not all gifted students with Lyme disease are as fortunate as Zack. Sean did not fare as well. Although he had an IEP through special education, his district refused to acknowledge his need for advanced services with accommodations. Eventually, a private school that understands twice-exceptional adolescents became a safe haven for Sean where his healing process included regaining his trust of educators.</p>

<p><italic>My friends help. I have energy for them. One of my friends has diabetes. She gets it. That’s why I like talking to her. Playing my guitar calms me down. I can take it to school and play with two guys during recess. Kids notice it, not my cane</italic>.</p>
<p>Social isolation is a critical concern for gifted students with Lyme disease, because having strong social support is an important aspect of learning to cope with Lyme disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1076217512465288">Oderberg, 2009</xref>). The comfortable status that was enjoyed among their peers, especially in their strength areas, may diminish with their increased symptoms. Teachers, counselors, and parents should be aware that this loss of normal socialization may result in mourning for what was once a secure social environment.</p>
<p>Gifted students who are sensitive may develop a “protective veneer” when they are teased or criticized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1076217512465288">Silverman, 2003</xref>). Zack, like other gifted kids with Lyme disease, experienced the push–pull of wanting to be accepted, yet tried to distance himself from hurtful comments by classmates that there was something wrong with him. Just using a cane in school distressed Zack. He became more self-conscious about being ill and expected to be laughed at or rejected. He began to withdraw from social interactions and developed an intense desire to be with those who are not judgmental or who understand what it is like to have a chronic illness.</p>
<p>Teachers and counselors can help gifted students with Lyme disease navigate their social status within the school environment. Zack’s increased stress about not playing with his friends at recess was recognized by his music teacher who loaned him a guitar to use. This helped increase his status among his peers. He became a “musician” and not the “sick kid who walked funny.”</p>
<p>When the usual support systems begin to change for gifted students with Lyme disease, teachers and counselors can offer guidance to their classmates. Informally or formally they can help kids see that flexibility is necessary when a friend has Lyme disease and that sometimes they may have to accommodate their classmate’s physical and emotional needs.</p>
<p>Mentioning resources on the Internet and using bibliotherapy to help gifted kids like Zack prevent social isolation are other strategies educators, counselors, and parents can use. The LymeTeens link on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.LymePA.org">www.LymePA.org</ext-link> is one way for teens with Lyme to share their experiences.</p>

<title>Emotional/Identity</title>
<p><italic>You mean I’m not lazy? That my teachers do understand? That they’ll accept my work even if it isn’t perfect? I like my self-portrait I did in art class, especially my sunglasses. Yeah, I’m hiding behind my sunglasses. That’s just how I feel right now</italic>.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1076217512465288">Hébert (2011)</xref> noted that identity is one of the most critical elements in understanding the social and emotional development of gifted individuals and that context plays a significant role in shaping identity. This is especially true for those who have chronic illnesses, for they may develop a distorted image of themselves as they become sicker. Once smart and flourishing. Now a loser.</p>
<p>The expectations of the ideal self may be shattered for gifted students, because of the changes that come with Lyme disease. The goal is to find a balanced expression of self at a time when both collapsed expression or exaggerated expression surface in the face of a chronic illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1076217512465288">Neihart &amp; Jacobsen, 2000</xref>). Knowing that a gifted boy or girl with Lyme disease may go from an honestly introspective self-awareness (balanced) to self-negating or self-loathing (collapsed) can help educators, counselors, and parents understand the emotional experience of being ill. For Zack, his former exceptional concentration changed to both scattered (collapsed) and exhausted, and burned out (exaggerated). His offbeat sense of humor went from quick-witted and exuberant (balanced) to sarcastic and cynical (exaggerated).</p>
<p>Gifted students with Lyme disease need help managing their stress and grief. Teachers and parents are urged to look beyond the happy façade that some gifted students project when they are in distress about the way things used to be (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1076217512465288">Peterson, 2009</xref>). For those suffering from Lyme disease, validation of their feelings increases their ability to cope. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1076217512465288">Peterson (2009)</xref> said that thoughtful questions like, “You don’t seem to have your usual energy. Is something getting in the way?” (p. 6) may lead to a conversation about what is happening in their life or can provide a sense that somebody in school or at home notices and cares.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>“When the usual support systems begin to change for gifted students with Lyme disease, teachers and counselors can offer guidance to their classmates.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Zack was fortunate that he felt connected with one of his teachers who expressed confidence in Zack’s abilities to overcome his Lyme disease and be productive. Although he could no longer play soccer, private lessons strengthened his passion for guitar and his belief that one day he would be an excellent performer. Sean also bonded with one of his high school teachers at a time when others were dismissive of his struggles. The teacher knew firsthand the suffering of Lyme disease, because he too struggled with it everyday. Sean’s strong interest in human rights was nurtured and modeled by his parents. Their willingness to advocate for his rights with the school district demonstrated skills in problem solving.</p>
<p>Both Zack and Sean felt the sting of not being “normal” and the loss of their fluctuating high capabilities. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1076217512465288">Kane and Fiedler (2008)</xref> proposed guidelines for teachers and parents working with gifted students who are dealing with loss. They include reducing external pressures but being clear about what is negotiable and nonnegotiable in terms of assignments: maximizing student choice, flexibility, and alternatives; conferencing regularly; and involving them in educational decision making.</p>
<p>Other strategies they propose consist of providing multiple opportunities for self-expression emphasizing creativity, using books and movies as entry points for conversation and discussion, and creating emotionally safe spaces when feelings are overwhelming. For Zack, it was the school library. Sean headed to the nurse’s office when he felt intensely frustrated.</p>
<p>Educators, counselors, and parents can also use strategies from <italic>Peak Performance for Smart Kids: Strategies and Tips for Ensuring School Success</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1076217512465288">Neihart, 2008</xref>). Zack responded positively to deep breathing and progressive relaxation to get him through blood tests, polling his energy levels to help manage his mood and learning how to be more optimistic.</p>
<p>Sean found the self-talk note cards guide in <italic>Anxiety-Free Kids</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1076217512465288">Zucker, 2009</xref>) to be helpful when he was particularly anxious. He used his messages to get through grueling days at school. “I am uncomfortable and nervous, but I can handle it.” “I don’t like the anxiety, but it is not dangerous.” “It is my choice to be relaxed or to be anxious. I am choosing to be relaxed. Let me start by calming my breath.” Another powerful message that can be used is, “I will cope the best that I can with my illness while anticipating my recovery” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1076217512465288">Oderberg, 2009</xref>, p. 22).</p>
<p>Encouraging gifted students to become experts on their Lyme disease is another strategy to reduce their anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1076217512465288">Schuler, 2007</xref>). Knowledge of the disease with its varied symptoms and treatments can be a powerful way for them to understand themselves, recognize their strengths and needs, and advocate for themselves. Focusing on what they can do at the same time accepting their limitations can help them let go of their losses.</p>
<p>Counselors are in a unique position to help gifted students affected by Lyme disease. They can help teachers and parents determine the extent of distress by using the Risk and Resiliency Continuum and Strengths and Challenges checklists developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1076217512465288">Trail (2011)</xref>.</p>
<p>Once the level of distress and willingness to work by a gifted student with Lyme disease is determined, approaches that are based on a gifted student’s level of internal/external locus of control can be used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1076217512465288">Strop, 2002</xref>). Strategies for students with an internal locus of control include brainstorming of problem-solving approaches, reflective listening, affirmations, monitoring irrational thoughts, meditation and relaxation techniques, visualization, and self-help books.</p>
<p>Group counseling, discussions, and psychodrama with other gifted students with chronic illness issues can help bright students with Lyme disease who have more of an external locus of control. Reading how other bright teens deal with Lyme disease can help them on their path to recovery and ease the loneliness of suffering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1076217512465288">Kemp, 2006</xref>). <italic>Lyme Times</italic> has a column in each issue called “In Our Own Words: Stories of Children and Adolescents” that highlights how others cope.</p>

<p>A chronic illness in a child or adolescent can cause parents to become depressed, isolated, and worn out. This is especially true as adolescents with chronic illness long for privacy and resent their dependency on their parents for their medical care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1076217512465288">Leis-Newman, 2011</xref>). For parents of gifted children and adolescents with Lyme disease, a primary issue is how to support their ill child’s efforts to seek independence while taking proper safety measures for treating the illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1076217512465288">Berenbaum, 2002/2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Counselors and educators can help families of gifted students with Lyme disease by becoming educated on the illness. It is important they understand the impact it has on family life by showing empathy and compassion to parents. Normal family life is disrupted, financial burdens may occur, family plans must change, siblings may become resentful, and worry may saturate the household (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1076217512465288">Berenbaum, 2005</xref>). The main caregiver may experience anxiety, fear, and lack of support. Parents of a gifted child with Lyme disease may grieve for what might have been. Their expectations of success may have to shift, just as their children must come to terms with a new and, hopefully, temporary definition of accomplishment.</p>
<p>Learning to pace one’s activity level is crucial to coping with Lyme disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1076217512465288">Oderberg, 2009</xref>). Teachers and counselors can work with parents to ensure that there is a balance between activity and rest. Both Zack and Sean found out that the price for overdoing physical activity was a worsening of their symptoms that resulted in a decrease of mental functioning. When there is communication between home and school about activities and levels of energy, it will increase understanding about what can realistically be accomplished on a daily, weekly, or long-term basis.</p>
<p>Educators and counselors can also provide resources to families of gifted students with Lyme disease. Books, <italic>Lyme Times</italic>, and films on Lyme disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1076217512465288">Wilson, 2008</xref>) can be made available as well as referral information for psychotherapy. Resources for families to use at home, such as distance learning programs for gifted students, can help reduce the anxiety parents may feel if they have to homeschool their gifted children. Counselors can also encourage parents to become emotional coaches to their children and teens, so that the intense emotions, especially the anxiety and rages, can be better managed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1076217512465288">Fonesca, 2011</xref>). Parents are also encouraged to share resources about Lyme disease with school personnel.</p>
<p>Helping parents network with other families can be crucial in preventing social isolation. To improve communication and decrease everyone’s stress, school districts can designate a teacher or counselor who is knowledgeable about Lyme disease to act as a liaison between school staff, special education and gifted education, and families affected by Lyme disease.</p>
<p>As they work with gifted students who are ill, counselors can observe their behaviors. If the progression and the symptoms of the Lyme disease become more intense, they may need to refer for more in-depth therapy regarding issues of loss, mourning, and identity. Compiling a list of therapists with experience in working gifted children and adolescents who have tick-borne or chronic illness is another way counselors can be of service to families.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Lyme disease, a tick-borne illness, affects children and adolescents throughout our country. When it strikes gifted students, their sense of identity as successful, bright, socially accepted, and emotionally healthy children and adolescents may be strongly impacted.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1076217512465288">Hébert’s (2011)</xref> writings on factors that influence a strong belief in self for gifted students can provide insight into what can be done to help those with Lyme disease in school settings. Specific strategies include encouraging involvement in extracurricular activities that support talent development, facilitating discussion groups, reflections and journal prompts, and photo elicitations. The implementation of these suggestions may need to be adapted for a gifted student with Lyme disease.</p>
<p>There are other ways educators, counselors, and parents can help. Knowing the signs of Lyme disease is critical. Teachers and counselors are urged to contact the school nurse if their gifted students begin to ask to leave class more often to see the nurse. Parents need to let school personnel know if they notice additional indicators. Gastrointestinal symptoms, dizziness, vision problems, profound fatigue, frequent and prolonged headaches, weight gain or loss, discomfort in extremities or the soles of the feet, and sensitivity to sound or light may all be warning signs that Lyme disease is present.</p>
<p>Understanding how formal and informal school accommodations can be used to help a gifted student with Lyme disease is important to ensure his or her academic success. Educators and counselors also need to be attentive to changes in the social environment that may be perceived as hostile to a gifted boy or girl who is chronically ill.</p>
<p>An awareness by adults of the emotional healing that is a necessary part of recovery from Lyme disease can help gifted students realize they are not alone as they struggle to maintain their identities. Listening, accepting their concerns and not minimizing their intense feelings, and giving emotional support can help foster resiliency and lessen the possibility of depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1076217512465288">Webb, Gore, Amend, &amp; DeVries, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Educators, counselors, and parents can help build resilience in gifted students with Lyme disease by integrating approaches for increasing students’ ability to bounce back from adversity: establish a sense of trust by returning to daily routines quickly, limit students’ exposure to adults’ intense emotional reactions, nurture and strengthen children’s relationships, support children as they learn to lean on their faith, and tell stories, especially stories of courage and selflessness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1076217512465288">Neihart, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>They can also promote the resiliency of these twice-exceptional students by highlighting needed skills for intrapersonal relationships, interpersonal relationships, increased competency, and working effectively with persons in authority (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1076217512465288">Lloyd-Zanni, 2007</xref>). As these students struggle to deal with their symptoms of Lyme disease, they need to learn how to set realistic long- and short-term goals, accept constructive criticism for work that may be less in quantity and quality than before, and seek help when necessary.</p>
<p>Finally, one major way that educators, counselors, and parents can help is through prevention of Lyme disease. Advocating for staff and peer sensitivity awareness training by Lyme-literate educators, doctors, or psychotherapists; use of a <italic>Lyme disease education curriculum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1076217512465288">Blanchard, 2006</xref>); providing community awareness programs; and exploring how students are exposed to Lyme disease in the school environment can reduce the number of tick-borne illnesses. Avoiding tick-infested areas and informing families what attire kids should wear as they play outdoors at school or go on field trips can be examined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1076217512465288">CALDA, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>As more cases of Lyme disease are found throughout the country, educators, counselors, and parents can take a lead role in helping gifted students cope with this tick-borne illness. The experiences of Zack and Sean, both gifted boys, can serve as models for school personnel and parents on how to promote a consistent team approach in dealing with gifted students infected by a tick-borne illness. Educating themselves and their schools will prevent more gifted students such as Zack and Sean from suffering the physical, social, and emotional pain of Lyme disease.</p>
