      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>This article explores the role of gender in the formation of cultural capital in
        transnational contexts, focusing on how migrant mothers strategically deploy cultural
        resources from one national setting in another. Mothers play an important role in
        transmitting, maintaining or enhancing cultural capital from one generation to the next. In
        migration they are faced with the challenge of ensuring the cultural resources they transmit
        to their children are validated: a habitus ‘infused with an ethnic group’s culture may
        provide an individual with cultural capital that counts within the ethnic group but means
        very little outside it’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1350506812466612">Hall,
          1992</xref>: 271). Mothers’ agency can bridge this gap between the differential value
        attributed to cultural resources in different national settings. Drawing on a study of
        European migrant mothers in London, the article opens up new areas of enquiry for migration
        and gender studies, and contributes to theorizing cultural capital on the transnational
        level. Bourdieusian notions of cultural capital are developed with reference to nationally
        bounded cultural fields. I demonstrate how some mothers engage in transnational cultural
        currency speculation and argue that they engender transnational social spaces.</p>
      <p>The article shows how class and ethnically privileged migrant mothers can strategically
        deploy their transnational cultural resources to compensate for shortcomings of economic
        capital and of local cultural and social capital. I further suggest that these transnational
        cultural resources can also be mobilized to accrue added value to their children’s
        education. Mothers can make strategic use of the differential valuation of cultural
        resources in nationally bounded settings, engaging in transnational currency speculation of
        cultural resources. As they convert educational investment in their children into
        credentials in the national setting where they expect the highest returns, they construct
        themselves as players in a transnational social space.</p>
      <p>The first section introduces the empirical study, then I discuss how research on
        transnational migration has addressed cultural capital, particularly focusing on
        Bourdieusian approaches and the treatment of gender and migration. Drawing on a case study
        from a research project on European mothers in London, I explore migrant mothers as
        engendering emergent transnational spaces through their speculation in cultural capital.</p>

    <sec id="section2-1350506812466612">
      <title>The study: European mothers in London</title>
      <p>Until the accession of new EU member states in 2004, migrants from other European countries
        to London have received relatively little attention, although they constitute a sizeable
        group (but see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1350506812466612">Favell, 2008</xref>;
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1350506812466612">White, 1998</xref>). In 2009, 669,000
        EU citizens were resident in London, making up 8.7% of the city’s population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1350506812466612">GLA, 2010</xref>: 3). More than half of
        children born in 2008 in London were born to migrant mothers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1350506812466612">4Children, 2011</xref>: 2). While London is certainly
        specific in its ethnic diversity, even in England and Wales, 7.3% of children born in 2010
        had EU-born mothers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1350506812466612">ONS, 2011</xref>).
        Thus, this group of children is numerically significant.</p>
      <p>This article draws on a study of European migrant mothers in London. In spring 2011 I
        conducted in-depth interviews with 30 mothers of school-aged children from a range of
        European Union member states, comprising Northern, Southern and Eastern European countries,
        to cover different migration experiences and a range of constructions of cultural and social
        difference. Interviewees were recruited through personal contacts at schools, Saturday
        schools, nurseries, mothers’ bookgroups and play groups. I asked potential interview
        partners directly or through the help of sponsors to participate. Ahead of the interview I
        emailed an information sheet introducing the research question and issues of research
        ethics. I had a very positive response, most mothers I approached were happy to participate,
        despite the fact that many suffered from a lack of time. This meant that some interviews had
        to be scheduled weeks in advance, some took place early on Sunday mornings, when family
        members were still resting, some late on a weekday evening, when children were already
        sleeping. The interviews were conducted in English, audio-recorded and fully transcribed.
        The semi-structured interviews covered migration trajectories, experiences of mothering and
        questions of participation and belonging, as I was interested in how migrant mothers
        position themselves and their children vis-a-vis British and European citizenship. The
        participants had been living in London between three and 25 years.</p>
      <p>While research on migrant families tends to focus on low paid, ethnicized non-European
        migrants this study contributes a different perspective: all the women were white, European
        and heterosexual, most identified as middle class. During fieldwork the significance of
        issues of cultural capital emerged, since many interviewees were professionally engaged or
        volunteered in the culture producing sector, e.g. as teachers, lecturers, in publishing, as
        artists, designers. In addition many were ‘voracious’ cultural participants, frequently
        participating in a wide range of out-of-home activities, often in high cultural forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1350506812466612">Katz-Gerro and Sullivan, 2010</xref>).
        Frequently, this also included their children.</p>
      <p>The interviewees were able to benefit from intra-European mobility and thus did not
        encounter difficulties in terms of migration regulations or in the validation of their
        qualifications, they saw migration as offering new professional, personal and cultural
        opportunities (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1350506812466612">Favell, 2008</xref>).
        Moreover, they were able to draw on the ‘cultural capital of whiteness’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1350506812466612">Lareau and Horvat, 1999</xref>) that partly
        gave them access to privileged social positions and networks. Yet, their migration
        trajectory meant that in some instances and fields they lacked local capital and what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1350506812466612">Hage (1998</xref>: 57) calls ‘national
        capital’, that is particular cultural and physical resources, which are politically
        recognized as legitimizing a person’s claim to national belonging. Studying the experiences
        of privileged migrants matters, because it elucidates and can deconstruct the processes of
        producing and validating particular forms of cultural capital, challenging the normalization
        of privilege as merely based on competences.</p>
      <p>Enhancing our understanding of how middle-class, ethnically privileged migrants experience
        cultural difference can help to disaggregate the interrelation of national cultural capital
        and racism. This study shows the contradictions between the progressive potential of
        destabilizing the privileges of nationally bounded cultural capital, on one hand, and the
        enhancement of ethnic and class privileges by reinscribing them on a European transnational
        level on the other.</p>

    <sec id="section3-1350506812466612">
      <title>Transnational migration and cultural capital</title>
      <p>In their influential proposition for a transnational analytic frame, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1350506812466612">Glick Schiller et al. (1992)</xref> make a case for
        researching migrants as participants in two societies, within a globalizing system, focusing
        on migrants’ social relationships and positionings as ‘fluid and dynamic’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1350506812466612">1992</xref>: 8). They argue that migrants
        use these new transnational spaces by translating ‘the economic and social position gained
        in one political setting into political, social and economic capital in another’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1350506812466612">1992</xref>: 12). Glick Schiller et al.
        caution against cultural reductionism as cultural capital is always negotiated in hegemonic
        struggles. In a system of nation-states, transnational forms of culture always risk being
        appropriated into nationalized versions. Building on this framework I outline the role of
        gender, and mothering in particular, in engendering transnational social fields.</p>
      <p>Not all theories of transnationalism pay enough attention to the contested and dynamic
        character of cultural capital, instead they reify ethnicity as the determining basis for
        social solidarity. Intra-ethnic divisions of gender, generation, class and others are often
        glossed over in accounts of transnational cultural capital, although access to the resources
        of ethnic groups is internally stratified (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1350506812466612">Anthias, 2007</xref>). While some theorists recognize the
        central role of gender in producing social and cultural capital, they do not always pay
        adequate attention to the unequal access of gendered actors to these resources. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1350506812466612">Faist’s (1998)</xref> proposition that
        migrants make use of transnational networks of reciprocity and patterns of social exchange
        puts particular emphasis on kinship and family as resources that can be mobilized for
        economic benefit. Marriage strategies and the unpaid labour of women in family businesses
        are examples for strengthening intra-ethnic solidarity and expanding the social networks of
        migrant groups. In a similar vein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1350506812466612">Nee
          and Sanders (2001)</xref> suggest that women’s greater involvement in social networks
        creates ‘human cultural capital’ for the whole family. While these approaches treat gender
        differentiation as productive of collective resources, they do not explore the impact of
        gendered power relations on who can access and use such collective ethnic resources.</p>
      <sec id="section4-1350506812466612">
        <title>Bourdieusian notions of cultural capital in transnational migration studies</title>
        <p>This article draws on Bourdieusian notions of capital, exploring the role of power
          relations in the constitution and circulation of cultural capital. While the broader field
          of migration scholarship tends to draw on human capital approaches, studies of
          transnationalism have made use of Bourdieu’s work on fields and capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1350506812466612">Levitt and Glick Schiller, 2004</xref>).
          According to Bourdieu cultural capital appears in three states: embodied,
          institutionalized and objectified, I focus here on the former two. In the embodied state
          ‘cultivation, <italic>Bildung</italic>’ is incorporated as habitus, requiring an
          investment of time and ‘work on oneself (self-improvement), an effort that presupposes a
          personal cost’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1350506812466612">Bourdieu, 1986</xref>:
          244). Cultural capital in its institutionalized form includes formal educational
          credentials, which are most often accredited by national bodies and thus are nationally
          bounded. But perhaps more importantly, cultural capital also includes the acquisition of
          cultural practices and rules. Mothers are charged with the task of transmitting these
          within the family. As it is intergenerationally reproduced in the family, cultural capital
          has a quality of inheritance. ‘Because the social conditions of its transmission and
          acquisition are more disguised than those of economic capital it is predisposed to … be
          unrecognized as capital and recognised as legitimate competence’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1350506812466612">Bourdieu, 1986</xref>: 245).</p>
        <p>It is particularly important to be aware of the social constructedness of cultural
          capital when researching migration, since geographic and social trajectories of migrants
          can engender a mismatch of their cultural resources and the institutionalized and informal
          processes of recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1350506812466612">Bauder,
            2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1350506812466612">Erel, 2009</xref>;
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1350506812466612">Nohl, 2006</xref>). Bourdieu argues
          that cultural capital only exists in relation to particular fields in which cultural
          resources are activated, validated and converted into capital. Here I explore how migrant
          women’s engagement in transnational social spaces relates to the emergence of
          transnational social fields in the Bourdieusian sense. Although referring to gender and
          ethnic differences in passing, Bourdieu’s model of the field is based on a nationally
          closed cultural universe. Yet, migration is located at the conjuncture of different class,
          social and nationally bounded systems and their gendered articulations, and migrants are
          positioned vis-a-vis the national formations of their country of residence and origin
            (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1350506812466612">Levitt and Glick Schiller,
            2004</xref>).</p>
        <p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1350506812466612">Hage (1998)</xref> has explored how
          migrants activate cultural capital in order to construct belonging to the ethnically
          dominant culture of the society of residence. His study on multiculturalism in Australia
          shows how migrants try to convert resources and assets such as English language knowledge,
          Australian accent, light skin, etc. into ‘national capital’. This ‘national capital’
          measures the degree to which migrants are ‘recognised as legitimately national by the
          dominant cultural grouping within the field’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1350506812466612">1998</xref>: 53). In the process of striving for
          recognition as possessing national capital, migrants change the field of national culture
          so that it becomes more inclusive of ‘well adapted’ migrants. This is both enabled by and
          results in a shifting emphasis from Anglo-centric to multiethnic versions of the nation.
          Hage’s account of migrants’ appropriation of ‘national capital’ is an important aspect of
          migrants’ strategies with respect to the society of residence. However, migrants also
          engage in struggles of producing and validating cultural capital within the migrant
          group.</p>
        <p>Elsewhere I have critiqued a tendency in migration studies to reify migrants’ cultural
          capital which assumes that migrants simply bring with them a package of cultural resources
          that may or may not fit with the ‘culture’ of the country of residence. Instead I propose
          the notion of migration-specific cultural capital, arguing that migrants also acquire new
          skills and resources in situ. Approaches that focus on migrants’ negotiations and
          struggles to validate these cultural resources as cultural capital within different scales
          of social relations, nationally and transnationally promise richer insights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1350506812466612">Erel, 2010</xref>).</p>
        <p>Some studies of transnational migration have employed a Bourdieusian notion of cultural
          capital to explain the incorporation of migrants into labour markets. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1350506812466612">Bauder (2003)</xref> has pointed out the
          significance of educational and professional institutions’ regulations and employers’
          norms for devaluing ‘foreign’ qualifications and work experience, reifying the national
          boundedness of institutionalized cultural capital and rendering citizenship as a form of
          cultural capital in the labour market (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1350506812466612">Bauder, 2008</xref>). Gendered and racialized habitus contributes to migrant women’s
          difficulties in having their skills recognized as cultural capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1350506812466612">Erel, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1350506812466612">Gutiérrez Rodríguez, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1350506812466612">Riaño and Baghdadi, 2007</xref>). Yet, some migrant women
          use their embodied cultural capital of language skills and cultural knowledge to access
          intercultural jobs, though these offer limited social mobility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1350506812466612">Liversage, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1350506812466612">Lutz, 1991</xref>). Whether and how migrants can activate
          cultural capital depends on their social position in national and global hierarchies:
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1350506812466612">Weiss (2005)</xref> found that
          western expatriates rarely require local validation, while third world migrants
          encountered obstacles in converting their transnationally validated credentials into
          career progression in Germany. When formal cultural capital does not enable access to
          skilled jobs, migrants may focus on validating their cultural capital in the country of
          origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1350506812466612">Kelly and Lusis, 2006</xref>).
          Thus far research has focused on the role of cultural capital in migrants’ labour market
          integration, here I shift the focus to look at migrants’ mothering practices as
          negotiating cultural capital.</p>

        <title>Women and cultural capital</title>
        <p>Women’s positioning with regard to cultural capital is ambiguous. While femininity can
          constitute a form of cultural capital for some women in some situations and in some
          fields, its value is limited in many other fields where masculinity continues to accrue
          more value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1350506812466612">Skeggs, 2001</xref>). Yet,
          women’s role in the family often makes them responsible for the production and circulation
          of symbolic capital as a form of status display. This takes place through reproductive
          work in the household, where women perform the task of transforming class into status
          membership through consumption and cultural participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1350506812466612">Collins, 1992</xref>: 219). Through these practices, women
          develop forms of class distinction, with middle-class women engaging in distancing work
          from working-class women. While there is some differentiation, this realm remains largely
          feminized. Gender is also a key dimension in what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1350506812466612">Collins (1992)</xref> terms the ‘culture production
          sector’: in their role in domestic reproduction, women are key consumers of the culture
          producing sector. Furthermore, women make up a large proportion of the workforce of the
          culture producing sector (e.g. education, arts, publishing), indeed this is significant
          for my argument, as many of the interviewees worked in such jobs. While economic capital
          allows access to cultural consumption, networks providing the information and know-how
          with which to participate in the cultural sector are also key. Gender is an important
          factor in explaining possible mismatch of economic and cultural capital, as educators and
          other professionals with access to the cultural production sector, occupations which are
          largely feminized, may be able to accumulate a high volume of cultural capital despite not
          necessarily commanding a high volume of economic capital. Mothers’ role mediates the
          relationship between economic and cultural capital. The ability to make small distinctions
          in cultural tastes is built up over generations, this capacity is reinforced by personal
          association with family and friends. Mothers are a crucial link for maintaining, enhancing
          or destabilizing the intergenerational reproduction, accumulation and transmission of
          cultural capital. However, a gendered analysis of women’s relation to cultural capital is
          not sufficient, it is important to take intra-gender differentiations of ethnicity and
          class into account. Thus, recent quantitative research in Britain shows that it is middle-
          and upper-class white women who have the time, financial and information resources to
          participate frequently in a range of cultural activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1350506812466612">Katz-Gerro and Sullivan, 2010</xref>). Furthermore, as my
          study shows, migration trajectory and the extent to which women command ‘national capital’
          also constitutes an intra-gender differentiation as the case study will detail.</p>
        <p>I am interested in migrant mothers’ strategies of validating cultural resources within
          nationally bounded and transnational contexts particularly in their negotiation of
          schooling. This is significant since both the family and the school are key institutions
          for equipping children with the cultural resources and the emotional orientation to
          identify as members of the nation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1350506812466612">Balibar, 1991</xref>). The following case study shows how migrant mothers can deploy
          class resources and European national belonging strategically in London to construct a
          transnational social space. The case study was chosen because the interviewee talked about
          transnational strategies which played a role in several of the migrant mothers’
          narratives. However, Tina’s strategy was perhaps the most explicit and her
          self-reflexivity allowed her to talk candidly about it. As such, this case study sheds
          light on emergent practices among intra-European migrants, rather than claiming
          representativity.</p>

      <title>Tina: Playing the national educational field with transnational cultural
        resources</title>
      <p>Tina is a German language teacher in a London secondary school. She is in her mid to late
        forties. She met her boyfriend on holiday and after graduating from high school migrated
        from Germany to England to join him. Subsequently they got married, her husband is a British
        mixed race professional.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1350506812466612">1</xref></sup>
        Due to his work they spent a couple of years in the 1980s in the US and in the 1990s in the
        Caribbean. They have three sons aged 21, 18 and 15: the oldest studies in a different
        English city, the younger two live at home and attend school. Tina is very committed to her
        paid job, where she is currently training for a more senior position, thus actively working
        on her institutionalized cultural capital. She is also investing in her embodied cultural
        capital as a ‘voracious’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1350506812466612">Katz-Gerro and
          Sullivan, 2010</xref>) cultural participant: she sings in three choirs and a band,
        regularly attends arts and musical events by German artists. She views this as following her
        personal interests, while also supporting her work. While she feels her children are ‘at
        home’ with their cultural background as British and Caribbean, as well as German, she has
        focused on teaching them German and helping them to access German cultural forms:</p>
      <speech>
        <speaker>Tina:</speaker>
        <p>Yes, well I spoke to them when they were born. I spoke to them always in German, and I
          think there’s two reasons. A) it’s great to have <italic>two</italic> languages. And they
          realize that’s a super advantage. And secondly, well maybe three reasons, secondly it’s
          part of their cultural heritage in terms of, for me. And thirdly, they need to talk to
          their relatives in Germany because my mum’s English is not very good. And when they go to
          Germany they need to be able to communicate and they are German, they have two
          passports.</p>
      </speech>
      <p>This view echoes a general consensus in my sample that multi-linguality is desirable.
        Interview partners supported this with a wide range of arguments referring to brain
        development, openness to cultural diversity, possible advantages in professional life. This
        builds on the ability of these European mothers to claim their languages of origin as useful
        and valuable cultural resources. It contrasts with the frequent devaluation of the home
        languages of racialized and ethnicized migrant mothers. Mothers take responsibility for
        enabling their children to access the language and cultural resources of their country of
        origin:</p>
      <speech>
        <speaker>Tina:</speaker>
        <p>I had always the baby group and they’ve always been taught German. They went to English
          primary schools, they’ve always been taught German to read and … we hired a teacher, so
          there was a couple of German mothers in the area, and we hired a teacher who would teach
          them after school, which was OK, which was good. They sort of learnt basic reading and
          writing and they could do that. Then, every summer we go to Germany …</p>
      </speech>
      <p>Furthermore mothers use these cultural resources to negotiate their own and their
        children’s social positioning, both within the mothers’ country of origin as well as the new
        country. This becomes particularly evident when exploring Tina’s story about choosing a
        secondary school for her children. Transition to secondary school is a key turning point in
        children’s educational history in the UK. While I cannot fully go into the complex
        sociological debates about this, I would like to briefly discuss why school choice is seen
        as so significant, particularly in large cities like London. In recent years politicians and
        public debate has increasingly emphasized that parents should be able to exercise choice
        about their children’s schooling. Yet, sociologists argue that the notion of ‘choice is a
        particularly middle-class way of operating in the world’ (Skeggs, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1350506812466612">Byrne, 2009</xref>: 426). In this sense, the
        policy of granting parental schooling choice has been critiqued for allowing middle-class
        parents to build on and develop advantageous access to what are considered good schools (cf.
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1350506812466612">Byrne, 2009</xref>). As there is fierce
        competition for ‘good schools’, parents develop strategies to access them. These strategies
        include moving house to be in the catchment area of the school, hiring private tutors,
        becoming actively involved in the life of religious institutions in order to access faith
        schools, etc. All of these strategies require an investment of considerable economic, time
        and social resources. When choosing a school for their children, middle-class parents rely
        on official reports, but perhaps more so, on their networks. While education is an important
        means to acquire qualifications, it is also important in acquiring class codes and cultural
        capital. ‘Much of the learning which the middle classes most care about is from fellow
        pupils as much as teachers. There is a desire to find a school filled with enough “people
        like us” who will teach children “how to be” ’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1350506812466612">Byrne, 2009</xref>: 427). These cultural codes are class
        specific, but at the same time racialized. Thus, quantitative research suggests that ethnic
        concentration in particular schools is a consequence of the school choices of parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1350506812466612">Byrne, 2009</xref>). Furthermore, schools
        have historically played an instrumental role in producing nationally codified knowledges
        and national identifications of students. In the same vein, of course, schools are also
        important sites for producing national dis-identifications and feelings of non-belonging for
        some students and their parents.</p>
      <p>In line with other middle-class mothers in London, the mothers in my study understood the
        significance of school choice for their children as enabling them access to good education,
        but also to the particular status, cultural, classed and racialized codes attached to ‘good
        schools’. Yet, in many instances, they were torn between two impulses. On one hand, many
        invoked an egalitarian ethos, arguing that all schools should provide good education so that
        the choice of school would not become a matter of competition. This is a widespread
        discourse in British public debates on education, but what is specific to migrant mothers is
        that in their narratives they gave examples from the education systems of their country of
        origin to evidence their claim that such a widely available public provision of quality
        education is achievable and can lead to positive educational experiences. On the other hand,
        they felt it was their responsibility as mothers to do ‘what is best for the child’ and
        therefore participate in the competition for good secondary schools. However, many felt at a
        loss as to how to evaluate the options. Most of the women I spoke to were privileged
        migrants, identifying as white and middle class. Their migration trajectory as European
        citizens was largely one of accessing new opportunities, rather than a struggle of
        overcoming migration legislation or deskilling. Yet, despite this smooth migration
        experience, many felt that they did not have the cultural know-how necessary to successfully
        negotiate the British educational system to their children’s full advantage. Indeed, while
        these mothers’ geographical mobility is enabled by their European citizenship status and
        their cultural capital of whiteness allows them a privileged inclusion as migrants, their
        social trajectories of transnational mobility mean that there is a mismatch between their
        cultural capital and the institutional and informal validations since classed and racialized
        habitus is articulated in nationally specific ways. While positioned centrally in some
        regards, the migrant mothers lack ‘ontological complicity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1350506812466612">Bourdieu and Wacquant, 2007</xref>: 127–128): <disp-quote>
          <p>… when habitus encounters a social world of which it is the product, it is like a ‘fish
            in water’: it does not feel the weight of the water, and it takes the world about itself
            for granted … the world encompasses me (<italic>me comprend</italic>) but I comprehend
            it (<italic>je le comprends</italic>) precisely <italic>because</italic> it comprises
            me. It is because this world has produced me, because it has produced the categories of
            thought that I apply to it, that it appears to me as self-evident.</p>
        </disp-quote></p>
      <p>This shows how privileged positioning in the field is normalized as competence in
        navigating the field: ‘Those who are immediately adapted to the demands of the game … have
        an incarnate sense that arises from the synchrony between their habitus, its social
        trajectory and the institutional space’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1350506812466612">Puwar, 2004</xref>: 127). School choice requires ‘sufficient cultural capital – the
        information and specific competence – to decode the local market; to make judgements about
        the state of the market often five or even ten years into the future’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1350506812466612">Reay and Lucey, 2003</xref>: 126). Many mothers in this
        study felt like a fish out of water, unable to draw on these implicit, specifically British
        cultural knowledges on evaluating schools. This related to their insecurity on where and how
        classed and racialized boundaries are drawn, a highly effective though unspoken process.
        They lacked a ‘feel for the game’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1350506812466612">Bourdieu and Wacquant, 2007</xref>: 128) that enabled them to understand their own and
        others’ positioning in the field of education, as well as a grasp of the options of
        repositioning themselves and their children advantageously. This feel for the game is not
        based on conscious intentionality and discourse. It is acquired not through the explicit
        statement of rules but through familarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1350506812466612">Puwar, 2004</xref>: 125). One way in which the migrant
        mothers attempted to compensate for their lack was to reposition themselves with respect to
          <italic>national</italic> British educational capital and find ways of using their
        transnational positioning to validate the classed cultural resources gained in their country
        of origin as cultural capital in Britain.</p>
      <p>Let us return to Tina’s story: while her children attended English primary schools and
        learned German through private tuition, she experienced a moment of crisis when her oldest
        son was in secondary school. The family had returned from a year’s stay in the Caribbean,
        where they had temporarily relocated due to her husband’s work, when her oldest son decided
        he did not want to go back to the comprehensive school he had previously attended in
        London:</p>
      <speech>
        <speaker>Tina:</speaker>
        <p>… he went to a grammar school in the Caribbean which was very different and very strict.
          And he came back and said I don’t want to go back to that school [the London comprehensive
          school], I want to go to a different school.</p>
      </speech>
      <speech>
        <speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
        <p>Why was that?</p>
      </speech>
      <speech>
        <speaker>Tina:</speaker>
        <p>Because he thought it wasn’t strict enough, it wasn’t challenging enough, and the English
          comprehensive system. … So [oldest Son] came straight back from the Caribbean and went to
          the German School and that was quite a good move because then he was challenged.</p>
      </speech>
      <p>After her oldest son’s positive experience at the German secondary school, Tina wanted to
        enrol her younger sons at this school, too. However, the middle son was initially not
        accepted because he failed the German language test. Subsequently, he enrolled at the local
        comprehensive, but then,</p>
      <speech>
        <speaker>Tina:</speaker>
        <p>[middle son] hated it, again. … Then we said ok he’s going to – so we sent him to
          Germany, with my mum to go to school there.</p>
      </speech>
      <speech>
        <speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
        <p>And how old was he?</p>
      </speech>
      <speech>
        <speaker>Tina:</speaker>
        <p>For six months. He was 11 or 12. I think he must have been 12. And he was fine, he went –
          and only for six months and then he got into the German School.</p>
      </speech>
      <speech>
        <speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
        <p>So really to bring his German up to scratch, was that the idea?</p>
      </speech>
      <speech>
        <speaker>Tina:</speaker>
        <p>Yes.</p>
      </speech>
      <p>The same procedure was repeated for the youngest son, who was sent to stay for six months
        with the grandparents to improve his German. He was subsequently admitted to the German
        School in London.</p>
      <speech>
        <speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
        <p>Why was it important for you that they should attend the German School?</p>
      </speech>
      <speech>
        <speaker>Tina:</speaker>
        <p>Because I think the German school system in terms of the grammar school is very
          challenging academically and stretches the children. And also it’s for the language so
          that they really consolidate their German. But also for [youngest son] they have got two
          classes [in the same year group] only, whereas the English school’s got nine. So it’s a
          beautiful school, it’s [got] beautiful grounds, it’s not that difficult to get there. …
          And we just – it just felt better for them. We didn’t know where to send them and private
          schools in England are ridiculous.</p>
      </speech>
      <speech>
        <speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
        <p>In terms of?</p>
      </speech>
      <speech>
        <speaker>Tina:</speaker>
        <p>Money. And if you have three children, that’s my full time salary and I know English
          people do that but – German School you still have to pay but it was like £5000 a year,
          which was alright. So that’s – that was OK so they all went through that.</p>
      </speech>
      <speech>
        <speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
        <p>How did the kids find that?</p>
      </speech>
      <speech>
        <speaker>Tina:</speaker>
        <p>They appreciated it. I think [oldest son] appreciated it much – and they all say it was a
          good school, they learnt a lot, they made some really nice friends. … [Oldest son] now
          realizes how good it is. He’s studying engineering, having the possibility of doing an
            <italic>Praktikum</italic> [internship] in Germany because he’s fluent.</p>
      </speech>
      <p>However, despite these positive aspects of her sons’ attending the German School in London,
        they decided not to take their final exams at the German school:</p>
      <speech>
        <speaker>Tina:</speaker>
        <p><italic>Abitur</italic> [graduation exam for German secondary school] was too difficult
          for them because he just got a <italic>Fünf</italic> [fail grade exam] back in German. His
          German grammar isn’t perfect so he struggles with that and I think the
            <italic>Abitur</italic> would be really hard. And they think A-levels [the British
          graduation exams for secondary school] are easier. … But I think neither of them would say
          they didn’t want to be at the German School, they would have preferred to go to an English
          school. He definitely wants to be there, but he doesn’t want to do A-levels there.</p>
      </speech>
      <p>I would like to highlight a few themes in Tina’s story of school choices. On one hand, she
        presents a discourse that is typical among middle-class parents in the UK, viewing
        comprehensive schools as ‘rough’ and too large inner city schools. It should be noted that
        the notions of ‘inner city’ and ‘urban’ are often codes for talking about the large
        racialized student body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1350506812466612">Byrne,
          2009</xref>), while the notion of ‘roughness’ alludes to working-class culture, with a
        sense of fear and disgust. Interestingly, it was her oldest son’s transnational educational
        experience of attending a grammar school in the Caribbean which made him feel he was missing
        out on a more disciplined and challenging education. In response, the family turned to the
        German School in London. This compensated for Tina’s lacking informational and cultural
        capital that would allow her to position her sons advantageously in the field of British
        education, as she puts it ‘we didn’t know where to send them’. Instead, Tina activated her
        ethnically specific cultural resources. To begin with, her German ‘national capital’ allowed
        her to gain admittance to a school for German citizens abroad. This school combined the
        advantages of a private education with an affordable price, since it was part-funded by the
        German state to enhance the mobility of its citizens while ensuring their continuing
        cultural and national loyalty to Germanness. For this reason the fees of about £5000 per
        year are less then half the average fees of private schools in London, £11,361 in 2008
          (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1350506812466612">BBC, 2008</xref>). Second, in order to
        equip her sons with the necessary cultural resource of German language knowledge, Tina
        activated her social capital of having family members with whom her children could stay in
        Germany to improve her children’s language skills. Tina’s strategy to send her sons to the
        German School helped her to compensate for her lack of British local informational capital
        on how to gain advantageous access to ‘good’ secondary schools in London. Enrolling the
        children at the German School also compensated for a lack of economic capital, her German
        national capital allowed her access to subsidized private education, which she could not
        afford on the regular British market.</p>
      <p>However, Tina’s story shows that ethnically specific cultural and social resources can do
        more than compensate for a lack of local and national cultural capital. When her sons use
        their ‘good education’ acquired at the German School to transfer to British secondary
        schools to achieve better results in their school leaving exams, they use the differential
        value of cultural resources in the German and the British educational fields to their
        advantage. Making use of the ‘better’ German education to achieve higher marks in the
        British educational field is a way of positioning themselves as players of two nationally
        bounded educational fields, partaking simultaneously in both. They attempt to extract value
        precisely from the difference in cultural currencies, much like speculators in international
        money currency transfers. Here I am not evaluating the efficiency or success of these
        strategies, the important point to note is that making use of the differential forms and
        value of cultural capital in the two national contexts engenders a transnational social
        space.</p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>Levitt and Glick Schiller conceptualize migrants as actors who are anchored but pivot
        ‘between a new land and a transnational incorporation’; arguing that movement and settlement
        are not linear or sequential but change direction over time. Therefore, they suggest that
        transnational experience is best viewed as ‘simultaneity of connection’ to the new land and
        the homeland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1350506812466612">2004</xref>: 1011). People
        living in transnational social spaces ‘experience multiple loci and layers of power and are
        shaped by them, but they can also act back upon them’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1350506812466612">Levitt and Glick Schiller, 2004</xref>: 1013). Tina and her
        sons experience the different national educational systems and institutions as loci of power
        that shape their access to ‘good education’, but they also act back on these national
        educational institutions by speculating with the value of their cultural resources across
        national boundaries. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1350506812466612">Kelly and Lusis
          (2006)</xref> demonstrate how migrants can benefit from converting resources acquired in
        the new country into cultural capital in the country of origin. I suggest that Tina’s case
        shows that migrants can use the very quality of transnational simultaneity to extract added
        value. The cultural resources (German language knowledge) and national capital (citizenship,
        familial connections) acquired through Tina’s participation in a transnational German space,
        enabled her sons’ private education at a price the family could afford. Membership of a
        German transnational space allowed them to access private education subsidized by the German
        state; this shows that national capital should not be viewed as the opposite of
        transnational social space, instead both are closely intertwined. Yet, her sons
        strategically deployed what Tina describes as the higher educational standards of the German
        School to gain advantageous positioning in the British educational field: they used the
        knowledge acquired in the German School to achieve higher marks in the British secondary
        school leaving exams. I suggest we conceptualize the way in which Tina and her sons make use
        of the differential value of cultural resources in the German and the British educational
        fields as a form of transnational cultural currency speculation, which in turn contributes
        to creating a transnational social space.</p>
      <p>Levitt and Glick Schiller point out that some individuals are central to building
        transnational connections: <disp-quote>
          <p>… there may be one central individual who maintains high levels of homeland contact and
            is the node through which information, resources, and identities flow. While other
            individuals may not identify with or take action based on those ties, the fact that they
            are part of the same transnational social field keeps them informed and connected so
            that they can act if events motivate them to do so. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1350506812466612">2004</xref>: 1009)</p>
        </disp-quote></p>
      <p>These processes are gendered insofar as they reinscribe the central role of mothers in
        transmitting cultural capital on a transnational scale. In this study mothers acted as nodal
        points of transnational connection for their children and, at times, also partners. Mothers
        took responsibility for the schooling decisions, even in households where the father was not
        a migrant and could thus be expected to have a higher volume of national and local cultural
        and social capital. In this way, the mothers’ gendered responsibility for their children’s
        education and familial symbolic capital contributes to creating a transnational social
        space. These mothers mobilize their status as privileged migrants from European countries to
        convert cultural resources of Europeanness into capital on the British, nationally bounded
        educational field. They can be seen as speculating with the different valuation of specific
        resources in the two nationally defined educational institutions to extract added value for
        their children’s educational profiles.</p>
      <p>Following Bourdieu, the field is both constituted by and constitutive of the players. It is
        by engaging in the game that players confirm the value of the prize. While national
        institutions continue to dominate the validation of secondary educational credentials in
        Europe, the value of ‘cosmopolitan capital’ (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1350506812466612">Weenink, 2007</xref>) is increasingly recognized. By
        bargaining about the value of cultural capital in the field of education on a transnational
        scale and by engaging in transnational currency speculation, Tina and other migrant mothers
        constitute themselves as subjects in a transnational space. These processes are spurred by
        intensifying intra-European mobility practices of middle-class, privileged European migrants
          (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1350506812466612">Koikkalainen, 2011</xref>). These
        emergent practices rearticulate the relationship between nationally bounded and
        transnational cultural resources. In this context, migrant mothers’ involvement in
        educational choices is a particularly rich topic of study, as it explores how two key sites
        for the constitution of the nation – family and schooling – articulate emergent cultural
        fields which relate national and transnational processes of validation. The migrant mothers
        in this study certainly form transnational <italic>spaces</italic>. Further research is
        needed to explore whether they succeed in creating transnational social
          <italic>fields</italic> in the stricter, Bourdieusian sense, in which they strive to
        position themselves as privileged players with a feel for the game in a transnational field,
        thus creating new transnational sources of distinction.</p>

          <p>While Tina acknowledges racial difference with her husband, she did not initiate
            discussion of her children’s racialized positioning, and minimized its significance when
            I asked directly. This silence around racialized identities was typical for my sample
            and deserves further research on how white European identities are constituted in a
            multi-racial city that is seen as desirable because of its ethnic and racial
            diversity.</p>
