<abstract>
<p>In this article, the study of impact damage of laminated composites reinforced by through-thickness stitching is investigated and presented in threefold. Specimens stitched with varying stitch density and stitch thread thickness are subjected to low-velocity impact <italic>via</italic> a drop-weight machine. <italic>Impact damage resistance</italic> is first studied by examining the extent of delamination area in damaged specimens using ultrasonic C-scan analysis. It is revealed that higher stitch density is more capable of impeding delamination growth by arresting cracks at closer interval and suppressing crack propagation. The use of thicker stitch thread offers slight improvement to damage resistance by marginal reduction in delamination propagation, and is more pertinent at high impact energy levels. <italic>Impact damage response</italic> is then analyzed from the impact history response curves of impacted laminates. The impact response of load–time graphs demonstrates that the onset of delamination is not influenced by stitch density and stitch thread thickness, but the maximum residual impact force is related to the delamination size of the laminates, which is sequentially related to stitch parameters. Finally, <italic>impact damage mechanisms</italic> are elucidated by employing X-ray radiography and micro-Computed Tomography to reveal subsurface damages, primarily dominated by intralaminar matrix cracks, interlaminar delamination, and stitch fiber/matrix debonding. It is revealed that stitches act as crack initiation sites, due to the presence of weak resin-rich pockets around stitch threads, thus inadvertently resulting in densely stitched composites having more stitch-induced matrix cracks upon impact loading. Contrarily, specimens with higher stitch density and thread thickness are more capable of impeding delamination growth by effectively bridging delamination cracks and arresting crack propagation. Principal mechanisms responsible for impact resistance performance of stitching namely <italic>crack arresting</italic> and <italic>crack bridging</italic> are presented and discussed.</p>

<p>D<sc>amage in carbon</sc> fiber reinforced plastic due to impact loading is an extremely complex phenomenon that comprises of multiple failure mechanisms like intralaminar matrix cracks, interlaminar delamination, fiber pull-out, and fiber fracture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1056789510397070">Daniel et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1056789510397070">Zako and Uetsuji, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1056789510397070">Tay et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1056789510397070">Louhghalam and Arwade, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1056789510397070">Tang et al., 2010</xref>). These damages are perilous, as they are often barely visible and remained undetectable by naked eye. Impact-induced delamination is also easily generated even when the velocity of the impact is low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1056789510397070">Abrate, 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1056789510397070">1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1056789510397070">Lesser and Filippov, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1056789510397070">Lo and Allen, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1056789510397070">Xu and Rosakis, 2005</xref>). The result of such damage is detrimental to the structure, causing a significant loss in stiffness and compressive strength of the composite material.</p>
<p>Various approaches have been proposed to improve the interlaminar damage resistance of impacted laminates. They range from <italic>material</italic> approaches (matrix toughening, adoption of high-strain/high-strength fibers, control of fiber–matrix adhesion; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1056789510397070">Arguelles et al., 2010</xref>) to <italic>structural</italic> approaches (optimal lamination design, interleaving concepts, introduction of through-thickness reinforcements; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1056789510397070">Philippidis et al., 1993</xref>). Numerous studies have shown that the interlaminar properties of laminates can be improved considerably, particularly under mode I loading, by stitching with high-strength fibrous yarns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1056789510397070">Dransfield et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1056789510397070">Mouritz and Jain, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1056789510397070">Iwahori et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1056789510397070">Tan et al., 2010</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1056789510397070">d</xref>). The significant increase obtained in fracture toughness and delamination resistance of stitched composites are attributed mainly to the bridging action of through-thickness threads, which, by exerting a closure force at the interface between the delaminated layers, arrest or delay the propagation of delaminations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1056789510397070">Cox et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1056789510397070">Massabo and Cox, 1999</xref>; Tong et al., 2002).</p>
<p>In stitched composites, impact damage behavior is further complicated by the presence of through-thickness stitching, which not only positively increases mode I and II interlaminar strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1056789510397070">Dransfield et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1056789510397070">Jain et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1056789510397070">Massabo et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1056789510397070">Massabo and Cox, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1056789510397070">Mouritz and Jain, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1056789510397070">Wood et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1056789510397070">Iwahori et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1056789510397070">Tan et al., 2010</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1056789510397070">d</xref>), but also adversely creates geometrical defects like misalignment of in-plane fibers and weak resin-rich pockets around stitch threads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1056789510397070">Mouritz et al., 1997b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1056789510397070">Mouritz and Cox, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1056789510397070">2010</xref>). There is a fair amount of publications on low-velocity impact damage of stitched composites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1056789510397070">Larsson, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1056789510397070">Mouritz et al., 1997a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1056789510397070">Hosur et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1056789510397070">Lopresto et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1056789510397070">Aymerich et al., 2007a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1056789510397070">b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1056789510397070">Aymerich and Priolo, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1056789510397070">Yoshimura et al., 2008</xref>). Researchers generally investigated the effect of stitching on impact resistance by comparing delamination area of unstitched and stitched composites. However, there is a lack of understanding on how stitching affects the damage resistance, damage response and damage mechanisms of the impacted laminates, paying particular attention to the influence of stitch density and stitch thread thickness.</p>
<p>This article aims to have a detailed investigation of the low-velocity impact damage resistance, response, and mechanisms of Vectran-stitched composites. Unstitched and stitched composites, with varying stitch density and stitch thread thickness, are subjected to low-velocity impact damage <italic>via</italic> a drop-weight impact machine (Instron Dynatub 9250HV). Impact damage resistance is first studied by examining the delamination area of damaged specimens using ultrasonic C-scan inspection technique. Impact damage response is then analyzed from the impact history response curves, particularly the load–time and load–displacement curves, of impacted laminates. Impact damage mechanisms are elucidated by employing X-ray radiography and micro-Computed Tomography (µCT) to reveal subsurface damages, primarily dominated by intralaminar matrix cracks, interlaminar delamination and stitch fiber/matrix debonding. Stitch behavioral mechanisms responsible for impact resistance performance, namely crack arresting and crack bridging, are identified and discussed.</p></sec>

<sec id="sec3-1056789510397070"><title>Material Preparation</title>
<p>The specimens were made using T800SC-24 K (Toray Industries) carbon fiber fabric of either 32-ply [+45/90/−45/0/(0/+45/90/90/−45/0)<sub>2</sub>]<sub>S</sub> or 20-ply [+45/90/−45/0/0/+45/90/90/−45/0]<sub>S</sub>. Most of the specimens were stitched in through-thickness direction using Vectran fiber, while some remain unstitched. Vectran is selected as the stitch fiber because, besides having comparable properties with Kevlar, it is more superior due to its very low propensity to absorb moisture and performs better in interlaminar strengthening of stitched composites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1056789510397070">Tan et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1056789510397070">2010a</xref>). The stitching process basically involves sewing high tensile thread through stacked ply layers to produce a preform with a 3D fiber structure. The linear density of Vectran stitch thread used in this study is 200 or 400 denier and is inserted at an equal stitch pitch, <italic>S<sub>P</sub></italic> (distance between two adjacent stitches in the same row) and stitch space, <italic>S<sub>S</sub></italic> (spacing between two adjacent stitch rows) of 3 or 6 mm. Definitions of stitch pitch and stitch space are schematically illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1056789510397070">Figure 1</xref>. This results in a corresponding stitch density, <italic>S<sub>D</sub></italic>, of 0.111 mm<sup>−2</sup> (densely stitched) or 0.028 mm<sup>−2</sup> (moderately stitched), calculated by the formula as given below:

<p>Schematic diagram of an industrial sewing machine for stitching process is given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1056789510397070">Figure 2</xref>. The type of stitch used in this study is the modified lock stitch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1056789510397070">Figure 3</xref>), in which the loops crossing the needle and bobbin threads are formed at one surface of the composite to minimize in-plane fiber distortions inside the materials. After the stitching process (if any), resin transfer molding technique, using resin XNR/H6813, was adopted to consolidate the composite. Specimens of 100 mm width and 150 mm length were then cut out from a mother plate using a diamond wheel cutter. For the stitched laminates, they are measured and cut such that the impact point, which is at the center of the rectangular specimen, is at the center of stitch space and stitch pitch. This is done to avoid possible direct impact onto the stitch thread fiber. The averaged plate thicknesses of the 32- and 20-ply specimens are 6.1 and 4.1 mm, respectively. The test specimens are produced by Toyota Industries Co. Ltd. A summary of all stitch parameters for the specimens, as well as the notations used in this article is provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1056789510397070">Table 1</xref>. All test specimens are physically examined for any poor-resin regions and ultrasonic C-scanned for any internal delamination to ensure that they are free from any manufacturing related defects. All specimens are found to be in good condition.

<p>Low-velocity impact test was performed using Instron Dynatup 9250HV drop-weight impact test machine with an impactor of constant mass 6.26 kg and hemispherical steel tip of diameter 15.9 mm (5/8 in.). The specimen was placed in a support frame with a cut-out window of 76 × 127 mm<sup>2</sup> and tightened with four clamps with rubber tips along the sides, as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1056789510397070">Figure 4</xref>. The four clamps can be adjusted in height to accommodate the different specimen thicknesses, so that all specimens of that thickness were clamped with approximately the same force.

<p>A rebound brake was activated in the test system to avoid multiple impacts on the specimens. The impact test history curves, including impact force, time, and displacement, of the specimens were obtained by the instrumented tip.

<sec id="sec5-1056789510397070"><title>Ultrasonic C-scan Analysis</title>
<p>Non-destructive inspection based on ultrasonic C-scan analysis was used to evaluate the extent of delamination growth generated in the impacted specimens. The analysis was performed using the ultrasonic C-scan system Gsonic Scan 6AX 600. The specimens were immersed in water and scanned in pulsed-echo immersion mode using a 2.25 MHz 24.13 mm point focus sensor. Ultrasonic analysis works by the principle of detecting reflection of ultrasound wave when it passes through a surface of different densities. If there is any surface crack in the path of the travel of ultrasound, then it acts as reflector and a defect echo is obtained. Therefore, by collecting the information from the reflected echo of ultrasound from the entire surface area of the sample, we can obtain the mapping of the defect in the sample, which is referred to as C-scan. This is done by setting an electronic gate on the reflected echo and digitizing the signal. The digitized gate is further analyzed by transforming the data to obtain a colored map to differentiate a defective area from the non-damaged area. Such scanning will give the information of cumulative damage as projected onto a horizontal plane.

<p>Numerous techniques have been developed to study internal damages, but no single technique has been able to deal with all different types of damages. For example, ultrasonic methods are suitable for examining delaminations, but cannot easily resolve vertically oriented cracks, and cannot accurately resolve multiple or stacked delaminations. X-ray radiography of damage generally involves the penetration of cracked areas of a composite with a liquid having a high X-ray absorption coefficient. This penetrant then casts shadows on the contact print which delineate the damaged regions. X-ray radiography provides a high resolution image of interlaminar delaminations and intralaminar matrix cracks, but produces image which is vertically integrated, so that individual delaminations cannot be resolved through the thickness.</p>
<p>The impacted specimens were immersed in a zinc iodide solution for an hour prior to radiography. Zinc iodide solution, a commonly used radiographic dye-penetrant which has a high absorption coefficient, is impregnated into all cracks, which are connected to the damaged surfaces. The zinc iodide solution was a mixture of alcohol (5 mL), distilled water (5 mL), photo-setting solution (5 mL), and zinc iodide powder (30 g). Excess dye-penetrant was removed prior to X-raying the specimens. The specimens were then radiographed in a SOFTEX SV-100AW X-ray machine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1056789510397070">Figure 5</xref>). Fujifilm Industrial X-ray film Envelopak IX was used with exposure times of 8 and 6 min for 6.1- and 4.1-mm thick specimens, respectively, at X-ray tube settings of 17.5 kVp and 1.5 mA. The X-ray films were then converted to digital format with an Epson scanner using black/white negative film scanning mode at a resolution of 1200 dpi.

<sec id="sec7-1056789510397070"><title>X-ray µCT</title>
<p>X-ray µCT complements the use of X-ray radiography by imaging detailed cross-sectional views of the specimens, thereby resolving through-thickness delamination and matrix cracks. µCT is a 3D imaging technique which is used non-destructively to inspect the inner structure of an object by transmission measurements using X-rays. A large number of projection images are obtained by rotating the sample. After a reconstruction process, the distribution of the linear attenuation coefficient is obtained along the section of the sample crossed by the radiation. µCT is a very useful tool to identify structural inhomogeneities, voids, fractures, microcracks, and porous structures in polymer composites where there is a significant difference in density. µCT has proven useful to analyze epoxy resin composites for structural defects such as cracks and delamination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1056789510397070">Schilling et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>X-ray µCT images were acquired with the Toshiba TOSCANER-3000µhd Micro-focus X-ray Computed Tomography system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1056789510397070">Figure 6</xref>). This unit is equipped with an X-ray source having maximum voltage and current of 225 kV and 500 µA, respectively. The detector contains an X-ray CCD camera with a resolution of 2048 × 2048 pixels. The scans were conducted with micro-focus X-rays set at a voltage of 39 kV and a current of 500 µA. To do X-ray µCT measurements, it is not necessary to cut the samples and polish them; thus, it offers a big gain of time. The only disadvantage of this method is the fact that it takes quite some time to obtain the cross-sectional images in an automatic regime (some hours, depending on the amount of slices).
<fig id="fig6-1056789510397070" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>Toshiba TOSCANER-3000μhd Micro-focus X-ray Computed Tomography system.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1056789510397070-fig6.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>It is worth noting that the source–detector and the source–sample distance are critical in determining the magnification of the sample, and thus the resolution of the scan. The closer the sample was to the source and the further away from the detector, the higher the magnification. A conical X-ray beam scanned the sample, which was rotated at increments of 0.2° for each rotation step and with an average of eight frames taken. This procedure was then repeated until a full rotation of 360° was achieved, and total of 1800 cross-sectional images were then obtained to be used in the 3D profile generation.</p></sec></sec>

<sec id="sec9-1056789510397070"><title>Impact Damage Resistance</title>
<p>Typical ultrasonic C-scan images for impacted 6- and 4-mm thick specimens are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1056789510397070">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1056789510397070">8</xref>, respectively. These C-scan images illustrate the damage evolution of impacted specimens with increasing impact energy levels. The red and yellow regions at the center of the images represented the delamination area induced by low-velocity impact, while the blue region represented the undamaged area. It is obvious that the delamination size increases with increasing impact energy for all cases. At the lowest impact energy case for both the 6 and 4 mm specimens (10 and 6.7 J, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1056789510397070">Figures 7(a)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1056789510397070">8(a)</xref>, respectively), there are unobservable differences in the delamination area for unstitched and stitched composites, and also due to the effect of stitch density and stitch thread thickness. This implies that stitching is not able to prevent the initiation of delamination. However, with escalating impact energy, the delamination size differences due to stitch density become more apparent. Delamination area for unstitched specimen is the largest among specimens impacted at the same energy level. The delamination area for 6 × 6 (moderately stitched) specimens is also larger than the delamination area for 3 × 3 (densely stitched) specimens. This is prominent for both 6 and 4 mm specimens especially in the case where the impact energy is the highest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1056789510397070">Figures 7(d)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1056789510397070">8(c)</xref>). This is due to the fact that densely stitched specimens provide a much larger bridging force in the thickness direction, compared to moderately stitched specimens, due to the presence of closely spaced stitches. Thus, the driving force for propagation of delamination crack is greatly reduced and delamination growth is intensely suppressed. Moreover, delamination crack is effectively arrested by stitches in densely stitched specimens due to the presence of stitches in closer proximity.
<fig id="fig7-1056789510397070" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>C-scan images of 6 mm specimens impacted at energy of (a) 10 J, (b) 25 J, (c) 40.6 J, and (d) 60.8 J.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1056789510397070-fig7.tif"/></fig>
<fig id="fig8-1056789510397070" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p>C-scan images of 4 mm specimens impacted at energy of (a) 6.7 J, (b) 16.8 J, and (c) 27.3 J.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1056789510397070-fig8.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The delamination shape for 6 mm specimens is observed to be generally circular, except for 6 × 6 and unstitched specimens in 60.8 J cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1056789510397070">Figure 7(d)</xref>) whereby they are slightly elongated along the specimen length, which is due to saturation of delamination growth around the boundary of the support frame. Overall circular delamination shape for quasi-isotropic laminated composites under low-velocity impact is commonly observed. Thus, stitch parameters in this study do not alter the overall shape of the delamination damage, since in all cases <italic>S<sub>P</sub></italic> = <italic>S<sub>S</sub></italic>. For 4 mm specimens, circular delamination shape is also observed for damage at low energy levels. However, the delamination shape becomes elongated with major axis along the width of the specimens, especially noticeable at the highest impact energy of 27.3 J (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1056789510397070">Figure 8(c)</xref>). This is due to bending effect, which is more prominent in 4 mm specimens, compared to 6 mm specimens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1056789510397070">Davies and Zhang, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1056789510397070">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>). For a given deflection the curvature in the width-direction will be larger than in the length-direction, which causes more damage in the form of matrix cracks (fiber splitting) and subsequently delamination cracks are significantly induced along the width direction of the 4-mm thick specimens.</p>
<p>Effect of stitch thread thickness on delamination size seems to be unobservable by naked eye. However, under post-process measurement of delamination size, using area measurement software, there appears to be slight improvement in delamination reduction using a thicker stitch thread. Averaged projected delamination area is calculated and plotted against impact energy, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1056789510397070">Figure 9</xref>. Through-thickness stitching greatly reduces delamination growth, up to 40% when comparing delamination area of 6 mm unstitched and 6 mm 400 d 3 × 3 specimens at impact energy of 60.8 J (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1056789510397070">Figure 9(a)</xref>). As discussed earlier, densely stitched specimens are more effective in suppressing delamination growth compared to moderately stitched specimens. The delamination area reduction could be up to 23% for the case of t6 200 d (60.8 J). From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1056789510397070">Figure 9</xref>, it is also evident that using a thicker stitch thread could reduce the delamination size under the same stitch density. It is apparent that for all cases, the graphs of 400 d fall slightly below 200 d, and the difference gets larger with increasing impact energy up to a maximum improvement of 8% delamination size decrease in the case of t6 6 × 6 (60.8 J). Thicker stitch thread is expected to provide greater interlaminar strength in the through-thickness direction, as demonstrated by mode I double cantilever beam test, whereby doubling stitch thread area could approximately double the increase in mode I strain energy release rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1056789510397070">Tan et al., 2010d</xref>). However, in the case of low-velocity impact, we do not see the same effectiveness in delamination reduction under the influence of stitch thread thickness and there are mainly two reasons to it: firstly, mode II, and not mode I, is more prominent in impact loading cases; secondly, the stitch threads under impact loading do not break, unlike in the case of mode I fracture, whereby high energy is absorbed due to stitch fracture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1056789510397070">Tan et al., 2010b</xref>).
<fig id="fig9-1056789510397070" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><p>Delamination area against impact energy curves of (a) 6 mm and (b) 4 mm specimens.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1056789510397070-fig9.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>It is also observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1056789510397070">Figure 9</xref> that when the impact energy is small, the difference in damage areas due to the effect of stitch parameters is also very small. However, as the impact energy level increases, the difference in damage areas among the specimens becomes larger. This also means that the improvement effect of impact damage resistance due to stitching becomes greater at higher impact energy. Some researchers have made this observation when comparing unstitched and stitched laminates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1056789510397070">Mouritz, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1056789510397070">Aymerich et al., 2007a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1056789510397070">b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1056789510397070">Yoshimura et al., 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1056789510397070">Mouritz (2003)</xref> has reasoned that when impact energy is low, the delamination crack is short; thus, fewer stitches are bridging the short delamination crack and the effect of suppressing delamination growth is less significant than a longer delamination crack, whereby the bridging zone is fully developed. It is revealed in this study that this observation is similarly true when investigating the effect of stitch density and stitch thread thickness on the low-velocity impact damage of stitched composites.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec10-1056789510397070"><title>Impact Damage Response</title>
<p>The impact force–time graphs of 6 and 4 mm specimens are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1056789510397070">Figures 10</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1056789510397070">11</xref>, respectively. It is obvious that each impact graph has a distinctively similar shape as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-1056789510397070">Figure 12</xref>, which can be characterized by two important impact force parameters: <italic>P<sub>max</sub></italic> and <italic>P<sub>crit</sub></italic>. Impacts on composites produced the characteristic response of an initial rise in load until a sudden drop occurs at <italic>P<sub>crit</sub></italic>, which is defined as the critical force for onset of delamination, also known as the delamination threshold load (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1056789510397070">Schoeppner and Abrate, 2000</xref>). The delamination process is accompanied by a rapid reduction of the force due to reduction in the bending stiffness of the laminate, as a result of internal delamination damage. A reloading phase of the specimen to a maximum point <italic>P<sub>max</sub></italic> may occur if enough residual potential energy is stored in the impactor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1056789510397070">Cartie and Irving, 2002</xref>). The averaged <italic>P<sub>max</sub></italic> and <italic>P<sub>crit</sub></italic> values for all impacted specimens are given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-1056789510397070">Figure 13</xref>.

<p>From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1056789510397070">Figures 10</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1056789510397070">11</xref>, it is clear that higher impact energy generates higher maximum impact force <italic>P<sub>max</sub></italic>. At lower impact energy level, the difference in <italic>P<sub>max</sub></italic> among specimens impacted at the same impact energy may not seem obvious. However, at higher impact energy levels, it is evident that 3 × 3 specimens showed higher <italic>P<sub>max</sub></italic> values than 6 × 6 specimens. It is also apparent that 400 d stitch thread specimens experienced greater <italic>P<sub>max</sub></italic> than 200 d specimens for all stitched configurations. Relating back to C-scan analyses in previous section, <italic>P<sub>max</sub></italic> is considered to be indirectly related to the delamination size in the specimens. In 6 × 6 specimens, the presence of larger delamination area implies that the impacted specimen plate stiffness is much lower than that of 3 × 3 specimens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1056789510397070">Figure 9</xref>); thus, 6 × 6 specimens could withstand lower <italic>P<sub>max</sub></italic> than 3 × 3 specimens. Since the influence of stitch thread thickness on delamination size is more apparent at higher impact energy levels, there is likewise greater difference in <italic>P<sub>max</sub></italic> among the specimens at higher impact energy. <italic>P<sub>max</sub></italic> values of 6 mm thick unstitched specimens are observed to be always lower than stitched laminates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1056789510397070">Figure 10</xref>). This is justified as the delamination size difference in unstitched and stitched 6 mm thick specimens is relatively significant. As mentioned above, the larger delamination damage implies a larger reduction in laminate plate stiffness, thus resulting in lower <italic>P<sub>max</sub></italic> values in 6 mm unstitched specimens. However, this is not true in 4-mm thick specimens. Although 4 mm unstitched specimens have larger delamination area than 4 mm stitched specimens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1056789510397070">Figure 9(b)</xref>), the difference is not as significant as that in 6 mm specimens. This is mainly due to membrane effects which are more pronounced in thinner laminates and at more extensive delamination growth. Indentation and shear contributions are significant in thick plates, while the membrane contribution is significant in thin plates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1056789510397070">Olsson, 2001</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1056789510397070">Olsson (2001)</xref> presents a simplified analytical approach to consider membrane load contribution. The total load on the plate is composed of the bending and shear load contribution, as well as membrane load contribution. He concluded that when comparing thick and thin plates, the major contribution is due to bending, but at delamination initiation the indentation and shear contributions are significant in the thick plate, while the membrane contribution is significant in the thin plate. At lower impact energy level for 4-mm thick specimens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1056789510397070">Figure 11(c)</xref>), all stitched and unstitched specimens’ impact force–time graphs apparently merged to form one curve.</p>
<p><italic>P<sub>crit</sub></italic>, however, seems to possess constant value for all 6 mm stitched specimens of around 6 kN and a lower value of about 3.2 kN for all 4 mm stitched specimens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-1056789510397070">Figure 13</xref>), which demonstrates its independence to impact energy levels and stitch parameters. This implies that the onset of delamination occurs once the critical impact force is reached, independent of the total impact energy intended. Moreover, it is further confirmed that delamination onset is not influenced by the difference in stitch density and stitch thread thickness. However, it is noted that <italic>P<sub>crit</sub></italic> of unstitched laminates for both 6 and 4 mm specimens have apparently slightly higher values than stitched specimens. This implies that the onset of impact damage in stitched specimens is easier to initiate, primarily due to the presence of weak resin-rich regions around stitch threads. It is also noted that the critical impact force for delamination onset in 4 mm specimens is lower than 6 mm specimens. This means that delamination is easier to initiate in thinner specimens than thicker specimens, mainly due to bending effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1056789510397070">Davies and Zhang, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1056789510397070">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>).</p>

At the initial stage of deflection, it is evident that both the 6 and 4 mm specimens follow their own loading curve, before the first load drop whereby <italic>P<sub>crit</sub></italic> is reached. This signifies an equal bending stiffness independent of stitch density, stitch thread thickness and intended impact energy, prior to any damage. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1056789510397070">Gui et al. (2005)</xref> have investigated the effect of stitch parameters on the stiffness of stitched laminates using an analytical model to calculate the constitutive relation of stitched laminates. Their results indicated that stitch pitch, stitch space, and thread thickness have negligible effect on normal bending stiffness (bending stiffness matrix <italic>D</italic> in the classical lamination theory) of the stitched laminates. From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-1056789510397070">Figures 14</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-1056789510397070">15</xref>, it is additionally observed that the bending stiffness of 4 mm specimens is much lower than 6 mm specimens, inevitably due to lesser thickness.

<p>It is clear that 6 mm unstitched specimens have larger deflection than 6 mm stitched specimens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-1056789510397070">Figure 14</xref>), but it is not the case for 4 mm unstitched and 4 mm stitched specimens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-1056789510397070">Figure 15</xref>). This corresponds to the similar observation made earlier in the impact force–time graphs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1056789510397070">Figures 10</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1056789510397070">11</xref>), whereby it is reasoned that the membrane effect for 4 mm is inevitably more significant thus masking the flexibility difference due to delamination damage area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1056789510397070">Olsson, 2001</xref>). It is also noted that 6 × 6 specimens have larger deflections than 3 × 3 specimens, being more obvious at higher impact energy levels. This larger deflection implies an increased in bending flexibility or greater reduction in bending stiffness due to more internal delamination damage. For both 4- and 6-mm thick specimens, the effect of stitch thread thickness becomes obvious at higher impact energy levels with 400 d specimens having smaller deflection compared to 200 d specimens, since the latter have larger delamination areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1056789510397070">Figure 9</xref>). It is recognized that specimens with a larger deflection have correspondingly lower impact force. For example, 6 × 6 specimens have larger deflection and lower impact force, compared to 3 × 3 specimens that have smaller deflection and higher impact force. This suggests that the energy absorption (area under load–displacement curve) at each impact energy level could be the same, regardless of stitch density and thread thickness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1056789510397070">Tan et al., 2010</xref>c).</p></sec>
<sec id="sec11-1056789510397070"><title>Impact Damage Mechanisms</title>
<p>Typical X-radiographs of impacted 4-mm thick specimens subjected to impact energy of 6.7 J are displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16-1056789510397070">Figure 16</xref>. The darkened region at the center of the images indicated low-velocity impact damage, dominated by delamination and matrix cracks. Various forms of damage mechanisms could be clearly identified and related to the differences in stitch density and stitch thread thickness. It is observed that distal face (defined as the back face or the opposite to impact face) matrix cracks run along the 45° direction, which corresponds to the in-plane fiber orientation of the back ply. It is evident that distal face matrix cracks are more prominent and longer in 3 × 3 specimens, whereby these matrix cracks are connected by diagonally adjacent stitch loops. This is because the resin-rich regions around stitch loops act as crack initiation sites and since these stitch loops are very close to each other in 3 × 3 specimens, they joined up to form connected crack lines. This also indicates that there are more matrix cracks in 3 × 3 (densely stitched) composites, compared to 6 × 6 (moderately stitched) composites, due to the presence of more stitch loop resin-rich regions, which promote initiation of matrix cracks. Intralaminar matrix cracks in various ±45°/90°/0° directions, due to the respective ply lay-up orientations are also observed. It is especially in 3 × 3 specimens that these intralaminar matrix cracks are seen extending from stitch loops. Further evidence demonstrating this phenomenon is seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17-1056789510397070">Figure 17</xref>. It is clear that stitch-induced matrix cracks are abundantly present in densely stitched composites. This further confirms the fact that stitches act as crack initiation sites. Except for distal face matrix cracks, intralaminar matrix cracks are generally within or extend up to delamination area. This is in line with findings from other researchers that matrix cracking is the initial failure mode of impact damage in laminated composites and that delamination are initiated by matrix cracks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1056789510397070">Abrate, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1056789510397070">Choi et al., 1991a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1056789510397070">b</xref>). From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16-1056789510397070">Figure 16(a)</xref> and (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16-1056789510397070">d</xref>), the delamination growth in 3 × 3 specimens are observed to stop at debonded stitches, forming a relatively controlled square or diamond shaped damage. However, in unstitched (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16-1056789510397070">Figure 16(c)</xref> and 6 × 6 specimens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16-1056789510397070">Figure 16(b)</xref> and (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16-1056789510397070">e</xref>)), delamination shape is generally oblong or circular, with little shape influence by stitches in 6 × 6 specimens. This implies that, besides being crack initiators, stitches are also acting effectively as crack arrestors in 3 × 3 specimens. As above discussions are made mostly based on the effect of stitch density, there is hardly observable difference due to the influence of stitch thread thickness, besides the fact that the overall delamination size is smaller in 400 d specimens, as discussed in earlier section.

Sections a1-3, b1-3, and c1-3 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig18-1056789510397070">Figure 18</xref> correspond to sectional lines a1-3, b1-3, and c1-3 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16-1056789510397070">Figure 16</xref>. The cross-sectional images are taken in the lateral through-thickness direction of the specimens, particularly containing the delamination region. The top face is the impact face, while the bottom face is the distal face. Slices of 1 mm apart are in fact observed during actual examination. However, due to space constraint on paper, only selected slices (adjacent slices being 4 mm apart) are presented for each specimen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig18-1056789510397070">Figure 18</xref>. Contrary to X-radiographs, the white regions in µCT images represent damage areas that are infiltrated with radio-opaque zinc iodide dye-penetrant. Damage mechanisms, primarily dominated by matrix cracks, delamination, and stitch fiber/matrix debonding, are clearly identified in these images. Adjacent cross-sectional slices also provide obvious and comprehensible 3D delamination damage patterns of stitched and unstitched composite specimens.

<p>The area of impact could be identified as the darkened region, as seen in sections a3, b3, and c3 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig18-1056789510397070">Figure 18</xref>. The impact area is known as the impact–compression zone in many studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1056789510397070">Davies and Zhang, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1056789510397070">Hou et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1056789510397070">Yoshimura et al., 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1056789510397070">Hou et al. (2000)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1056789510397070">Yoshimura et al. (2008)</xref> have demonstrated experimentally that there is a delamination free region under the impactor in this impact–compression zone. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1056789510397070">Davies and Zhang (1995)</xref> explained that this region at the center line of the impactor is a low shear region and is in a state of through-thickness compression; so, delamination does not start from here. It is the boundary of this impact–compression zone that has high shear stress and high normal stress which initiates impact damage by generating matrix cracks. From the X-radiographs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16-1056789510397070">Figure 16</xref>), the impact–compression area is measured to be approximately 3 mm in diameter for all specimens, independent of stitch parameters. As such, it implies that stitching does not affect the impact–compression zone size in this study, whereby the smallest stitch spacing used is no less than 3 mm.</p>
<p>Prior knowledge of impact damage in composite materials imparts that when impact energy threshold is above a critical level, matrix cracks are generated by shear or tensile flexural stresses around the indentation area develop mainly in the intermediate and back face layers. Matrix cracks are then followed by interface delaminations growing from the crack tips; delaminations occur between plies of different orientations and are elongated along the fiber direction of the lower layer at interface, with the largest delaminations developing between layers with the highest orientation mismatch. Delaminations appear in a regular pattern producing altogether a typical 3D spiral staircase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1056789510397070">Abrate, 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1056789510397070">1994</xref>). It is observed that the delamination pattern of unstitched composites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig18-1056789510397070">Figure 18(c)</xref>) follows such cone-shaped characteristics whereby the delamination is the largest nearer the distal face. The delamination damage distribution is thus conical with maximum damage on the distal face. However, the delamination pattern of stitched composites, particularly in 3 × 3 specimens, is less conical, but more cylindrical in nature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig18-1056789510397070">Figure 18(a)</xref>). This is due to the fact that delamination propagation is effectively arrested and contained by the stitches, especially so in the case of densely stitched composites, where stitches are very close to one another. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1056789510397070">Hosur et al. (2003)</xref> have introduced this concept, but did not provide sufficient experimental evidence. In the case of moderately stitched (6 × 6) specimens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig18-1056789510397070">Figure 18(b)</xref>), the 3D delamination pattern is less conical than unstitched specimens, but more conical than densely stitched specimens, due to partial delamination growth influence of stitches. A schematic diagram to explain and summarize the influence of stitching on 3D delamination pattern is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig19-1056789510397070">Figure 19</xref>. It is recognized that in densely stitched (3 × 3) specimens, delamination spread is greatly suppressed by the presence of stitching, thus resulting in a smaller projected delamination area, as discussed in earlier section. In moderately stitched (6 × 6) specimens, the growth of delamination is less restrained by stitching and in the case of unstitched specimens; delamination propagation is naturally created, without any influence of stitching, thus producing the largest delamination growth.
<fig id="fig19-1056789510397070" position="float"><label>Figure 19.</label><caption><p>Illustration of 3D delamination pattern for unstitched and stitched composites: (a) densely stitched (3 × 3), (b) moderately stitched (6×6), (c) unstitched.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1056789510397070-fig19.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Besides acting as crack initiator, stitch performs effectively as crack arrestor. µCT images provide adequate experimental proof for this behavior. Delamination propagation in µCT images is observed to always terminate at stitch thread location, especially in densely stitched (3 × 3) cases. This suggests that there are primarily two mechanisms responsible for impact damage resistance and delamination growth suppression, namely: crack arresting and crack bridging. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig20-1056789510397070">Figure 20</xref> evidently demonstrates these mechanisms in µCT image of a 3 × 3 specimen. In terms of crack arresting, stitching greatly reduces the driving force for propagation of the delamination crack. The stitching creates closing tractions acting across the crack, which shield the crack tip from full effect of the crack opening stress. For crack bridging, stitching provides the bridging action of through-thickness threads, which, by exerting a closure force at the interface between the delaminated layers, suppress crack propagation. Crack bridging results in reduced crack growth and eventually crack arrest.
<fig id="fig20-1056789510397070" position="float"><label>Figure 20.</label><caption><p>μCT image showing crack arresting and crack bridging mechanisms in delamination suppression of stitched composites (t4 200 d 3 × 3 16.8 J).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1056789510397070-fig20.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The above discussion made in the later part of this section is mostly based on the effect of stitch density, as there is little noticeable difference due to the influence of stitch thread thickness. This means that the damage mechanisms and distribution are not greatly influenced by stitch thread thickness, but more significantly affected by stitch density.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec12-1056789510397070" sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
<p>This study experimentally investigates the low-velocity impact damage resistance, damage response, and damage mechanisms of stitched composites. Both unstitched and laminates stitched with varying stitch density and stitch thread thickness are subjected to low-velocity impact <italic>via</italic> a drop-weight impact machine, with the aim to study the coupled influence of stitch parameters.</p>
<p>Impact damage resistance is investigated using ultrasonic C-scan analysis which evidently compares the delamination areas of impacted laminates and concludes that higher stitch density is more capable of impeding delamination growth by arresting cracks at closer interval, bridging delamination cracks, and suppressing crack propagation. The use of thicker stitch thread slightly reduces delamination growth, and is more pertinent at high impact energy levels.</p>
<p>Impact damage response of load–time graphs demonstrates that the force required for onset of delamination is not influenced by stitch density and stitch thread thickness, but the maximum residual impact force is related to the delamination size of the laminates, which is sequentially related to stitch parameters. It is also revealed that the damage initiation force for stitched laminate is lower than unstitched laminate, due to weak resin-rich regions around stitch loops. Load–deflection graphs confirm that moderately stitched composite laminates are more flexible than densely stitched ones, mainly attributed to their overall larger delamination damage area, with the note that bending stiffness prior to damage is the same regardless of stitch parameters.</p>
<p>Impact damage mechanisms, primarily dominated by intralaminar matrix cracks, interlaminar delamination and stitch fiber/matrix debonding, are elucidated by employing the use of X-ray radiography and µCT. It is shown that stitches act as crack initiation sites, due to the presence of weak resin-rich pockets around stitch threads, thus inadvertently resulting in densely stitched composites having more stitch-induced matrix cracks upon impact loading. µCT images also conclusively revealed that delamination are effectively contained by closely spaced stitches in densely stitched laminates to produce less conical but more cylindrical delamination pattern. It is clear that the principal mechanisms responsible for impact resistance performance of stitching are identified to be crack arresting and crack bridging.</p></sec>
