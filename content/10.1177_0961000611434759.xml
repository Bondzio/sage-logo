<abstract>
<p>This article reports research into the perceptions and predictions of academic librarians regarding the future role and development of e-books, and e-book collections and services. A number of recent studies reported in the literature review indicate increasing interest in e-books. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 32 academic librarians, in seven case study libraries. Most interviewees anticipated a significant growth in the size and role of e-book collections in academic libraries over the next five years. The actions and policies of each of the key stakeholder groups, e-book vendors (publishers and aggregators), academic libraries and users are viewed as pivotal to the future use of e-books in universities. The growing importance of e-books will have a number of consequences for academic libraries, in terms of the technologies that they make available to users, the use of library space, user education and staff workload.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>E-books pose an interesting challenge to academic libraries, and there are many questions to be answered as to the way to manage the introduction and development of e-book collections and services. This article makes a contribution to knowledge and practice in e-book services in academic libraries by gathering insights into academic librarians’ views on the future of e-books, and e-book collections and services in their libraries. In particular, it seeks to encourage academic librarians to plan for a future in which the ‘final bastion’ of the traditional array of library resources, the book, is increasingly accessed digitally.</p>
<p>E-books are viewed as having the potential to be even more significant for libraries and learners than e-journals, because of the longstanding centrality of textbooks to learning in higher education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961000611434759">Armstrong et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0961000611434759">Rowlands et al., 2007</xref>). Indeed, the digital format offers many opportunities for books to be developed as interactive learning resources, and in some cases being substituted for locally designed learning resources and experiences. At this point in time, many academic libraries are only in a position to make a limited list of e-books available, and are highly dependent on publishers’ decisions concerning the availability of and licensing arrangements for e-books. But many commentators believe that things could change rapidly and predict a significant growth in e-book budgets in the next five years (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961000611434759">British Library, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0961000611434759">HECG, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0961000611434759">Primary Research Group, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0961000611434759">RIN, 2007</xref>). Hence, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961000611434759">Anson and Connell (2009)</xref> suggest libraries need to be better prepared for a future in which e-books may be as important, or more important, than print books.</p>
<p>The aim of the research reported in this article is to:</p>
<list id="list1-0961000611434759" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>provide insights into the future for e-books in academic libraries, with specific reference to the factors that will influence that future.</p></list-item>

<p>The objectives towards the achievement of this aim are to:</p>

<list-item><p>elicit predictions of the speed of e-book collection development and their relative impact;</p></list-item>

</list>
<p>This article is structured as follows. First, the literature review summarises findings from previous research on e-book collections in academic libraries. Next, the qualitative methodology for the research is outlined. This is based on semi-structured interviews conducted with key stakeholders in seven case study academic libraries. Findings are reported next. The following section offers a critical discussion of the findings. Finally conclusions and recommendations summarise key themes that emerge from the findings and the critical discussion, and offer recommendations for practitioners and for further research.</p>

<sec id="section2-0961000611434759">
<title>Literature review</title>
<p>E-books are commonly perceived as offering great potential for teaching and learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961000611434759">Armstrong et al., 2006</xref>), they are attractive to scholarly communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0961000611434759">Nicholas et al., 2007</xref>) and they have ‘greater potential to change the information landscape than journals’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0961000611434759">Rowlands et al., 2007</xref>: 489). Many surveys have been conducted that indicate that e-books are a central element of the information experience of the academic population, including staff and undergraduate and postgraduate students. The JISC e-books user survey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0961000611434759">Rowlands, 2008</xref>) revealed that 60% of the academic population of 127 higher education institutions in the UK use e-books for their scholarly work. Amongst respondents to the SuperBook Project, 44% of respondents had used e-books, although many of these uses were not through the university library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0961000611434759">Rowlands et al., 2007</xref>). In ebrary’s ‘Global faculty e-book survey’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961000611434759">2007</xref>) 53% of the participants used e-books for their research, class preparation and instruction. On the other hand, ebrary’s ‘Global student e-book survey’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0961000611434759">ebrary, 2008</xref>) found 49% had never used e-books, but presumably most of the others had. However, there is one important caveat to this apparently high level of use, and that is that other studies show that the use of e-books lags well behind that of other e-resources, such as e-journals, and there is a sense that e-books are not yet fully embedded in academic practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961000611434759">ebrary, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>One of the main reasons for the relatively limited uptake of e-books is the reluctance on the part of publishers and aggregators to produce e-books, especially in the UK where the uptake of e-books seem to be slow. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961000611434759">Gold Leaf (2003</xref>: 9) concluded that:
<disp-quote>
<p>many publishers are reluctant to make their publications available in e-book format and/or to promote them too strenuously, because they are afraid of the effect on their revenues. This is especially true of the major textbook publishers, who have instead invested heavily in producing supplementary/complementary electronic materials to support print books.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0961000611434759">Nicholas et al. (2007</xref>: 33) noted: ‘although progress has been made, they were still dipping their toes in the water and waiting for someone else to take the initiative’. And in 2008, Nelson was still reporting that e-book sales lagged behind projections and constituted only a small percentage of the book market.</p>
<p>However, both commentators and research suggest that things will change and growth is on the horizon. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0961000611434759">2007</xref>, Hook reported that: ‘e-books may still be only a small part of the total publishing market, but e-book sales are growing, and many expect big things for the format in the near future’. In 2009, an exit survey conducted as part of the JISC National e-Book Observatory project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0961000611434759">JISC and UCL, 2009</xref>), showed that the usage of e-books by the academic population increased in 2009 reaching 65%, more than 5% higher than in the 2008 JISC first user survey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0961000611434759">Rowlands, 2008</xref>). More recently, Brindley predicted that by 2020 ‘75% of all titles worldwide will be published in digital form only, or in both digital and print’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961000611434759">British Library, 2010</xref>: 6). And finally, the evidence is that e-book sales grew exponentially in the first quarter of 2010, at least in the US, jumping from just 1.5% of total US book sales in 2009 to 5% of the market in the first quarter of 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0961000611434759">IDPF, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>As e-books become more popular their adoption as a learning resource could have a major impact on academic libraries. This adoption poses a range of collection development issues such as acquisition policies and processes; pricing and licensing models and arrangements; cataloguing processes and promotional activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0961000611434759">Vasileiou et al., 2009</xref>) as well as changes in the use of library space. Whilst there are a number of surveys focusing on the use of e-books, there are very few research studies that have attempted to investigate the issues associated with the management of e-books in academic libraries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961000611434759">Armstrong et al., 2006</xref>). However, two large-scale research projects have been published in 2009 concerning the management of e-book collections in academic libraries. The first project was conducted by Information Automation Limited (IAL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0961000611434759">IAL, 2009</xref>) for the JISC National e-book Observatory (UK). The second project was undertaken by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961000611434759">Anson and Connell (2009)</xref> for the Association of Research Libraries (US).</p>
<p>Various studies report that academic librarians expect to develop their e-book collections over the next few years. For example, the ‘Feasibility Study on the Acquisition of e-Books in Higher Education and the Role of JISC’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0961000611434759">HECG, 2006</xref>) indicated that a high percentage of the UK academic libraries (89 of the 92 respondents) were either ‘very eager’ or ‘fairly eager’ to develop e-book collections’ to meet the needs of taught course students. The study ‘Researchers’ Use of Academic Libraries and their Services’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0961000611434759">RIN, 2007</xref>) commissioned by RIN (Research Information Network) and CURL (Consortium of University Research Libraries) indicated that the majority of UK academic libraries offer e-versions of textbooks and reference sources. More specifically, 73% of respondents reported an increase in provision of electronic textbooks and 72% an increase for reference sources during the past three years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0961000611434759">RIN, 2007</xref>). Librarians also stated that they are increasingly looking to spend money on the development of their e-book collections. Finally, in 2008, Primary Research Group published the results of the study entitled ‘Library Use of E-Books, 2008–2009 Edition’. The study surveyed 75 libraries throughout the world including the United States, Canada, Australia, Germany and Japan. Of the participant libraries 45 were university research libraries from which 69% indicated that they plan to increase spending on e-books over the next two years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0961000611434759">Primary Research Group, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Clearly, then, the future of e-books in academic libraries, and the factors that influence developments in this arena, are of great importance to academic libraries, but there has been no previous research in this area.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0961000611434759" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methodology</title>
<p>The limited previous research into e-books and, in particular, the interest in this research in eliciting forecasts and views about e-book futures in academic libraries suggests that an inductive approach to this research is appropriate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0961000611434759">Saunders et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>This is consistent with the collection of qualitative data, gaining an understanding of the meanings humans attach to events and a lower level of concern with generalization. In addition, an interpretivist stance has informed the research design. The intention is not solely to gather facts, but also to listen to the way in which academic librarians talk about the future of their services in the context of e-books (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0961000611434759">Saunders et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Semi-structured interviews with academic librarians were chosen as the main research method. The questions were open-ended thus not limiting the interviewees’ choice of answers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0961000611434759">Gubrium and Holstein, 2002</xref>). The purpose was to provide a setting where the interviewer and interviewees could discuss the topic in depth. The interviewer therefore made use of cues and prompts to help and direct the interviewees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961000611434759">Creswell, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0961000611434759">Patton, 2002</xref>). The questions asked related to the future of e-books in academic libraries:</p>

<list-item><p>What will be the role of e-books in academic libraries in five years’ time?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Which factors will affect the adoption of e-books and the development of e-book services?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What are the potential implications of these developments for academic libraries?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Information on job role was also gathered and noted. The interview schedule was piloted with two subject librarians from Libraries A and B, and the e-resources manager from Library B. The pilot interviews assisted in the improvement of the interview schedule by adding some extra questions and rephrasing some expressions.</p>
<p>The identification of potential interviewees started with the selection of case study libraries. A multiple case-study approach was adopted for a number of reasons:</p>
<list id="list4-0961000611434759" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Gathering responses from different staff in the same library offered deeper insights into the context for a specific case library;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The approach supported the selection of case libraries on the basis of criteria deemed to possibly be relevant to e-books and their management, such as research or teaching focus, and size;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Clustering interviews aided convenient and efficient use of time.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0961000611434759">Miles and Huberman (2005)</xref> multiple case sampling adds confidence to the findings and enhances their validity and stability. Once the set of <bold>case study libraries</bold> had been selected, the library staffing lists were examined, and contacts made with senior librarians in order to identify key informants. Typically, such key informants held the roles of e-resources librarian, subject librarian or cataloguer/metadata officer. Ultimately, 32 interviews were conducted, distributed across the case study libraries as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0961000611434759">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<p>The interviews were recorded and transcribed. Thematic analysis was conducted, and coding was used as the basic analytic strategy. Analysis was guided, but not constrained by, the themes in the interview schedule. An inductive approach to coding was employed for the thematic analysis in order to avoid ‘rigidity and premature closure that are risks of a deductive approach’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0961000611434759">Lapadat, 2009</xref>: 926).</p>

<title>The future role of e-books in academic libraries</title>
<p>This subsection presents the librarians’ perceptions and predictions about the future growth of e-book collections in their libraries, the speed of e-book adoption and the role of e-books as a supplementary or dominant format in five years’ time.</p>
<sec id="section7-0961000611434759">
<title>Growth of e-book collections and speed of adoption</title>
<p>There was a consensus amongst the participants that the use of e-book collections in universities would grow over the next five years. However, the growth was seen as dependent on various factors, such as the availability of e-book titles in the market (29 participants), and developments in portable devices (13 participants).</p>
<p>Interviewees differed in the speed with which they felt that e-book collections would be developed. They variously characterised the development as slow (P9, P27 and P30), gradual (P4), considerabe (P28) or as the next thing to ‘take off’ (P11). Some saw that adoption and development would be greater in specific subject fields than in others (P6, P12, P14 and P17).</p>
<p>Several interviewees compared the adoption of e-books with that of e-journals (P3, P6, P10, P17 and P29) and concluded that the adoption of e-books is not as extensive or speedy as was e-journal adoption. According to P29:
<disp-quote>
<p>I don’t think that e-books will replace print books, like e-journals did. There will be more of them in five years’ time … E-books still have a long way to go. There was an assumption that the huge take up of e-journals would just happen with e-books but with all those copyright implications it is more complicated.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0961000611434759">
<title>E-books as supplementary or dominant format</title>
<p>On the whole, the participants saw a future in which e-books would co-exist alongside print books, although opinions varied as to which might be the dominant or supplementary format going forward.</p>
<p>The majority, 22 interviewees, predicted that in five years’ time e-books will remain as supplementary to print books. Four interviewees suggested that e-books will not replace (P13, P18, P19 and P29) print, whilst three (P12, P14 and P27) felt that they will not supersede print:
<disp-quote>
<p>I think that there is a tendency to treat e-books as supplementary to print books at the moment and that will continue for a quite long time. (P15)</p>
<p>I do not see that the library will be completely empty in five years’ time. (P24)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>However, three interviewees were more positive about the future of e-books suggesting that although print books will still be available, e-books would be the dominant format in five years’ time. Some suggested that e-books might become the dominant format in specific subject areas such as: Medicine and Law (P3); Clinical studies (P6); Architecture (P14); Languages, Literature, Arts (P17); Management (P32); and Science and Engineering (P28). P23 suggested that only print reference material will be replaced by e-books, with e-books in general being in the minority in library collections.</p>
<p>One interviewee (P5) was prepared to hazard a prediction of the percentage of book purchases that would be e-books in five years’ time, and suggested that about one-third of all purchases would be e-books, and that students would get at least half or more of their taught course books recommendations electronically.</p>
<p>Either explicit or implicit in this discussion there was recognition that e-books would be particularly useful for providing access to heavily used textbooks (P3, P5 – P7). E-book material would also be helpful to distance learners (P12 and P23), and students who work in hospitals (P31) and are on field trips (P32).</p>

<sec id="section9-0961000611434759">
<title>Factors influencing the adoption of e-books and the development of e-book services in academic libraries</title>
<p>The findings revealed that the development and growth of e-book collections in academic libraries is primarily driven by the key stakeholders: e-book vendors (publishers and aggregators), academic libraries and their user communities. These three stakeholder groups have direct input into decisions about e-book collection developments in academic libraries but they are also affected by those decisions (two-way process). In addition e-book technologies were seen to have an important impact on adoption and development of e-books. Each of these groups of factors is discussed below.</p>

Participants commented on their role in influencing the future of e-books through the availability of titles, licences and DRM restrictions, pricing and business models, and platform functionality.</p>
<p>The availability of e-book titles, especially in terms of quantity (29 participants) but also in terms of format (P9) and up-to-date content (P8), essentially determine the future level of acquisitions. Libraries’ demand for further material in all the subject areas is apparent but there is still evidence that publishers are hesitant to respond and are concerned about reductions in their print sales (five participants):
<disp-quote>
<p>I think that it really depends on whether publishers choose to make more titles available electronically. If they do I imagine that in a lot of areas we will choose to buy e-books, because they will free up some space which is always an issue, unless the price is exorbitant … So, it seems the publishers are dragging their feet and not making them available. (P17)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>It was argued by 26 interviewees that e-book licenses and related DRM, which restrict access to or use of digital content, will affect the future of e-book adoption. A variety of limitations that need to be addressed by vendors were mentioned including: printing (5 interviewees); multiple concurrent access (4 interviewees); viewing of one chapter or one page at time (4 interviewees); off campus access (1 interviewee); saving, downloading, copying and pasting of content (1 interviewee); authentications processes (1 interviewee); and downloading of e-book content on an e-book reader (1 interviewee).</p>
<p>Affordability of individual e-books titles and packages was mentioned by 19 interviewees. For instance, P22 expressed concerns about possible price increases when vendors realise that there is a large market demand. In addition, P2 commented on the maintenance fee payment for some e-book platforms whilst two other interviewees emphasised the importance of the transparency of e-book pricing models, and expressed their current concerns. P4 said:
<disp-quote>
<p>vendors are making their prices a bit less transparent. So, we don’t quite know when we apply to them to buy something how much they are going to charge us and why, and it varies each time. You can’t say that this is the price, this book is going to cost this much. You apply to them to buy it and they say ‘you’ve got 35,000 students, the price we are going to use is this much’.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>It was agreed by 14 participants that platform functionality is crucial, hence future improvements should be considered regarding ease of access including: design of platform interfaces (3 participants); customised features such as adding notes facility (P1); format of e-books (P24); and help guides (P8). Regarding platform interfaces and ease of access, P4 strongly argued that there is need for standardisation in order to avoid user frustration:
<disp-quote>
<p>students are constantly facing a new way of looking at an e-book every time they switch from one title to the other because each supplier has got a different platform.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Commenting on platform searchability, P31 explained that:
<disp-quote>
<p>the searchability of the books themselves probably needs to be improved a bit. One of the big advantages of e-books is that you can search them but the actual mechanisms which are allowing you to do that are a bit primitive like keywords.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The impact of business models was highlighted by 14 interviewees. Some participants expressed the need for provision of models tailored to meet libraries’ needs and requirements such as: models for individual titles (P12) and chapter purchases (P18 and P25); outright models (P1); services that allow the library to select which titles it would like in e-book bundles (P1 and P22); and also models that are viable for the library (P6) and not complicated (P29). As P1 commented:
<disp-quote>
<p>we would like to be able to tailor very carefully what we buy, and that’s actually one of the downsides of NetLibrary. We get a lot of titles that we don’t want as well as those titles that we do want; it’s around them providing a very tailored service to us.</p>

<title>Users</title>
<p>Users’ perspectives on e-books and usage of e-books constitute important drivers since they can play a critical role in the decision making of libraries with regard to e-book acquisitions.</p>
<p>All the interviewees referred to feedback provided by their users including: their expectations (4 participants) and needs (13 participants) for more e-books to be available via the library; their preferences and attitudes (25 participants) in using electronic or print resources; their satisfaction with e-books (6 participants); and expectations that e-book readers should be(one participant) provided by the library.</p>
<p>Evidence of students’ expectations and demand was highlighted by some participants. P3 explained that users expected everything to be available electronically. In addition, many interviewees highlighted that the demand for more e-books to be available from the library is an important element to be taken into consideration.</p>
<p>There is evidence that the interest in and demand for e-books varies between disciplines. For example, P20 commented that some students in Law ‘are crying out for e-books’ whilst others still request print copies. According to three librarians, students in Art and Design (P1, P13 and P14) still prefer to use print material. Conversely, P28 claimed that students in Science and Engineering prefer the electronic format. In addition, P6 observed that people are always moving onto the next technology, and hence they will increasingly have e-book readers and will want more e-books in the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>Four participants explained that decisions about e-book acquisitions can be affected by the types of their students including distance learners and part-time students. As P24 suggested:
<disp-quote>
<p>We have a lot of part-time students, distance learners, people who are combining working with studying; they are not always able to come in to the university to physically look at the book. The demand of that group of users in particular will drive our e-book strategy.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Actually having good data on the level of use of e-books, especially if that data shows increases in demand, or even unsatisfied demand, will be a driver for the development of e-book services. The extent of e-book usage was reported by 10 interviewees. For example, P16 said:
<disp-quote>
<p>Obviously, usage stats … if e-books are heavily used then the library would react to that and try to make more e-books available to users. On the other hand, if users are not interested in e-books at all and e-books’ usage is either dwindling or very static then the library may respond by investing less in e-books.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>P26 and P27 agreed that users’ feedback on the numbers of e-books, their subject coverage and accessibility issues is crucial.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0961000611434759">
<title>Academic libraries</title>
<p>Libraries’ response in the building of e-book collections can be vital in terms of budget allocation, provision of appropriate e-book material, delivery of e-books, marketing/promotion and user education, liaison with the e-book vendors and space arrangements. These parameters are presented below, with marketing/promotion and user education first, because this generated the most comments.</p>
<p>Usage of e-books can be driven by the libraries, thus development of their marketing (six interviewees) and promotion practices (25 interviewees) is crucial. Improvements in various channels of promotion were mentioned including library websites (P4, P24, P25 and P32) and user education (13 interviewees). Three participants (P4, P17 and P31) believed that particular emphasis should be given on the promotion of the benefits of e-books.</p>
<p>The provision of more e-book titles (P5, P7, P9, P20), the selection of appropriate resources (P8 and P18) including acquisition of targeted titles rather than packages (P8 and P23) can generate high volumes of e-book usage. P23 argued that the switch to buying individual titles that are on reading lists, through MyiLibrary, would make a big difference to usage because that is the material that the students are looking for. Additionally, searching for individual titles on the OPAC is more convenient for the users rather than searching within e-book packages such as those from NetLibrary. Furthermore, library policies on the management of e-books could further assist librarians in the selection and de-selection of e-book material (P16 and P20).</p>
<p>The use of various access routes for the dissemination of e-books (six interviewees) and their inclusion on the OPAC (three interviewees) was highlighted by some participants since that will make the content more visible and findable for the users. In order to facilitate access to e-book material, provision of appropriate technological equipment, such as e-book readers (4 interviewees) would be beneficial.</p>
<p>According to eight participants, librarians should provide feedback to e-book vendors, to advocate libraries needs, including requesting wider availability of titles (P15, P20, P26 and P31). Professional bodies (P20) and consortia (P29) can facilitate this communication:
<disp-quote>
<p>Law libraries should use our professional body to put pressure on the publishers to make e-textbooks available for our students. (P20)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Budgetary constraints and allocation of more money for e-books were mentioned by seven participants. For instance, P5 explained that in the Management subject area:
<disp-quote>
<p>there are hundreds of titles available that I could buy if the money was available but it is not.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Space constraints in library buildings can be a crucial driver towards the growth of e-book collections (five participants). As P15 predicted:
<disp-quote>
<p>e-books might become a more favourable option because of shelf space, as we are going down to one library.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Other parameters mentioned include:</p>
<list id="list6-0961000611434759" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>staff awareness of e-books available by the library would enhance their capacity to promote them better at service desk (P18);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>subject librarians’ preferences for print or electronic material (P16); and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>liaison with the academics in order to bring them on board (P5, P12 and P29).</p></list-item>
</list>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0961000611434759">
<title>E-book technology developers</title>
<p>Developments in e-book technologies were also mentioned as an important factor in driving the development of e-book collections. Comments focused on e-reader technologies, and e-book functionalities and developments.</p>
<p>Technological improvements and increased prevalence of e-book readers have the potential to alter and increase the delivery of the content thus the uptake of e-books (13 participants). In addition, growth of other technologies was mentioned by a few participants who referred to mobiles (P9 and P14), PDAs (P6), ipods and e-paper (P9).</p>
<p>A few interviewees supported that e-books themselves can be a driver. For instance, the on and off campus accessibility (P9); the fact that they do not have physical implications (P1 and P2) for the libraries; and that they reduce the cost of the whole process such as in cataloguing and shelving (P3). Further improvements in e-book technology to facilitate reading on a screen could also add extra value (P11).</p>

<title>Implications of the increasing importance of e-books for academic libraries</title>
<p>Future development and growth of e-book collections has a number of consequences for libraries. These include changes to the provision of technological equipment; the use of library space; user education and support; staff workload; and other issues.</p>
<sec id="section15-0961000611434759">
<title>Provision of technological equipment</title>
<p>Provision of appropriate technological equipment for the delivery and accessibility of e-book content was highlighted <italic>by</italic> the most participants (16). Higher availability of e-books will require acquisition of additional PCs (8 participants) and laptops (3 participants) as well as printers (3 participants). Interestingly, loaning of e-book readers to the users was highlighted only by 4 participants. Only one participant (P24) referred to the installation of appropriate software such as Adobe Reader on library computers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0961000611434759">
<title>Changing the use of library space</title>
<p>The most noticeable impact will be on the reconstruction of library buildings due to the decrease of physical space for housing print collections (14 participants). The spaces reclaimed by reducing shelves can be re-purposed for student study and collaboration spaces (5 participants). Spaces can be used for accommodating technological tools (3 participants) such as PCs, laptops and printers.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>If you have more e-books, you will have more different kinds of study space for students, such as social study spaces. (P16)</p>
<p>If you have less stock you have got less physical shelves and then you fill in it with computers so that people can access the electronic stuff. (P25)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0961000611434759">
<title>User education and support</title>
<p>More focus on user education and support on usage of e-books were mentioned by two and three participants, respectively. According to P28, e-book technology is:
<disp-quote>
<p>rather more complicated and variable, not to forget regularly changing, and requires rather a lot more assistance in use than printed media.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0961000611434759">
<title>Staff workload</title>
<p>Opinions regarding changes in the amount of workload conflicted. Two participants predicted a decrease in their workload given that the circulation of print material would be less (P30) but two others disagreed. According to P24 and P8, workload will increase since e-book acquisition is more complex than that for print material (P24), material in new formats such as e-books needs to be added on the catalogue (P8) and additional technological issues need to be solved to ensure a high quality service to users (P8).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0961000611434759">
<title>Other issues</title>
<p>Some issues were mentioned by only a few interviewees. The provision of technological equipment implies additional spending for the library but also cost for the users when they print out e-book pages or chapters. In addition, copyright is an issue in cases where users want to print out the whole e-book. For instance, P20 explained:
<disp-quote>
<p>we will have got the issue with the print credits and the students will say ‘why should I pay to print out this chapter of a book while I used to take it out for free?’ That is something which students have mentioned to me before. Students then wanted to print the entire book out. So, then we have got copyright issues.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>P29 suggested that there will be a need for the development of different cataloguing techniques because of the increased quantity of acquisitions, whilst P28 observed that the larger e-book collections will be less definable than existing book stock and hence more difficult to manage in terms of monitoring, cataloguing and maintenance.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section20-0961000611434759">
<title>Summary</title>
<p>Although growth of e-book availability is seen as inevitable during the next five years, interviewees differed in their views as to the speed of adoption and development. The co-existence of print and electronic formats was anticipated by all the participants, although the majority of them suggested that e-books will remain supplementary to print books. Overall, dominance of the electronic format is expected by only three participants whereas some others felt that e-books will be dominant only in specific subject areas.</p>
<p>Participants mentioned a very wide range of factors that might affect future developments in the adoption of e-books, and the development of e-book collections in academic libraries. These are summarised in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0961000611434759">Table 2</xref>.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly, the growth of e-book collections implies various changes such as provision of e-book reading devices, redeployment of library spaces, re-allocation of librarians’ tasks and roles, and focus on improvements on the user education and support.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study is the first to gather insights into the views of academic librarians on the future of e-books and the development of e-books collections, and as such there is no comparable study. However, perhaps not surprisingly, when invited to discuss the future, participants projected from their experience of the present, and hence many of the factors that they identified as influencing the future are grounded on the issues that they are experiencing in their current practice in working with e-books. And, many of these issues have been identified and discussed by other authors, most notably the two major studies that have studied the management of e-book collections in academic libraries, JISC’s National e-book Observatory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0961000611434759">IAL, 2009</xref>), and ‘E-book Collections: ARL Spec Kit 313’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961000611434759">Anson and Connell, 2009</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0961000611434759">IAL (2009</xref>: iv) established ‘objectives to investigate: selection; licensing and pricing models; cataloguing and MARC records; ways of accessing e-books; promotion: evaluation; and the platform interface through which the JISC e-books were available’. Accordingly, there is common ground between some of the topics covered in their study and this research, most notably with respect to some of the factors that drive student demand for e-books, the view that e-textbooks should co-exist with printed text book collections, licensing and pricing issues, the need for libraries to promote and market e-books, and the limitations of vendors statistics. In addition, there have been a range of other studies that have investigated some of the aspects of e-book management that have been mentioned by participants in this research. For example:</p>

</list>
<p>However, the uniqueness of this current study lies in the openness of its research approach. Although additional prompts were used, the opening questions were very broad. For example, on the matter of factors that would affect the future of e-book collections, the question was no more specific than that. Contrary to other studies, the research reported in this article did not go systematically through the different stages or aspects of e-book collection management, but left it open to participants to cite the factors that they thought were important. In this process some factors that have received much attention in other studies were barely mentioned. For example, in reflecting on future developments, little reference was made to selection processes, cataloguing and access to e-books, the role of academics, or indeed, software interfaces. The focus is rather much more on the role of the academic library as intermediary seeking to provide a superior digital service to users, being constrained by vendors who are still groping for sustainable business models and are seeking to secure their position through licensing, DRM, pricing models and availability of titles.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-0961000611434759" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion and recommendations</title>
<p>Amongst the participants in this study – academic librarians, with roles as subject librarian, e-resources librarian and cataloguer – there is a general acknowledgement that academic libraries need to develop their e-book collections and services, in anticipation of increasing demand from users, and in recognition that if students, for example, can not access e-books through their university library, then, if they can, they will go elsewhere. On the other hand, these academic librarians found it difficult to predict the speed of developments, which they feel are largely in the hands of e-book vendors (publishers and aggregators) who, in turn, are cautious about the potential threat of e-books to the long-term sustainability of their businesses. Academic libraries find themselves, even more than usual, as intermediaries between interested e-book users on one hand, and reluctant publishers on the other. This stand-off will eventually be resolved, because ultimately all businesses (publishers and aggregators in this instance) have to respond to demand before an innovative competitor erodes their market position, even if this involves re-configuring the industry and its business models.</p>
<p>At the moment, then, academic libraries are in a position in which it is difficult to plan for the future development of e-book services, but the participants in this study were aware of a range of drivers that would shape that future. These drivers can be grouped on the basis of the potential impacts of the various stakeholder groups on the supply, delivery, access to, use of and technological development regarding e-books. A significant level of adoption of e-books in support of learning in universities will have a range of consequences for the role and activities of libraries.</p>
<p>This study suggests that in order to advance the use of e-books in academic libraries, librarians need to:</p>
<list id="list8-0961000611434759" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>formulate a strategy for the development of their e-book collections over the next five years;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>work with academics and users to understand the ways in which e-books can be used to support learning, and, in particular, to further understand the difference between disciplines;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>continue to build relationships with e-book vendors that are both challenging and collaborative, and lead to a sustainable outcome for all stakeholder groups;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>work in partnership and in consortia with other libraries to benchmark evolving practice, and to support engagement across the academic library community with evolving standards, technologies, and licensing and pricing.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Research has a valuable role to play in supporting academic librarians in all of these endeavours. In addition, researchers have a role in offering insights and projections to enable academic librarians to adapt to a future in which e-books represent a significant, or even the major proportion of their stock.</p>
