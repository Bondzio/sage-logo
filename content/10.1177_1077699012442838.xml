<p>One of the great challenges in teaching any opinion-writing class is explaining how an opinion piece can be readable, compelling, and fair while still having more structure than a letter (or email or text) home to mother.</p>
<p>In <italic>The New York Times Reader: Arts and Culture</italic>, Don McLeese effectively shows how to “teach” arts reviewing. McLeese, a journalism professor at the University of Iowa, is certainly qualified to write about arts reviewing. He is a former popular music critic for the <italic>Chicago Sun-Times</italic> and <italic>Austin American-Statesman</italic>, and he writes for numerous publications on a freelance basis. Through many examples, some question-and-answer interviews with <italic>Times</italic> reviewers, and his own commentary, he provides an informative guide for anyone who teaches arts-reviewing classes.</p>
<p>Finding a textbook for an opinion- or review-writing class has always been a challenge, at least to journalism and communication instructors, in part because the world of the arts moves and changes so quickly that a textbook is usually outdated before it is published. Just as a class is discussing, say, television and the impact of premium channels such as HBO and Showtime, along comes the likes of <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Hulu.com">Hulu.com</ext-link> and online TV shows. And the environment for film—with streaming video, Red Box DVDs, and more—moves even faster. Good writing will always be good writing, but it’s still hard for the author of a textbook to keep up.</p>
<p>McLeese’s book would be a handy supplement overall for arts-writing classes. It offers many examples of reviews—films, music television, art, dance, theater, and even video games—written by, of course, <italic>New York Times</italic> critics and reporters. (The book is a part of a CQ Press series on specialty reporting.) McLeese supplements these examples with the critic interviews, longer arts stories by <italic>Times</italic> writers, and his own commentary. The best and most practical aspect of the book is his “dissecting” of the reviews. This diagramming of the reviews points out what he states are the key portions of most reviews: description, context, interpretation, and evaluation. This relatively simple explanation would be of particular use during the first portion of an opinion-writing class.</p>
<p>The book combines older, perhaps classic, reviews by some of the greats—Christopher Lehmann-Haupt, Vincent Canby, Jack Gould—and relatively current examples. McLeese cannot completely avoid the problems faced by authors of other arts-reviewing textbooks: some of the reviews used as examples seem a little outdated. A review of the hit TV show <italic>24</italic>, for instance, might seem “so last year” to students who have been raised on the Internet, and who can instantly find a review of a video game or a play that debuted six hours ago. But such is the drawback of using conventional presses and paper to communicate.</p>
<p>A more serious drawback of an otherwise useful book, however, is its failure to address the elephant in the room when it comes to reviewing: the role of the Internet in the promotion of the citizen–reviewer and the demotion of the professional reviewer. One or two of the critic interviews touch briefly on the phenomenon of bloggers as critics, but the author does not really address this issue head on. The growth of the Internet has of course had a dramatic effect on newspapers overall. Critics, in particular, have suffered greatly, and their ranks are thinning dramatically. It would be difficult to avoid a discussion of their status in any review-writing class. The book also could benefit from a practical section on how one becomes a reviewer, or at least how anyone interested in such a career could get started.</p>
<p>In general, however, <italic>The New York Times Reader: Arts and Culture</italic> is an interesting and useful book that would be a practical and valuable text for students in most arts-writing classes.</p>
