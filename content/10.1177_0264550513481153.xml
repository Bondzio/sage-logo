<title>Resettlement and care for older prisoners and ex-offenders</title>
<p>RECOOP is a charity that promotes the care, resettlement and rehabilitation of older prisoners, offenders and ex-offenders - in particular those over the age of 50 - through the provision of support services, advocacy, financial advice, mentoring on issues such as employment and training, and advice on housing and health. The support aims to enable them to take control of their lives and remain free from offending, and to prevent them from becoming socially excluded. The charity offers advice and support to prisoners, ex-offenders, families, carers, supporters, staff in the criminal justice system and voluntary and statutory bodies and agencies. RECOOP provides assistance both in prison and in the community. In prison RECOOP provides direct services for older prisoners; provides information and advice, low level social care and advocacy to older prisoners; and promotes older prisoner health and well-being. In the community, RECOOP supports and advises older people on release from prison to improve opportunities for resettlement and rehabilitation; and supports older people with non-custodial sentences. More information about accessing the service is available at www.recoop.org.uk</p>

<title>In-reach support for veterans in prison</title>
<p>Prison In-Reach (PIR) is an initiative that aims to ensure all veterans in prison or on probation, their families and those working with the resettlement services, are fully aware of the support available from the Service Personnel and Veterans Agency (SPVA) and the ex-Service organizations. This includes help before and after release. Prison and probation staff have access to the information provided by the Service Personnel and Veteran’s Agency (SPVA) UK website and the site can be accessed from prison and probation computer systems. The SPVA website enables prison and probation staff to access information on their work, including the help it provides to all veterans on pensions, compensation, and access to Service records, medical entitlements, and welfare advice and support. The information can be used to assist with sharing the details with ex-Service offenders. In addition to the website information, the Royal British Legion, Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Families Association-Forces Help and the mental health charity Combat Stress all provide welfare visits to veterans in prison and to their families. These visits do not count against an offender’s personal visit allowance. It is important that veterans in prison, especially those close to their release date, have access to such visits if they need them so that they can be helped through the crucial period either side of release. The PIR work hopes to improve the ways veterans in the criminal justice system have access to information and hopes that veterans can be shown the advice and support available to them by criminal justice professionals. The Veterans UK website can be accessed at www.veterans-uk.info and includes full details of the Prison in Reach support.</p>
