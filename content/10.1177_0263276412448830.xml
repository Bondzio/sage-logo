<abstract>
<p>The ‘mathematical imaginary’ at work in psychology is central to the contingent history of the discipline, but is also responsible for considerable confusion and ambiguity around the ontological assumptions of psychological theories and models. Rather than reject the mathematical altogether, this article argues for an alternative form of mathematical description in psychology through the use of topology. Drawing on DeLanda’s topological account of the virtual, the relationship between psychology and ontology is progressively questioned in relation to memory. Henri Bergson’s conception of duration and the pure past is juxtaposed with the topological psychology of Kurt Lewin and its notion of life space as a manifold with <italic>n</italic>-dimensions. Using a diagrammatic strategy developed by Mullarkey, an actualist account of the virtual is used to hold these distinct bodies of work together. Psychological events may be given a ‘thick description’ through the identification of topological relations and invariants. The interplay between the actual entities that are afforded in experience can be seen to be virtualized as planes of irreality. A topological approach to psychology offers the opportunity of replacing the taxonomy of essences common to the discipline with a dynamic account of invariance through homeomorphism.</p>

<p>[T]he determination of topological relationships is the fundamental task in all psychological problems. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0263276412448830">Lewin, 1936</xref>: 87)</p></disp-quote></p>
<sec id="sec1-0263276412448830"><title>Origins</title>
<p>By 1967, Herbert Simon once predicted, the majority of psychology will take the form of computer programs (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0263276412448830">Newell and Simon, 1963</xref>). This expression of what we might call the ‘mathematical imaginary’, shared by a particular type of psychologist, neatly encapsulates an entire historical trajectory traced by the discipline. Psychology separated itself from philosophy by applying the logic of differential calculus to the study of mind. The earliest forms of psychological experimentation (e.g. Wundt, Ebbinghaus) established a relationship between rates of the presentation of stimuli and the rate of some response made by the experimental subject. The mathematical function that is thereby obtained was considered to directly represent a psychological operation that would then be postulated by theoretical deduction. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0263276412448830">Ebbinghaus (1913</xref> [1885]), for example, derived a function that he dubbed a ‘forgetting curve’ by calculating the differential between the presentation of sequence of random numbers and the subsequent serial recall of the stimuli.</p>
<p>If one were to unpack what Isabelle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0263276412448830">Stengers (2010)</xref> calls a ‘contingent history of science’ in the case of psychology, then this practical application of differential calculus deserves to be considered as an ‘event’ – an intensive, symmetry-breaking threshold where novelty emerges in the thinking of the psychological and its rendering as a scientific object. The psychological subject is transformed into a mathematical space in which a huge variety of functions can be plotted (e.g. rates of forgetting, diminution of attention, levels of anxiety). In fact the only constraint on the number of functions that can be produced through this process is the limitation of the empirical creativity of the experimentalists concerned. Small wonder that William James – who was responsible in part for the establishment of one of the first experimental psychology laboratories in North America – spent much of his <italic>Principles of Psychology</italic> attempting to produce a cohesive theoretical framework around the burgeoning range of data produced in this mathematized space of the subject.</p>
<p>By the time Simon made his prediction, this mathematical space had undergone numerous revisions. The behaviourist or ‘empty organism’ approach had attempted to purge subjectivity altogether by recourse to the positivist procedure of treating the derived functions as law-like regularities that did not require further specification. However, progressively, it was realized that for any psychological act of sufficient complexity, the functions were inaccurate and required further modification to be plausible, usually in the form of nesting differential relations of stimulus–response rates within one another. These were expressed as massive algebraic expansions that quite literally transformed psychological research into mathematical puzzle-solving, albeit of a mundane and time-consuming sort (a movement known as ‘informal behaviourism’). The difficulty here is that the algebraic formulation of even a basic psychological act reaches such a byzantine level of intricacy that it appears wildly implausible – the function seems to disintegrate into symbolic dust. The elegant solution to this difficulty was to inject reflexivity into the mathematical space. If we continuously feed the outcome of a given calculation back into the formula to create new starting conditions then dynamism returns to the otherwise inflexible regularity. And if it is then assumed that the psychological subject itself engages in just this kind of continuous feedback, the mathematical space is transformed. The subject is no longer the referent of a mathematical <italic>operation</italic> but is rather itself a mathematical <italic>operator</italic> which is continuously (re)tracing its own mathematical coordinates. In this way the declaration that psychology is reducible to a kind of computational modelling, by way of Simon’s analogy with the program, is curiously a kind of empowering of the subject, which is granted its own autonomy for self-calculation, since it is now recognized as a self-governing cybernetic system (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0263276412448830">Dupuy, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>This brief and crude history of psychology is designed to illustrate the extent to which mathematics and mathesis plays a crucial yet also ambiguous role in the shaping of psychological thinking. Much effort has been expended both inside and outside the discipline in the critique of the kinds of statistical assumptions that psychologists make in the generation of quantitative data, especially data from experiments (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0263276412448830">Cohen, 1994</xref>, for a very precise statement). The myriad epistemological problems that arise from placing statistical norms at the centre of psychological research have been thoroughly exposed (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0263276412448830">Rose, 1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0263276412448830">1996</xref>). But what is less discussed is the particular way in which numerical reasoning – the ‘mathematical imaginary’ – directly structures ontological assumptions within psychology. Number dominates not only the way psychologists tend to generate knowledge, but also how they typically conceive of the very object given to their studies.</p>
<p>But let me immediately make some caveats. Not all psychology is entirely in thrall to number. Historically, there are dialects within the discipline that have been in dialogue with phenomenology and have attempted a sustained non-mathematical effort at thinking subjectivity (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0263276412448830">Brown and Stenner, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0263276412448830">Curt, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0263276412448830">Shotter, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0263276412448830">Tolman, 1994</xref>). Similarly, alternatives to experimentation (so-called qualitative methods) have been well developed, such that in some areas, such as social psychology, the range of philosophical, practical and sometimes ideological divisions between researchers are simply glossed as ‘quantitative vs qualitative psychology’ (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0263276412448830">Willig, 2012</xref>). When this division is entrenched, two apocalyptic visions of the future of psychology are afforded. Coming from one side, quantitative research is the guarantee of objectivity, scientificity and, ultimately, of a unity of knowledge that is threatened by an immature return to a pre-scientific notion of the subject that will dissolve the discipline into politically-oriented squabbles that will destroy its professional standing. And from the other, there is the corresponding idea that premature quantification of the subject, in the form outlined in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0263276412448830">Heidegger’s (1993)</xref> famous description of mathesis, is a project which is corrosive to the adequate thinking of Being and will ultimately reduce psychology into an instrument of social administration (or ‘the police’ as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0263276412448830">Canguilhem, 1980</xref>, had it), unless the discipline can be re-founded on more appropriate conceptual and methodological grounds.</p>
<p>Tempting as it is to replay these debates once more, in this article I will deliberately ignore this particular division. I will neither simply reject nor affirm quantification as the basis for psychology, but will instead seek to examine the ontological implications of different mathematical assumptions as they are played out in psychological research. The strategy I will pursue here will be to explore what a particular branch of modern mathematics – namely topology – can offer to psychological thinking. Here I will orient to Manuel DeLanda’s description of topology as ‘the least differentiated geometry’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0263276412448830">2002</xref>: 26); that is, a set of descriptions of invariance in a relatively undifferentiated, non-Euclidean space. Such a mathematical space can be seen as prior to and in some sense implied by the Euclidean space of subject–object transactions typically posited in psychology.</p>
<p>Invoking DeLanda’s work immediately brings with it an engagement with the question of the ‘virtual’ and the merits of this term for social scientific analysis. Part of the difficulty of addressing this question is that in Deleuze and Bergson’s work, upon which DeLanda draws, the distinction between virtual and actual is premised upon a further distinction between psychology and ontology. Here the topics that are usually treated as defining psychology, such as memory, emotion and perception, are raised to the status of ontological questions by forcing them beyond the limits of any given experience. That is to say that an adequate treatment of a topic such as memory necessarily departs from a concern with the particular experiences of any given person in favour of a questioning of the impersonal conditions of memorial experiences <italic>as such</italic> (as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0263276412448830">Ansell Pearson’s 2002</xref> treatment of ‘the time of life’ as the basis for approaching memory). I am acutely aware that making such a Bergsonian ‘turn beyond experience’ may render psychology obsolete for many thinkers, with its questions better posed in formal philosophical terms. However such ontological elevation risks mystification if it does not supply the means by which ontological terms (such as ‘virtual’ or ‘duration’) can be translated back into notions which allow purchase on mundane experience, even if they necessarily challenge and expand what may count as such experience. Here <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0263276412448830">DeLanda’s (2002)</xref> call to identify the processes through which actualization takes place can be heeded by drawing on topology to describe how invariants taken in an ontological sense may either persist or be transformed as they are expressed in psychological terms.</p>
<p>There is, in fact, an existing attempt to use topology for just this kind of philosophical renewal within the discipline – Kurt Lewin’s <italic>Principles of Topological Psychology</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0263276412448830">1936</xref>). This work will be discussed at some length as we proceed. I will argue that juxtaposing Lewin’s work with that of Bergson lends weight to an ‘actualist’ interpretation of the virtual, where topological abstraction can offer a thick description of psychological events. The juxtaposition will be conducted using a ‘diagrammatic’ strategy proposed by John <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0263276412448830">Mullarkey (2006)</xref>. This involves an attempt at a visual representation of a conceptual argument. Mullarkey argues that in circumstances where we are confronted with ‘systems of reference’ that are fundamentally opposed, a diagram can serve as a subtractive or condensed presentation of a theory. The diagram is affirmative – it offers no critique, no suggestion of synthesis. It allows the implicit contradictions of a theory to be visually unfolded in the diagram itself. My intention in using diagrams to juxtapose markedly different approaches in this way is to ask what kind of space would be required for two or more seeming opposed diagrammed theories to be compossible.</p>
<p>For the most part, I will use the psychology of memory as my source of examples. In part this choice is because memory is central to both Bergson and Deleuze’s Bergsonism, and hence is thoroughly implicated in the question of the virtual. But as an area, memory has always captured the mathematical imaginary of psychologists, given the peculiar combination of quantities (rates of forgetting) and qualities (distinctions between memory processes) that are debated here.</p>
<p>Where better, then, to mobilize a different kind of mathematical imaginary in psychology, one that is hopefully better equipped to address the ontological difficulties that have beset the discipline.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0263276412448830"><title>Boxes</title>
<p>The psychology of memory is one of the defining areas of research within the discipline. Its progress stands as a good exemplar for the discipline as a whole, with its shift from rudimentary experimental attempts to measure the power of recall quantitatively, through speculative attempts to model the cognitive architecture that defines the executive and storage functions in remembering, to the current preoccupation with seeing memory as the ongoing reconstruction of the past in multilayered cognitive-neural networks of brain mental activity (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0263276412448830">Draaisma, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0263276412448830">Schacter, 1996</xref>). For the most part, research in this area uses traditional forms of psychological experimentation that involve manipulation of external stimuli to explore the effects on responses, taken to indicate the workings of cognitive processes. Theoretical work starts from the assumption that memory can be treated as a system whose boundaries and limits are defined by the overall cognitive architecture of mind, which will at some point in the future be mapped clearly on to the neural structure of the brain.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0263276412448830">Figure 1</xref> shows a ‘classic’ organization of some of the cognitive processes involved in memory. The logic of this diagram is deceptively straightforward. The first box depicts an input of some kind, which is received by the perceptual system denoted by the second box. The perceptual sensations generated by receptors are then transmitted onwards to a set of central or ‘executive’ control processes (the third box), which have at least two general roles: they temporarily prolong perceptions such that they can be subject to further processing and also store these same perceptions by forwarding them to the final box – long-term memory. Processing may further involve the summoning of relevant contents back from long-term memory, which may be blended with the ‘new’ perceptions to arrive at an output, shown here as the final additional smaller box.
<fig id="fig1-0263276412448830" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Simplified model of memory (after <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0263276412448830">Atkinson and Schiffrin, 1968</xref>).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0263276412448830-fig1.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>This is, of course, a ridiculously simplified model of memory. There is considerably more complexity and subtlety in recent work such as Conway’s conception of autobiographical memory (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0263276412448830">Conway and Pleydell-Pearce, 2000</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0263276412448830">Lansdale’s (2004)</xref> studies of acropetal memory and current ecological approaches to remembering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0263276412448830">Manier, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0263276412448830">Sutton, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0263276412448830">Winograd et al., 1999</xref>). Nevertheless the simplified model encapsulates much of the default or standard assumptions that define cognitive approaches to memory. The very representational form this model takes is telling and begs a series of questions. What do the boxes and arrows actually denote? Their form suggests that they are substances and processes. The boxes are stable entities of some sort, and the arrows are functional relations denoting an exchange (either unidirectional or bidirectional) between these entities. But this is not the case. The first box – ‘environmental input’ – must have some entitative status, not least because contained within it is the whole causal universe that the subject might perceive. Similarly, the fifth box – ‘response output’ – can only really refer in entitative terms to the embodiment through which this output is enacted. But the remaining three boxes are best understood as bundles of processes, although the third – ‘long-term memory’ – sounds markedly more thing-like than the other two. The very division into boxes suggests an implied Cartesian subject/object distinction, but it is unclear where the boundaries are drawn. The diagram seems to show a subject who has equal standing to the ‘environment’ – but should not, properly speaking, boxes 2–5 be contained within box 1? And for that matter should not boxes 3 and 4 (as the ‘cognitive’ bits) be contained within boxes 2 and 5 (as the ‘embodied’ bits)? The same kinds of difficulties arise when we think about the arrows. The arrow between boxes 2 and 3 is a ‘perception’, but what is the arrow between boxes 3 and 4? Is it still a perception or is it already a memory? If the latter, then how did this transformation occur? But what then is the reverse arrow coming back from box 4 to 3? It might be a memory, or a memory in the process of becoming restored to the status of a perception or something else entirely. Finally how are we to understand the blank space outside the boxes? In what kind of space is this set of relations placed? How are the temporal dimensions of this space to be understood, given the nominal impossibility of thinking memory outside of time?</p>
<p>Leaving aside the actual theoretical postulates of given cognitive models of memory, by itself the diagram reveals a number of difficulties. There is an implicit dualism, where the subject is given far greater weight than the environment. Differences in behavioural output are functionally related to something in the broader world that serves as input, but appear ultimately to be determined to a far greater extent by what happens ‘within’ the subject itself. The whole process of remembering appears to occur in a space that is outside of any particular context or historical contingency. In other words, memory unfolds in a space that is never anywhere in particular, that is, as a form of pure transcendence. Allied to this is the lack of any specification of a time function, leading us to assume that Newtonian or reversible time is implied. This would mean that running the model backwards would make no difference to the key properties that are expressed. However, if the model is applied repeated to a series of episodes of remembering, long-term memory (box 4) would expand quantitatively. There would be more placed ‘in it’ with each iteration. This means, in turn, that over time there is a greater likelihood of a ‘match’ between the contents of long-term memory and incoming perceptions – as we get older, more situations resemble those we have previously experienced – and correspondingly that the processing and outputs would be qualitatively different as time progresses. Time matters for this model, yet nowhere is it described.</p>
<p>To sum up, the problem with this model is not that it is a mechanical image of an organic process. Nor is it that it offers a reductive mathematical approximation (the differential between input and output rates) to describe human action. Rather, <italic>it is neither sufficiently mechanical nor properly reductive</italic>. It fails to properly clarify the entities and processes that it claims are at work, and it gives no description of the mathematical space in which these points and vectors are distributed. These type of models are often critiqued for suggesting a ‘container’ view of memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0263276412448830">Middleton and Brown, 2005</xref>), but here we have little sense of what is contained and what is doing the containing, nor of basic features of the space–time in which all this is thought to occur. What we have here is an ontological incoherency based on a lack of mathematical specification.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0263276412448830"><title>Cones</title>
<p>Much of the critique of the psychological model of memory described above is derived from Bergson’s <italic>Matter and Memory</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0263276412448830">1991 [1908]</xref>). In this key work, Bergson elevates certain aspects of memory to an ontological category – ‘pure memory’ – that grounds a unique account of the mechanisms underpinning recollection in the form of the actualization of memory-images. What is of interest to us here is the manner in which Bergson points towards a different mobilization of the mathematical in relation to memory, one that enables us to think the outside of the boxes we encountered in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0263276412448830">Figure 1</xref>. As I will go on to show shortly, this thinking ultimately leads us toward topology.</p>
<p><italic>Matter and Memory</italic> famously delivers a version of the psychological that bypasses subject–object dualism. In place of the bounded perceiving subject that stands over and against the world of objects, we have a monist account of a plane of images – including that image we call our body – acting upon one another. Perception, on this account, is not the passive reception of an object (or its copy), but rather a process of reflection and refraction as images communicate movement through one another. What we perceive is selected aspects of an image – a ‘virtual image’ – that are structured by the potential they offer for our own actions: ‘our needs are… so many searchlights which, directed upon the continuity of sensible qualities, single out in it distinct bodies’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0263276412448830">Bergson, 1991 [1908]</xref>: 198). Perception is then a relational process that is subtractive; out of the multiple possible virtual images that might be reflected in the encounter between my ‘body-image’ and another image, the one that offers the most to my ongoing needs is selected. In respect to the account of the psychological that is unfolded here, what Bergson does is to de-throne consciousness by arguing that it adds nothing in representational terms and that, crucially, reflection is not a property of the subject as such but rather a relational process where perception is never singular (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0263276412448830">Massumi, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Bergson’s account of the spatial plane in which communication between images occurs stresses something like a physics of perception – terms such as ‘refraction’, ‘vibration’ and ‘resonance’ dominate. We can address a great many memory issues by treating remembering, with respect to this plane, as the prolonging of a virtual image within an action. For example, our ability to remember how to write or to drive – usually referred to as ‘procedural memory’ in psychology – can be considered as a mechanical problem involving the body’s capacity to prolong the movement of a virtual image within the effectors of its nervous system (termed ‘habit-memory’ by Bergson). We might extend this description to recuperate some aspects of the model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0263276412448830">Figure 1</xref>, on condition that these processes are ‘de-subjectified’ and treated outwith a bounded consciousness that is managing reflection.</p>
<p>However, when it comes to the more complex question of the modes through which we remember distinct aspects of our past experience – so-called ‘episodic’ and ‘autobiographical’ memories – we must turn towards Bergson’s conception of time as ‘duration’. Here Bergson famously describes time as qualitative flow, an intensive ‘continuous variation’ that does not in itself contain portions or instants. This is contrasted with the notion of ‘clock time’ or the division of time into passing instants, which is, for Bergson, a secondary spatialization of time that is accomplished by the organism to serve its own survival needs and interests. If the temporal character of memory is fashioned after duration, then it may be described in the following way:<disp-quote>
<p>Duration is the continuous progress of the past which gnaws into the future and which swells as it advances. And as the past grows without ceasing, so also there is no limit to its preservation. Memory, as we have tried to prove, is not a faculty for putting away recollections in a drawer, or of inscribing them in a register. There is no register, no drawer; there is not even, properly speaking, a faculty, for a faculty works intermittently, when it will or when it can, while the piling up of the past upon the past goes on without relaxation. In reality the past is preserved by itself, automatically. In its entirety, probably, it follows us at every instant; all that we have felt, thought and willed from earliest infancy is there, leaning over the present which is about to join it, pressing against the portals of consciousness that would fain leave it outside. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0263276412448830">Bergson, 1998</xref>: 4–5)</p></disp-quote>This passage from <italic>Creative Evolution</italic> (1998 [1911]) summarizes much of what is at stake in viewing memory from the perspective of duration. If there are no divisions, as such, within duration, then the idea of memory as the effort to preserve discrete episodes of lived experiences is nonsensical. There are never any gaps in experience to fill, no break between my current perception and the totality of my past. Everything is already there ‘preserved by itself’. And yet this preservation cannot be thought of as a container or an archive, since duration, by definition is not spatialized as such. There is no need to add the box marked ‘long-term memory’ found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0263276412448830">Figure 1</xref>.</p>
<p>What, though, is the status of this ‘past’ that ‘follows us at every instant’? There is a significant interpretive divergence here. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0263276412448830">Deleuze’s (1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0263276412448830">1999)</xref> reading of Bergson claims that ‘only the present is “psychological”; but the past is pure ontology; pure recollection has only ontological significance’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0263276412448830">Deleuze, 1991</xref>: 56). Which is to say that, insofar as we are considering the act of recollection itself, we remain within psychology. But if we attempt to account for the necessary grounds through which these acts are performed, we pass to ontology. This, for Deleuze, is the more significant intellectual project, since ‘we can see that… psychology is now only an opening onto ontology, a springboard for an “installation” in Being’ (1991: 76). The pure past has no direct psychological significance; it concerns instead an impersonal time, a virtual plane of Being which may actualize itself in the form of mundane, concrete personal experiences, and is therefore the creative engine that affords the psychological.</p>
<p>But in contrast to this ‘virtualist’ reading of pure memory, we clearly see in the excerpt cited above that there is a crucial psychological dimension in Bergson’s account. What matters is ‘all we have felt, thought and willed from earliest infancy’. It is not the totality of the past as such that is significant, but only that portion of it that I can call ‘mine’. John <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0263276412448830">Mullarkey (2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0263276412448830">2006)</xref> presses this point to advocate an ‘actualist’ reading of the pure past. He argues that recollection – those psychological processes Deleuze sees as a mere ‘springboard’ – require no further grounding in anything outside of themselves. If perception is already divided, such that the present into which duration ‘gnaws’ is already imbued with the power to creatively differ from itself, then no further engine of novelty and transformation is required. We do not need a concept of the virtual to think of change and difference in the psychological, since it is already dynamically produced in the exchange or ‘endosmosis’ between duration and perception.</p>
<p>Settling this important debate in Bergson studies is far beyond the scope of this article. But we can note that it raises an important concern for the ‘mathematical imaginary’. Consider the famous diagram of the cone that appears in chapter 3 of <italic>Matter and Memory</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0263276412448830">Figure 2</xref>). Bergson was well aware of the irony of demonstrating the concept of duration through words and images that necessarily spatialized time (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0263276412448830">Lawlor, 2003</xref>). This diagram then schematically, and problematically, attempts to visualize how duration – sketched as the cone with the points A˙B˙S – is inserted into the concrete spatially distributed plane of images that is depicted as the rectangle P. The point S is where the duration and space meld into one another. It is very unfortunate that Bergson’s choice of denotation – the letter ‘S’ – seems to suggest to us that this meeting point is a bounded psychological subject. This is, of course, not the case. If S denotes any ‘thing’ in particular then it is the body-image, or rather a nervous system that is capable of slowing down and reflecting movements from other images in such a way that it creates an interval in the otherwise ceaseless play of images acting upon one another. It is this interval into which the past is thrust. In this way, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0263276412448830">Worms (1999)</xref> has it, the body is the ‘and’ in ‘matter AND memory’, the lynchpin around which the endosmosis of time and space is to be thought. We might extend this further by speculating that we need not even think in terms of an individual body, but rather of assemblies of bodies whose nervous systems are sufficiently affectively correlated so as to act in concert as a collective body-image.
<fig id="fig2-0263276412448830" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>The cone of pure memory (after <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0263276412448830">Bergson, 1991 [1908]</xref>: 162).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0263276412448830-fig2.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Irrespective of how we define S, what counts at this point is how pure memory is inserted into space in its most condensed form. Bergson describes this as occurring through twinned processes of contraction and rotation, whereby the past presents those aspects of itself that are most useful to infuse current perceptions:<disp-quote>
<p>memory, laden with the whole of the past, responds to the appeal of the present state by two simultaneous movements, one of translation, by which it moves in its entirety to meet experience … and the other of rotation upon itself, by which it turns toward the situation of the moment, presenting to it that side of itself which may prove most useful. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0263276412448830">Bergson, 1991 [1908]: 77</xref>)</p></disp-quote>Now it is this notion of an intrinsic utility to the manner in which the pure past (whether understood in ontological or psychological terms) is inserted into the interval S that is critical. In a fine summary of Bergsonism, James Burton glosses the process in the following way:<disp-quote>
<p>Pure memory cannot be experienced as such, for it marks the limit of experience; yet it remains virtually present in that any aspect of the past existence of the body-image may in theory be produced in the form of memory-images, by the contracting and filtering of that past that is the body-image’s continuous activity. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0263276412448830">Burton, 2008</xref>: 329)</p></disp-quote>Burton follows the logic of the virtualist interpretation of Bergson in making the claims that ‘in theory’ since everything that is psychological is already a priori installed in pure memory, or, in other words, that any given present is virtualized and subsumed within the pure past, then it follows that ‘any aspect of the past existence of the body-image’ may be recollected as ‘memory-images’. It is at this point that the difficulty of sorting out the ontological from the psychological becomes apparent. As an ontological claim, this is entirely consistent with what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0263276412448830">Mullarkey (2004)</xref> calls the Manichean promotion of the virtual as the source of change, transformation and creativity. ‘In theory’ everything must be possible. But as a psychological claim this is deeply problematic. Why would our memories be structured in such a way as to always present those aspects of themselves that are most useful? And why, for that matter, would our perceptual processes operate along the same lines? How is it possible that we could – again, in theory – recollect every aspect of our past experience? To assume such an instrinsic utility to memory would be to subscribe to a certain kind of normativity in remembering, where the tendency of memory processes is to organize our prior experiences in such as way as to promote vitality, creativity and transformation. Those instances that do not fit with this tendency – memories that are painful, awkward or simply inconvenient to us in our daily affairs – must be deemed pathological or special cases. But if we begin with psychology rather than ontology, what is rapidly apparent is that the supposedly pathological is considerably more common than the normative. Our capacities to recollect often seem to refuse to fulfil our needs, whether that be in the cases where we simply fail to remember a name, an event or a story that would have made a difference on a particular occasion, through to the more significant experiences where we are dogged by memories of things that we would far rather forget, where we cannot help but be overwhelmed by a past that will not be kept outside the ‘portals of consciousness’ (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0263276412448830">Haaken and Reavey’s 2010</xref> collection for illustration).</p>
<p>The difficulty here is with the purity of ‘pure memory’. If it is treated as beyond further specification then inevitably these psychologically derived questions will receive only the most abstract of answers. However, within the virtualist version of Bergson there is to be found the basis for a fruitful mathematical response. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0263276412448830">Ansell Pearson (2002)</xref> lays great emphasis on the distinction between quantitative and qualitative multiplicities that can be read from Bergson (notably in <italic>Time and Free Will</italic>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0263276412448830">DeLanda (2002)</xref> reframes this, in Deleuzian terms, as the difference between the intensive and extensive expressions of a given multiplicity, where the latter is to be treated in terms of Euclidean space, while the former needs to understood in terms of vector space. Finally, Bergson himself indicates that there is an organization, of sorts, to be divined within duration, as denoted by his division of the cone into section (A’·B’; A’’·B’’, etc.). To recapitulate our conclusions at the end of the previous section: if we are to advance further in our understanding of the relation of psychology to ontology we must embrace rather than reject this mathematical description as the means of going forward.</p>

<p>Topology is a comparatively under-used resource in psychology. Modelling tends to be performed using statistical techniques such as factorization or regression to produce mathematical spaces of covariance. These reveal extensive structures that can be visualized using techniques such as clustering. However, these structures can often be conceptually incoherent, raising significant concerns as to the ontological claims on which they are premised, as we saw in our brief consideration of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0263276412448830">Figure 1</xref>. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0263276412448830">DeLanda (2002)</xref>, we might envisage a further set of mathematical operations that would be required to understand the emergence of these extensive structures. This would consist of mapping intensive processes (e.g. perceptual and memory processes) in the form of vectors, and then subsequently of defining the topological space in which something of the long-term tendencies of these vectors can be grasped. For DeLanda topological space, in comparison with two other kinds of space (vector space, extensive structures), is ‘ideally continuous and relatively undifferentiated’ such that it is a ‘counterpart of the virtual’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0263276412448830">2002</xref>: 69). To put this in terms of Bergson’s cone diagram, we might say that the plane P refers to extensive structures, the point S marks intensive processes, and the cone itself denotes a relatively undifferentiated topological space.</p>
<p>How then are we to think this topological space in such a way that the tension between ontology and psychology can be made productive? I will now turn to discuss the single most sustained attempt to demonstrate the power of topology for psychological thinking – Kurt Lewin’s <italic>Principles of Topological Psychology</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0263276412448830">1936</xref>). Lewin’s work grew from the Gestalt tradition in the 1920s and 1930s, which attempted to establish a closer dialogue between psychological research and theoretical physics.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0263276412448830">1</xref></sup> In <italic>Principles</italic>, Lewin proposes that topology serves to ground the specification of all other psychological processes: ‘the determination of topological relationships is the fundamental task in all psychological problems’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0263276412448830">1936</xref>: 87). This is so because, for Lewin, an adequate account of a psychological event, or situation (S), requires an estimation of the behaviour (B) that defines that situation. Behaviour (B) is a vector that can be calculated by positing a manifold with at least two degrees of freedom, which Lewin refers to as person (P) and environment (E):<disp-quote>
<p>Every psychological event depends upon the state of the person and at the same time the state of the environment, although their relative importance is different in different cases. Thus we can state our formula B = f(S) for every psychological event as B = f(PE). (1936: 12)</p></disp-quote>As we saw with the model of memory in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0263276412448830">Figure 1</xref>, if we do not think through the mathematical space in which elements that make up the differential relation are plotted, then we rapidly descend into ontological confusion. The notion of manifold is then essential if we are to ‘find methods of representing person and environment as common terms in the same situation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0263276412448830">1936</xref>: 12) such that their vectors can be established. In later work, Lewin would concern himself more fully with the calculation of such vectors (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0263276412448830">Lewin, 1946</xref>), but here he engaged in using topology to rethink the mathematical-ontological grounds of psychology. Lewin refers to the required manifold as ‘life space’. This he defines as the ‘totality of possible events’ that might be experienced by a given person, or more precisely as the ‘total of possible and not-possible ways of behaving’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0263276412448830">1936</xref>: 15). What Lewin ultimately intends is for this seemingly inconceivable range of possibilities to be expressed by adding further <italic>n</italic> degrees of freedom to the life space manifold. His ambitions are then cognate with those of Bergson – an adequate account of living, psychological processes needs to invoke the totality of lived experiences.</p>
<p>Life space is a topological space of relation and connection. The fundamental question grounding psychological events is of the constitution of parts and wholes and whether any two given points plotted in the space may be connected or separated. Take a simple example used by Lewin of two children sat in a bathtub. This is illustrated using the diagrams a–c in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0263276412448830">Figure 3</xref>. In all three diagrams, the bathtub can be treated topologically as a region (see Lewin, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0263276412448830">1936</xref>: 105–6), meaning a set of points enclosed by a Jordan curve, such that every point within can be connected to any other without crossing the curve. If A and B mark the position of the children relative to one another, then in the situation shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0263276412448830">Figure 3</xref>a, the bathtub is a ‘space of free movement’ in a simply connected region. The size or shape of this space is not relevant – merely that it is possible to move from any point to any other within the region defined by the Jordan curve. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0263276412448830">Figure 3</xref>b this region is divided. If child B draws their hand across the water to indicate a ‘cut’ or border making out a part of the bathtub that they claim as their own, then the region is divided into two separate regions (i.e. it is no longer possible for every point to be connected to every other without crossing the borderline). Lewin refers to this drawing of boundaries within a region as the constitution of a ‘power field’. However, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0263276412448830">Figure 3</xref>c if child B merely places their hand on the side of the bathtub to form a barrier B’, this does not have the same effect, since it is still possible for connections to be drawn merely by passing around the other (unblocked) side. In this case the region is still considered to be whole, but it is doubly rather than simply connected.
<fig id="fig3-0263276412448830" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Three topological versions of children in a bathtub (after Lewin, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0263276412448830">1936</xref>: 43).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0263276412448830-fig3.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The example described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0263276412448830">Figure 3</xref>b abstracts topological invariants from the psychological event in the form of regions. What is depicted is a relatively undifferentiated space that is prior to a Euclidean or geometric definition. It does not really matter whether the children are in a bathtub, a playground, or relating to one another through the internet, so long as their movements do not cross the boundary defining the region. It is the boundary that distributes the possible and the non-possible consistently through any set of transformations during which topological invariance is preserved. While the space can be further metricized, by plotting vectors, or qualified, through phenomenological exploration, it is prior to the definition of either extensive structures or subjectivity – that is to say, prior to the application of either quantitative or qualitative methods as these are usually understood in psychology.</p>
<p>The status of this abstracted set of invariants bears comparison with the Bergsonian ‘virtual’. Lewin uses the phrase ‘what is real is what has effects’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0263276412448830">1936</xref>: 19) to describe the topological properties of life space. The sense of this is close to Deleuze’s formulation of a Bergsonian pure past where ‘the possible has no reality (although it may have an actuality); conversely the virtual is not actual, but <italic>as such possesses a reality</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0263276412448830">1991</xref>: 96). We might reformulate this to state that topological invariance has effects in terms of distributing what may be actualized as possible and not-possible so long as it persists through the transformations it undergoes. This does not mean that we should consider life space as some overarching mechanism that directly drives psychological processes. It is rather a description of psychological events from the perspective of the distribution of potential experiences. Take the following example used by Lewin of a mother who ‘looks her child in the eye when she is trying to induce him to carry out a certain action or to emphasize a command’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0263276412448830">1936</xref>: 127). There are several different ways of conceptualizing this look between mother (A) and child (B) topologically (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0263276412448830">Figure 4</xref>).
<fig id="fig4-0263276412448830" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Three ways of diagramming a ‘look’ (after Lewin, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0263276412448830">1936</xref>: 128).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0263276412448830-fig4.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0263276412448830">Figure 4</xref>a, the gaze is diagrammed as something akin to a ‘quasi-physical’ action. The mother, treated here as region A, extends herself (A’) towards the child (B) in such a way that the two regions overlap to form a new connected region (A + A’ + B). It does not matter that there is no actual physical contact – it suffices that the gaze captures the attention of the child for a new region to be formed. Alternatively, it might be more appropriate, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0263276412448830">Figure 4</xref>b, to map the ‘looking at’ as a glance (A’) that is thrown toward the child ‘like a ball’ without there being continuous contact with A. The child is aware of having been looked at by the mother, this glance having a reality and a set of ongoing effects on the child that merits the event of the ‘looking at’ being rendered as a region (A’) that the child now has to negotiate in their subsequent actions (for example, averting their eyes from their mother or turning their back to ensure they cannot be directly ‘looked at’ again). Finally, the dynamic nature of the glance as a form of reproach or boundary setting might be emphasized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0263276412448830">Figure 4</xref>c as a ‘change of the position and intensity’ of a ‘field of forces’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0263276412448830">Lewin, 1936</xref>: 129) that radiates from the mother around the child. This has the merit of indicating that the field of forces extended by the gaze might set very particular boundaries, involving specific implications for the child should they choose to cross the boundaries.</p>
<p>These differences in the topological mapping of an event as mundane as ‘being looked at’ indicate that Lewin’s topological-abstractive procedure is able to recover a range of potential experiences that might be afforded without a shift in overall topological invariance. More importantly, it demonstrates that we do not need to posit a Cartesian dualism to grasp these psychological dynamics between mother and child. In all of the three mappings it is as though ‘the mother controls the infant by her will in a way which is only slightly different from the way in which she controls her own body’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0263276412448830">Lewin, 1936</xref>: 179). The unit of analysis is then not the emotional attachment between self-contained individuals, but rather resonances and tensions across nervous systems that can be treated analytically as defining a region.</p>
<p>So far we have considered psychological events that are comparatively straightforward (although, as we have just seen, even an act as simple as a gaze can be topologically unfolded in numerous ways). The following example is more elaborate:<disp-quote>
<p>A woman stands at the loom in a big noisy factory, next to the last in the eighth row. A thread is broken. She is about to stop the machine to see what has happened. It is shortly before the lunch hour. She has accomplished very little during the morning. She is annoyed. (Lewin, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0263276412448830">1936</xref>: 22)</p></disp-quote>Lewin stresses the relationship here between physical qualities of the factory (the space, the noise) and the apparently subjective experiences of the worker (frustration, annoyance). However, unlike the Cartesian division in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0263276412448830">Figure 1</xref>, where the former would be packaged together as ‘the environment’ and the latter as ‘cognitive processes’, here this relationship is between ‘quasi-physical facts’ plotted as points within a region. As Lewin puts it, ‘these facts are to be included in the representation of the psychological life space only to the extent and in the manner in which they affect the individual in his [sic] momentary state’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0263276412448830">1936</xref>: 4). The question is then of what is and is not possible given this arrangement of points. For example, if the woman stops the loom, this will have consequences for the operation of the machines in the other rows. Would this act amount to crossing the boundary of the region? Or can it be accomplished within the existing connections and relations that define this psychological event?</p>
<p>Lewin continues the description of the loom operator by adding the following details:<disp-quote>
<p>She has been married for three years. For a year and a half, her husband has been unemployed. The two-year old child has been seriously ill, but today seems somewhat better. She and her husband have been quarrelling more and more often recently. They had a quarrel this morning. Her husband’s parents have suggested that she send the child to them in the country. The woman is undecided what to do about it. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0263276412448830">1936</xref>: 22–3)</p></disp-quote>These details are treated as ‘quasi-social’ facts. This is to say that their relevance does not come from some causal force they exert on the woman’s behaviour, but rather the extent to which they can be plotted as part of the manifold of possible and non-possible events. For example, if stopping the loom is a boundary-crossing event, it may cascade into a further boundary-crossing event in the manifold that includes the relations to her family (it is not possible for the child to remain at home and for the woman to be unemployed). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0263276412448830">DeLanda (2002)</xref>, drawing on complexity theory, calls these linked series of boundary crossings ‘symmetry-breaking events’. That is to say that some topological invariance is lost across the life space manifold.</p>
<p>In this example, there is a topological expansion of the psychological event. We – and indeed the woman herself – are able to conceive of a very large series of potential topological expansions. Perhaps there is a region where the child being sent to the country is compossible with a revolutionary event where the workers take charge of the factory. Insofar as a region where these connections are possible can be conceived from within the psychological event itself, then it has effects as what Lewin calls a ‘quasi-conceptual fact’. In topological terms this can be expressed by adding a further degree of freedom to the manifold, which can be visualized as a further dimension. Lewin notes that any point in a region can be treated as intersecting with an additional dimension, such that a further coordinate is added to its distribution. The addition of dimensions is termed ‘degrees of irreality’ by Lewin:<disp-quote>
<p>Action itself can be of very different degrees of reality. Processes which concern strong needs of the person and in which he had to surmount strong physical or social barriers have usually a high degree of reality. Among the quasi-conceptual processes one can for instance distinguish carefully planned consideration of the ways and means which lead to a certain goal from free play of phantasy, which is more irreal. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0263276412448830">1936</xref>: 196)</p></disp-quote>What Lewin describes here is an ongoing procedure of topological abstraction. There are, ultimately, <italic>n</italic>-dimensions that might be psychologically relevant to a given event. But the further this abstraction – or, we might equally say, <italic>virtualization</italic> – proceeds, the further we depart from concrete actuality towards the relative indifferentiation of life space considered as the ‘totality of possible events’. In an attempt to visualize this procedure, Lewin offers the following diagram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0263276412448830">Figure 5</xref>):
<fig id="fig5-0263276412448830" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Degrees of irreality (after Lewin, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0263276412448830">1936</xref>: 200).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0263276412448830-fig5.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Like many attempts to visualize <italic>n</italic>-dimensional space, this diagram is not entirely successful. We must think of each plane as intersecting such that it adds a further coordinate to the plotting of point P, where this latter denotes a psychological event. If it were possible to continuously add further planes in this way, we would ultimately end up with a diagram that approximated life space as such, that is to say with an image of the virtual. This would be of a piece with extending the Bergsonian cone in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0263276412448830">Figure 2</xref> to its limit.</p>
<p>To summarize, Lewin argues that psychological analysis typically starts from an incorrect unit of analysis – usually reducing behaviour to either subject or environment. In order to understand a psychological event we must first treat it as relative to an intensive process that is reducible to neither subject nor environment and which can be mathematically described as a manifold with at least two degrees of freedom (or ‘life space’). This manifold can be expanded to encompass the totality of possible and non-possible experiences by adding further degrees of freedom. Doing so recovers topological invariants that allow for an adequate description of a given psychological event – it situates the event as emerging from a virtual space of potential. Lewin goes on to argue that there is a psychological reality to ‘quasi-physical’, ‘quasi-social’ and ‘quasi-conceptual’ facts. Perception self-divides, such that what is apprehended is not just concrete actualities, but also virtual connections, regions and boundaries that inhere in these actualities. Finally, change and creativity in and through psychological events is relative to the degree of abstraction (or ‘irreality’) that the event affords.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0263276412448830"><title>Dimensions</title>
<p>Lewin, like Bergson, attempts to ground psychological processes in an ontology that tends towards undifferentiation and continuity, but which can nevertheless be visualized in terms of its dynamic relation to discontinuous, discrete episodes in which experience is actualized. Clearly there are significant differences between the thinkers. On the one side, we have a philosopher whose concern is to develop ‘fluid’ philosophical concepts that do justice to the change and mobility he sees as characterizing an ‘indefinite’ reality (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0263276412448830">Bergson, 1992</xref>: 211). On the other, a psychologist seeking a theoretical renewal of a discipline that has cut itself off from the emerging visions of reality expressed in modern physics. The argument has been that, despite these differences, the juxtaposition of these thinkers progressively realizes a different kind of ‘mathematical imaginary’ in relation to psychology. While critics inside and outside the discipline typically see quantification and the use of number as pure reductionism, I have described how the abstractions proposed by Bergson and Lewin enable a more fluid and mobile account of the dynamic relation between psychological processes and virtualization which destabilizes the otherwise implied Cartesianism in psychological models.</p>
<p>In this penultimate section I want to show – quite literally – how topology is the means by which these two thinkers can be held together, despite their differences. The form of my argument thus far has been shaped by what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0263276412448830">Mullarkey (2006)</xref> calls ‘diagrammatology’ – the perspectival presentation of systems of reference. I have tried to allow the diagrams themselves to pose the problems in an attempt to affirm rather than simply critique each position I have reviewed (cognitive models, Bergsonism, Lewin’s topological psychology). This is not to say that each position does not have shortcomings, but my preference throughout has been to allow these difficulties to unfold from the diagrams. How then can we attempt to hold together these various positions? I offer <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0263276412448830">Figure 6</xref> as a partial attempt to do so.
<fig id="fig6-0263276412448830" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>Bergson’s cone combined with Lewin’s levels of irreality.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0263276412448830-fig6.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The first thing to note is that it appears that <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0263276412448830">Figure 1</xref> is absent from this juxtaposition. In fact I think we can say that the ‘input’ and ‘sensory registration’ boxes have exploded into the movement of images and points on the uppermost plane. Furthermore, that the ‘response’ and ‘working memory’ boxes are now located at the point of the cone – where they mark the interval opened up by the nervous system for the insertion of duration and the virtualization of actual experience. And finally, that the ‘long-term memory’ box is now dissolved into the entirety of the cone itself.</p>
<p>What does the superimposition of the Bergsonist cone on Lewin’s levels of irreality suggest? Lewin’s planes of irreality denote an open set of topological abstractions that are equivalent to adding a new dimension successively to a given point. Any given psychological event can then be expanded by adding a further degree of freedom, such that its corresponding space of movement may be plotted through adding a further set of coordinates. The topological mapping of the event then appears to be stretched across the planes such that ‘P’ marks a manifold with <italic>n</italic>-dimensions. For Lewin, these abstracted planes do not all have the same level of reality, meaning that the movements possible along these planes are quasi-physical, quasi-social or quasi-conceptual – which is to say, they are comparatively more virtualized than one another.</p>
<p>The juxtaposition with the cone assists in viewing the successive dimensions added to the event as progressive virtualizations. But it also raises a number of problems. If the point of the cone marks the actual – what becomes rendered as ‘lived experience’ – then what is the psychological status of the planes? For Lewin they are clearly expansions of the psychological event that can be apprehended as such from within the event (note that we are leaving indefinite who or what it is that is doing the apprehending, whether it refers to a person or a collectivity, a single nervous system or an assemblage of affectively correlated bodies). This places the account at odds with Deleuze’s Bergsonism, where the virtual has ontological rather than psychological standing – virtualization takes us ‘beyond experience’, actualization is what affords experience.</p>
<p>It is the immobile appearance of the diagram itself that is partly to blame. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0263276412448830">Lawlor (2003)</xref> suggests that Bergson’s cone ought really to be visualized in a dynamic fashion, such that cone rotates with downward and upward movements, corresponding to actualization and virtualization. In a similar fashion, we might think of the planes of irreality as in a process of continuous transformation, which can be visualized for analytic purposes as passing through a series of visual forms while maintaining topological invariance. Adding further dimensions does not simply add complexity but also visualizes moments of symmetry breaking, where invariance is lost before re-settling around a new distribution of relations. In Lewin’s terms, this could occur through a quasi-conceptual movement (i.e. thinking) approaching or crossing a boundary resulting in a transformation of the structure of a region. If it is possible from within the psychological event to conceive of a passage beyond an apparent boundary, then this has ‘real’ transformative effects on the movements that are then possible in the region in which the event is defined. Crudely put, if we can think, feel or recollect our way beyond the concrete actuality of our circumstances, this brings about a new actuality.</p>
<p>Accounting for the juxtaposition in this way makes it necessary at this point to choose between the rival interpretations of Bergson. The cone cannot be stripped of its psychological relevance. It denotes virtualizations that are relative to a psychological event, and not a pure ontological/mathematical space from which the psychological event is extracted. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0263276412448830">Mullarkey (2004)</xref> argues that this ‘actualist’ reading is supported by reference to the numerous occasions in which Bergson gives a psychological rendering of duration – the past is in some sense ‘our past’, it is ‘for us’. Moreover, the processes of reflection and refraction, through which images communicate movement through one another, already generates an actual that divides itself up, that is never singular. It is these multiple, intersecting self-created actualities that are virtualized, this being the ‘flip-side of this act of self-creation: that is, what strings along (or “condenses” or “dominates” or “synthesizes”) the various presents we call one individual’s own breadth of experience’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0263276412448830">Mullarkey, 2004</xref>: 478). On this account, the psychological is not the residue of a superior movement (ontologically speaking) by which the virtual begets the actual. It is instead the case that:<disp-quote>
<p>the virtual is grounded by a play of actualities: the virtual for Bergson becomes a well-founded perspectival and psychological phenomenon – an emergent product formed through the interplay between a multiplicity of actual entities (including spatial and temporal continuities and discontinuities, identities and differences, quantities and qualities). Being ‘well-founded’ here means that the virtual, while a function of the actual and an emergent product, has real effects on the actual rather than being merely epiphenomenal. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0263276412448830">Mullarkey, 2004</xref>: 471)</p></disp-quote>To put this in Lewin’s terms, the psychological event is defined by topological relations that are continuously virtualized through quasi-physical, quasi-social and quasi-conceptual means, equivalent to the addition of further <italic>n</italic>-dimensions at any point. The ‘play of actualities’ can then be understood as an open series of transformations that are extended and prolonged as virtualizations, and which may in turn exert real effects when they are brought back in to play through recollection.</p>
<p>Bergson uses the term ‘attention to life’ to refer to the effortful attempt to produce ‘cohesion’ between the movements and sensations passing between the body-image and other images, and the recollections that are condensed and contracted in remembering (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0263276412448830">Bergson, 1991</xref>: 173). Attention to life is a seizing of actualities, the establishing and expanding of a ‘foothold’ among the world of images, the constitution of a perspective, such that the ‘mass of accumulated memories’ now seems to stand on the ‘sensations and movements of the present hour’, as if they were a ‘pyramid which should stand upon its apex’. The woman standing before her loom, in Lewin’s example, is involved in an expanding attention to life when the region which defines the relationship between the broken thread and her son is transformed by quasi-conceptual operations that create a new region where her leaving the malfunctioning loom and her son remaining at home are compossible. The remaking of the region occurs through a conjugation of movements that involve actual entities (the woman, the factory, the home, her son) and virtualizations (the use of recollection and imagination to produce a world where non-possible events become possible). But we could equally imagine the failure of such compossibility in this psychological event, since it depends upon the topological invariants that structure each intersecting dimension of the manifold. Perhaps, right now, there is no conceivable way of crossing the boundary through quasi-conceptual means. And since we are now considering the virtual as the series of virtualizations of the actual defining the topological features of a life space (the totality of possible events), then it makes it plausible to consider that there may be invariance in the present and in the breadth of past experience. Rendering the pure past as a perspectival product of actual psychological experience (albeit experience outwith a bounded subject) intensifies the stakes of self-creation: not everything may be possible, the past may not afford transformation of the present.</p>

<p>I began with a proposition that borders on the heretical for critics of mainstream experimental psychology – that the ‘mathematical imaginary’ of the discipline is actually the route to its renewal. The diagrammatic juxtaposition of Bergson and Lewin’s models has attempted to make that peculiar proposition thinkable. What then might be accomplished through the topological approach to psychology that emerges from this juxtaposition? It suggests that, in principle, every psychological event can be mapped by surfacing the topological relations that define this particular instance of life space. The movements that can be traced in this topological space do not necessarily imply Cartesian distinctions. As we saw earlier, the mapping of something as fleeting as a glance can be performed in numerous ways. Topological description effectively operates here as ‘thick description’ (as with Ryle’s famous example of a winking gesture), a means of demonstrating that several different actualities can emerge from the same topological space.</p>
<p>Tracing the invariants that persist through the transformations of topological life space may succeed in producing ‘affective universes’ of psychological events (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0263276412448830">Brown and Stenner, 2009</xref>). This would have the advantage of substituting a dynamic homeomorphism for the tendency of psychologists to categorize on the basis of taxonomic distinctions of essential qualities. For instance, rather than personality types, we would have a thick description of tendencies, boundaries, relations and thresholds of transformation (i.e. symmetry breaking).</p>
<p>Such a topological approach would shift the unit of analysis for psychological analysis beyond the individual. Let me briefly offer three examples of problems drawn from my own work:
<list id="list1-0263276412448830" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>In a secure forensic mental health unit, how is the management of sexuality bounded by the literal and practical boundaries of the unit? To what extent is a sense of the ‘loss’ of sexuality required by formal patient–staff interactions? (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0263276412448830">Brown et al., forthcoming</xref>)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>How do the objects and design of a reminiscence museum in a home for the care of elderly people connect past and present for elderly clients and their families? Which objects appear to afford ‘disruptive’ connections? (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0263276412448830">Bendien et al., 2010</xref>)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Why are adoptive parents unable to dispose of objects (e.g. toys, clothes) that link their adoptive children to difficult or traumatic pasts? Ought they to engage in efforts to fictively reconstruct a past that affords a different future life trajectory for the child? (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0263276412448830">Brown et al., forthcoming</xref>)</p></list-item>
</list>What is common across all three sets of problems is a concern for the virtual aspects of psychological events (e.g. openings to a broader domain of impersonal experience through affective and recollective means) as a constituent part of inhabiting concrete, actual relational settings.</p>
<p>The attempt to think Bergson and Lewin together diagrammatically favoured an actualist reading of the pure past/duration. This sidesteps the tendency in Deleuze’s Bergsonism to see in psychology merely a ‘springboard’ to ontology. That is, the view that actual experience is extracted from an undifferentiated virtuality upon which its intelligibility depends. However it still preserves some of the resources that this virtualist reading of Bergson offers. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0263276412448830">DeLanda’s (2002)</xref> effort to make the pure past knowable through topological abstraction is retained when virtualization is seen, with Lewin, as the adding of planes of irreality. Furthermore, we have a vocabulary in the form of quasi-physical, quasi-social and quasi-conceptual operations in which to understand how psychological events automatically virtualize and self-divide in themselves, and in so doing accomplish a form of autopoiesis. This can be subsumed under Bergson’s notion of ‘attention to life’, the efforts at producing coherence from movement, which we can here see as the process of distributing what is to be counted as subjects and objects. It is the glance itself as the expression of attention to life that distributes the possible actualities of mother and child vs. child incorporating part of the mother vs. single mother–child assembly. But most important of all is the recognition of topological invariance, within certain thresholds, as a fundamental principle of psychological life. We do little justice to the difficulties, struggles and resilience that make up a significant proportion of life space by referring the capacity for transformation to a conception of the virtual that is purely ontological, that is shorn of any psychological relevance. To see psychological events as epiphenomenal residue of a creative movement that is, by definition, beyond experience tends to leave us mute when it comes to accounting for mundane, difficult experiences. Why does recollection often leave us feeling that our lives are without value? How is it that we can be locked into ways of being that we are well aware are less than ideal? What is the holding power that certain images, people or things have over our thinking? Why can we not conceive of ways beyond our current experience? A topological approach to psychology might have no immediate answers to these kinds of questions, but it would at least supply a set of descriptive tools with which to make them tractable.</p>
