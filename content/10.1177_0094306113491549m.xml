<p>South Korea’s rapid and radical transformation begs the attention of social scientists. From a predominantly agrarian and rural country, it has become an indisputably industrial and urban society in just over a generation. Whether we consider compressed industrialization or political democratization, the South Korean case is a challenging grist for the analytical or policy mill. To take just one example, while demographers were busy prophesizing a looming Malthusian crisis in South Korea until the 1970s—and population-control experts were dispensing birth-control advice to the population—their contemporary counterparts are predicting population decline and collapse, and the same experts are seeking ways to enhance sexual reproduction in the 2010s.</p>
<p>Caren Freeman’s <italic>Making and Faking Kinship</italic> provides a wonderful window from which to view not only South Korea but also Northeast Asia, migration, gender relations, and ethnonational identity. The starting point of her far-flung research is the dearth of women willing to marry rural farming men in South Korea. The severity of the crisis—produced by the rapid rural exodus, the valorization of urban life, the generalized crisis of agriculture, and son preference in South Korea—became a national problem that prompted the government to seek brides for the hapless rural men. One potential source was Choso njok (ethnic Koreans in China) women. Since the establishment of diplomatic ties between China and South Korea—a consequence of the end of the Cold War and the post-Deng political and economic reforms in China—co-ethnics in China became not only a proximate source for rural brides but also a symbolic cause, and celebration, of the (South) Korean nation. By the time the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s unleashed a regional depression, these harbingers of rural revival and ethnonational unification had become targets of media and public criticisms: long-lost sisters who had returned to their homeland had become “runaway brides” who were merely seeking monetary rewards from fraudulent marriages.</p>
<p>Freeman’s persuasive analysis looks not only at South Korean government policy but the actors themselves: South Korean grooms, Choso njok brides, and marriage brokers. Empathetic ethnographic research brings these disparate characters vividly to life, making them at once sympathetic and reasonable figures, not cut-out cardboard figures of media discourse and public opprobrium, or the usual run of social-scientific analysis. At once delving into broad social backgrounds and presenting concrete, individual voices and characters, we come very close to the faces of transnational migration. Time and again, Freeman’s ability to present simultaneously the complexity of motives and the general situations in which the individual actors found themselves was impressive. In an especially enlightening chapter on gender logics, she unravels the tensions and contradictions in what seems like a straightforward, economically-motivated marriage migration. Given that many of the Choso njok brides were already married, whether to fellow Choso njok or Han Chinese men, they had to conclude a “paper” divorce in order to engage in a “fake” marriage. Yet a “counterfeit” wedding sometimes transformed into a serious relationship. “Runaway brides” were not just those who had swindled South Korean men but also those who stayed in South Korea (and therefore ran away from their husbands in China). Far from being passive respondents to the structural situation of economic inequality, Choso njok women not only articulate distinct motives and interests but also act strategically, idiosyncratically, and unpredictably. Agency is easy enough to assert; the author does a cogent job of showing it in action.</p>
<p>Freeman considers not just marriage migrants but also labor migrants, many of whom employ kinship ties to gain visas. Here she leads us to a topsy-turvy world where “real” ethnic Koreans with indisputable kinship ties to South Koreans are denied visas to South Korea whereas non-ethnic Koreans with “fake” papers are able to convince officials and to garner them. We gain insights into the workings of the Chinese bureaucracy, including the prevalent use of graft, as well as the competing logics of blood-based kinship and ethnic ties vis-à-vis paper-based ethnic and state membership. Paradoxically, those who fabricate kinship ties, precisely because they manufacture documents to articulate with bureaucratic definitions and guidelines, are more likely to succeed than those who do not need to do so—and hence lack the preparation and the exactitude demanded by bureaucrats. The author allows us to see all sides—Choso jok, Han Chinese, and government officials—and their idiosyncratic logics and practices.</p>
<p>Beyond the migrants themselves, Freeman delineates the social world not only of the towns and villages the migrants left behind but also the putative homeland in which they find themselves. There is a poignant portrait of Choso njok husband and wives, whose spouses had migrated to South Korea as marriage or labor migrants, consoling themselves in dance halls. Flexible families and flexible marriages become the fate of a community in motion. South Korea too, comes under her analytical gaze. The facile assumption of ethnic solidarity in an ethnically homogeneous country is shattered by the indisputable co-ethnics (as well as “fake” Koreans) who are anything but culturally or even linguistically homogeneous. The consequent disillusionment informs the restrictive and even punitive policy toward co-ethnic migration.</p>
<p>Freeman has written a brilliant book that illuminates the complex dynamics not only of South Korea and Northeast Asia but of migration involving ethnic identification and state policy, as well as migrants, families left behind and forged anew, kinship ties claimed and disputed, marriages faked, broken, and made, and the larger world they navigate. For a world in movement, in an age of globalization, she has rightfully conducted fieldwork in many sites over a large landmass, wielding both Korean and Chinese, and in so doing has crafted an exemplary ethnography. It is easily the best ethnography in Korean Studies to appear in some years and is therefore essential reading for anyone seeking to be conversant in Northeast Asia, migration, kinship, gender, family, and globalization. It challenges an unreflexive understanding of these topics—social scientists beyond Asianists and anthropologists would also benefit from reading and pondering it.</p>
