<p>This one-day seminar hosted a rich and diverse range of contributions about oral history, all of which were concerned with the extent to which oral history challenges well established (written) narratives of the protest movement of 1968, as it took place in different European countries.</p>
<p>From the beginning, one of the seminar’s leitmotivs has been the contradiction between ‘1968’ as a moment which paralleled the birth of oral history, and the fact that ‘dominant narratives’ of 1968 are mostly written ones, underpinned by a conception of history that is rooted in ideas of archival and documentary reliability. Despite the diversity in methods employed and sites investigated, all the papers tackled (explicitly or otherwise) a pivotal epistemological question: what kind of knowledge can oral history provide for an understanding of 1968, and of the past more in general?</p>
<p>Many articles explored the problematic nexus between individual and collective memories, looking at the ways in which history is used by individuals and social groups to make sense of the present, and to shape new identities. As pointed out by Dr Jennifer Burns (Warwick) during the conclusive round table discussion, approaches inspired by oral history can shed new light on history as ‘embodied in groups and individuals’: a potentiality confirmed by almost all the presentations.</p>
<p>The first two articles clearly stressed the importance of studying specific and peripheral contexts in order to problematize traditional accounts of 1968. Robert Gildea (Oxford) presented an interesting article related to the collective research project ‘Around 1968: Activism, Networks, Trajectories’, which informed Juliane Fürst’s (Bristol) article as well. Gildea explored the transnational memory of 1968 through interviews with five ‘middle-ranking activists’, enquiring about both their subjective understanding of 1968 and its influence on their current lives. He identified different narrative strategies in the interviewees’ attempts to make sense of their past: some of them had to ‘reinvent’ their radicalism, or just ‘kept their faith’, while others felt guilt or embarrassment about their participation in the events. Furthermore, Gildea’s study showed the extent to which interviews may provide insights about a person’s place in different sets of social relationships. For example, some narratives were marked by strong conflicts and struggles between activism and other social realms (family, school and religious background). Moreover, several interviewees found it difficult to fully engage with collective movements such as feminism and the gay movement, as long as certain public representations of ‘being a feminist’ and ‘being gay’ did not necessarily match their experience. Overall, Gildea’s article showed that individual accounts problematized a straightforward, collective and generational memory of 1968. Moreover, it made evident that oral history can enrich as well as demystify the history of social movements.</p>
<p>This point was also raised by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1750698012463900">Gerd-Rainer Horn (2007</xref>; Warwick), author of <italic>The Spirit of ’68: Rebellion in Western Europe and North America, 1956–1976</italic>, during the round table discussion. Horn suggested different kinds of contributions that oral history can make to this topic, like investigations into the interpersonal relationships that shaped the early stages of social movements, the legacy of Second World War resistance movements, and psychoanalysis-driven enquiries into the ‘mental substructures’ of social movements.</p>
<p>In contrast to Gildea’s focus on individual narratives, Fürst’s presentation emphasized the collective aspect of Soviet hippie experience. More precisely, a sense of collectivity emerged as pivotal in the way participants experienced the Soviet hippie movement. The article, then, explored the influence of the Soviet context on the ways in which hippies manipulated different signs and cultural objects, for example, music, clothes, English language and Californian slang. Through participants’ memories, the Soviet government emerged as an identity against which they constructed their hippie subculture. However, the emphasis they put on collectivity – Fürst argued – may be considered as typically Soviet. Hence, in exposing the complex relations between subcultures and the socio-cultural contexts from which they arose, Fürst’s article echoed recent debates in subcultural studies about the necessity of overcoming romantic understandings – or dominant narratives – of subcultures as spontaneous forms of ‘resistance’ against a clearly definable national or ‘mainstream culture’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1750698012463900">Weinzierl and Muggleton, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>If Gildea and Fürst did not discuss the issue of self-reflexivity, that is, the overt acknowledgement of the role played by historians in ‘co-authoring’ participants’ narratives, the issue emerged as a key theme in the rest of the seminar. In her presentation on British left activists, for example, Celia Hughes (Warwick) constantly reflected on the active role of the researcher, and the interviewees’ reactions to her personal points of view. Other than addressing the difficult negotiation between the personal and political in activists’ accounts of 1968, the article also shed light on an even more complex negotiation: that between the necessity of producing a ‘reliable’ interpretation of the participants’ narratives, and the values and beliefs, which influence the researchers’ own work.</p>
<p>Similarly, in her study of the Italian ‘Macerata movement’ in the late 1960s, Sofia Serenelli-Messenger (Reading) took into account her being ‘part of the story’ of participants in the protest movements of 1968, situating herself both as a young woman born in the area of Macerata, and as the daughter of ‘marginal militants’ of the 1968 movement. Moreover, the epistemological nature of the interviewees’ accounts was explicitly considered as a ‘representation’ of the past, which was then compared with documents from local archives. The article, furthermore, developed a question already raised by organizer Andrea Hajek (Warwick) and Bruno Bonomo (Rome), namely, the issue of ‘possessive memory’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1750698012463900">Braunstein, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1750698012463900">Foot, 2010</xref>) among Italian 1968ers, and emphasized the value of enquiring about peripheral cities, specific communities and ‘areas of persistent silence’ more generally. Other issues that were explored include the gendered aspect of memories, and the complex interplay between local and American influences in hippies’ activities.</p>
<p>The Italian context was addressed in other ways during the seminar as well. Bruno Bonomo provided a detailed review of the encounters between oral history and the study of 1968 in Italian academia: starting with the work of Luisa Passerini and Alessandro Portelli, he described an increasingly rich and diversified field. Moreover, he indicated prospective lines of research – for example, linguistic analysis of activists’ narratives – and some of the ‘limits’ of oral history – inspired studies of 1968, including a privileged focus on the geographical ‘centres’ of the protest and on middle-rank activists, rather than on peripheral contexts and people less directly involved in political activism, thus tying in with Serenelli-Messenger’s focus on the marginal militants of Macerata.</p>
<p>The importance of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1750698012463900">Passerini’s (1996)</xref> <italic>1968. Autobiography of a Generation</italic> also came to the fore, finally, in Joseph Maslen’s (Sheffield Hallam) presentation, where he compared Passerini’s book with another ‘generational’ biography written in the 1980s, Margot Kettle’s <italic>Recollections of a Younger World</italic> (1982–1984), which deals with 1930s left-wing movements in Britain. Maslen tried to underline common cultural and narrative tropes, also pointing to a possible relationship between the books and their socio-cultural context. Although the conclusions were a bit confused, the article explored an intriguing pathway for the historical study of autobiographical memories.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the seminar provided well-grounded evidence for the advantages of applying oral history to a largely debated and established historical theme. At the same time, the methodological questions raised by the speakers went beyond 1968, and provoked a vivid discussion among a highly interdisciplinary audience, suggesting prospective directions of enquiry. Oral history, in fact, overlaps with other disciplines such as ethnography, which might be worth exploring. In addition, the need of recording participants’ physical ‘performances’ points to a possible dialogue with visual methods grounded in sociology and anthropology.</p>
<p>The overall picture, then, suggests that approaches inspired by oral history can deconstruct narratives, which time has made – in the words of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1750698012463900">Roland Barthes (1972)</xref> – natural or universal, rather than socially and historically specific. Indeed, the seminar explored different and exciting paths for a de-naturalization of the myth of 1968, underlining (and so demystifying) the social conditions for the emergence of certain narratives in spite of others.</p>
