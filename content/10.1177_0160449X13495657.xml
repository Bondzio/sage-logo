<p>Aptly titled <italic>Playing Bigger Than You Are</italic>, Stewart Acuff’s short memoir frames the labor movement as one defined by the “wit and grit” (p. 29) of everyday organizers who challenge the emergent financial elite. Acuff discusses his life amidst those organizers, beginning with his street-level work with the Association for Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN) in the South in the late 1970s and ending with his time with the AFL-CIO during the George W. Bush administration. In the process, Acuff narrates his firsthand impressions of some of the significant national moments of the labor left in recent years, like the “New Voice” changes in the 1995 AFL-CIO leadership, the 1997 UPS strike, the World Trade Organization protests in Seattle, Barack Obama’s 2004 Democratic National Convention speech, and the 2005 AFL-CIO convention, when dissident unions formed the alternative “Change to Win” coalition.</p>
<p>As Bernie Sanders (I-VT) suggests in the book’s introduction, the text is best described as a “story of a life in organizing” (p. xi) rather than an analysis or organizing manual, though the abbreviated last chapter does offer recommendations for new organizers. Beginning with his work in Texas and Tennessee ACORN and the New Hampshire People’s Alliance, Acuff traces how campaigns to lower utility rates taught him to embrace collective direct action. After he recounts his return to the South to organize African American women working in nursing homes and the public sector—and often winning, despite the hostile presence of the Ku Klux Klan—Acuff discusses his union experience in Atlanta. In the early 1990s, Acuff won the presidency of the Atlanta Central Labor Council. He helped lead struggles to unionize the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, craft local coalitions with civil rights and community organizations to defend “righteous” labor standards, and fight the rise of neo-conservatives like Newt Gingrich.</p>
<p>Bible verses and Acuff’s recognition of the noble struggles of poor and middle-income communities thread prominently through the book. He concludes the book by explaining his time away from the southern, Christian communities he often celebrates. As an official at the head of the national AFL-CIO’s Organizing Department between 2001 and 2009, he asserts that the internal politics of national union leaderships and AFL-CIO “desk jockeys” (p. 89) thwarted the momentum of the labor movement from the inside. That friends and former colleagues in his first union, SEIU, led the 2005 effort to break from the AFL-CIO made the division more painful, as it threatened long-standing personal relationships as well as the campaign to pass the Employee Free Choice Act, which would have streamlined the organizing process and punished employers who illegally tried to obstruct organizing or contract campaigns.</p>
<p>The book identifies the need to create a social movement for the passage of the Employee Free Choice Act, Acuff’s current organizing goal, and it repeatedly appeals to the labor movement to embrace movement tactics. Acuff repeatedly shows how community-labor coalitions, particularly when coupled with direct action, political support, and inspiring organizers, can win victories for the working class. It does so particularly clearly in chapters five and six, on the labor-community battles for union power and community equity in Georgia in the 1990s.</p>
<p>Like the labor movement Acuff discusses, however, the book sometimes works at cross-purposes. It’s too short (the print is large, and pages small) to dissect the details of his work helping the labor movement play “bigger than you are.” It switches between the highly personal and broadly general in a way that makes it feel incomplete as either a memoir or an appeal to a new generation of organizers. Given Acuff’s wide and varied organizing experience, a detailed organizing manual, which the Foreword suggests he is considering as his next work, would likely be an important resource for labor scholars, educators, and organizers.</p>
