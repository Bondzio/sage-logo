<p>We report our experience and the midterm results of a modern technique for endovascular management of isolated iliac artery aneurysms (IAAs) with unfavorable neck anatomy, which involves the inversion of an iliac leg of a Zenith stent graft. Patients who underwent endovascular IAA repair from 2002 to 2010 were reviewed. A total of 12 patients, with a mean age of 77.6 years, underwent endovascular repair of 13 IAAs. Mean size of the aneurysms was 54.6 mm (range 34-133 mm). Mean proximal neck diameter was 18 mm (range 15-22 mm). In 7 patients, the length of the proximal neck was &lt;15 mm (10-14 mm). Only 1 patient developed thrombosis of the stent graft immediately after the operation. Patients were followed up for a mean of 31.5 months (range 18-72 months). Our midterm results demonstrate the durability of this technique in the management of iliac aneurysms with unfavorable anatomy.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Most iliac artery aneurysms (IAAs) have coexisting abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1538574412436698">1</xref>
</sup> Isolated IAAs occurring in the absence of AAA are rare, accounting for only 2% of all intra-abdominal aneurysms and 0.03% of patients in a large autopsy series.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1538574412436698">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1538574412436698">3</xref>
</sup> Isolated IAAs occur predominantly in the common iliac artery (CIA; 70%), while 20% are found in the internal iliac artery (IIA) and 10% are seen in the external iliac artery (EIA).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1538574412436698">1</xref>
</sup> Most IAAs are asymptomatic, but patients may present with rupture, embolization, thrombosis, and visceral or neurologic compressive symptoms. They are of clinical importance due to the significant operative mortality as high as 33% to 50% in some reports.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1538574412436698">2</xref>
</sup> Elective repair has been recommended for IAAs greater than 3 cm in size, rapidly expanding and symptomatic IAAs.<sup>

</sup>
</p>
<p>Open surgery has been the traditional therapy for iliac aneurysms. An aortouniiliac or aortounifemoral interposition graft may be performed to treat patients with unilateral common iliac aneurysms. However, this is often technically challenging, given the pelvic location of iliac aneurysms and the frequent history of prior AAA repair. Since the introduction of endovascular aortic aneurysm repair, its applications have rapidly expanded to include IAA repair, and endovascular management of iliac aneurysms have emerged as an attractive alternative to open repair due to low procedure-related morbidity and mortality rates.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1538574412436698">4</xref>

</sup>
</p>
<p>Currently, no device exists that is specifically designed to treat isolated IAAs. Instead covered stents or limbs of stent grafts for the treatment of AAA have been used. While the distal landing zone can easily be secured by extending the graft to the EIA, an efficient and safe proximal landing zone remains a challenging issue. Therefore, IAAs with unfavorable anatomy (wide, short, and/or conical) are excluded because of the lack of conventional stent grafts with large proximal diameters and smaller distal diameter.</p>
<p>Several published reports described the use of a modern technique in the management of isolated IAAs with wide and/or short proximal necks for which there are no commercially available grafts.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1538574412436698">8</xref>

</sup> The technique involves the use of the limb component of the Zenith aortic stent graft (William Cook Europe, Copenhagen, Denmark) but “reverse loaded,” however little is known about the mid- and long-term outcomes of this technique. We report our experience and the midterm results of this technique for endovascular management of IAAs with unfavorable neck anatomy.</p>

<sec id="section2-1538574412436698">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Medical records for consecutive patients undergoing endovascular IAA repair from 2003 to 2010 were reviewed. Our retrospective cohort included patients with isolated IAA and patients who had concomitant IAA and AAA which were previously repaired or were not suitable for bifurcated stent graft. The cohort only included IAA with unfavorable neck anatomy.</p>
<p>Unfavorable neck anatomy is defined as (1) neck width ≥14 mm in diameter, (2) neck length &lt;15 mm, (3) conical neck, and (4) combination of (1), (2), and (3). Neck width determines the type of endograft required that is conventional covered stents and stent grafts are used for cases with favorable vascular anatomy with a normal caliber CIA and a similar caliber EIA (these cases were not included in the study). In patients with wide neck and considerably different caliber CIA and EIA, tapered stent grafts are required. Neck length determines the feasibility of endograft treatment that is cases with neck length &lt;10 mm are generally not suitable for endograft implantation. The inclusion criteria for endovascular repair included aneurysm of the CIA with a proximal neck diameter of ≥14 mm and at least 10 mm in length, a distal landing zone without significant stenosis or aneurysmal dilatation in the distal CIA or EIA, and access vessels with a diameter of at least 6 mm.</p>
<p>Patient presentation and symptoms were reviewed. In all cases, computed tomography angiography (CTA) with intravenous contrast was used to assess IAA location and diameter and to plan endovascular repair. Iliac artery aneurysm length and diameter and proximal and distal neck length and diameter were all measured in the corrected plane. Then the inverted Zenith device (William Cook Europe, Copenhagen, Denmark) was ordered.</p>
<p>The stent graft would be simply deployed across the CIA if a length of 10 mm of nonaneurysmal artery was present distally for stent graft fixation, preserving the IIA. However, if the aneurysm involved the origin of the IIA, or the length of adjacent distal nonaneurysmal iliac artery was inadequate (&lt;10 mm), the origin of the IIA was embolized and covered by the stent graft extension into the EIA. Internal iliac artery embolization, when required, was performed preoperatively with Amplatzer vascular plugs (AGA Medical Corp, Plymouth, Minnesota) and/or coils.</p>
<p>At the time of endovascular repair, ipsilateral arterial access was obtained by cut down in all cases. All patients initially underwent intraoperative angiography usually from the contralateral side. Intraoperative angiograms were used to confirm estimates of appropriate device lengths as determined by preoperative CTA. All patients had 5000 units of heparin intravenously. In each case, the aneurysm neck was excluded by tapered stent graft extending from proximal CIA to its bifurcation or to EIA. Balloon dilation was performed at the proximal and distal attachment sites and in the overlapping zones. Thereafter, a final check angiogram was performed.</p>
<p>All patients received antiplatelet or anticoagulation therapy. Details of the hospital course were reviewed, including any early postoperative complications (first 30 days postprocedure). Also documented were any midterm (30 days to 5 years) and long-term (&gt;5 years) complications, including IAA rupture, graft thrombosis, and death. At follow-up, the patients were routinely asked about the presence of claudication. All patients were seen at 1 to 2 months postoperatively and then at discretion of the vascular surgeon, with CTA performed at 1 month, 6 months to 1 year, and yearly thereafter to document changes in IAA diameter and the presence of any endoleaks.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 12 patients (10 males and 2 female) underwent endovascular repair of 13 IAAs. Ten procedures were performed under general anesthesia, 1 under spinal and 1 under local anesthesia. The choice of anesthetic procedure was determined by the anesthetists. Emergency repair was performed in 1 patient who presented with lower abdominal pain when CT scan revealed a 133-mm impending rupture IAA. The rest were elective cases found during investigation for vascular disease or incidentally during investigation for nonvascular problem. Mean age of the patients was 77.6 years (range 66-93 years). Four patients had isolated IAA. Coexistent AAA was present in 3 patients: 1 patient was not fit for a bifurcated stent graft and was reluctant to have any major surgery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1538574412436698">Figure 1</xref>), and 2 patients had 34 mm subtherapeutic AAA and were also not fit for major surgery. One patient had stable type B dissection, 1 patient had a subtherapeutic 52-mm type III thoracoabdominal aneurysm, and 3 patients had previous repair of aortic aneurysm or dissection.</p>

<p>The IIA was preserved in 1 case, was already occluded at the time of the intervention in 1 case, and was intentionally occluded in 11 cases. Occlusion of the IIA was achieved by Amplatzer vascular plugs with or without coils in 7 patients, and with coils only in 2 patients. Of these 11 cases, 9 did not have occlusion of the contralateral IIA. Gluteal claudication developed in 2 patients, both had patent contralateral IIA. No other ischemic complications occurred as a result of intentional occlusion of the IIA. Only 1 intraoperative complication was encountered: type Ia endoleak treated successfully with a Palmaz stent. One patient developed complete thrombosis of the stent graft immediately after the operation secondary to a kink in the EIA just proximal the lower end of the stent. However, there were no signs of critical ischemia and no further intervention was performed. The remaining patients had an uneventful recovery.</p>
<p>Patients were followed up for a mean of 31.5 months (range 18-72 months). Six patients had a follow-up of ≥2 years (including 2 who had &gt;5 years follow-up). Late CT angiogram was performed at a mean of 20 months (range 12-48 months). During the follow-up period, 1 patient developed minor type II endoleak from the embolized IIA on the first postoperative CT scan which completely resolved after 1 month. New onset of buttock claudication, which limited ambulation, was reported postoperatively in 2 patients after embolization of the IIA. It significantly improved after 18 months of follow-up in 1 patient and worsened in the second patient after he had an open repair of contralateral IIA 2 years after the first operation. The remaining patients had no short- or midterm complications.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Open surgical repair of IAAs in good surgical risk candidates has traditionally been the standard of care.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1538574412436698">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1538574412436698">2</xref>
</sup> The favorable early outcomes of endovascular AAA repair in properly selected patients encouraged a similar approach to IAAs.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1538574412436698">13</xref>
</sup> Iliac arteries are often tortuous and calcified, even more so when they are aneurysmal. In addition, the diameter of the proximal sealing zone is often significantly larger than the diameter of the distal sealing zone, which is the EIA in most cases. Conventional stent grafts are therefore inadequate and a funnel-shaped, flexible stent graft is required. Furthermore, sufficient proximal neck length ≥10 mm is probably mandatory to exclude the aneurysm.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1538574412436698">14</xref>
</sup>
<sup>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1538574412436698">16</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The use of covered stents and stent grafts to deal with IAAs has been shown to be feasible and durable in several studies.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1538574412436698">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1538574412436698">14</xref>

</sup> In the early studies, homemade devices were used. For that purpose polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) grafts were secured with Palmaz stents attached to the proximal and distal end of the prosthesis. Later, several stent grafts became commercially available and in addition to AAA repair were also used for the exclusion of IAAs. Experience has accumulated in the management of combined abdominal and common IAAs by the use of bifurcated grafts.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1538574412436698">16</xref>

</sup> However, a bifurcated graft would not only be unnecessary for a healthy aortic vessel but could also be harmful due to the risks of stent graft deployment, like disruption to the lumbar or inferior mesenteric-IIA collateral circulation, especially in cases in which IIA embolization is considered, resulting in pelvis ischemia.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1538574412436698">21</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Currently, no stent graft device exists that is specifically designed to treat isolated IAAs. The conventional iliac limb stent graft requires a favorable anatomy with a normal caliber proximal landing zone (CIA) and a similar caliber distal landing zone CIA or EIA. The trombone technique can be used only in selected patients where there is a small difference in caliber between the proximal and distal landing zones. In such cases, one can implant the distal (smaller caliper) stent graft first and then insert the proximal (larger caliper) device.</p>
<p>In patients with more complex anatomy and considerably different caliber proximal and distal landing zones, commercially available covered stents and stent grafts are not generally tapered or of sufficient diameter to accommodate our need. Customized tapered stent grafts or “reverse loaded” iliac limbs could offer an endovascular alternative for IAA with unfavorable neck, which are currently managed with bifurcated grafts in many centers. All the cases in this series had wide proximal necks (≥14 mm) and 7 of these were short (10-15 mm). We chose to use “reverse-loaded iliac leg of a Cook Zenith stent graft, which is an off-label use that was shown to be safe and feasible in previous reports.<sup>

<sup>-</sup>
<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1538574412436698">12</xref>
</sup> The iliac limbs can be inverted manually before the procedure. However, we opted to have the device inverted by the company and delivered to us to reduce the risk of contamination.</p>
<p>In our series, intraoperative complication was encountered in 1 case only: type Ia endoleak caused by heavy calcification and significant angulation (60°) of the CIA at its origin. The endoleak was successfully excluded with a Palmaz stent. The proximal neck was short and wide measuring 12 mm in length and 16 mm in diameter. The proximal stent diameter was appropriately oversized to 22 mm (37.5%). In this cohort, aneurysms with sufficient neck length (&gt;15 mm), the stent grafts were 10% to 20% oversized; while in those with short necks (10-15 mm), the stent grafts were oversized up to 37.5% to ensure secure device placement (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1538574412436698">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>Two postoperative complications were reported: the first one was stent graft thrombosis shortly after the operation secondary to a kink in the EIA just proximal to the lower end of the stent. This required no further surgical intervention as there were no signs of critical ischemia. Retrospective review of the intraoperative angiogram revealed a kink at that site which was underestimated at the time of the operation. The second complication was minor type II endoleak on the first postoperative CT scan which resolved after 1 month (possibly reflecting the time it takes for the internal iliac branches to completely thrombose in some cases).</p>
<p>We had no serious morbidity and no mortality following this technique. The complications in this study include 1 primary endoleak (treated intraoperatively), 1 early stent graft occlusion, and 1 minor type II endoleak which settled on conservative treatment. These results are comparable with the existing publications where conventional stent grafts were used to treat IAA with adequate proximal necks (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1538574412436698">Table 2</xref>). An important point is that in these publications, bifurcated stent grafts were used to treat IAA with unfavorable neck anatomy. Persistent buttock claudication occurred in 2 cases (15.4%), this compares favorably with existing literature.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1538574412436698">21</xref>
</sup> In our cohort, 1 patient was symptomatic and was presented with lower abdominal pain, whose CT scan showed bilateral IAA (left side 133 mm, right side 51 mm) with fat stranding around the larger aneurysm suggestive of impending leak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1538574412436698">Figure 2</xref>). This aneurysm was successfully excluded with a tapered iliac stent graft. Later, the second smaller aneurysm was successfully excluded, however the stent graft occluded shortly after the operation secondary to a kink in the EIA as described above.</p>

<p>Saratzis et al reported an alternative technique for short proximal necks that spares the need for a bifurcated graft.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1538574412436698">9</xref>
</sup> They used Endofit self-expanding stent graft which achieves proximal sealing by the use of a stent graft with a proximal bare stent protruding into the aortic lumen. The study included 7 patients with a mean neck length of 7 mm (5-9 mm) and diameter &lt;18 mm. Aneurysm exclusion was successful in 6 cases. One case required an extension cuff to achieve complete exclusion. For patients with short (10-15 mm) and wide (≥14 mm) necks, our technique is an alternative.</p>
<p>Power and collegues prospectively reviewed their management of 12 IAAs treated with endovascular repair using Anaconda limb (Vascutek Ltd, Inchinnan, Renfrewshire, Scotland) in a straight or reverse flare configuration.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1538574412436698">27</xref>
</sup> Their mean follow-up was 12 months. Perioperative complication in this series included 1 early graft thrombosis and 1 groin haematoma. Late complication included 1 additional graft thrombosis and 1 late death following amputation. Five endoleaks were noted (4 type II and 1 indeterminate) at 1 month, with 4 other endoleaks (1 type II, 1 type III, and 2 indeterminate) identified on later scans. Our experience using the reverse-loaded Zenith iliac limb compares favorably to the above results.</p>
<p>The Cook Zenith(Cook Medical, Bloomington, Indiana) converter was successfully used to exclude IAA, in a few recent reports.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1538574412436698">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1538574412436698">29</xref>
</sup> This device is available as tapered 24 to 36 mm proximal diameter, 12 mm distal diameter, and 80 mm length, therefore is only suitable in selected cases with a very wide proximal neck.</p>
<p>Alternative techniques for IAA management emerge based on the need to preserve the pelvic circulation. New-generation iliac bifurcated devices show good intraoperative performance and long-term outcomes. However, the demanding implantation technique and higher costs associated with these devices limit their widespread use.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1538574412436698">19</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The limitations of this study are the relatively small number of patients and the retrospective character. However, our findings coincide with the previous studies which demonstrated that the use of tapered stent grafts in the endovascular repair of IAAs with unfavorable necks is a safe and feasible method. Furthermore, our midterm results suggest durability of the technique. This technique expands the armamentarium available to treat these challenging iliac aneurysms with unfavorable anatomy, especially for high-risk patients who are not suitable for open surgery</p>
