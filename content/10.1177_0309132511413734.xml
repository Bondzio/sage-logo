<title>Commentary 1</title>
<p>Jamie Peck’s most recent book, <italic>Constructions of Neoliberal Reason</italic>, is masterful. In order to explain its brilliance and relevance, let me briefly narrate two vignettes from the world of teaching.</p>
<p>For the last few years, I have imposed a ban on the use of the term ‘neoliberal’ by my students. They can deploy the term only after they have made the empirical and analytical case for its use. They have to demonstrate neoliberalism at work, in the making, under construction, under contestation. They cannot assert it as what Peck rightly critiques as a ‘summary label’, the ubiquitous conjuring up of a monster called neoliberalism. Such a ban is perhaps applicable to many other analytical concepts – for example, the idea of the modern – but it seems especially urgent in the case of neoliberalism, for the term has come to be used loosely and widely to describe contemporary conditions of society and space. In this sense, neoliberalism has become an apparatus without history, a structure without dialectics. With Jamie Peck’s <italic>Constructions of Neoliberal Reason</italic>, here finally is a book that makes possible an understanding of neoliberalism as historical conjuncture and thus as ‘open-ended and contradictory process’. Peck’s previous work, from <italic>Workfare States</italic> and <italic>Contesting Neoliberalism: Urban Frontiers</italic> (the latter with Eric Sheppard and Helga Leitner) to the recent essays on fast policy (with Nik Theodore), have already demonstrated the complex character of neoliberal practices, their multiplicity and inherent hybridity, their inevitable incompleteness. <italic>Constructions of Neoliberal Reason</italic> consolidates this defamiliarization of neoliberalism, rendering strange the seemingly familiar world of market fundamentalism.</p>
<p>Each year, at the University of California, Berkeley, I teach a large undergraduate course titled ‘Global Poverty: Challenges and Hopes in the New Millennium’. It is a class that takes as its subject of investigation the emergence, in the new millennium, of poverty as a matter of global conscience. Taught to a generation of ‘millennials’, the class is a critical intervention in the formations of philanthropy, volunteerism, charity and conscientious development through which young Americans today define their sense of self and their place in the world. One of the themes of the class, borrowed from the writings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0309132511413734">Subcomandante Marcos (2000)</xref>, is that ‘ideas are also weapons’. For a generation born into the Third Way era of Clinton and shaped by the intimate televisuality of distant wars (Iraq, Afghanistan) and disasters (Katrina, Haiti), global liberalism is doxa. These millennials are the interlocuters of what Peck (p. xvi) designates as ‘soft neoliberalism’, steeped in ideas of social entrepreneurship, microfinance, self-help, and creative capitalism. Reading <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0309132511413734">Jeffrey Sachs (2005)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0309132511413734">William Easterly (2006)</xref>, they inevitably dismiss Keynesianism as oppressive state practice. Unable to come to terms with market failure, they are convinced of the ills of state failure. It is the study of the construction of liberal and neoliberal thought that makes it possible for these students to interrogate the global liberalism that they have inherited. For example, this past Fall semester, a group of students came to see me in office hours to discuss the Mont Pelerin Society and the Chicago School. Strangely enough, they drew hope from the history of ideas, from the study of figures like Hayek and Friedman. Studying what Peck (p. 34) describes as the ‘ideational, ideological, and institutional’ construction of the project of neoliberalism allowed them to imagine alternatives. These students were able to conceptualize neoliberal ideology as mutable, to confront what Peck (p. xii) perceptively pinpoints as the ‘never-inevitable ascendancy of neoliberalization’. Most importantly, they were able to see themselves as ‘situated social actors’ – again Peck’s (p. xii) phrase – and to believe that they could thereby enact a different political project. I was eager to have these students read <italic>Constructions of Neoliberal Reason</italic>, for Jamie Peck has given us all an invaluable gift. That gift is more than a history of neoliberal thought and practice. It is the type of genealogical analysis that enables a new politics of the possible.</p>
<p>There is much to discuss in relation to <italic>Constructions of Neoliberal Reason</italic>. For the sake of brevity, let me highlight three issues that I continue to ponder well after I have put the book down. These issues have stayed with me as I travel to sites of research in the Middle East and South Asia, leaving behind the familiar geographies of North America. They are glimpses of how <italic>Constructions of Neoliberal Reason</italic> may itself travel.</p>
<p>Over the years, Jamie Peck’s scholarship has consistently drawn our attention to statecraft as a site of neoliberal hegemony. Peck (p. 277) makes this case once again in <italic>Constructions of Neoliberal Reason</italic>, stating pithily that neoliberals are statists. He suggests, though, that the task of neoliberal regulation and governance is self-contradictory, a ‘purgatory’ in which neoliberalism is ‘destined to dwell’ (p. xiii). It is on this point that I wish to hear more. What are the variegated forms of statecraft through which neoliberalization proceeds? This question is on my mind because I write this commentary while located in what Peck (p. 6) would describe as the ‘sociospatial frontiers’ of neoliberalism, in the Middle East. As I type, the streets of Algeria and Tunisia are exploding. In the latter, a young college graduate unable to find a job, denied even the opportunity to sell fruits and vegetables on the street, set himself alight. Since then, unemployed youth have raged in anger against rising food prices and in despair of a future that refuses to arrive. Such austerity riots have been repeatedly quelled by strong states – in Egypt, for example. These authoritarian regimes have enacted the mandates of structural adjustment, making evident the sheer violence that is often necessary to construct and implement the project of neoliberalism. I make this point about the significance of the state as a site of neoliberal reason and practice because so many of the contestations of neoliberalism are directed at state power. It is against the state that the youth of North Africa press their claims. It is the ostentatious wealth of the state’s functionaries that have been the most visible targets of the Tunisian protests. These claims, violently forged by a generation that has known only liberalization, seek to restore an economy where a vast public sector apparatus once provided the certainty of lifelong desk jobs for the educated middle classes. This type of welfare state is no more than a fading memory, but nevertheless powerful enough to launch cracks in the edifices of authoritarian neoliberalism.</p>
<p>To understand such forms of statecraft it is necessary, as Peck is aware, to understand the diverse spatiotemporalities of neoliberalism. Peck (p. 39) rightly notes that neoliberalism has ‘many birthplaces’. Glimpses of this plural geography are evident in <italic>Constructions of Neoliberal Reason</italic>: the United Kingdom, New York, New Orleans, China, Chile, Chicago, Austria. Peck is attentive to how some of these geographies have been crucial sites of experimentation, where crisis often facilitated the brutal implementation of neoliberal policy. I want to hear more on this count as well. In other words, what does it mean to effect a reading of <italic>Constructions of Neoliberal Reason</italic> at the frontiers of neoliberalism, at those locations that Peck (p. 6) predicts are ‘zones both of audacious experimentation and catastrophic failure’? Peck (p. 275) gestures towards the multipolarity of neoliberalism but for the most part tells a story of the ‘long American Century’ and its European legacies. This is not a fault to be found with the book. Such is its genealogical task. But it is precisely this genealogical endeavor that must then provoke a discussion of the history that lurks in the shadows of Europe: colonialism and imperialism. After all, European liberalism was inextricably entangled with colonial reason and practice. It is in the colonies that experiments to craft a liberal economy and a liberal man were conducted. Nationalisms – from Egypt to India – were also steeped in such liberal reason, invoking ideas of self-responsibility and economic austerity well before the IMF and World Bank had come into existence. These are of course instances of what Peck (p. 24) describes as neoliberalism’s ‘mongrel others’ – perhaps my favorite phrase in the book. But they are also instances of the colonial logic of (neo)liberal modernity. I make this point because it is difficult to understand the seductions of neoliberalism in much of the world without making note of the cohabitation of colonialism and liberalism. On the one hand, neoliberalism is indisputably neocolonial, imposed through the heavy hand of the IMF and World Bank. On the other hand, neoliberalism is simply the most recent enunciation of nationalist aspirations of development, modernization, and globalization. Less a rupture than a claim to progress, neoliberalism as market rule is thus a signifier of economic freedom.</p>
<p>Finally, in foregrounding neoliberalism’s mutable and mongrel character, <italic>Constructions of Neoliberal Reason</italic> makes visible both the inevitable incompleteness of neoliberalism as well as its constant reinvention. Peck (p. 192) pays particular attention to instances of ‘soft neoliberalism’. Using the example of the ‘creative cities’ paradigm, Peck demonstrates how arguments about place-based entrepreneurialism and cultural innovation exist alongside the punitive practices that constitute what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0309132511413734">Loic Wacquant (2009)</xref> has broadly designated as a condition of penality. Such forms of soft neoliberalism are of great interest to me, for the emergence of a global conscience about poverty can be seen as an instance of such a formation. If <italic>The Road to Serfdom</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0309132511413734">Hayek, 1944</xref>) is a defining text of neoliberalism, then now <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0309132511413734">C.K. Prahalad’s (2004)</xref> <italic>The Fortune at the Bottom of the Pyramid: Eradicating Poverty through Profits</italic> provides the premise for bottom billion capitalism and Hernando <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0309132511413734">de Soto’s (2000)</xref> <italic>The Mystery of Capital</italic> makes possible the conceptualization of the world’s poor as heroic entrepreneurs. Peck perceptively notes that such constructions hinge on a revaluation of culture and creativity as competitive assets in the new economy. My recent work is concerned with how poverty, conceptualized as culture, is transformed into globally circulating finance capital. These ideas are in turn embedded in institutional ensembles that facilitate the circulatory capacity of capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0309132511413734">Roy, 2010</xref>). In both <italic>Constructions of Neoliberal Reason</italic> and in his recent essays on fast policy, Peck brilliantly uncovers the interlocutors of such mobile rationalities – from powerful think tanks to international development agencies. Peck is already writing the sequel to <italic>Constructions of Neoliberal Reason</italic>. His research on policy transfer shows how the workfarist and zero tolerance experiments of Giuliani’s New York have given way to the soft neoliberalism of Bloomberg where anti-poverty policies borrowed from Mexico are put into place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0309132511413734">Peck and Theodore, 2010</xref>). If Obamanomics – Peck’s (p. 231) closing chapter in <italic>Constructions of Neoliberal Reason</italic> – marks the tired logic of mainstream neoliberalism, then the fast policies of soft neoliberalism indicate the remarkable reinvention of market rule under the sign of human development and creative capitalism. The latter, a phrase coined by Bill Gates and Warren Buffett (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0309132511413734">Kinsley, 2008</xref>), now joins the pantheon of discursive constructions detailed by Peck. This is the brilliance of <italic>Constructions of Neoliberal Reason</italic>. It is sharply attuned to the many lives of neoliberalism.</p>

<title>Commentary 2</title>
<p>I am writing this commentary in Jamie Peck’s home country in between two days of strikes that have more or less closed my university department. These strikes will be followed by a major demonstration in London that will draw together public sector workers, parents, and young people in the effort to persuade the government that its reform programme is wrong. Anti-cuts campaigners are calling for a 24-hour cycle of marches, occupation and sit-ins; ‘Tahrir Square in Trafalgar Square’ is their rallying cry. More generally, public sector jobs, salaries and pensions are all on the line. Youth unemployment is now at its highest level since 1992, and prospective university students face paying £9000 per annum for their education from 2012. One of the best national health care systems in the world, which also has remarkably high public satisfaction levels, is about to be marketized and partially privatized. Local services such as libraries, children’s centres and support networks are being cut, and state funding for voluntary sector organizations, community groups and arts is either being slashed or completely taken away. The expectation that is the ‘Big State’ will be replaced by the ‘Big Society’. Likewise public sector cuts are being justified on the grounds that new private sector jobs will emerge once the distorting effects of public sector are cleared away. In the meantime, banker’s bonuses are almost back to normal, and behavioural economics is the academic flavour of the month.</p>
<p>While it might be tempting to argue that this reform programme marks a return to the ‘red in tooth and claw’ variants of neoliberalism that dominated during the 1980s, there are important differences between neoliberalism in its ‘most vanguardist and outspoken form’ (p. 276) and these more recent developments. Jamie Peck’s work does a great deal to help us understand the nature of these differences. Indeed he has been tracking the vicissitudes of neoliberalism for nearly two decades. His influential contributions range from early regulationist inspired accounts of ‘jungle law’ that helped us understand the then novel reforms of the Thatcher government during the 1980s, through to the ‘house-trained, mealy mouthed versions’ (p. 276) of neoliberalism that came to dominate internationally and nationally in the 2000s. Throughout this time Jamie Peck has been at the forefront of social scientific attempts to name and theorize the market-oriented formations that framed policy agendas and political programmes. He has always been ready to call it as he sees it, is not afraid to read well beyond his home discipline of geography, and writes both eloquently and with passion. This important book both builds on and marks a new phase in his long-standing research agenda. It provides us with both a conceptual framework that does not fit neatly into theoretical boxes (which is a good thing!) and a vivid empirical account of the diverse ways in which neoliberalism has been made and remade in ‘ideational, ideological and institutional terms’ (p. xi).</p>
<p>The book moves conceptualizations of neoliberalism a long way from the still all-too-common discussions of the ‘neoliberal project’ in which hegemonic, monolithic, agent-less institutions unilaterally impose market solutions on unwilling and unwitting victims. Jamie describes these analyses as ‘global abstractions’ and instead keeps the agents of neoliberalism and their various forms of agency firmly in sight; indeed, ‘close enough to see the whites of the protagonist’s eyes’ (p. xii). His theoretical influences may come as a surprise to those who know his earlier work; not only do the expected political economists and economic geographers feature, but so too do Foucault, various anthropologists, and even the occasional poststructuralist. The result is a refreshingly rich and rigorous account that asks us all to be much more careful in our analyses of neoliberalism. This book underlines the fact that neoliberalism is a political form that emerges in very distinctive forms across time and space and we need to know much more about that process.</p>
<p>Above all, Jamie Peck’s analysis of <italic>neoliberalization</italic> is profoundly geographical – but never in a tokenistic way – and through his research the multiple movements of the diverse actors associated with market-oriented policies and programmes become much more visible. Nor is this simply a programmatic account; this is a book that takes the empirical seriously. Jamie Peck ‘walks the walk’ in his call for more nuanced, embodied accounts of neoliberalism, and shows us exactly what he thinks such analyses should look like. His argument is that local neoliberalisms have become cumulatively intertwined and mutually referential. This claim is substantiated through a focus on what he describes as ‘generative sites and moments of neoliberalization’, albeit largely located in the global North. His aim is to illustrate the ‘dialogic’ production of neoliberalization, and in doing so show how neoliberalism is always impure, tagged on to other contradictory, polymorphic processes – parasitic even.</p>
<p>Much of the book is a detailed account of the networks, exchanges and mobilities that help explain how it is that a relatively obscure transnational intellectual project was able to become a dominant policy framework, and the morphing and mutations that have subsequently ensued. Following a fascinating discussion of the Mont Pelerians themselves, he develops detailed institutional ethnographies and ideational trajectories of urban neoliberalism through an account of the new urban right in New York, and the post-Katrina New Orleans. His work draws attention to the shadowy world of think tanks, the right-wing media and the broader conservative intelligentsia which is often overlooked in accounts of the ‘usual suspects’ that focus on high-profile iconic politicians. This is followed by a trenchant critique of the urban economic development based on the creative industries à la Richard Florida’s creative class, and then in the final chapter he turns his attention to contemporary US politics following the election of Barack Obama.</p>
<p>There is much to be learned here, but, perhaps not surprisingly, further tantalizing questions emerge as a result of this provocative analysis. For as Jamie himself acknowledges, this is still <italic>a</italic> story of neoliberalism, not <italic>the</italic> story. Neoliberalism is found in the expected places and is embodied in the familiar actors. We are in known places such as Mont Pelerin, New York, Washington DC. It is also largely a transatlantic story and the important sites and moments of the global South (other than Chile) are not really present. What happens if this analysis is expanded accordingly? It would also be useful to know more about some of the new actors identified; for example, the think tanks and epistemic communities of the fast urban policy ‘creative cargo cult’ are not unpacked in the same way as they are in the earlier chapters on Chicago School. Because the emphasis in this chapter is on the creative industries script rather than the wider arena of actors, we do not learn enough about these ‘new age neoliberals, dressed in black’ (p. xix). Similarly, I was fascinated by the diverse political advisors who feature prominently in the spaces of ideological ambiguity that characterize Obamanomics (p. 242). Just how do these ideologically illusive actors come to play the role that they do? How does cultural politics come to be allied to Wall Street agendas? What would we find if we unpacked the ‘nudge-ocracy’ of behavioural economics? Finally, if neoliberalism is indeed impure, there are still important actors who are missing in his analysis. For example, there is no discussion of the grassroots political experiments that have been scaled up through neoliberalization, and the diverse actors involved who think they know neoliberalism when they see it, but are still not sure if they have been resistant, co-opted or complicit.</p>
<p>But there are many others who can and will do this analytical and political work. Indeed, because the ‘bumpy ride’ (p. 278) is far from over, it is almost inevitable that this book will inspire a new generation of scholarship. What Jamie Peck clearly and forcefully shows us all is that simply labelling something as ‘neoliberal’ will just not do. We need to examine more carefully how political formations and social relations become <italic>neoliberalized</italic>, and understand that this will take us into murky and unfamiliar worlds. For scholars like me who are interested in the apparent contradictions and paradoxes of neoliberalism, Jamie Peck provides just the conceptual material we need. Indeed, as I work with colleagues to understand new political formations that the UK government is keen to label as ‘Big Society’ it will be his work we turn to first. Our focus is on novel forms of grass roots social innovation that draw variously on discourses of environmentalism, economic entrepreneurship and community development, and also rework the complex imbrications of state, market and civil society that are themselves an important legacy of the last two decades. In analysing these ambiguous political formations it will be absolutely crucial to begin from the assumption that neoliberalization is an ‘adaptive, mutating, and contradictory mode of governance’ (p. xiii). If you are also interested in understanding the complex and sometimes unexpected historical and geographical permutations of neoliberalism, then you too should start with this book.</p>

<title>Author’s response</title>
<p>First of all, I would like to thank Wendy Larner and Ananya Roy for their thoughtful, generous readings of the book. They have each made decisive contributions to what Katharyne Mitchell once described as a (rather unruly but nonetheless productive) ‘collective project’, anchored in critical human geography, that for well over a decade now has been grappling with the meaning and consequences of neoliberalism. It has never been entirely clear to me why it should have been geography, rather than some other branch of the critical social sciences, that became an early locus of this effort, but maybe it has something to do with our traditions of relatively open theorizing, married with real-time, first-hand, and often-exploratory fieldwork. There is maybe some corroboration of this intuition in the fact that, outside geography, it is anthropology where one finds some of the most sophisticated explorations of neoliberalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0309132511413734">Ferguson and Gupta, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0309132511413734">Gledhill, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0309132511413734">Greenhouse, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0309132511413734">Hoffman et al., 2006</xref>), while this remains little more than a minority pursuit in both mainstream political science and sociology (being almost entirely absent, needless to say, in economics).</p>
<p>This unevenly matched critical challenge is hardly made any easier by the duplicitous nature of neoliberal discourse and practice itself. A confounding characteristic of dominant policy paradigms, strong discourses, regimes of truth, or manifestations of common sense is that it is difficult to think critically <italic>about</italic> them once it has become normal, for academic analysts as well as social actors, to think <italic>with</italic> them. On top of this, the rascal formulation that is neoliberalism presents particular difficulties, since it is routinely disowned, <italic>especially</italic> by its most active ideological advocates and practitioner-proponents. Instead, neoliberalism has circulated mostly as a critical code word since the 1990s, having been dropped by the true believers of the Hayekian thought collective as long ago as the mid-1950s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0309132511413734">Mirowski and Plehwe, 2009</xref>). Between the dogmatism of its more vanguardist advocates and the duplicity of its third-way practitioners, between instances of external imposition, electoral consent, and colonization by stealth, neoliberalism exists in the world not as a fixed ideology or singular form of practice, but as a series of particular, context-specific, and contradiction-laden enactments of an always-plastic ‘flexible credo’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0309132511413734">Hayek, 1944</xref>), enveloped in a ‘regime of double truths’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0309132511413734">Dean, 2010</xref>). While ‘local’ neoliberalisms – say in Canada or Chile or China or the Czech Republic – may exhibit some cross-case commonalities, family resemblances, and mutually constitutive connections, their enabling conditions of existence could hardly have been more different, as have been the specificities of their reform trajectories and restructuring projects. This ‘geohistoricity’, hardly an incidental feature of the process of neoliberalization, was what I took to be the central problematic of <italic>Constructions of Neoliberal Reason</italic>.</p>
<p>A second theme was that of crises, not simply in their macroregulatory form, as the bookends of development paradigms or modes of growth, but as routinely experienced and widely dispersed crucibles for the almost-regularized reinvention of market rule. If there has been an explanatory arc in my own travels with neoliberalism, which began with dissertation research on Thatcherism in the mid-1980s, it has been one of trying to come to terms with the reproductive tenacity of this patently flawed form of malgovernance. Hence the notion of <italic>neoliberalization</italic> as a rolling and roiling, geographically differentiated and historically evolving, patterned and patterning process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0309132511413734">Brenner et al., 2010</xref>). The ultimate source of what might be called neoliberalism’s temper, its unseemly fusion of irritability and stridency, is the radical <italic>non-attainability</italic> of its precious utopia of absolute freedoms. Not only does this mean that the project of neoliberalism is always incomplete, always frustrated, always impure; it also means that – no matter what the degree of ideational, ideological or institutional dominance – neoliberalism is doomed to coexist (often antagonistically) with its others. Dwelling among such ‘mongrel’ formations, neoliberalism’s work is therefore never done. What is more, it <italic>cannot</italic> ever be done, while what we have come to think about as ‘alternatives’ are always in the mix – be they old or new, progressive or regressive.</p>
<p>Responses to the global financial crisis, portrayed by some at the time as a terminal event for neoliberalism, reveal only too clearly that crises themselves, even big ones, are not necessarily preludes to a ‘postneoliberal’ world. Maybe neoliberalism lost another of its nine lives in the Wall Street crash, but its various post-crisis forms seem, if anything, to be yet more entrenched, locking in austerity politics in the capitals of neoliberalism in the global north, and hypercharging growth politics across the global south and east. This is evidently not the same world as the supposedly pre-crisis world of 2007, but some new world of progressive ‘postneoliberalism’ it manifestly is not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0309132511413734">Peck et al., 2010</xref>). Geographies of neoliberalization are therefore being reconstituted on a global scale – a new world (re)order. This is the (less than accommodating) terrain on which postneoliberalisms will have to be constructed.</p>
<p>It is no coincidence, of course, that <italic>postneoliberalism</italic> is a Latin American formulation, a world region in which (sometimes attenuated, sometimes extreme) neoliberal impulses exist in some of their most volatile social hybrids. No coincidence, either, that these are the kinds of locations that Ananya Roy and Wendy Larner invoke in their commentaries, for both in social practice and in political imaginaries they represent spatial signifiers of the (potential) limits of neoliberalization, even if they do not exist entirely beyond its ambit. The provenance of the book, as they point out, is largely transatlantic, which partly reflected my self-conscious strategy of tracing some of the (re)formative gridlines of the neoliberal project, from its continental European origins in the 1920s through its later interdigitations with American hegemony, tying these to and through sites of rupture and reconstitution; though its reach also reflects the limits (geographical and otherwise) of my own research and fieldwork. These efforts were not geographically random on my part, of course, but reflected the challenge of piecing together a historically and sociologically adequate ‘origin’ story – albeit a complex and contradictory one, not one of preordination.</p>
<p>But as I find myself, more and more, working in research sites in Asia and Latin America, I have been learning, once again, some of the basic lessons of interrogating nominally ‘common’ processes from multiple vantage points. While I have never subscribed to the view that there exists some smooth power gradient – running from neoliberalism’s places of projection, out through sites of subjection to spaces of exception – the challenge of developing properly relational understandings of polymorphic, hybrid phenomena like neoliberalism is nevertheless a daunting one. Rather like its object, this task must itself be forever incomplete. The reproduction of neoliberalism is manifestly a multipolar process, indeed increasingly so. I realize, in this context, that the cases that I explore in the book are selective and partial, rather than exhaustive. With the publisher’s indulgence, I could already picture the outlines of additional chapters, say, on Beijing and Athens … none of which would be sideshows to some main event elsewhere, since these are among the principal centers of neoliberal recalculation.</p>
<p>Neoliberalism, of course, is not simply an ‘internal’ characteristic of this or that political-economic regime, it continues to shape and reshape the constitutive networks through which these entities interact, and the rules of many of the games that they play. In this sense, neoliberalism exhibits globalizing powers of what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0309132511413734">Michael Mann (1984)</xref> once called ‘infrastructural coordination’, which in contrast to command-and-control ‘despotic power’ can function across vast social distances, operating as it does through distended matrices of proxy practices (surveillance, accounting, etc.), intermediary institutions, capillary capacities, and so on. This should not be taken as a license for lazy notions of blanket neoliberalization, found in every nook, pore, and cranny, and under every rock, but it does speak to the (necessary) challenge of locating neoliberalism across as well as within cases, and through its dynamic interconnections, networks, and relations, as well as in its (separate) distinctive, local forms. As debates continue around the meaning, even the existence, of neoliberalism, decades into its supposed hegemony, it is clear that there is a lot left to do. In this, as in other respects, the challenge of understanding neoliberalization, in its many domestic and cosmopolitan forms, remains in its infancy.</p>
