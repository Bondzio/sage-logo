<abstract>
<p>This literature review examines and synthesizes 30 years of research into the relationship between gender and musical instruments. Specifically, the review focuses on how this relationship affects instrument selection by grade school students entering a school music program. Topics include the gender typing of musical instruments, instrument preferences of young (preband or preorchestra) students, beliefs about which gender should play which instrument, gender influences during the instrument selection process, the status of gender stratification within instrumental ensembles, and perceptions of musicians in relation to their gender and instrument. Also discussed are theories as to why gender associations and stereotypes occur within instrumental music, including social role theory, and ways in which researchers have attempted to counteract gender as a factor in the instrument selection process. The review concludes with implications drawn from the body of research and direction for future studies.</p>

<body>
<p>When a grade school student chooses which instrument to play, the decision affects his or her musical experience in many important ways. The instrument a child selects determines whether the child is a member of the school band or orchestra and the size and instrumentation of those ensembles. Factors such as size, physical characteristics, and enjoyment level all contribute to a student’s initial success on his or her chosen instrument. As the student grows physically and mentally, the extent to which he or she is suited to the instrument continues to affect the student’s success as a musician. This level of success is one factor that contributes to students’ overall contentment with their selected instrument. Certainly, we as music educators want our students to be as happy as possible with their instruments, as a student’s satisfaction level affects not only the nature of his or her experience with music, but also whether and for how long a student chooses to participate in instrumental ensembles.</p>
<p>Although many factors influence a student’s choice of instrument, the issue of gender has been of particular interest. The stratification apparent in most instrumental-performing ensembles poses a unique situation: Unlike a student’s physical size, for example, gender has no effect on one’s ability to succeed at learning a particular instrument. Regardless, numerous studies have shown a considerable association between gender and the instruments students prefer or choose to play (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-8755123312437049">Abeles &amp; Porter, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-8755123312437049">Fortney, Boyle, &amp; DeCarbo, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-8755123312437049">Griswold &amp; Chroback, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-8755123312437049">Harrison &amp; O’Neill, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-8755123312437049">Johnson &amp; Stewart, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-8755123312437049">MacLeod, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-8755123312437049">O’Neill &amp; Boulton, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-8755123312437049">Sinsel, Dixon, &amp; Blades-Zeller, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-8755123312437049">Zervoudakes &amp; Tanur, 1994</xref>). This phenomenon is noteworthy in that it has the potential to limit students’ range of musical participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-8755123312437049">Abeles &amp; Porter, 1978</xref>). For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-8755123312437049">McKeage (2004)</xref> identified gender-based instrument selection as one reason for comparatively low female participation in collegiate jazz ensembles, stating that the band instruments most common to those groups (saxophone, trumpet, trombone, percussion) are instruments more often played by males. Women in that study identified playing a non-jazz primary instrument as one of the most common reasons for not participating or continuing in jazz ensembles.</p>
<p>Certainly then, research into gender associations of instruments is valuable in that it enables us to begin to understand this and related phenomena. Once gender associations and stereotypes are understood, steps can be taken toward remediation. Research conducted in this area can be organized into the following eight categories:</p>

<title>Gender Typing of Instruments</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-8755123312437049">Abeles and Porter (1978)</xref> carried out the first study examining gender typing of musical instruments more than three decades ago. One component of their four-part study asked college music and nonmusic majors to view a pair of musical instruments and identify which of the two instruments was the most masculine. The instruments included in the study were violin, cello, flute, clarinet, saxophone, trumpet, trombone, and drum. All possible pairings of the instruments were presented. Results of this study identified flute, violin, and clarinet as being the most feminine instruments. Drum, trombone, and trumpet were identified as being the most masculine, with cello and saxophone falling in the middle of the rankings.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-8755123312437049">Griswold and Chroback (1981)</xref> expanded on the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-8755123312437049">Abeles and Porter (1978)</xref>, including nine additional instruments in their study as well as the phrases “instrumental conductor” and “choral conductor.” Again using college music and nonmusic majors as subjects, participants were asked to rate each instrument/phrase on a Likert-type scale anchored with “feminine” on one end of the scale and “masculine” on the other. Results identified the harp as the most feminine item, followed in order by flute, piccolo, glockenspiel, cello, choral conductor, clarinet, piano, French horn, and oboe. Tuba was rated as the most masculine item, followed by string bass, trumpet, bass drum, saxophone, instrumental conductor, cymbal, and guitar. Data analysis indicated that the above gender associations remained largely the same regardless of the gender of the rater. This study confirmed the presence of gender-based instrument stereotypes as identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-8755123312437049">Abeles and Porter (1978)</xref>, as well as substantiating some of the specific associations of instruments themselves.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-8755123312437049">Delzell and Leppla (1992)</xref> used a near-replication of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-8755123312437049">Abeles and Porter (1978)</xref> study, presenting music and nonmusic majors with pairs of the same eight instruments and asking them to indicate which was the more masculine instrument. The results were nearly identical, the only difference being a switch between clarinet and violin, placing clarinet as the second- and violin the third-most feminine in this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-8755123312437049">Delzell &amp; Leppla, 1992</xref>). All three studies determined no significant difference based on the gender of the respondent. Of note in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-8755123312437049">Delzell and Leppla (1992)</xref> study is that although gender associations of instruments remained largely the same, a comparison of normalized scores revealed a smaller range between most masculine and most feminine instrument in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-8755123312437049">Delzell and Leppla (1992)</xref> study (range = 2.969) than in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-8755123312437049">Abeles and Porter (1978)</xref> study (range = 4.195). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-8755123312437049">Delzell and Leppla (1992)</xref> interpret this result to indicate a potentially lessened effect of gender association of instruments over the 14 years since <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-8755123312437049">Abeles and Porter (1978)</xref>.</p>
<p>As indicated by these three studies, research has shown that masculine or feminine associations are assigned to musical instruments with a high level of consistency, remaining largely the same throughout the 14-year span between <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-8755123312437049">Abeles and Porter (1978)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-8755123312437049">Delzell and Leppla (1992)</xref> studies. This condition appears to exist regardless of the gender of the individual considering the instruments and without any provided stimulus associating the instrument with a musician of a particular gender.</p>

<title>Instrument Preferences of Young (Preband/Preorchestra) Students</title>
<p>Going beyond the gender associations of instruments themselves, several researchers have examined the instrument preferences of young (preband/preorchestra) students for gender-based trends. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-8755123312437049">Abeles and Porter (1978)</xref> included this in their study, asking students in kindergarten through fifth grade to identify the instrument they would be interested in learning most after an aural and visual presentation of the same eight instruments used previously. Results showed that in the early primary grades (kindergarten, first, and second grade), boys preferred instruments identified as traditionally masculine, whereas girls selected from a wide range of both masculine and feminine instruments. In third through fifth grade however, boys’ preferences remained stable on the masculine end of the scale, whereas girls’ choices moved steadily toward more traditionally feminine instruments. The maximum difference between boys’ and girls’ choices occurred in the fourth grade—however, even at that time, girls displayed a wider variety of instrument preferences than did boys.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-8755123312437049">Delzell and Leppla (1992)</xref> conducted a similar study into instrument preferences. Using the same eight instruments as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-8755123312437049">Abeles and Porter (1978)</xref>, they asked fourth-grade students to identify which would be their first and second choice to play, and why they selected those instruments. They also asked the students about what would be their last choice instrument, and to explain that decision as well. Consistent with findings by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-8755123312437049">Abeles and Porter (1978)</xref>, boys tended to have a much more limited range of preferences—for instance, 83.2% of boys selected either saxophone or drums as their first choice. The order of boys’ and girls’ preferences, however, displayed much more variety than in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-8755123312437049">Abeles and Porter (1978)</xref> study. Boys’ fourth choice, after drums, saxophone, and trumpet, was the flute—a traditionally feminine instrument. Similarly, girls’ second choice after flute was drums, followed closely by saxophone. Other changes in preference order include a large jump by saxophone from fifth to second most popular, and a drop in violin from second to fourth place. These findings indicate that while masculine and feminine anchors—flute on the feminine end, drums on the masculine end—remained the same between studies, instruments on both ends of the spectrum are becoming more popular with students of the opposite sex.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-8755123312437049">O’Neill and Boulton (1996)</xref> also examined the instrument preferences of elementary students, but this time in the United Kingdom. The age of their subjects (9-11 years) would make them eligible for instrumental ensemble participation in the United States, but because of differences in instrumental music presentation in the United Kingdom, few of these students were actually actively engaged in instrumental music study. The instruments used in this study were flute and violin for their previously identified feminine connotations, drums and trumpet for their masculine connotations, and piano and guitar for their previous absence in research of this nature. Consistent with previous research, students were asked to rank the instruments in order of which they would most like to learn to play, as well as to identify reasons behind their choices. Results showed piano, flute, and violin as the most popular choices of girls, and guitar, drums, and piano as the most popular choices of boys. Guitar and drums were the most common last choices of girls, while flute and violin were the last choices of boys. Trumpet was the fourth (middle) choice of both boys and girls. These results show very little change in gender-based instrument preferences identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-8755123312437049">Abeles and Porter (1978)</xref>, despite the 18-year gap between the two studies.</p>
<p>A study of instrument preferences done by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-8755123312437049">MacLeod (2009)</xref> is the most recent research conducted in this area. In this study, third- and fifth-grade students were asked to rate their preferences on a Likert-type scale anchored by “Do not like!” and “Like a lot!” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-8755123312437049">MacLeod, 2009</xref>). They were also asked to name their favorite instrument. Instruments used in this study were violin, cello, flute, clarinet, saxophone, French horn, trumpet, and trombone. Students were divided into two groups, one of which only viewed pictures of the instruments, while the other group only listened to recordings. Ultimately, this difference in presentation yielded no difference in student responses. Results, however, did show a significant difference in instrument preferences by gender between third- and fifth-grade students. Third-grade girls rated violin, flute, and clarinet as their three favorite instruments, consistent with previous feminine associations of these instruments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-8755123312437049">Abeles &amp; Porter, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-8755123312437049">Delzell &amp; Leppla, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-8755123312437049">Griswold &amp; Chroback, 1981</xref>). However, third-grade boys rated flute, cello, and violin as their top three instruments, contradicting research indicating that boys’ preferences stay on the masculine end of the scale regardless of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-8755123312437049">Abeles &amp; Porter, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-8755123312437049">Delzell &amp; Leppla, 1992</xref>). By fifth grade, preferences of boys had changed dramatically, with saxophone identified as the most preferred instrument and flute falling from first place to seventh. Again, this contradicts previous research identifying girls’ movement toward more feminine choices as the primary cause for increased gender discrepancy by age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-8755123312437049">Abeles &amp; Porter, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-8755123312437049">Delzell &amp; Leppla, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-8755123312437049">Sinsel et al. (1997)</xref> took an interesting and somewhat alternative approach in their study of instrument preferences. Whereas previous studies correlated instrument preference with the actual gender of students, this study explored instrument correlation in relation to students’ psychological sex type—that is, their psychological identification as masculine, feminine, or androgynous, regardless of their biological sex. Fourth- and fifth-grade students in the study were first administered Boldizar’s (1991) “Children’s Sex Role Inventory” (as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-8755123312437049">Sinsel et al., 1997</xref>), a survey instrument designed to determine a child’s psychological sex type. Subjects were then presented with audio recordings of nine different band instruments and asked to identify their most- and least-preferred instruments. Instruments were included in the study based on previously established gender associations: flute, clarinet, and oboe as feminine representatives; drums, trombone, and tuba representing masculine instruments; as well as saxophone and French horn, previously identified as gender neutral (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-8755123312437049">Abeles &amp; Porter, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-8755123312437049">Delzell &amp; Leppla, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-8755123312437049">Griswold &amp; Chroback, 1981</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-8755123312437049">Sinsel et al. (1997)</xref> also included trumpet in the gender-neutral group despite masculine tendencies exhibited in other studies—this may be because trumpet was not rated as strongly masculine as some of the other instruments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-8755123312437049">Abeles &amp; Porter, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-8755123312437049">Delzell &amp; Leppla, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-8755123312437049">Griswold &amp; Chroback, 1981</xref>). Results showed that students’ most preferred instrument displayed a strong correlation with their psychological sex types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-8755123312437049">Sinsel et al., 1997</xref>). Feminine students preferred feminine instruments 60% of the time and masculine instruments in only 15% of cases. Masculine students selected masculine instruments 65.4% of the time and feminine instruments in only 7.7% of cases. Interestingly, androgynous sex–typed students selected gender-neutral instruments 41.9% of the time, with the remaining students nearly evenly split between masculine (27.4%) and feminine (30.6%) instruments. These results indicate that although previously established gender-based preferences do seem to hold true, students’ biological gender alone is not enough to predict instrument preference.</p>

<sec id="section3-8755123312437049">
<title>Opinions About Which Gender Should Play Which Instruments</title>
<p>Although the previously discussed studies identified clear trends in instrument preference along gender lines, all the data collected relied on self-identified preferences. That is, the participants were asked to state for themselves which instrument they would prefer to play, or liked the best based on its sound or features. To examine gender associations in terms of stereotypes, one must study the <italic>perceived</italic> preference that an individual (or group of individuals) project onto others. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-8755123312437049">Ford and Tonander (1998)</xref> identify stereotypes as serving to simplify the process of understanding other people by viewing them as a group rather than as individuals. Research into this aspect of the gender–instrument relationship proceeds by not simply acknowledging that flute is an instrument with widely held feminine connotations, but by examining whether people believe that girls should play the flute <italic>because</italic> it is a traditionally feminine instrument.</p>
<p>The first venture into this arena was included in the original four-part study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-8755123312437049">Abeles and Porter (1978)</xref>. In this portion of their research, randomly selected adults were presented with a hypothetical scenario indicating that their fifth-grade child had expressed a desire to play a musical instrument and asking them to recommend an instrument for her to play. Half the surveys asked about a hypothetical daughter, whereas the other half asked about a son. The instruments provided as options were the same eight as in previously discussed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-8755123312437049">Abeles and Porter (1978)</xref> research. Results showed that respondents were most likely to select flute, clarinet, or violin for their daughter, and trumpet, drums, or trombone for their son. This simple experiment exemplifies gender stereotyping—knowing only the gender of the child, respondents most often selected instruments traditionally assigned a gender association matching that of the child.</p>
<p>The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-8755123312437049">Delzell and Leppla (1992)</xref> study also explored the concept of gender-based instrument stereotyping. After the portion of the study in which students were asked to identify their own instrument preference, they were given a sheet with a number of instrument pairs and asked to identify which of the pair a boy (half the surveys) or a girl (the other half of the surveys) would be most likely to play. Sheets were distributed randomly to both boys and girls. When combining the results of both male and female respondents, results aligned closely with previous studies of gender associations: drums, saxophone, and trombone were identified as the top three perceived preferences of boys, and flute, clarinet, and violin were identified as the top three perceived preferences of girls. Again, this demonstrates stereotyping in that feminine- and masculine-typed instruments were assigned to girls and boys, respectively, with gender as the only known trait of the musician in question. Interesting is the fact that the first part of this study identified somewhat uncharacteristic preferences when students self-identified their favorite instrument—for example, flute was the fourth choice of boys and drums were the second choice of girls. When asked to identify which instruments they thought boys and girls <italic>should</italic> play, however, their answers were much more closely aligned to typical gender associations.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-8755123312437049">O’Neill and Boulton (1996)</xref> included an inquiry into stereotyping in their research as well, but in a slightly more direct manner. In their one-on-one interviews with fourth-grade students, students were first asked to rate their own instrumental preferences. They were then asked if there were any instruments from the list (piano, flute, violin, guitar, trumpet, drums) that should <italic>not</italic> be played by boys or should not be played by girls, and to state a reason why. Both male and female responses indicated that boys should not play flute, piano, or violin, whereas girls should not play drums, guitar, or trumpet. These findings accurately reflected self-stated preferences of boys and girls—that is, the three instruments identified as those that boys should not play were the top three choices of girls, and the three instruments identified as those that girls should not play were the top three choices of boys. Top reasons for identifying instruments that should <italic>not</italic> be played by a certain gender included a belief that the gender in question does not like the sound of the instrument, that the instrument is simply “an instrument for boys [or girls],” or never having seen a member of that gender playing the instrument.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-8755123312437049">
<title>Gender Influences During the Instrument Selection Process</title>
<p>Research discussed up to this point has focused on hypothetical situations—what instruments young students <italic>would</italic> choose to play, what instruments <italic>should</italic> be played by children of a certain gender, and so forth. The next studies investigate factors that come into play for students and teachers engaged in the actual process of selecting or assigning instruments. A relatively small amount of research in this area also addresses issues of retention for students who do choose gender-atypical instruments.</p>
<p>A natural question when considering gender-based instrument associations is what role the director might play in conforming to or rejecting these stereotypes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-8755123312437049">Johnson and Stewart (2004)</xref> examined this effect by sending randomly selected beginning band directors to one of two websites. The first website displayed two pictures of each of eight students—one showing the student’s entire smiling face, the other showing a close-up of the student’s lips and oral cavity. The second website showed only the oral cavity picture, hiding the student’s gender. On both websites, participants were asked to assign the student to one of six beginning band instruments. In general, results of the survey showed no significant difference between instrument assignments by directors who were aware of the students’ genders and those who did not receive this information. These results were corroborated by a second study investigating the effects of both race and gender on instrument assignment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-8755123312437049">Johnson &amp; Stewart, 2005</xref>). Neither of these factors had any significant impact on instrument assignments by the directors involved in the study. These results are reassuring in that instructor bias does not seem to play a major role in instrument assignment. In this synthetic research scenario, oral structure was perhaps the strongest factor in the decision-making process. Free-response questions at the end of the surveys indicated that in a real teaching situation, participants most commonly used students’ own preferences, their success on various mouthpieces, or instrumentation needs as additional factors in deciding on an instrument. These findings indicate that conceptions and preferences brought into the selection process by students themselves are stronger factors in creating gender-based associations than are any biases of the educators facilitating the selection process.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-8755123312437049">Fortney et al. (1993)</xref> explored the student perspective on influences that come into play during the instrument selection process. They asked 900 middle school band students to state which instrument they played, then rated various factors as to whether each one influenced their choice of instrument “None,” “Some,” or “A Lot” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-8755123312437049">Fortney et al., 1993</xref>). Factors included people (parents, friends, music teachers), instrumental timbre, media influences (e.g., having seen the instrument on TV), cost, size, and availability of the instrument. When looking at only the stated instruments of the students, clear gender associations are present. More than 90% of flute players were female; conversely, nearly 90% of trumpet players and percussionists were male. Similar associations existed for the other instruments as well, with females representing more than 70% of clarinet and oboe players and a large majority of low brass players being male. When asked why they chose their instrument, more than half the subjects responded that they liked the sound of the instrument. Few differences existed between the responses of females and males, with the exception of girls citing size of the instrument slightly more often than boys, and boys citing media influences slightly more often than girls. This discrepancy is somewhat supported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-8755123312437049">Taylor (2009)</xref>, who also noted boys’ identification of media influences in his study of male flutists. Specifically, two boys cited a male flutist in a popular cartoon and a male ocarina player in a popular videogame as primary influences in their decisions to play the flute. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-8755123312437049">Fortney et al. (1993)</xref> concluded from their study that despite students not expressly naming gender as a factor their choice of instrument, some type of gender/instrument social influence was clearly present. While the most commonly stated reason by both boys and girls for choosing an instrument was its timbre, the authors point out the improbability that most girls “just happen to prefer the timbre of woodwind instruments” and that most boys “just happen to prefer the timbres of brass instruments, saxophone, and percussion” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-8755123312437049">Fortney et al., 1993</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-8755123312437049">Conway (2000)</xref> looked at influences on instrument selection through a phenomenological study of the perceptions of high school band students. Students who both broke and conformed to traditional instrument stereotypes were interviewed. When asked what factors influenced their decisions, students in both the traditional and nontraditional instrument groups noted influences similar to those identified in previous studies—instrument timbre being the most common, with size and other physical characteristics of the instrument also mentioned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-8755123312437049">Delzell &amp; Leppla, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-8755123312437049">Fortney et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-8755123312437049">O’Neill &amp; Boulton, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-8755123312437049">Sinsel et al., 1997</xref>). Students who conformed to instrument stereotypes frequently cited the influence of family—either through suggesting a particular instrument or serving as a deterrent against an instrument that the student suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-8755123312437049">Conway, 2000</xref>). Peer groups were another common reply, as students recalled discussing “cool” instruments with their friends or deciding to play the same instrument as their friends were playing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-8755123312437049">Conway, 2000</xref>). For students who chose nonstereotypical instruments, peer influence seemed to have had the opposite effect—students often discussed a desire to be different from the crowd, or for one female brass player, to differentiate herself from her feminine, flute-playing sister. These results indicate that, at least for students playing nongender-typical instruments, the selection process often included an awareness of gender stereotypes and a conscious desire to go against them.</p>
<p>Also worth mentioning in this section is a relatively small amount of research done in the area of retention—that is, factors that support students who select gender-atypical instruments and enable them to continue playing those instruments through high school. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-8755123312437049">Conway (2000)</xref> study of high school instrumentalists found that students playing gender-atypical instruments often received ongoing support from their families. However, many students also cited an ability to ignore teasing and negative comments from peers who criticized their choice.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-8755123312437049">Taylor (2009)</xref> conducted a study into the support structures of musically high-achieving male flutists. Research has shown the flute to have a particularly strong feminine association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-8755123312437049">Abeles &amp; Porter, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-8755123312437049">Conway, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-8755123312437049">Delzell &amp; Leppla, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-8755123312437049">Fortney et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-8755123312437049">Griswold &amp; Chroback, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-8755123312437049">Harrison &amp; O’Neill, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-8755123312437049">O’Neill &amp; Boulton, 1996</xref>). Participants in this study were male flute and piccolo players who had participated in the Texas All-State band or orchestra between 2003 and 2007 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-8755123312437049">Taylor, 2009</xref>). Nearly all students reported having experienced teasing related to playing the flute. However, most participants made some note of teasing decreasing considerably once they began to excel in competitive situations such as chair placements and regional and state competitions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-8755123312437049">Taylor (2009)</xref> states, “For boys defying gender stereotypes, competition may serve as a supportive means of validation.” Findings also indicated that most of the male flutists had begun taking lessons within a few years of beginning the flute, and most had attended some sort of music- or flute-related summer camp. These experiences not only contributed to the students’ musical achievement but also put them in contact with other male flutists, creating an additional social support structure.</p>

<title>Status of Gender Stratifications Within Existing Performing Ensembles</title>
<p>Having examined gender influences on the instrument selection process, the next logical step is to look at how gender stratification is actually reflected in middle school, high school, and college-level performing ensembles.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-8755123312437049">Zervoudakes and Tanur (1994)</xref> completed a study examining gender stratification trends over three decades. A total of 600 elementary schools, high schools, and universities across the United States were asked to submit band and orchestra concert programs from the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. Rosters in each program were gender coded by first name, with accommodations made to determine the gender of ethnic or ambiguous names. Results showed that the proportion of females playing traditionally male-gendered instruments increased over the 30 years addressed in the study. However, the proportion of females playing female-gendered instruments also increased, simply indicating a higher overall participation level of females in instrumental ensembles. Further statistical analysis holding female proportions constant indicated that at the high school and college levels, proportion of women playing male-gendered instruments had actually <italic>decreased</italic> over time. The authors relate this to Wilkinson’s (1991) study of the medical field, in which more women are entering the profession but are tending to specialize in feminine-associated fields such as pediatrics (as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-8755123312437049">Zervoudakes &amp; Tanur, 1994</xref>). Analysis of enrollment at the elementary level, however, indicated an <italic>increased</italic> incidence of girls playing traditionally male instruments. These findings indicate that as long as this group of elementary-age students continues in instrumental music, proportions of females on traditionally male-typed instruments in high school and college ensembles should increase. No data were provided from this study on ratios of males playing traditionally female instruments. A replication of this study would be of value to the music education community to further track gender proportion trends through the 1990s and 2000s.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-8755123312437049">Sheldon and Price (2005)</xref>, curious as to whether instrument/gender associations were unique to the United States, conducted a study into the status of gender stratification in instrumental ensembles throughout the world. Rosters were collected from 170 community and school bands in 25 countries, with each roster including members’ names, gender, and instrument. Ultimately, more than 8,000 instrumentalists were included in the study. Results showed that overall, male and female enrollment in band ensembles is nearly equal in Australia and North America. Most European and African countries showed a higher proportion of male participants. Exceptions were Australia, England, and Iceland, all with small female majorities, and Japan, where almost 84% of instrumental ensemble members were women. Further analysis by instrument largely supported previous research in regard to gender association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-8755123312437049">Abeles &amp; Porter, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-8755123312437049">Cramer, Million, &amp; Perrault, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-8755123312437049">Delzell &amp; Leppla, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-8755123312437049">Fortney et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-8755123312437049">Harrison &amp; O’Neill, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-8755123312437049">MacLeod, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-8755123312437049">O’Neill &amp; Boulton, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-8755123312437049">Sinsel et al., 1997</xref>).

<title>Perceptions of Musicians in Relation to Their Gender and Instrument</title>
<p>It is natural to assume that since instruments possess clear gender associations, gender stereotypes may subsequently be projected onto musicians who play those instruments. That is, musicians who play gender-typical instruments may likely be perceived differently than musicians who play instruments associated with the opposite gender. The high school participants in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-8755123312437049">Conway’s (2000)</xref> phenomenological study alluded to this on an anecdotal level. Students who chose gender-atypical instruments often indicated that their choice was rooted in a desire to be different from the crowd—they were aware on some level that by choosing an opposite-gendered instrument, they might be perceived as unique or as more of an individual than their peers. The students also recognized the negative side of this issue when asked about assisting a future child of their own in selecting an instrument. When students were asked if a future daughter should be allowed to play a low brass instrument, all participants responded that they would encourage the child to play whatever instrument she liked. When asked if a future son should be allowed to play flute, however, several students indicated concern about the boy being teased. Indeed, nearly all the subjects in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-8755123312437049">Taylor’s (2009)</xref> study of male flute players reported having received negative feedback from family or peers about their choice of instrument. These findings allude to a larger issue appearing in research of gender-based perceptions: In this age of Title IX and other female equality initiatives, boys may actually face more gender–instrument barriers than do girls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-8755123312437049">Conway, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-8755123312437049">Delzell &amp; Leppla, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-8755123312437049">Cramer et al. (2002)</xref> also explored this issue in their study of gender stereotypes and perceptions of musicians. For this study, the researchers view gender stereotypes through the lens of social role theory. Social role theory is defined in the study as a belief that “gender stereotypes are derived from exposure to differential membership by males and females in various roles, occupations, or even behaviors” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-8755123312437049">Cramer et al., 2002</xref>, p. 165). For instance, children may think that flutists should be female because most flutists they have seen were female. Stereotypes occur when traits are assigned to an individual simply because of the social role he or she holds. The authors describe a study by Eagly and Steffen (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-8755123312437049">Cramer et al., 2002</xref>) in which subjects were asked to describe various men and women who worked as homemakers or who held jobs outside the home. Results showed that subjects assigned masculine traits to the jobholders and feminine traits to the homemakers regardless of the individual’s actual gender.</p>
<p>For their study of musicians, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-8755123312437049">Cramer et al. (2002)</xref> presented participants with scenarios of male and female musicians playing typically masculine and typically feminine instruments in various combinations. Participants were asked to rate each musician using nine descriptors—three masculine, three feminine, and three gender neutral. Results showed that musicians playing masculine instruments were rated equally in perceptions of dominance and leadership regardless of the gender of the musician. However, males playing feminine instruments were judged as less dominant and possessing fewer leadership skills than female musicians playing the same instruments. This statistical finding is consistent with anecdotal research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-8755123312437049">Conway (2000)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-8755123312437049">Taylor (2009)</xref>, indicating that males are judged more harshly than females for playing gender-atypical instruments.</p>

<title>Theories as to Why Gender Associations and Stereotypes Occur</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-8755123312437049">Cramer et al.’s (2002)</xref> social role theory is just one of several presented by researchers in an attempt to explain the phenomena of gender-based instrument associations and stereotypes. From an anecdotal perspective, students in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-8755123312437049">Conway’s (2000)</xref> study suggested that gender stereotypes stemmed from societal influences such as the media and common perceptions of male and female roles. One student states that stereotypes come from “this ethic that women are the recessive sex and that playing like low brass would be harder for them” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-8755123312437049">Conway, 2000</xref>, p. 9). Another explains that “the stereotype just comes from society in general . . . you’re not taught ‘girls can’t play trombone’ but you get feelings about certain things from what you see on TV” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-8755123312437049">Conway, 2000</xref>, p. 9). Others suggested that stereotypes are passed on from older generations.</p>
<p>Several researchers also cite media as a contributor to gender stereotypes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-8755123312437049">O’Neill and Boulton (1996)</xref> argue that boys are exposed to male rock and pop musicians playing drums, guitar, and even some brass instruments much more often than they witness male orchestral musicians playing violin or flute. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-8755123312437049">Harrison and O’Neill (2000)</xref> describe a similar situation, using social learning theory to describe how parents, teachers, peers, and the media all act as role models for children learning gender-appropriate behaviors. Boys who see (or don’t see) male role models associated with certain instruments may develop a belief that those instruments are (or are not) the most appropriate for boys to play.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-8755123312437049">O’Neill and Boulton (1996)</xref> also brought up the research of David and Brannon (1976), noting their theory that gender role development of boys is often based heavily in an early and active avoidance of things thought to be feminine (as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-8755123312437049">O’Neill &amp; Boulton, 1996</xref>). This theory could help explain why previous studies found young boys’ instrument preferences to cluster around traditionally masculine instruments at an age when girls still exhibited broader interests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-8755123312437049">Abeles &amp; Porter, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-8755123312437049">Delzell &amp; Leppla, 1992</xref>). Girls do experience a similar stage in development, according to the theory, but at a later age than boys. Hill and Lynch (1982) referred to this phenomenon as the “gender intensification hypothesis” (as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-8755123312437049">Basow &amp; Rubin, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-8755123312437049">O’Neill &amp; Boulton, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Gender intensification is a point around adolescence at which girls move away from traditionally masculine activities. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-8755123312437049">Basow and Rubin (1999)</xref> describe gender intensification as following a period of androgyny (ages 8-11 years) in which girls participate in sports and other activities without concern for their masculine or feminine connotation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-8755123312437049">Stoddart and Turiel (1985)</xref> discuss a similar phase—their research identified children in middle childhood as being more accepting of crossed gender boundaries than children in early childhood or adolescence. This developmental anomaly may support the broad instrument preferences exhibited by elementary-age girls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-8755123312437049">Abeles &amp; Porter, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-8755123312437049">Delzell &amp; Leppla, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-8755123312437049">Zervoudakes &amp; Tanur, 1994</xref>). Similarly, the gender intensification theory may serve to support research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-8755123312437049">Zervoudakes and Tanur (1994)</xref>, indicating that most high school and college ensembles exhibit stricter gender stratification by instrument than do elementary ensembles. If gender intensification does indeed happen for girls at puberty (around age 12 years), many of the girls who played gender-atypical instruments in elementary school may have quit band or orchestra or switched to a more feminine instrument by the time they reach high school.</p>

<title>Attempts at Remediation</title>
<p>Several studies into the influences of gender on instrument selection have explored whether the effect can be remediated in some way. This research almost always involves varying the method in which students are introduced to the instruments. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-8755123312437049">Abeles and Porter (1978)</xref> used three different audiovisual methods of presenting instruments to groups of 3- to 5-year-old students. The methods employed various levels of gender association, ranging from a completely nongendered approach to one that included pictures of gender-typical students playing each instrument. Results showed no effect of presentation method on girls and only a small effect on boys. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-8755123312437049">MacLeod (2009)</xref> included a similar element in her study, presenting one group of students with audio-only examples of instruments and the other with visual-only examples. No significant difference was found between the two methods.</p>
<p>Proponents of social learning theory suggest that role models may have an effect on students’ preferences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-8755123312437049">Delzell &amp; Leppla, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-8755123312437049">Harrison &amp; O’Neill, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-8755123312437049">O’Neill &amp; Boulton, 1996</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-8755123312437049">Harrison and O’Neill (2000)</xref> conducted a study investigating the effects of both same- and opposite-gendered role models on students’ instrument preferences. Students in this study were first given a brief audiovisual presentation of each of the six band instruments and were interviewed about their preferences. Students were then split into three groups: Group 1 was presented with a concert featuring gender-typical musician/instrument combinations, Group 2 received a concert featuring gender-atypical musician/instrument pairings, and Group 3 did not receive a concert. Each performer in the concert played two brief pieces of contrasting styles. Immediately following the concert (or, for Group 3, a month after the pretest), students were asked again to identify their instrument preferences. Results of the study showed same-sex role models affecting the instrument preferences of both boys and girls, with both genders more likely to select an opposite-gendered instrument when played by a same-sex role model. However, the researchers also noted that the data could be interpreted a different way: Seeing a same-gendered instrument played by an opposite-gendered musician could actually <italic>deter</italic> students from choosing that instrument. Thus, the study is somewhat indecisive in determining whether students are attracted to same-sex role models or deterred by role models of the opposite gender. The authors suggest the possibility of presenting instruments to segregated groups of boys and girls using only musicians of the same gender. However, they also admit that this is a somewhat artificial setup and possibly difficult to enact in a school setting. Ultimately it is concluded that while same-sex role models do affect students’ preferences for instruments, this may not be the best method of achieving that result.</p>
<p>Certainly more research is still needed in the area of gender-stereotype remediation. However, educators can take the above studies into consideration when helping students select an instrument. Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-8755123312437049">Abeles and Porter (1978)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-8755123312437049">MacLeod (2009)</xref> found students’ instrument choices remain largely the same after viewing either audio-only or visual-only presentations, several studies indicate that students do self-identify instrument timbre as a primary factor in their decision to play a particular instrument (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-8755123312437049">Conway, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-8755123312437049">Delzell &amp; Leppla, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-8755123312437049">Fortney et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-8755123312437049">O’Neill &amp; Boulton, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-8755123312437049">Sinsel et al., 1997</xref>). For this reason, determining students’ timbre preferences using a gender-neutral method can still be viewed as a relevant step in the instrument selection process. Edwin Gordon’s Instrument Timbre Preference Test kit, currently available through GIA Publications, is one objective testing instrument that educators might consider. In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-8755123312437049">Harrison and O’Neill (2000)</xref> determine that same- and opposite-gendered role models do affect students’ selections, though the exact cause for this is unclear. Educators may wish to devise a method of presentation practical for their own school setting in which students are able to view instrument demonstrations by both male and female musicians.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Research in the area of gender-based instrument associations, stereotypes, and stratification has resulted in a fair amount of agreement on certain points. First, it is clear that society perceives musical instruments as possessing a particular gender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-8755123312437049">Abeles &amp; Porter, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-8755123312437049">Delzell &amp; Leppla, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-8755123312437049">Griswold &amp; Chroback, 1981</xref>). Additionally, gender associations of instruments seem somewhat stable, with flute, clarinet, and violin considered feminine, most brass and percussion instruments considered masculine, and saxophone and cello typically identified as gender neutral (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-8755123312437049">Abeles &amp; Porter, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-8755123312437049">Delzell &amp; Leppla, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-8755123312437049">Griswold &amp; Chroback, 1981</xref>).

The association appears even stronger when considering students’ psychological sex type in addition to their biological gender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-8755123312437049">Sinsel et al., 1997</xref>). Children seem to possess an acute awareness of these associations, frequently assigning feminine instruments to girls and masculine instruments to boys when asked who should and should not play what (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-8755123312437049">Abeles &amp; Porter, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-8755123312437049">Delzell &amp; Leppla, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-8755123312437049">O’Neill &amp; Boulton, 1996</xref>). Evidence also suggests that individuals are perceived differently depending on whether their instruments are typical or atypical for their gender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-8755123312437049">Conway, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-8755123312437049">Cramer et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-8755123312437049">Taylor, 2009</xref>). Finally, the effects of gender stereotypes on ensemble makeup appear to be consistent not only over time but also on a global scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-8755123312437049">Sheldon &amp; Price, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-8755123312437049">Zervoudakes &amp; Tanur, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>It is clear through this body of research that gender-based instrument stereotypes not only exist but also are affecting the choices beginning band students make and the experiences they encounter throughout their time in public school music. Although some attempts at remediation have been made (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-8755123312437049">Abeles &amp; Porter, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-8755123312437049">Harrison &amp; O’Neill, 2000</xref>), gender remains an active influence in students’ decision-making process. As music educators, we undoubtedly want our students to have the most positive musical experiences possible. This includes the selection of an instrument that will enable the student to succeed and will provide him or her with enjoyment from elementary through high school and beyond. Future research might be directed toward methods of counteracting the effect of gender in the instrument selection process, focusing on techniques that are practical for implementation in a grade school setting. Research into retention techniques for students playing gender-atypical instruments would also be of use to middle and high school music educators. And while research indicates that instructor bias does not seem to play a major role in instrument assignment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-8755123312437049">Johnson &amp; Stewart, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-8755123312437049">2005</xref>), future studies might examine the effects of other instructor characteristics such as gender of the director and his or her own primary instrument. Further work in this area will benefit efforts to construct an environment in which students can choose whichever instrument fits them best, free of gender-based stereotypes.</p>
