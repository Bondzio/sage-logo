<abstract>
<p>Sándor Ferenczi, the great representative of the Budapest School of Psychoanalysis, had a lifelong interest in psychical phenomena. Although his ideas on the psychoanalytical understanding of spiritualistic phenomena and telepathy were not developed theories, they had a strong influence on some representatives of psychoanalysis, and thus underlay the psychoanalytic interpretation of telepathy. Ferenczi’s ideas on telepathy were interwoven with his most important technical and theoretical innovations. Thus Ferenczi’s thoughts on telepathy say a lot about his psychoanalytical thinking and attitudes, and illuminate the significance of his greatest innovations in the context of psychical research.</p>

<body>
<p>It is well known that Sándor Ferenczi, the great representative of the Budapest School of Psychoanalysis, was a real innovator. His contributions to the technique and theory of psychoanalysis proved to be fundamental in its history. It is less known that Ferenczi was also influenced by psychical research and spiritualism. Although it is not easy to estimate the effects of his telepathy experiments in light of his innovations, it is unquestionable that Ferenczi was deeply interested in thought-transference and encouraged systematic research in the field.</p>
<p>Ferenczi was not alone among psychoanalysts in his interest in psychical research and spiritualism. The founder of psychoanalysis, Sigmund Freud, was also deeply involved in the question of telepathy and made some remarkable observations on the phenomena (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0952695111434253">Freud, 1953a[1904</xref>], <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0952695111434253">1953b[1921]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0952695111434253">1953c[1922]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0952695111434253">1953d[1933]</xref>). In his opinion, telepathy was a psychoanalytically significant question that could illuminate the physical equivalents of mental processes (ibid.). Carl Gustav Jung, Freud’s heretical disciple, was labelled as a mystic, since in his analytical psychology he integrated the theory of psychoanalysis with spiritualism, religion, astrology, alchemy and eastern philosophies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0952695111434253">Jung, 1983a[1896]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0952695111434253">1983b[1897]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0952695111434253">1916[1902]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0952695111434253">2009</xref>). He was also truly interested in psychical research and parapsychology; he conducted several experiments with mediums and published numerous articles on the connection between the functioning of the unconscious and parapsychology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0952695111434253">Jung, 2001[1933</xref>], <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0952695111434253">1988[1944]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0952695111434253">1977</xref>). Many other representatives of early psychoanalysis were also interested in psychical research; István Hollós<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0952695111434253">1</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0952695111434253">1933</xref>), Helene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0952695111434253">Deutsch (1926</xref>), John <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0952695111434253">Rickman (1933</xref>) and T. W. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0952695111434253">Mitchell (1918</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0952695111434253">1938</xref>) are only some of those who tried to interpret the spiritualistic and other seemingly supernatural phenomena in psychoanalytic terms. As a result of their efforts, valuable psychoanalytic theories were born, which enriched the understanding of human relationships with innovative ideas. Their main interest remained thought-transference, which they declared relevant in the interpretation of the psychoanalytic situation.</p>
<p>Other psychoanalysts, like Freud’s biographer Ernest <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0952695111434253">Jones (1931</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0952695111434253">1957</xref>), were also certainly involved in the question of supernatural phenomena; however, their primary aim was to disprove the validity of such phenomena and identify the psychoanalytic, rationalistic meaning of supernatural belief systems. In their theories they followed a sceptical, reductive method of interpretation in which the seemingly supernatural phenomena were debunked by psychoanalytic theories; therefore they conformed to the demands of medical materialism.</p>
<p>In one way or another, psychoanalysts were deeply involved in the question of the supernatural. Partly as a result of this, historians of psychology often identify psychoanalysis with a mystical, irrational approach, which is rather far from the realm of science. They usually ignore the fact that psychoanalysts had very different attitudes towards the so-called ‘occult’, and most of them pursued an objective and rational method of understanding in their theories. Furthermore, psychoanalysts were not more involved in the question of spiritualistic phenomena or psychical research than the representatives of other branches of psychology. Their interest in these occurrences was a typical feature of early psychological thinking, in which mediumistic performances and other inexplicable phenomena seemed to be an excellent field for psychological investigations. By researching the latter, psychologists developed many different theories on the possible psychological background of mediumism. Among these, the theory of subliminal or unconscious processes proved to be fundamental; therefore it is not surprising that numerous psychoanalysts started to focus on the field of supernatural phenomena.</p>
<p>As has been pointed out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0952695111434253">Oppenheim, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0952695111434253">Luckhurst, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0952695111434253">Treitel, 2004</xref>), the scientific investigation of mediumistic and spiritualistic phenomena developed in connection with the discoveries and changes of 19th-century science and culture. The most important organization in these researches was the Society for Psychical Research, founded in London in 1882. The representatives of the SPR encouraged systematic investigation in the field of hypnotism, mesmerism, spiritualistic and psychical phenomena, and as a result of their efforts valuable theories were born on the possible psychological and physical background of the seemingly supernatural occurrences. Among these Frederic Myers’ concept on the subliminal consciousness also proved to be highly significant for the psychoanalysts. Freud was aware of Myers’ theory and – although there were some potential links between his own theory of the unconscious and the subliminal self – he tried to distance himself from the realm of Myersian subliminal psychology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0952695111434253">Freud, 1958[1912]</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0952695111434253">Hinshelwood, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0952695111434253">Keeley, 2001</xref>). Freud insisted on the materialist origins of the human psyche, and despite the fact that he was interested in psychical research, at heart he was rather ambivalent and cautious about the results of psychical researchers. However, Freud’s efforts to demarcate psychoanalysis from Myers’ concept of the subliminal self played an extraordinary role in the systematic theorization of the Freudian concept of unconscious (ibid.).</p>
<p>Ferenczi was one of those psychoanalysts who did not intend to disprove the validity of apparently supernatural phenomena. Nevertheless, in his technical and theoretical innovations – according to which the psychoanalyst was an active, emotionally and intuitively accessible actor in the psychoanalytic situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0952695111434253">Ferenczi, 1980a[1928]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0952695111434253">1995[1932]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0952695111434253">1980b[1932]</xref>) – he seemingly ignored the results of his experiments with telepathy. Taking into account the significance of Ferenczi’s theories for the later development of psychoanalysis, it would be misleading to neglect the influence of his experiments and ideas in the field of spiritualism and psychical research. Although he never developed a comprehensive theory on the matter, his interest in apparently supernatural phenomena was a typical manifestation of his innovative attitude, which proved to be so fruitful in psychoanalysis. Therefore it is worth examining whether his interest in the above-mentioned phenomena might have influenced the development of his ideas and technical considerations. In this article I will argue that although Ferenczi’s theories on telepathy were not elaborated, they developed in connection with his most significant innovations and thus they influenced Ferenczi’s ideas in a significant way.</p>
<p>Ferenczi discusses spiritualism in one of his earliest publications, in 1899 (1963[1899]). The fact that he devoted one of his first writings to the subject of spiritualism says a lot about the openness of the young Ferenczi. It reveals not only his scientific attitudes, but the innovative enthusiasm which characterized so many scientists at the turn of the last century. William James, Théodore Flournoy, Carl Gustav Jung, Charles Richet and Frederic Myers are only some of those eminent scholars who encouraged systematic investigation in the field of spiritualistic phenomena and thus enriched early psychology with valuable results (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0952695111434253">James, 1986[1886]</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0952695111434253">Flournoy, 1900</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0952695111434253">Jung, 1916[1902]</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0952695111434253">Richet, 1923</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0952695111434253">Myers, 1903</xref>). Besides American, English, French and German psychology, Hungarian scientific life was also influenced by spiritualism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0952695111434253">Elekes, 1926</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0952695111434253">Szántó, 1927</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0952695111434253">Szilágyi, 1923</xref>), although psychical research was not so well known and widespread in Hungary. Instead of the unorganized nature of psychical research in Hungary, Ferenczi followed the objectivity of psychical researchers in his early investigations in the field of spiritualism.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Ferenczi’s publication on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0952695111434253">spiritism (1963[1899]</xref>) raises many questions. What is the significance of this early article in Ferenczi’s life-work? Was his interest in spiritualistic phenomena determining or was it only a transitory enthusiasm? Why did Ferenczi devote an article to spiritualism in the first years of his psychological career? What is the connection between this article and his later psychoanalytic theories? The aim of the present article is to try to answer these questions.</p>
<sec id="section1-0952695111434253">
<title>On spiritism</title>
<p>Ferenczi was not the only one in the history of psychoanalysis who started his scientific career with a publication on spiritualistic phenomena.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0952695111434253">2</xref>
</sup> In 1902 Carl Gustav Jung published his doctoral dissertation ‘On the Psychology and Pathology of So-called Occult Phenomena’ in which he examined the special abilities of S. W., a young female medium. In reality, S.W. was his cousin, Helene Preiswerk, whose mediumistic trance-states were interpreted using Jung’s theory of hysteria and somnambulism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0952695111434253">Jaffé, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0952695111434253">Zumstein-Preiswerk, 1975</xref>). His work bears witness to a typical way of thinking of the early representatives of psychoanalysis and psychology, in which the psychological interpretation of mediumistic performances concluded with the postulation of unconscious processes and automatisms.</p>
<p>Similarly to Jung, Ferenczi attributed special psychological significance to the subject of spiritualistic phenomena. In his article ‘Spiritism’ he encouraged systematic investigations in the field of spiritualism:<disp-quote>
<p>Therefore the antagonists of spiritism should not use denial before, or without investigation in their crusade. They should devote themselves to the investigation of the claimed facts with the same objectivity that characterizes science in other fields. They should not shrink from sitting down at the moving table or from visiting spiritistic gatherings of lay people. After all, from the sociological point of view alone, the subject is important enough to attract the attention of the best minds. Let them take with themselves the arsenal of science, let them organize experimental seances, observe, rule out intentional deception and decide how much is delusion and how much is truth.</p>
<p>Even though their findings may not establish the objectivity of spiritualistic claims, subjective findings of truth would certainly be made. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0952695111434253">Ferenczi, 1963[1899]</xref>: 143)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>As did many of his other contemporaries, Ferenczi supposed that spiritualistic phenomena were based on the split of psychological functions or automatisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0952695111434253">Janet, 1930</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0952695111434253">Jung, 1916[1902]</xref>). Therefore they refer to a hidden, subconscious functioning of the psyche, which could have exceptionally important scientific significance. Although his views on the subject are rather general and introductory, they reflect the main interests of the young Ferenczi: the border zones of science and the automatic or unconscious functioning of the psyche.</p>
<p>It is worth mentioning that his article on ‘Spiritism’ was the result of Ferenczi’s openness to accept the reality of spiritualistic phenomena: in the early years of his career he conducted several experiments with automatic writing. It was the ‘pencil’s idea’ to write an article on spiritualism and send it to Miksa Schächter, who was the editor of a well-known Hungarian medical journal, <italic>Gyógyászat</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0952695111434253">Ferenczi, 1917</xref>). The fact that Ferenczi followed the advice of the pencil proves that he was not sceptical towards spiritualistic occurrences, although a kind of playfulness characterized him. The above-mentioned experiments with automatic writing were not the only sign of Ferenczi’s interest in spiritualism; he published valuable reviews on issues of psychical research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0952695111434253">Ferenczi, 1900a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0952695111434253">1900b</xref>). As his later works illuminate, Ferenczi was obviously not a spiritualist, but to a certain degree he was open to accepting the non-materialistic reality of spiritualistic phenomena, which he tried to interpret with psychological concepts.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0952695111434253">
<title>Telepathy experiments</title>
<p>Although Ferenczi was not an active member of the Society for Psychical Research (he was an associate of the society from 1911), in his psychoanalytic practice he conducted several experiments with mediums and clairvoyants. In these investigations he followed the objectivity of psychical researchers, trying to find a scientific interpretation for the phenomena (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0952695111434253">Brabant, Falzeder and Giampieri-Deutsch, 1993</xref>). His enthusiasm was a determining factor in his telepathy experiments from the beginning, and, as a result, he never gave up seeking evidence concerning the reality of the seemingly supernatural phenomena. His primary aim was to convince sceptical others, especially Freud, of the existence of telepathy; their correspondence bears witness to his efforts.</p>
<p>In his letters, Ferenczi regularly gave accounts of his results, and it seems that Freud – in spite of his scepticism – was almost as interested in the question as his disciple. However, Freud tried to hold Ferenczi back from publishing the results of his experiments. He was worrying about the consequences of such a publication concerning the often-questioned scientific image of psychoanalysis. In the scientific legitimation of psychoanalysis, its materialist principles, especially the theory of sexuality, played an extraordinary role, due to which – instead of the critiques and the attacks on psychoanalysis – the Freudian theory could become a part of science. Freud was aware of the special significance of the theory of sexuality. It was Jung himself who summarized the role that Freud intended to give to it:<disp-quote>
<p>I can still recall vividly how Freud said to me, ‘My dear Jung, promise me never to abandon the sexual theory. That is the most essential thing of all. You see we must make a dogma of it, an unshakable bulwark’. He said that to me with great emotion, in the tone of a father saying, ‘And promise me this one thing, my dear son: that you will go to church every Sunday’. In some astonishment I asked him, ‘A bulwark – against what?’ To which he replied, ‘Against the black tide of mud’ – and here he hesitated for a moment, then added – ‘of occultism’. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0952695111434253">Jung, 1993[1961]</xref>: 173)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Thus the theory of sexuality guaranteed the scientific nature of psychoanalysis and protected it from the suspicion of occultism.</p>
<p>It must be added that Freud was not so cautious in the case of his own observations on the subject of telepathy; during his career he wrote numerous articles and lectures on the problem (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0952695111434253">Devereux, 1953</xref>). Despite the efforts of his biographer, Ernest <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0952695111434253">Jones (1957</xref>), Freud was rather open to connecting psychoanalysis with the question of telepathy, but in doing so, he always focused on the psychoanalytic and not the spiritualistic significance of the phenomena.</p>
<p>However, Freud’s aim and Ferenczi’s aim were identical: to understand the functioning of telepathy and use this understanding in the analysis of the human psyche. Freud himself – who was much more cautious in this question than his innovative disciples, Jung and Ferenczi – used his observations on the functioning of telepathy in order to reinforce psychoanalytic theory. In his early writings on the subject he debunked apparent telepathic occurrences in the same way as psychoanalysis did with every kind of supernatural belief system, religion and symptom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0952695111434253">Freud, 1953a[1904]</xref>). Later he admitted that telepathic phenomena could exist in some way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0952695111434253">Brabant, Falzeder and Giampieri-Deutsch, 1993</xref>: 211; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0952695111434253">Jones, 1957</xref>). It is important to note that the question of telepathy was the only manifestation of the supernatural whose existence was accepted by Freud: the only exception that was seemingly opposed to the materialistic, rationalistic approach of psychoanalysis. However, Freud supposed that telepathy could have a physical basis, and worked similarly to the functioning of the telephone or the telegraph (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0952695111434253">Freud, 1953d[1933]</xref>). From this point of view he disconnected the concept of telepathy from the supernatural and the spiritual, and considered it as any other psychological or physical problem. In this way he maintained the framework of psychoanalysis in which superstitious beliefs and all apparently supernatural phenomena were debunked by psychoanalytic, materialistic terms. It must be added that the above-mentioned efforts of Freud could have been connected with the fear and the repression of his own superstitious beliefs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0952695111434253">Jones, 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0952695111434253">Roustang, 1983</xref>). Several sources underlie the fact that in his private life Freud was not so sceptical towards the so-called occult and he himself was also characterized by some superstitious beliefs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0952695111434253">Freud, 1953e[1919]</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0952695111434253">Jones, 1957</xref>).</p>
<p>It is not accidental that the problem of telepathy became an attractive field of research for many psychoanalysts. Among the different subjects that psychical researchers were interested in, telepathy was the only one that proved to be really relevant for the psychoanalysts. The reason for that was the strong connection between telepathy and the psychoanalytical situation (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0952695111434253">Forrester, 1990</xref>). Later some psychoanalysts realized that telepathic processes were strongly connected with the healing relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0952695111434253">Deutsch, 1926</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0952695111434253">Hollós, 1933</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0952695111434253">Servadio, 1956</xref>). They supposed that the increased sensitivity, which characterizes the therapeutic rapport, could be the source of telepathy or thought-transference. Furthermore they suspected that the telepathic message functions similarly to any other manifestation of unconscious processes and contents; according to their own observations telepathic messages reflected the subjects’ preconscious or unconscious complexes and belonged to the realm of primary processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0952695111434253">Hollós, 1933</xref>). Thus they declared telepathy as an important field of psychoanalytical investigation, similar to neurotic symptoms or dreams.</p>
<p>When Ferenczi started to investigate so-called spiritualistic phenomena, psychoanalysis was only a nascent theory. After some lay observations in the field of spiritualism, he started to conduct scientific experiments with a few promising mediums. The first step in Ferenczi’s telepathy experiments was his investigation with Frau Seidler, the divinator from Berlin. Although Frau Seidler showed extraordinary talent in reading unopened letters, when Ferenczi tried to convince Freud of the significance of her gifts he had to face the resistance of his master. Freud was truly unconvinced of her abilities. As a result of this, Ferenczi had to find new subjects for the experiments. The Hungarian somnambulist Frau Jelinek was his second subject, who was unfortunately also unable to make a reliable impression on Freud (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0952695111434253">Brabant, Falzeder and Giampieri-Deutsch, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, Ferenczi made great discoveries with a homosexual, masochistic patient, who often referred to Ferenczi’s hidden thoughts in his free associations. This case proved to be convincing for Freud too, who abandoned his scepticism as a result of Ferenczi’s account:<disp-quote>
<p>Your – carefully preserved – observations on your masochist seem to me finally to shatter the doubts about the existence of thought-transference. Now it is a matter of getting used to it in your thoughts and losing respect for its novelty, and also preserving the secret long enough in the maternal womb, but that is where the doubt ends.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0952695111434253">3</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>From this time on Ferenczi started to broaden the circle of investigations; he made observations on several of his patients and even with his fiancée, Gizella. However, his most successful experiments were those that he conducted with his homosexual patient. It slowly became clear to him that the process of telepathy was strongly connected with the transference situation. In 1910 he told Freud of his discovery:<disp-quote>
<p>Interesting news in the transference story. Imagine, I am a great soothsayer, that is to say, a reader of thoughts! I am reading my patients’ thoughts (in my free associations). The future methodology of ΨA must make use of this. … This method will be suitable to catch the patient’s most active complexes at work. – It can be refined even more! When I come to Vienna, I will introduce myself as ‘court astrologer of the psychoanalysts’.<sup>

</p>
<p>Although Freud shared Ferenczi’s enthusiasm, his constant cautions bore witness to his basic ambivalence towards the question of telepathy. In 1910 Freud asked Ferenczi not to publish his results till 1913:<disp-quote>
<p>I see destiny approaching inexorably, and I note that it has designated you to bring to light mysticism and the like, and that it would be just as futile as it is hard-hearted to keep you from it. Still, I think we ought to venture to slow it down. I would like to request that you continue to research in secrecy for two full years and don’t come out until 1913; then, certainly, in the Jahrbuch, openly and aboveboard. You know my practical reasons against it and my secret painful sensitivities.<sup>

</p>
<p>Ferenczi was obedient to his master and waited patiently. However, he did not publish his results in 1913. He only gave a paper to the Viennese Psychoanalytic Society, in which he summarized his experiences on thought-transference. His presentation was based on his telepathy experiments with the mediums Mr and Mrs Roth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0952695111434253">Nunberg and Federn, 1975</xref>: 215), but his results remained questionable for the audience. As a result of his failures to convince sceptical others, especially Freud, the problem of telepathy became less articulated in his letters and writings.</p>

<title>The interpretation of thought-transference</title>
<p>Ferenczi had many different ideas on the possible basis of telepathic processes, but unfortunately none of them was well elaborated. Rather, they were flexible ideas and meaningful observations, which outlined the later trends of research in this field of psychoanalysis. The core of his interpretation was his theory of introjection and projection, the processes that underlie the development of inner and outer reality and the boundaries of the self (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0952695111434253">Ferenczi, 2002a[1909]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0952695111434253">1995[1932]</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0952695111434253">Thurschwell, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0952695111434253">2001</xref>). On the basis of these ideas, in 1910 he concluded the following: anxiety reinforces the productivity of sending telepathic messages, while the calm state of mind increases the capacity for receiving telepathic messages. Furthermore, the receiver reacts unconsciously to thought-transference, and activates those unconscious complexes that are closer to the unconscious complexes of the sender. The summation of personal complexes and the tendency of projection create the transference phenomena, which, depending on the predominance of introjection or projection, incline the individual to receive or send telepathic messages: ‘the paranoid is inclined toward projection and complex emanation, the hysteric toward introjection and complex resonance’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0952695111434253">6</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Ferenczi says much more about the supposed mechanisms of thought-transference in his last work, the <italic>Clinical Diary</italic> (1995[1932]). Placing the healing process on a metaphysical level, he speaks about a non-verbal healing force of the libido, which is based on the mysterious interconnectedness of the healer’s and the patient’s unconscious (ibid.: 42). According to Ferenczi, it is possible to react or resonate to somebody else’s unconscious complexes, feelings, or thoughts in an unconscious way, which remains on the level of primary processes. The mysterious coincidences and telepathic occurrences are the manifestations of these hidden and latent perceptions and reactions.</p>
<p>This interconnectedness proved to be an exceptionally useful notion in the interpretation of telepathy; later several psychoanalysts, such as István <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0952695111434253">Hollós (1933</xref>), Mihály <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0952695111434253">Bálint (1955</xref>) and Nándor Fodor<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0952695111434253">7</xref>
</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0952695111434253">Fodor, 1947</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0952695111434253">Carrington and Fodor, 1953</xref>), applied this idea in their psychoanalytically oriented theories of telepathy. Among these interpreters the problem of telepathy became a real psychoanalytic problem that was also as significant as any other aspect of the therapeutic situation. Not only was the psychoanalytic meaning of psychical phenomena searched by them, but the special connection between psychoanalytic transference and telepathy. According to Hollós and Bálint, telepathic occurrences develop in strong transference situations, in which the patient’s past experiences are confused with the present situation and with the perception of the analyst. In Ferenczi’s view transference and counter-transference were based on introjective and projective processes, in which the inner and the outer psychological contents could be changed and confused. Based on the special sensitivity that characterizes transference situations not only did the transference of attitudes and emotions become theoretically possible, but also the transference of thoughts.</p>
<p>According to another of Ferenczi’s ideas, the increased sensitivity, which characterizes some mental illnesses, could also be the key to telepathic capacities. In 1932 he wrote the following:<disp-quote>
<p>From the very beginning I was inclined to think, that the hallucinations of the insane, or at least a part of them, are not imaginings but real perceptions, stemming from the environment and from the psyches of other human beings, which are accessible for them – precisely because of their psychologically motivated hypersensitivity – whereas normal people, focusing only on immediate matters of direct concern to them, remain unaffected. What comes to mind in this connection is the so-called occult powers of certain people, and the close relationship and easy transition between the two states: paranoia and psychic superperformance. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0952695111434253">Ferenczi, 1995[1932]</xref>: 58)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Elsewhere he connects this increased sensitivity to the state of ‘dissolution’ of the infantile psyche; from his point of view, this form of the psyche is much closer to the cosmic universe than is the developed adult psyche. Therefore the abilities of mediums and supernormal qualities in general can be traced back to the wisdom and knowledge of children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0952695111434253">Ferenczi, 1995[1932]</xref>: 100–1). Later he interprets mediumism in terms of certain increased olfactory capacities that serve as the psycho-physiological explanation of mediumistic phenomena. According to this:<disp-quote>
<p>A great deal of what has been regarded up to now as occult, or as a metaphysical superperformance, would thus become explicable in psycho-physiological terms. A further and still bolder step would then lead to the performances of spiritualist mediums, who can sense a person’s total emanations, as they continue vibrating somewhere in space, even across the limitless passage of ages. (As a dog might [sense] the footprints of its deceased master.) Spiritualist mediums therefore reconstruct, with the aid of their sense of smell, a person’s past. They may, aided by their olfactory imagination, follow a person back into the most distant past, to all the places he stayed in the course of his life. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0952695111434253">Ferenczi, 1995[1932]</xref>: 88)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>It seems that some of Ferenczi’s ideas on the interpretation of telepathy and mediumistic phenomena were based on purely psychoanalytical terms, while others – especially those that emerged at the end of his life – referred to a sort of spiritual understanding of the human psyche, in which the boundaries of the self and the body are flexible and undefined. In both cases, the connection between his interest in telepathy and psychoanalysis is rather obvious: it is about the unknown, hidden, unconscious capacity of the psyche, which serves not only the demystification of seemingly supernatural phenomena, but also the verification of the psychoanalytic theory of the unconscious. In this context, the existence of the human capacity to transfer thoughts bears witness to the hidden forces of the psyche; these forces are different from normal perception and cognition, and they refer to a radically different quality. The verification of such a different quality leads necessarily to the psychoanalytic concept of the unconscious for Ferenczi. From this point of view, Ferenczi’s ideas on telepathy are a typical manifestation of psychoanalytical thinking, according to which every apparently mysterious or supernatural phenomenon can be understood and illuminated by using the theory of the unconscious, which explains them. However, he attributes further characteristics to the psychoanalytic concept of the unconscious. In Ferenczi’s interpretations on telepathy the unconscious is not a fixed intrapsychical entity, but a dynamic factor that is able to transgress the boundaries of the personal psyche.</p>
<p>It is also clear that Ferenczi’s experiences in the field of psychical research are rather sporadic, and his theories on the subject are obviously unelaborated. Despite the fact that he was open to the possibility of psychical occurrences, he was a psychoanalyst at heart, and his primary field of interest was the psychoanalytical understanding of the human psyche. On the other hand, a significant part of his ideas on the possible functioning of telepathy emerged in connection with his ideas on transference and counter-transference. In this sense his experiences with telepathy are important supplements of his innovations. They refer to the changing and flexible borders of the human psyche that were the centre of transference phenomena, introjection and projection in Ferenczi’s thinking. Taking into account all these facts, it is not surprising that some experts consider Ferenczi’s psychical researcher activities outstanding and especially significant.</p>

<sec id="section4-0952695111434253">
<title>Why was Ferenczi ‘one of the most adventurous speculative researchers’ of the SPR?</title>
<p>In 1933, John Rickman, the English psychoanalyst and psychical researcher, wrote an enthusiastic obituary of Ferenczi in the <italic>Proceedings of the Society for Psychical Research</italic>. The obituary is surprising since Rickman claims that Ferenczi was ‘one of the most adventurous speculative researchers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0952695111434253">Rickman, 1933</xref>: 124) of the Society for Psychical Research, whose death is an enormous loss to the society. In the introduction to the obituary Rickman sets Ferenczi’s psychical researcher activity in a radically new light:<disp-quote>
<p>For over 30 years he published (first in Hungarian, later in German and English) papers on the phenomena of mental energy expressing itself in physical forms, the expression of instinctual longings in alterations of physiological states. The factors which lead to the employment of unusual physical means of expression were on the whole of less interest to him than the mechanisms of such ‘conversions from psychical to somatic’ spheres, so he stood midway between the group of workers whose main interest is the effect of anxiety and guilt in mental life (the present-day tendency in psycho-analysis) and those whose work lies more especially in the descriptive field of psychical research. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0952695111434253">Rickman, 1933</xref>: 124)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Rickman’s claim that Ferenczi was primarily interested in the conversions from psychical to somatic spheres seems to verify the significance of Ferenczi as a psychical researcher. In ‘The Phenomena of Hysterical Materialization’ (1926[1919]) Ferenczi expressed himself clearly on the matter. In this paper he points to the identity of the materialization phenomena in hysteria and mediumism. Although he does not delve into the problem of mediumistic materialization phenomena, it is rather clear that he was well aware of the potential significance of his ideas for psychical researchers.</p>
<p>According to Rickman, Ferenczi’s most important work in the field of psychical research was his article on the ‘Stages in the Development of the Sense of Reality’ (2002b[1913]):<disp-quote>
<p>His most important contributions bearing on psychical research lay in his stimulating papers on ‘The Development of the Sense of Reality’, in which he showed how the child’s developing perception of the external world is a slow relinquishing of phantasies and again how these phantasies are based on the child’s notion of himself. In line with these researches are his penetrating observations on the way in which the mind, to conceal from itself its own defencelessness in the presence of what is felt to be overwhelming and disruptive internal excitement, either attributes to the external world what really belongs within itself or attributes to itself what is really external. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0952695111434253">Rickman, 1933</xref>: 124)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>From Rickman’s point of view, the most significant aspect of the article is Ferenczi’s attempt to grasp the development of the sense of reality in the interconnectedness of inner and outer reality. According to this, the infantile psyche is the source of outer reality just as outer reality is the source of the infantile psyche, since in the chain of introjections and projections the difference between the inner and the outer, the self and the non-self, is lost. What the child projects from itself becomes the so-called outer reality later. Ferenczi illuminates this early process in his paper ‘Introjection and Transference’ (2002a[1909]):<disp-quote>
<p>We may suppose that to the new-born child everything perceived by the senses appears unitary, so to speak monistic. Only later does he learn to distinguish from his ego the malicious things, forming an outer world, that do not obey his will. That would be the first projection process, the primordial projection, and the later paranoiac probably makes use of the path thus traced out, in order to expel still more of his ego into the outer world. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0952695111434253">Ferenczi, 2002a[1909]</xref>: 48)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Not only the newborn child and the paranoiac are characterized by introjective or projective processes. To a certain degree every human psyche is built upon introjective and projective processes that create the inner subjective and the outer objective reality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0952695111434253">Ferenczi, 2002a[1909]</xref>). Although this idea can fertilize some theoretical branches of psychical research, remaining in the psychoanalytic framework, Ferenczi does not intend to touch on the question of psychical phenomena, but to describe a purely psychological process. However, it is probable that the psychoanalytically committed Rickman identified the functioning of introjective and projective processes with parapsychological phenomena. Since Rickman knew Ferenczi very well – he was a patient and disciple of his – the misunderstanding of Ferenczi’s works is rather improbable. By the concepts of introjection and projection Ferenczi created a potential bridge between psychoanalysis and psychical research; although this bridge was not strong enough to generate remarkable cooperation, for those psychical researchers who were committed to psychoanalysis it proved to be significant.</p>
<p>It must be added that analysing the magical phase of development, Ferenczi referred to the possibility of telepathy in one of the footnotes of his article on ‘Stages in the Development of the Sense of Reality’: ‘The psychological explanation of “magic” naturally does not exclude the possibility of this belief containing also the foreshadowing of physical facts (telepathy, etc.)’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0952695111434253">Ferenczi, 2002b[1913]</xref>: 230). Although his words are not really illuminating concerning his views on the connection between the development of the sense of reality and telepathy, by his remark he connected his psychoanalytical interpretation to the realm of psychical research. This remark is a typical example of the interconnectedness of Ferenczi’s views on telepathy and his innovations. Psychical phenomena were not the focus of his theories, but by referring to them Ferenczi gave a supplementary meaning of his theories by which psychical phenomena could have been understood in a psychoanalytic framework.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0952695111434253">
<title>‘Ferenczi’s evil genius’</title>
<p>It seems very likely that Ferenczi’s famous patient Elizabeth Severn (RN) also played a fundamental role in the evolution of Ferenczi’s ideas on telepathy. Severn, labelled by Freud ‘Ferenczi’s evil genius’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0952695111434253">Jones, 1957</xref>: 407), had been Ferenczi’s patient and disciple for the last 8 years of his life. Taking into account the content of Ferenczi’s later works and Severn’s works on psychology and psychoanalysis, it is rather clear that they influenced each other not only on a psychoanalytical and emotional, but also on a theoretical level. The theory of mutual analysis was the result of this cooperation.</p>
<p>It is also likely that Severn’s spiritualistic, mystical approach, which characterized her all of her life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0952695111434253">Fortune, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0952695111434253">1996</xref>), influenced Ferenczi. Although Severn was genuinely interested in psychoanalysis, in her own psychoanalytical theories she broadened the limits of psychoanalysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0952695111434253">Severn, 1919</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0952695111434253">1933</xref>). The centre of Severn’s thinking was a non-psychoanalytical concept of the self, which had very clear spiritualistic connotations. In her book <italic>The Discovery of the Self</italic> (1933) she identified the self as follows: the self is<disp-quote>
<p>… the living, governing principle in man, the soul or mind which animates and gives meaning to all that he is and does. It is not only the ‘little I’, the mere surface manifestation with which we are all more or less familiar, but a vital and integrating principle consisting of various and dynamic forces, which in their entirety make up the individual or Ego. It is the ‘big I’, which having its roots not only in us but in the Cosmos, gives us intimations from time to time of vast processes, high aims, and even immortality. This internal entity is the representative of our higher or spiritual destinies, and is what gives significance to our whole existence. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0952695111434253">Severn, 1933</xref>: 8)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Despite the cosmic connotations of the self, Severn used psychoanalytic concepts for the description of the psyche: thus her theory became a mixture of mystical and psychoanalytic ideas. According to Severn the real core of the personality is not instinctual life but the above-described cosmic self. She united the materialistic and idealistic interpretations of life for the purpose of a new psychological science. In this new psychological approach, the body and the soul were interconnected; furthermore, the unconscious controlled all the physiological processes of the body.</p>
<p>She also criticized the rigidity of the classical psychoanalytical technique; according to her, the whole framework of psychoanalysis was too mechanistic and asymmetric. In contrast, she emphasized the necessity of love; in her view the psychoanalyst has to be a parent, a better parent than the original one, who failed to support his or her child in the past. She also rejected the obligatory neutrality of the psychoanalyst; instead of this she considered empathic feedback and emotional support fundamental.</p>
<p>It is obvious that the emphasizing of love and an empathic maternal attitude in the psychoanalytic situation is the same idea that characterized Ferenczi in his last years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0952695111434253">Ferenczi, 1980a[1928]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0952695111434253">1995[1932]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0952695111434253">1980b[1932]</xref>). Their critiques of psychoanalysis are identical. It is likely that their conceptions emerged during their mutual analysis; however, it is still not clear who was the real source of these innovative ideas.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, taking into account the non-materialistic approach that characterized Ferenczi’s later works, it is likely that the spiritualistic ideas of Severn played an important role in her relationship with Ferenczi, who was rather open to Severn’s mystical beliefs. According to her, clairvoyance, precognition, or telepathy serves as an obvious proof for the unconscious dimensions of the psyche. In her understanding, telepathy is nothing other than the natural ability of the unconscious, which must be known and practised. Her ideas on the therapeutic significance of telepathy are also remarkable: in her opinion the psychotherapist is able to intrude into the psyche of the patient and thus create an identity between himself or herself and the sufferer. Although Severn does not use the word ‘telepathy’ for this kind of relationship, it is evident that her ideas concerning this special identity are based on the functioning of telepathic processes. In this state of ‘psychical transfusion’ there is no distance between the patient and the therapist; therefore they share the same knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0952695111434253">Severn, 1933</xref>: 223).</p>
<p>Severn’s efforts to unite metaphysics and psychoanalysis were not fruitless. Partly thanks to her the psychical researcher Nándor Fodor turned to psychoanalysis and later he became one of the most prominent representatives of psychoanalytically interpreted psychical research. Ferenczi’s influence on her theories is undeniable; it is also likely that Severn’s mystical-spiritualistic approach impressed Ferenczi. Their later theories are the result of this cooperation, in which the materialist background of psychoanalysis was replaced by a cosmic, mystical interpretation of the psyche.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0952695111434253">
<title>Psychical research in psychoanalysis</title>
<p>Although Ferenczi’s ideas on the functioning of telepathy were not developed theories, they were undoubtedly interconnected with his innovative ideas. His interpretations on telepathy illuminated a supplementary meaning of transference, introjection and projection, in which he transgressed the boundaries of the classical theory of psychoanalysis and developed a more permeable concept of the human psyche. From this point of view, it was not accidental that Ferenczi devoted an article to spiritualism in the first years of his psychological career. His interest in spiritualistic phenomena referred to the problem of psychological reality that he later interpreted by psychoanalytic terms. In this way his experiences and views on telepathy were integrated in his psychoanalytic theories. Although his ideas on telepathy were not elaborated, the analysis of his interpretations proves that the core of his views on telepathy was his innovative theory on the flexible borders of the human psyche, introjection and projection. The problem of telepathy became the problem of inner subjective and outer objective reality in his view.</p>
<p>The influence of Ferenczi’s interest in telepathy was not manifested in spiritualistic views or mystical beliefs, but in those technical considerations that manifested themselves in connection with his ideas on telepathy. Based on his views on the permeability and sensitivity of the human psyche Ferenczi developed a more emotional, symmetrical and intuitive technique, in which the possibility of telepathic processes was also accepted. Taking into account the theoretical interconnectedness of Ferenczi’s theories of telepathy and psychoanalytical innovations, it can be pointed out that the idea of the permeability of the psyche, which proved to be fundamental in Ferenczi’s ideas of telepathy, fertilized Ferenczi’s thinking and served as a basis for his greatest innovations, such as his unique view of transference and counter-transference. According to the latter the psychoanalyst’s reactions and emotions are not avoidable artefacts of the psychoanalytic situation, but valuable and useful elements that create a more symmetric position in therapy. In this position the therapist is also unconsciously involved in the psychoanalytic situation. His or her thoughts and emotions are potentially shareable on a conscious or unconscious level. Not only was the theory of mutual analysis developed on this basis, but also the theory of unconscious, telepathic communication. Following the footsteps of Ferenczi, Mihály Bálint describes very clearly the psychoanalytic significance of telepathy in psychoanalysis:<disp-quote>
<p>These dynamic relations between transference and counter-transference are, I think, important <italic>contributory factors</italic> in provoking apparently parapsychological phenomena during analytical treatment. … If I am right, the crux of this involved relationship is the handling of the analyst’s counter-transference, especially the problem of how much and which side of this counter-transference should be openly admitted, communicated, or ‘interpreted’ to the patient. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0952695111434253">Bálint, 1955</xref>: 33)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>According to Bálint – who developed his ideas following Hollós’ theory on the telepathic occurrences in psychoanalysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0952695111434253">Hollós, 1933</xref>) – telepathic experiences occur in ambivalent and stressful analytic situations, when the analyst is unable to focus on the patient. However, because of technical reasons, the analyst decides to maintain the ‘façade of “professional hypocrisy”, i.e. to pretend that all his interest and attention are still focused on the patient’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0952695111434253">Bálint, 1955</xref>: 33). The patient’s telepathic sensitivity is a reaction to the analyst’s professional hypocrisy. It is easy to identify the influence of Ferenczi on Bálint’s theory; the emphasis of counter-transference, sensitivity and the more symmetrical analytical situation refers to the innovative thoughts of Ferenczi.</p>
<p>It is not by accident that Ferenczi’s fragmented ideas influenced so many psychoanalysts later. István Hollós developed his theory of telepathic occurrences between the patient and the analyst on the basis of Ferenczi’s chance remark on the interconnectedness of the patient’s and the analyst’s unconscious (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0952695111434253">Hollós, 1933</xref>). This idea and Hollós’ theory proved to be significant in the works of Jule <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0952695111434253">Eisenbud (1970</xref>), Emilio <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0952695111434253">Servadio (1956</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0952695111434253">1963</xref>) and Jan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0952695111434253">Ehrenwald (1947</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0952695111434253">1954</xref>), who all tried to interpret the problem of telepathy and other psychical phenomena by using psychoanalytic theory. By doing so they developed similar concepts on the flexibility and the sensitivity of the human psyche and the nature of the psychoanalytical situation as Ferenczi did. Nándor Fodor, the great Hungarian representative of psychical research and psychoanalysis, also knew Ferenczi and his theories, and partly as a result of his acquaintance with Elizabeth Severn, he developed a truly innovative way of psychoanalytical understanding of psychical phenomena (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0952695111434253">Fodor, 1934</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0952695111434253">1959</xref>). His ideas on the parapsychological aspects of the psychoanalytic situation are much closer to the psychoanalysis of Ferenczi than to the psychoanalysis of Freud, which means that the integration of telepathy within psychoanalysis required very similar technical innovations that were present in Ferenczi. Taking into account the widespread effects of Ferenczi’s fragmented theories it cannot be accidental that John Rickman considers Ferenczi ‘one of the most adventurous speculative researchers’ of the Society for Psychical Research. Not only his articulated ideas influenced the professional development of the above-mentioned scholars, but the whole of Ferenczi’s psychoanalysis, in which the flexibility of the boundaries of the psyche, its supposed permeability, the fundamental processes of introjection and projection, all refer to a great potential of psychical processes.</p>
<p>It is to be regretted that in spite of the efforts of several psychical researchers and psychoanalysts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0952695111434253">Carrington and Fodor, 1953</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0952695111434253">Mitchell, 1918</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0952695111434253">1938</xref>), psychoanalytic ideas were not really applied in the field of psychical research. It is true that the rather complicated and often questioned scientific status of psychoanalysis made the desired cooperation with psychical research difficult. On the other hand, psychoanalysts also found it risky to undertake any significant connection or collaboration with the representatives of psychical research. Taking into account that several critiques of psychoanalysis tried to identify Freud’s system with a sort of occult system, psychoanalysis had to distance itself from every kind of philosophy and practice that could have been connected with the so-called occult. In the eyes of Freud and his followers psychical research had strong connections with those occult and spiritualist practices and philosophies which they tried to demarcate from their own system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0952695111434253">Jones, 1957</xref>). However, it is rather obvious that psychoanalysis was never as far from the ‘black tide of mud’ of occultism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0952695111434253">Jung, 1993[1961]</xref>: 173) as some representatives of it, especially Ernest Jones, wanted it to be. Ferenczi’s works bear witness to this latent interconnectedness. Thus Ferenczi’s thoughts on telepathy illuminate both the relevance of psychical research to psychoanalysis and the relevance of psychoanalysis to psychical research.</p>
