<p>Marxist scholars have long contended with the repeated critiques of Eurocentrism directed toward the work of Karl Marx; critiques which have been vigorously defended and at least partially justified in the context of Marx’s canonical works. However, Kevin B. Anderson, author of <italic>Marx at the Margins: On Nationalism, Ethnicity, and Non-Western Societies</italic>, provides us with an alternative perspective that suggests Marx’s theoretical engagement with non-Western societies was robust, and furthermore, that this very engagement reveals a more complex and ambivalent conceptualization of Marx’s understanding of historical processes than originally conceived in works such as <italic>The Communist Manifesto</italic>. For Anderson’s goal in this text is manifold; on the one hand he seeks to demonstrate Marx’s evolving perspective on capitalist and socialist development, while on the other, he is responding to the view that Marx exhibited ethnocentric notions of civilization in his analysis of capitalist development and colonialism. In the end, however, these goals coalesce into a novel and convincing argument regarding a mature Marx’s multi-linear perspective on capitalist and socialist development which incorporates such non-class phenomenon as racism and/or nationalism in the formation of multiple developmental trajectories.</p>
<p>As Anderson notes, the younger Marx held that the advancement of capitalism (and thus, civilization) occurred through the assimilation and modernization of non-Western societies as a consequence of colonization and integration into the global economy. This presented a unilinear notion of development based upon a multi-stage advancement through different modes of production, eventually culminating in a socialist system. Alongside this notion, one can also see an important emphasis placed specifically on the capitalist mode of production, especially when viewed alongside the introduction to <italic>The Communist Manifesto</italic> and an article that Marx wrote for the <italic>New York Daily Tribune</italic> in 1853 entitled “The British Rule in India” in which Marx suggests that the British colonization and destruction of previous community forms was a necessary step in the path to real social revolution. Anderson is able to demonstrate, though, that Marx began to alter his perspective on “Oriental despotism” to one which sought to examine the revolutionary potential of various non-capitalist regions, including through the possible circumvention of the development of a capitalist mode of production in the process of societal evolution.</p>
<p>Anderson has devoted a substantial amount of effort analyzing some of the “secondary” writings of Marx (and Friedrich Engels, though to a lesser extent) from various sources, such as pieces from Marx’s time as the European correspondent for the <italic>New York Daily Tribune</italic>, letters, and research notes, some of which remained unpublished at the time of Anderson’s writing. <italic>Marx at the Margins</italic> is organized into six chapters (not including the introduction and conclusion), the first four of which are devoted to an analysis of Marx’s writings on various non-Western or non-capitalist societies, including: the colonial situations in India, China, and Indonesia (Chapter One); Russia and Poland (Chapter Two); the American Civil War (Chapter Three); and the state of Irish independence (Chapter Four). Chapter Five links the changes in Marx’s perspective to his work on <italic>The Grundrisse</italic> and Volume One of <italic>Capital</italic>, while Chapter Six goes over the later writings of Marx on non-Western societies (written between the late 1870s and his death in 1883).</p>
<p>By exploring Marx’s writings within their historical context, Anderson is quite successful in demonstrating his arguments concerning the development of Marx’s thought. This exploration of lesser-known writings is fascinating in and of itself, while the implications for Marxist social theory remain to be seen. Thus, this book is recommended for Marxist scholars and those with an interest in the history of sociology generally, especially given the ways in which Anderson is able to shed new light on Marx’s own work. Because of the typical range of canonical writings that are read by graduate and undergraduate students studying classical social theory, this book would also be an excellent companion to any course that deals with Marx in any sustained fashion.</p>
