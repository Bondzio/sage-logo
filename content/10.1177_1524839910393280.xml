<abstract>
<p>Healthy Opportunities for Preschoolers (HOP) is a physical activity and movement skill intervention that was developed to address the unique needs of home-based child care providers. The authors used a train-the-trainer approach to enhance local uptake and implementation of HOP and examined the impact on the trainers’ (workshop leaders’) perceived knowledge, confidence, and intention to implement community workshops and subsequently on the knowledge, confidence, and intentions of workshop participants. This study also assessed feasibility: reach, satisfaction, and facilitators and barriers to workshop implementation. Overall, 92% and 89.5% of the leaders were very or extremely satisfied with the workshop content and delivery, respectively. Training significantly increased their self-reported knowledge (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and confidence (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Subsequently, 73% of workshop participants (48 workshops, <italic>n</italic> = 321) took part in the evaluation; intention to use what they learned after the workshop was high (86%) and perceived knowledge, confidence, and attitude all increased significantly (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). The HOP train-the-trainer approach was feasible and enhanced knowledge, confidence, and readiness to change among home-based child care providers. This approach should be considered as a component of an overall strategy to enhance the promotion of physical activity and movement skills in home-based child care settings.</p>

<p>Family child care occurs in a home setting; where typically one adult cares for seven or fewer children younger than 12 years at one time. Approximately 60% of children younger than 6 years receive nonrelative care in Canada and the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1524839910393280">Doherty, Lero, Goelman, Tougas, &amp; LaGrange, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1524839910393280">U.S. Department of Education, n.d</xref>.) and family child care is the second most common form of nonrelative care. This type of child care has been associated with varied provision of opportunities for physical activity. Differences have been noted in relation to the adequacy of play spaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1524839910393280">O’Connor &amp; Temple, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1524839910393280">Temple &amp; O’Connor, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1524839910393280">Trost, Messner, Fitzgerald, &amp; Roths, 2009</xref>), time spent watching TV and videos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1524839910393280">Trost et al., 2009</xref>), time spent outdoors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1524839910393280">O’Connor &amp; Temple, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1524839910393280">Temple &amp; O’Connor, 2004</xref>); as well as care providers’ level of training and their attitudes toward physical activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1524839910393280">O’Connor &amp; Temple, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1524839910393280">Temple &amp; O’Connor, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1524839910393280">Trost et al., 2009</xref>). Evidence derived from 297 registered family child care homes in the United States suggests that the use of TV and video games throughout the day is widespread, that physical activity is withdrawn from children as a behavior management technique, and that a majority of care providers have not participated in workshops/training in physical activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1524839910393280">Trost et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Expert consensus suggests that preschool-aged children should accumulate several hours of physical activity per day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1524839910393280">National Association for Sport and Physical Education, 2009</xref>) and that screen time should be limited to less than 2 hours per day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1524839910393280">American Academy of Pediatrics, 2006</xref>). However, children in family child care are often sedentary and are not achieving anywhere near the recommended amount of physically active play (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1524839910393280">Temple, Naylor, Rhodes, &amp; Wharf Higgins, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1524839910393280">Trost et al., 2009</xref>). In group child care contexts, aspects of the physical and social environment are powerful predictors of children’s physical activity and sedentary behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1524839910393280">Brown et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1524839910393280">Dowda, Pate, Trost, Almeida, &amp; Sirard, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1524839910393280">Pate, Pfeiffer, Trost, Ziegler, &amp; Dowda, 2004</xref>). Given children’s low levels of physical activity in the family child care and the potential to enhance physical activity by influencing the physical and social context of care, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1524839910393280">Temple and Naylor (2010)</xref> conducted a mixed-methods study with family child care providers in British Columbia, Canada to identify areas of need and priorities for action. Findings demonstrated that care providers were positively predisposed toward physical activity; but they also experienced many barriers such as lack of space and equipment, and poor weather. Care providers also felt the age range of children in their care limited opportunities for physically active play. Care providers wanted exposure to new ideas as well as opportunities to interact with other family child care providers. They emphasized the differences between home-based and group child care and that “activity ideas” would need to account for the unique context of family child care, including rules for playing indoors (since this is also a home), small indoor spaces, the diversity of children and the equipment available.</p>
<p>These findings provided the impetus for the development of an initiative called Healthy Opportunities for Preschoolers (HOP). HOP was designed specifically for the home-based child care setting and included (a) an illustrated manual with 80 child-tested physical activity and fundamental motor skill development activities and (b) two community workshops (called HOP Moving and Grooving and Play Ball). To maximize the local implementation and sustainability of HOP (across five geographic regions) a train-the-trainer model was adopted whereby members of the childcare community in each region were trained to lead the community workshops.</p>
<p>Professional development or training is a common component of efforts to enhance organizational capacity for public health promotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1524839910393280">Crisp, Swerissen, &amp; Duckett, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1524839910393280">Fixsen, Naoom, Blase, Friedman, &amp; Wallace, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1524839910393280">Kealey, Peterson, Gaul, &amp; Dinh, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1524839910393280">Sobeck &amp; Agius, 2007</xref>) and the adoption and implementation of evidence-based interventions or educational programs in practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1524839910393280">Bero et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1524839910393280">Danielson, Doolittle, &amp; Bradley, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1524839910393280">Kratochwill, Volpiansky, Clements, &amp; Ball, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1524839910393280">Tziraki et al., 2000</xref>). Training has been consistently related to implementation quality and effectiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1524839910393280">Durlak &amp; DuPre, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1524839910393280">Kratochwill et al., 2007</xref>). Train-the-trainer models specifically offer a cost-effective way of reaching geographically dispersed areas while also potentially enhancing local relevance and the likelihood of sustainability. We examined the impact of the HOP train-the-trainer approach and documented aspects of program uptake. Specifically we examined (a) the impact of a 2-day training program on workshop leader’s knowledge, confidence, and intention to implement community workshops; (b) the reach of the workshops in the 9 months following training; (c) the subsequent impact of the community workshops (conducted by “trainers/workshop leaders”) on care provider knowledge, confidence, and intention to implement HOP activities in their practice; (d) satisfaction with the training and subsequent workshops; and (e) the facilitators and barriers to implementation.</p>

<p>Recruitment was initiated by emailing information and application packages to Child Care Resource and Referral (CCRR) agencies (that train and support family childcare) and public health departments in British Columbia. A total of 15 child care professionals from 5 health regions in British Columbia (3 per region) were selected in order of application. These individuals were funded to attend a 2-day professional development workshop and to deliver 4 workshops in their community. The workshop was expanded to include self-funded participants because of an overwhelming response from the field (an additional 24 participants). The impact of the 2-day training on all 39 participants has been reported in this article. A total of 39 women aged 25 to 61 years with on average 16.5 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 9.7; range = 0-35 years) experience in the field, participated in the training. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1524839910393280">Table 1</xref> presents the geographical distribution of the leaders.</p>

<title>Workshop participants</title>
<p>Participants in 43 workshops led by the 15 funded leaders in the 9 months after the leader training (<italic>n</italic> = 430) were asked to participate in the evaluation. Pre- and postworkshop questionnaires were completed by 321 care providers (73% response rate). In total, 44% participated in “Moving and Grooving” whereas 28% participated in “Play Ball” and 28% in both. Participants ranged in age from 19 to 67 years and 98% were female. Mean number of years as a care provider was 11.0 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 8.4 years). A total of 56% of care providers reported participating in five or more bouts of vigorous- or moderate-intensity physical activity per week. Of the 321 workshop participants who completed evaluations, 93 agreed to a follow-up interview. All were telephoned, we made contact with 40, and 13 interviews were conducted (until data saturation was reached).</p>

<p>Specifically the training prepared leaders to: discuss the rationale and guidelines for physical activity and movement skills, engage adult learners, both “do” and “teach” activities that promote physical activity and movement skills and familiarize workshop participants with the HOP manual.</p>
<p>All the leaders were given a training manual, enough HOP manuals for community workshop participants, two CDs—one containing resources for workshop facilitation (e.g., certificates, signs, evaluation forms, PowerPoint presentations) and one containing 120 videotaped examples of the HOP activities and workshop content—and the 15 funded leaders received a stipend to cover costs and their hours to deliver four HOP workshops in their community.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1524839910393280">
<title>Community workshops</title>
<p>Leaders returned to their regions and organized HOP workshops at times and locations suitable for their communities. The two 2-hour community workshops aimed to enhance the knowledge, motivation, and ability of participants to facilitate movement skill development and physical activity opportunities for children in their care. As with the workshop leaders training the workshops were experiential and consisted of an introduction and rationale for physical activity and fundamental motor skill development, a variety of activities from the HOP manual, (either locomotor, stabilizing, or dance activities—Moving and Grooving—or manipulative skills—Play Ball), an orientation to the manual and making low-cost equipment (the complete manual is available to download at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.educ.uvic.ca/faculty/temple/pages/hop.htm">http://www.educ.uvic.ca/faculty/temple/pages/hop.htm</ext-link>).

<title>Analysis</title>
<p>Descriptive statistics were computed on all variables in the workshop leader and participant questionnaire and for workshop tracking data.

Two by two repeated measures analysis of variance was used to compare funded and unfunded workshop leaders’ experience, knowledge, confidence and changes in these over time. Telephone interviews were transcribed simultaneously and then emailed to the participant for member checking. Transcriptions were merged and hand-coding of text units was completed by a research assistant. Themes were then generated from like codes. Themes and related quotes were organized for data display and reviewed along with transcripts by the investigators.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="section15-1524839910393280">
<title>Training of Leaders</title>
<p>Leaders were relatively experienced workshop facilitators (48% had “quite a bit” or “a lot” of experience), but they were less experienced at facilitating workshops focusing on children’s physical activity and movement skills (18%). In all, 92% and 89.5% of the leaders were very or extremely satisfied with the workshop content and workshop delivery, respectively. The leaders found the training very or extremely useful (86.9%). All but one of the leaders (an unfunded participant) intended to use what they learned within the month. Intention to use was not significantly associated with funding status. Paired <italic>t</italic> test revealed significant increases in perceived overall knowledge and confidence after the workshop: <italic>t</italic>(35) = 5.693, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001 and <italic>t</italic>(36) = 4.651, <italic>p</italic> &lt;.001, respectively. Leaders’ perceptions of the adequacy of their knowledge on specific aspects of physical activity and movement skill development also significantly increased <italic>t</italic>(37) = 7.713, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, from 6.53 (<italic>SD</italic> = 2.96) at pretest to 10.03 (<italic>SD</italic> = 1.91) at posttest. Overall, 70% of the agreed number of workshops (<italic>n</italic> = 60) were completed within 9 months of training, and the entire funded leader cohort had presented at least one workshop (<italic>M</italic> = 2.9, range 1-6) in that time; with almost half (47%) completing four. Preworkshop experience, confidence, specific fundamental motor skills and physical activity knowledge and personal physical activity levels were not related to workshop delivery. Posttest adequacy of specific knowledge total was significantly related to the number of workshops delivered (<italic>r</italic> = .565, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). The distribution of workshops and participants by region is displayed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1524839910393280">Table 1</xref>.</p>
<p>The telephone interviews with leaders highlighted that the hands-on activities that engaged the participants (“it was great that people were not just sitting and listening”) and the materials and resources provided (“the website and hand-outs were useful I didn’t have to do a lot of prep work”) facilitated workshop implementation whereas the costs of equipment to run the workshop properly, lack of appropriate space, the time between training and conducting the workshop and the evaluation and paperwork were barriers. Some of the leaders indicated that they would prefer co-facilitation, needed more funding and a workshop kit of equipment to continue.</p>

<p>Care providers who participated in community workshops conducted by the trained leaders significantly increased their overall level of knowledge and confidence for providing movement experiences for preschoolers, their level of knowledge in specific aspects of physical activity provision and their attitude toward promoting and facilitating physical activity for preschoolers (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1524839910393280">Table 3</xref>). A comparison of change across workshops demonstrated a dose–response effect. Change scores were significantly greater for those care providers who took part in both workshops. Specifically confidence (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .005) and adequacy of knowledge of: projection (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001), reception (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001), striking (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001), helping children explore (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), and total adequacy of knowledge (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001) were higher. We also found evidence of specificity of knowledge changes. For example post hoc analysis showed that changes in adequacy of knowledge related to the manipulative skills (projection, reception, and striking) were significantly different if the care provider had participated in the Play Ball workshop or both workshops, compared with having participated in the Moving and Grooving workshop only. A total of 86% of workshop participants intended to use what they learned in their child care setting. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1524839910393280">Table 4</xref> presents the percentage of care providers who perceived they had adequate knowledge of specific aspects of physical activity provision pre- and postworkshop.</p>

<p>Telephone interviews with care providers who had attended a workshop (<italic>n</italic> = 13) showed that the key messages of the workshop were transferred. The interviewees universally identified the importance of physical activity for children as a key message stating for example, that “children need to be active to be healthy.” Some of the participants also identified the importance of skill development in the early years; “it reinforced how important it is to develop healthy children and develop gross motor skills” and motivating children to be active through fun; “to have fun and get moving” as key themes. Three themes that emerged when care providers were asked to talk about changes they had made since the workshop were increasing the frequency of physical activities, expanding their repertoire of activities (“it made me see how I can use things I have in different ways”; “we [did] more things like bowling, used scarves and catching”) and including more facilitated activities (“I used [activities] from the booklet, the booklet was great, we use buckets, bean bags and bowling, it became more structured”; “after the workshop when we go to the park now we bring balls with us”). They also mentioned that the workshop served as a motivator: “it just gave me a kick start that I needed to get the kids more active.”</p>
<p>When asked about facilitators and barriers to implementation the interviewees from the northern regions of British Columbia highlighted that weather was a critical barrier to implementation: “things haven’t really changed since the workshop because of the weather, it is too cold, but it will change when the weather gets better.” The care providers found the information and manual easy to use and both this and the workshop’s focus on low-cost homemade equipment were facilitators: “I liked the fact that I didn’t feel I had to go out and buy a whole bunch of things to do the activities.” Specific feedback about the workshop highlighted not only that the interactive activities in the workshop were well received (“the hands-on activities were great”) but also that this aspect could have been enhanced (“the overview needs to be more participatory”). Participants indicated that the pre workshop evaluation was not an ideal start to the workshop. Information about fundamental motor skills development was embedded within the activities and some individuals indicated that they would like more specific instruction on developing the fundamental motor skills rather than only learning through activities that incorporate the skill.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We implemented and evaluated the impact of the HOP train-the-trainer workshop. The training significantly increased workshop leaders’ knowledge and confidence and enhanced their readiness to teach the community workshop independent of their funding status. The funded leaders subsequently implemented the HOP workshop at the community level and significantly increased care providers’ attitude, knowledge, and confidence; and intention to implement HOP activities. We also found increases in perceived knowledge about activities for different developmental levels, the nature of young children’s participation in physical activity (i.e., short burst, intermittent), enriching the environment to facilitate movement experiences and manipulative movement skills such as catching, demonstrating that our training had achieved many of its objectives. The latter finding is notable as manipulative movement skills are less likely to be encouraged and facilitated in preschool contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1524839910393280">O’Connor &amp; Temple, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1524839910393280">Taggart &amp; Keegan, 1997</xref>). More important, we found that those care providers who participated in the workshop focusing on manipulative skills or who participated in both workshops had greater gains in perceived knowledge of manipulative skills. This illustrates that specificity of content was important and that there was a dose–response effect, that is, that knowledge and confidence gains were higher with more training.</p>
<p>The qualitative data supported our quantitative findings, with care providers reporting that they had increased the amount of physical activity they were doing with the children, increased their repertoire of activities and changed their view of what they could use to promote the movement skills (e.g., paper balls, balloons, and bean bags). In keeping with the components of effective training promoted by Porter et al (2000) and Kratochwill et al (2007) our qualitative data clearly showed that we incorporated “active learning” opportunities and that our content area focus was strong. A high percentage of the participants left the training intending to implement the workshops and/or the activities. The intention to implement is very important because we know that provision of daily <italic>opportunities</italic> for physical activity in preschool is associated with higher levels of physical activity and less time in sedentary behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1524839910393280">Bower et al., 2008</xref>). Some of the qualitative responses from the North suggested that the weather was still a barrier to implementation for some. That the weather was still seen as a constraint despite HOP’s focus on indoor and outdoor environments suggests that additional work to address this barrier is needed.</p>
<p>Despite an a priori commitment by workshop leaders to implement four workshops and funding support to do that, workshop implementation levels for funded participants were lower than expected in the 9-month window following training. Interviews and email correspondence showed that illness, job transitions, and work responsibilities interfered with workshop delivery. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1524839910393280">Fixsen et al. (2005)</xref> have emphasized that implementation occurs in the context of organizational and external influencing factors that can either hinder or support implementation effectiveness and our work illustrates this. The research they reviewed also highlighted that although quality training is essential, ongoing follow-up/coaching was more directly associated with implementation. We found some support for this with some trainers indicating that a refresher and/or co-facilitation during their first workshop after training (in addition to resources for conducting workshops) would have been ideal.</p>
<p>Our results should be viewed in light of a number of limitations. First, there was no comparison group, making it difficult to rule out other causes of change such as the characteristics of the intervention (e.g., funding) and evaluation environment. Second, it was evident that our workshops attracted physically active females with high levels of initial confidence in their ability to implement physical activity and motor skill development activities, limiting the generalizability of the findings. Finally, the leader training was only 2 days long and may not have provided enough contact time with the materials and knowledgeable instructors.</p>

<title>Implications for Practitioners</title>
<p>Our results, although formative, are important in the context of both healthy child development and escalating levels of childhood obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1524839910393280">Shields, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1524839910393280">World Health Organization, 2000</xref>) and indicate the feasibility of using professional development as a strategy to facilitate change in the home-based settings where many preschool aged children learn and play. We targeted the impact of the leader training on subsequent workshop implementation and quality but further work examining the impact of the training on the policies and practices of early learning practitioners and concomitantly the physical activity levels of the children they deal with is needed. Further research on the impact of co-facilitation, peer networks (communities of practice) and follow-up support and contact after training on implementation is critical.</p>
