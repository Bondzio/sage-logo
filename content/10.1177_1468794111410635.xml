<p>It’s always an indication that I have been ‘hooked’ by a special issue of a journal or book if I find myself speedily flicking between authors articles, reference lists and quotations so frequently that I have to resort to an army of ‘stickies’ to mark places of interest. Tracking the thought provoking mixture of connections and disjunctures between the articles I found many contributions that will be of use to myself and my postgraduate students, as well as in Masters research methodology courses. So what are the aspects of this Special Issue that engaged me and sustained my interest throughout?</p>
<p>First, I particularly appreciated the ‘mix’ of contributions, and the thoughtfully dialogic ordering of the articles. A wide range of forms of performance ethnography are engaged within the issue. These include: performance artwork, drama, ethno-fiction, poetry, and digital video technology. I enjoyed the way in which many of the articles spoke in opposition to each other, as well as the inclusion of articles that engaged with the possibilities and the limitations and challenges posed by performance ethnography. As a result, the Special Issue becomes more than a salvation narrative.</p>
<p>In the Introduction, guest editor Carl Bagley notes his intention to explore the ways in which drawing together educational ethnography and the arts can engage with and re/present the social complexities that characterize contemporary times. Norman Denzin’s self titled ‘manifesto’ of sorts (p. 255), sets the scene by proposing that critical performance pedagogies move across global and local, political and personal contexts to challenge injustice. Drawing on a range of specific situations, he shows the potential for spectacle pedagogy to ‘enact a politics of hope’ (p. 268).</p>
<p>Denzin’s ‘call to arms’ is picked up in articles such as Bagley’s, where he explores the potential of performance ethnography to represent and disseminate the emotional, embodied and sensory nuances of ethnographic data. Given the lack of training in arts based representations of data, he expresses some disquiet with the need to satisfy a performance ethic in the enactment of performance ethnographies.</p>
<p>While not intended as a response to Bagley, Geoffrey Walford speaks to his concerns, situating discussions of ethnography within a broader historical context, and alerting us to what can be lost when new forms of representation emerge. He cautions us against valorizing new forms of ethnography, and forgetting the broad and in-depth range of research methods and rigour characterizing traditional ethnography. Walford thoughtfully acknowledges the unequal power dynamics between researchers and the participants, noting that representations of performance ethnography, when there is an emphasis on spectacle and display, can run the risk of privileging the ethnographer’s analysis rather than the participant’s perspectives.</p>
<p>Andrew Sparkes and Jim Mienczakowski also call into question the extent to which ‘novel representations’ of ethnography as Sparkes describes them, in and of themselves, necessarily constitute high quality ethnographic research. Mienczakowski notes the potential of drawing on arts based approaches to gather a wider range of ethnographic data than may be possible with more traditional forms of ethnographic data collection, and also in presenting findings to more diverse audiences. However, he points out that little research has been undertaken to understand the ways in which audiences are affected and influenced by arts based representations of ethnographic data. In this regard, Sparkes suggests that researchers need to engage in informed debates from a range of perspectives in judging ‘novel’ forms of ethnographic representation.</p>
<p>Like Walford, Mienczakowski alerts readers to the dangers of performance ethnographies that privilege entertainment and therapy, at the expense of attending to the exchange values of power differentials within the researcher/researched relationship and seeking social justice for research participants. He draws upon some interesting approaches which interact with the audiences as willing participants to gather new data as part of enacting performance ethnographic work.</p>
<p>Contributions by VanSlyke-Briggs present insights into the possibilities and limitations of drawing on ethno-fiction as a form for presenting ethnographic research findings. Her article fits well together with Peter Clough’s work, which shows how story-making as a form of ethnographic data representation can attend to the messy complexities of life. Phipps and Saunders also draw on fiction, in their case, using the form of poetry, to show how its nuanced and evocative form can both interrupt and illuminate dominant values in education, and educational research methods.</p>
<p>The Special Issue ends on a high note for me with ML White’s contribution which engages critically with the possibilities and limitations of using video technology to collect and analyse ethnographic data with young people. I was particularly interested in the ways that the digital domain actively shapes and crafts the research as an educational and cultural process. She speaks to the concerns of many of the previous contributors in acknowledging power relations not only between researcher and researched, but also in terms of representations that privilege words. The attention to the power differentials within researcher/researched relationships, and the degree of collaborative negotiation and characterizing her work with the research participants is impressive.</p>
<p>I will be drawing extensively on the articles within this Special Issue of <italic>Ethnography in Education</italic> to explore these approaches in my own research, and that of postgraduate researchers working with me. The debates engaged with in this Special Issue will also be useful in postgraduate research methods courses.</p>
