<p><bold>Abdul Wakil Sulamal Shinwari</bold>’s short story looks at the perils of being a professional female in today’s Afghanistan</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>‘Miss, you’re not going to perform the pre-prayer washing ritual with such long nails, are you?’</p>
<p>Zarlashta was shocked at the new minister’s question, was overcome with shame, lowered her eyes and didn’t make a sound.</p>
<p>The minister stroked his beard and said: ‘Why are you not answering me, have you taken fright? What will you say to God?’</p>
<p>Zarlashta was as still as a statue. The minister asked her:</p>
<p>‘For whom have you put on all this make-up?’</p>
<p>Zarlashta still remained silent.</p>
<p>The minister added: ‘How can you expect me to leave you here in the office in such a state of sparking red and white – what official could resist you?’ He was silent for a second, but then continued: ‘former officials have gone astray, but I don’t want our brother Mujahidin to be put in harm’s way.’</p>
<p>Zarlashta could no longer keep her silence and from behind her tears responded, ‘In that case me, fire me minister.’</p>
<p>The minister was enraged and replied, ‘Just yesterday I turned away lots of women. You are asking me to do the right thing and fire you!’</p>
<p>Zarlashta said, ‘Fine, make my family responsible for everything, break my legs, the ministry can go to the dogs.’</p>
<p>The minister was infuriated. ‘How does your husband cope with putting all the responsibility on you, the way you think? How would Kabul not be destroyed if your husband is in one ministry sitting side by side with a woman, and his wife, like you, is doing work in other ministry?’</p>
<p>Zarlashta said quietly, ‘I haven’t got a husband.’</p>
<p>Then he said, ‘What does your father do?’</p>
<p>‘My father is dead.’</p>
<p>‘Brothers?’</p>
<p>‘They are young.’</p>
<p>The minister was silent and then said slowly, ‘Why have you remained without a husband? We Muslims will not marry you, and the other dirty ones won’t have found you.’</p>
<p>Zarlashta started crying – she wanted to say something but bit her tongue.</p>

<p>The minister stopped asking tormenting questions and said gently, ‘Very well, let us forget this matter. Now tell me, if I find a husband for you, will you marry him?’</p>
<p>Zarlashta said from behind her tears, ‘If you fire me and don’t take care of my family, I won’t have any choice but to get married, will I?′‘</p>
<p>The minister liked this remark and smiled. ‘And so this will please God and will also free you of your troubles.’</p>
<p>Zarlashta said out of necessity, ‘Like you say, minister, you are all wise people.’</p>
<p>The minister stroked his beard, looked around and said to Zarlashta, ‘Close the door behind you.’</p>
<p>Zarlashta was shocked but went to the door and shut it, as it was already half closed.</p>
<p>The minister said slowly, ‘Am I not a suitable man for you? Don’t be scared, I am not forcing you.’</p>
<p>Zarlashta was shocked and overcome with shame, but she still controlled herself, kept her composure and said gently, ‘But you are like a father to me, minister.’</p>
<p>The minister laughed. ‘Such things will give a damned bearded man a white beard! I am not past it, dear! I would only be ten or 12 years your senior.’</p>
<p>Zarlashta jumped at this news. ‘But you do have a wife, no?’</p>
<p>‘You refer to one – I have two, but one is a housewife, the other is an “outdoor wife”. I haven’t got an office wife or a wife to go on walks with. I am mad for modern women, really.’</p>
<p>Zarlashta laughed and said, ‘But an outdoor, walking and modern wife also wants a modern husband, no?’</p>
<p>The minister laughed. ‘Like how?’</p>
<p>‘He would have to shave his beard and he would act modern.’</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>‘If you fire me and don’t take care of my family, I won’t have any choice but to get married, will I?’</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The minister smiled. ‘You call that hard work? What’s difficult about shaving one’s beard? Okay, and from tomorrow I will wear a western suit! What else do I have to do?’</p>
<p>Zarlashta laughed. ‘What about my nails, lipstick and eye shadow?’</p>
<p>‘As you like, but you will have to refrain from wearing it at work, as it is God’s torture that I fired other women. Also, spare me from the gossip of others and my friends.’</p>
<p>Zarlashta said slowly, ‘In that case, I will think about it.’</p>
<p>The minister said seriously. ‘Never mind thinking, just tell me that you will take time and go and see someone to let them know that you have decided.’</p>
<p>Zarlashta was again overcome with shame and ran out of the office.</p>
