<abstract>
<p>Although hospice volunteer programs contribute to patient care, little is known about their utilization and adaptation of technology. A survey was posted to the Hospice Volunteer Association Web site to assess technology use among volunteer coordinators and volunteers. Results revealed that participants have access to computers, Internet, and e-mail at the hospice agency and routinely use cellular phones and e-mail. Despite the use of technology, communication problems with volunteers hindered the coordinator’s ability to manage scheduling, training, and volunteer assignments for patient care. Coordinators and volunteers felt comfortable utilizing technology but were less comfortable using technology in the patients’ home. Several areas are identified for development and integration of advanced technology in volunteer programs. Future research is needed to ease technology implementation and increase volunteer acceptance.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Hospice agencies face continued pressures to reduce costs, increase efficiency, and comply with stricter regulatory requirements, while simultaneously providing optimal care and outcomes for patients and family members.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049909111429559">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049909111429559"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049909111429559"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049909111429559">4</xref>
</sup> As a result of these increasing financial pressures, a technological shift is occurring in hospice care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049909111429559">5</xref></sup> One such shift has been the utilization of telecommunications technology in delivering end-of-life care known as telehospice.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049909111429559">6</xref>
</sup> Telehospice is defined as the use of advanced communication technologies to improve the quality of hospice services delivered to patients and their families.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049909111429559">7</xref>
</sup> Incorporating technology into palliative and end-of-life care services can significantly improve patient access to personnel, reduce travel costs for providers and family, increase the likelihood of timely care, and elevate patient involvement, empowerment, and satisfaction.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049909111429559">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049909111429559">8</xref>
</sup> However, in order for telehospice to be successful, hospice professionals must first accept and endorse technology as a viable and user-friendly method for service delivery.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049909111429559">6</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>While technology has long been suggested as one of the solutions to alleviating health care costs and deficits,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049909111429559">9</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049909111429559"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049909111429559">11</xref>
</sup> hospice agencies have traditionally followed a low-tech approach to care.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049909111429559">12</xref>
</sup> More recently, however, hospice staff have perceived technology as a useful tool for documenting meeting processes, staying informed of care decisions, and developing more collective and common care plan goals.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049909111429559">13</xref>
</sup> Telehospice interventions now appear to be more readily accepted by nursing and administrative staff members.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049909111429559">6</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Thus far, research on telehospice adaptation has focused only on clinical staff and has neglected to account for the peripheral patient care role facilitated through volunteer programs. Unique to hospice, the Medicare Conditions of Participation requires that volunteers provide at least 5% of total patient care hours for each hospice agency.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049909111429559">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049909111429559">15</xref>
</sup> Hospice volunteers provide an average of 46.6 hours of service each year to patients’ homes and direct volunteer patient care hours have been found to positively impact the overall rating of quality of hospice care.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049909111429559">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049909111429559">16</xref>
</sup> Volunteers are a quintessential link in the provision of holistic hospice care, providing a community context that blends formal and informal hospice care.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049909111429559">17</xref>
</sup> Importantly, volunteers provide respite care and emotional and social support for the patient’s primary caregiver.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049909111429559">18</xref>
</sup> They work closely with volunteer coordinators who provide training, oversight, and are a significant resource for dealing with the stress of volunteering.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049909111429559">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049909111429559">20</xref>
</sup> As more technology becomes infused into the delivery and coordination of hospice services, volunteer programs will need to embrace the shift toward technological integration in order to coordinate increased support services.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049909111429559">21</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The purpose of the study was to explore how technology is currently being used in hospice volunteer programs. Specifically, we aimed to determine to what extent hospices share common approaches to managing a hospice volunteer program and facilitating communication with volunteers. The following research questions were used: (1) What is the extent of volunteer coordinator–volunteer communication?; (2) What challenges do hospice volunteer managers face?; (3) What technology is currently being used to facilitate volunteer work and management within hospice programs?; and (4) What is the response of hospice volunteer managers and volunteers to the idea of using new technology in patient care?</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-1049909111429559">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants were recruited by the Hospice Volunteer Association (HVA) through the Hospice Volunteer News e-mail, and the Hospice Community Forum Web site. Hospice volunteer coordinators and volunteers were asked to respond to an e-mail announcement that directed them to an online survey link on the HVA Web site home page. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the supporting university.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1049909111429559">
<title>Instrument</title>
<p>A 31-item questionnaire was developed in conjunction with HVA staff and members of the research team. Respondents were first asked to report demographic information including their length of hospice service. To capture hospice agency information, volunteer coordinators were asked to indicate the type of agency, daily census, number of volunteers, and the estimated amount of volunteers providing direct patient care. To assess volunteer coordinator–volunteer communication, volunteer coordinators were asked to report on recruitment strategies, the frequency and attendance of volunteer meetings, the frequency and means of contact with each volunteer, and challenges with scheduling volunteers. Additionally, 2 open-ended items were used to inquire about the challenges of managing volunteers and challenges to meeting the mandatory 5% of services provided by volunteers. Next, the current use of technology in volunteer programs were assessed by asking both volunteers and volunteer coordinators about the availability of computers and the Internet at the agency, frequency of computer and Internet use at home and in work/volunteer work, agency use of an electronic medical record (EMR) system and volunteer management and reporting software, and other technological devices used in work/volunteer work. Finally, we asked volunteer coordinators and volunteers how comfortable they are using new technology, introducing new technology to patients, and potentially using video technology with patients.</p>

<sec id="section5-1049909111429559">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Data were entered into SPSS (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois) and descriptive statistics were computed for all survey items. The 2 short, open-ended items were categorized and then quantified. Categorization consisted of constant comparison of the data leading to the development of mutually exclusive codes.</p>

<p>The majority of participants identified as volunteer coordinators (61.5%), followed by volunteers (32.5%) and other hospice staff (6%). The majority of respondents worked in hospice service for over 3 years (55%). An overwhelming majority of respondents identified as whites (90%) and female (87%). The average daily census ranged from 8 to 1250 patients, with a mean of 133 patients. More than a third of the agencies were home care nonprofit (37%), followed by private nonprofit (31%), and only 7% were identified as hospital nonprofit. Approximately 25% of respondents did not indicate an agency type. Volunteer coordinators were responsible for a range of 3 to 500 volunteers with an average of 56 volunteers. Additionally, coordinators estimated that on average 64% of volunteer hours at their agency were spent on direct patient care.</p>
<p>Research question one addressed volunteer coordinator–volunteer communication practices among hospice agencies. Initial contact with volunteers centered on recruitment via the agency’s Web site (84%) and other Internet advertising (68.5%). Volunteer meetings are typically held once a month (31%) or quarterly (24%). The majority of volunteer coordinators reported an average of 10 to 19 volunteers in attendance (40%), followed by smaller meetings of 5 to 9 volunteers (26%). In addition to these meetings, volunteer coordinators reported speaking with each volunteer at least monthly (30%) or every other week (24%) via e-mail (56%) or phone (33%). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1049909111429559">Table 3</xref> provides an overview of volunteer coordinator–volunteer communication.</p>

<p>Challenges to hospice volunteer management, the focus of research question 2, allowed volunteer coordinators to detail the challenge of meeting the mandatory 5% of volunteer services and general volunteer management issues. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1049909111429559">Table 4</xref> provides a summary of responses and quantified results. Agency characteristics (27%) and challenges to managing volunteers (33%) were considered prevalent barriers to meeting federal requirements. Limitations on what counts for volunteers to make the 5% requirement, finding volunteers in rural areas, and having enough time from hospice admission to patient death for a volunteer to provide service were agency-level challenges. One volunteer coordinator identified the lack of time necessary to match patients and volunteers, explaining that “too much time passes and the need no longer exists.” Geographic coverage was also reported as a barrier, especially for agencies serving rural areas as it was hard for coordinators to find “volunteers in rural areas with a willingness to drive many miles for patient care.”</p>

<sup>a</sup>Of 104 volunteer coordinators, only 70 completed this portion of the survey.</p>
</fn>
</table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap>
<p>Volunteer management was challenging due to communication problems with volunteers (34%), retention (26%), and the provision of training and volunteer support (29%). Although the majority of communication problems stemmed from differences in technological use such as computers, e-mail, and telephone, face-to-face communication was also described as a challenge. One volunteer coordinator explained, “Most of our volunteers do not use computers. Telephone tag is pretty slow sometimes.” Face-to-face communication was also a substantial challenge for volunteer coordinators due to irregular meeting attendance and geographical dispersion of volunteers. One coordinator shared, “I find it difficult to get the volunteers to communicate regularly and attend the meetings.” Another coordinator shared, “Communication, they're spread widely geographically and many do not have or use computers for electronic communication.” Geographic distance and volunteers’ busy schedules were also a challenge when scheduling volunteers.</p>
<p>In addition to communication problems, volunteer coordinators identified volunteer retention (26%) as a significant challenge. A volunteer coordinator shared, “Intentions are always good to begin with. Personal and family obligations overcome their good intentions (which is understandable) but can be frustrating in meeting the needs of the patients and obtaining the time.” Volunteer schedules were also problematic (14%), as one coordinator explained, “I work mostly with volunteers who are under age 60—still working. Their busy lifestyles present practical challenges which prevent them from volunteering the amount of time they would like to and that we need.” Relying on volunteers to complete visit logs and agency requirements was also reported as a challenge (29%).</p>
<p>Research question 3 investigated the use of technology in hospice volunteer programs. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1049909111429559">Table 5</xref> provides a summary of volunteer coordinator/volunteer technology use. More than half of volunteer coordinators/volunteers reported that computers were available in their hospice agencies (58%) and that they had Internet access (60%). Almost half of all study participants reported that their agency uses an EMR system (46%) as well as a volunteer management software (43%), with Misys (AllScripts) and Patient Data Vault (HVA; 37%) the most commonly used. The majority of participants reported using a computer for work/volunteer work (70%), using a home computer (86%), launching the Internet (89%), accessing e-mail either at home or at work (92%), and using a cellular phone or palm-held computer (81%).</p>

<p>Finally, we assessed volunteer coordinator and volunteer comfort with technology use in patient care. Nearly half (43%) of the respondents reported being totally comfortable with the technology that they are currently using. Furthermore, nearly one third (31%) of the participants reported being somewhat or totally comfortable with the idea of introducing new technology to patients. Only 17% of participants felt that new technology, particularly videophones, would be useful to patient care. The majority of respondents were neutral (44%) and 28% reported that video technology as not useful.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This exploratory study assessed the use of technology in hospice volunteer programs. Participants were recruited using a convenience sampling strategy through the HVA, and it should be noted that the population is not representative of all hospices. It is likely that smaller hospices with fewer resources and thus small volunteer programs did not participate in this study, and technology use among this population remains unknown. The study is further limited by the limited response rate to some questions on the survey. Finally, the small number of volunteers represented in the sample and the lack of participating hospice agencies in the southern part of the United States limits the diversity of the sample. Still, the study sample consists of a wide variety of hospice agencies and participants had sufficient hospice experience. The response to the study indicates an awareness and utilization of technology among both hospice volunteer coordinators and volunteers.</p>
<p>Hospice volunteer coordinators and volunteers have access to and do use technology. Computer and Internet availability and use was common both at work and at home. E-mail and cellular phone use was a common form of communication between coordinators and volunteers. Volunteer coordinators identified online recruitment and other Internet advertising as the most viable recruitment methods. Likewise, several coordinators indicated that lack of a Web site was a barrier to volunteer management. Although hospice volunteers are commonly older adults over the age of 55 and technology adaptation has been traditionally less rapid among this population,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049909111429559">22</xref>
</sup> this study demonstrates that hospice volunteers are active technology consumers. Notably, the study was completed using an online survey and evidences basic usability among the study sample it also introduces the possibility of bias in the findings as individuals who were not technologically savvy did not participate.</p>
<p>Given that hospice volunteers are using the Internet, e-mail, and cellular phones, hospice volunteer programs could further benefit from these telehospice tools to facilitate communication and coordination about patient care. With hospice volunteers working an average of 4 hours shift per week over 1 year,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049909111429559">23</xref>
</sup> this study shows that volunteer coordinators have a need to regularly communicate with them (either monthly or biweekly). Volunteer coordinators reported communication problems with volunteers, yet limited their attempts to phone or e-mail. In addition to the use of the Internet for primary recruitment, hospice agencies should consider devoting Web space for volunteer information, instant messaging with the volunteer coordinator, blogging, and perhaps an online schedule depicting the geographic placement of patients as well as their day and time preferences for volunteer visits.</p>
<p>An important consideration to the use of technology, not just among hospice volunteers, is the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049909111429559">24</xref>
</sup> Due to privacy laws such as HIPAA, limited information can be communicated over conventional e-mail, and development of systems such as the Patient Data Vault which provides a secure, encrypted communication for discussing all aspects of managing volunteer assignments and reporting are necessary to ensure that agencies do not compromise the patient’s privacy and violate HIPAA. Still, the promise of technology to enable more fluid access to information may alleviate the underutilization of hospice volunteers that currently occurs due to lag time in between training completion and patient assignment.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049909111429559">25</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Volunteer coordinators also identified that communication problems were evidenced by lack of attendance at volunteer meetings. Although this study did not capture the amount of volunteers that should have been present at a meeting, volunteer coordinators reported overseeing an average of 56 volunteers and average meeting attendance between 10 and 19 volunteers, suggesting that less than half of volunteers attend routine meetings. Although there is no established connection between volunteer retention and volunteer meeting attendance, geographic distance was a noted barrier to volunteer participation in patient care and could also impact attendance at volunteer meetings. Future research is needed to explore the content of these meetings, meeting attendance by volunteers, and the potential of technology to overcome geographic boundaries that prohibit participation and perhaps impact retention rates.</p>
<p>This study found that EMR systems and volunteer management software were common among hospice agencies. Interestingly, prior research on volunteer training topics did not include training on electronic management systems.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049909111429559">23</xref>
</sup> Initial volunteer training may be a venue for introducing the use of technology for service coordination, patient scheduling, and potentially patient care. The investment in technology for volunteer training could be cost effective, given that the average volunteer staff commitment is 1 to 5 years of service.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049909111429559">23</xref>
</sup> Still, volunteer coordinators reported that volunteer training is one of the primary challenges of managing volunteers. More research is needed to explore the use of technology in the delivery of volunteer training. This study suggests that Internet-based training may be viable given that volunteer recruitment is primary Internet based. Technology may play a major role in resolving widespread problems with volunteer training<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049909111429559">23</xref></sup> and should be considered for inclusion in the development of national standards for volunteer training.</p>
<p>Findings in this study are consistent with early research that although hospice volunteer coordinators and volunteers reported feeling comfortable with the technology they used, they were less comfortable introducing new technology for use in the patients’ home.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049909111429559">26</xref>
</sup> Volunteer coordinators and volunteers are not unlike most health care professionals who feel overwhelmed by an increase in technology use as adequate training and support are rarely provided in the integration of these services.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049909111429559">21</xref>
</sup> With volunteers reporting regular utilization of e-mail, Internet, and cellular phone, more research is needed to explore how these platforms can be used to deliver patient services and increase communication between coordinators and volunteers while still protecting patient privacy.</p>
<p>Problems with volunteer retention and training further document that most hospice agencies often do not know effective or efficient ways to engage volunteers.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049909111429559">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049909111429559">27</xref>
</sup> Currently, the direct patient services role of volunteers typically involves offering emotional support and observing patient care.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049909111429559">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049909111429559">29</xref>
</sup> With Internet-based interventions now being offered to both hospice patients and professionals to facilitate communication and/or deliver health care interventions,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049909111429559">30</xref>
</sup> it is time to begin thinking about ways to incorporate hospice volunteers in this aspect of patient care. The remaining challenge is to create an awareness of available technology, its uses, and the ease of adoption among volunteers and volunteer coordinators. This study suggests that the use of health information technology can facilitate more effective and efficient volunteer coordination due to the ability to increase communication opportunities.<sup>
