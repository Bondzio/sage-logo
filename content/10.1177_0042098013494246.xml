<p>In <italic>Great American City: Chicago and the Enduring Neighborhood Effect</italic>, author Robert J. Sampson details the findings of the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods (PHDCN), a long-term study on social conditions in that city. The book makes three main arguments: social conditions differ by neighbourhood; neighbourhood social conditions are durable over time; and, neighbourhoods matter in shaping wellbeing of residents.</p>
<p>In chapter 1, Sampson introduces his appeal for social science research at the neighbourhood-level: that even in a wired world, physical proximity still matters in shaping life outcomes. Chapter 2 further explains the neighbourhood-level orientation of this text, reviewing the literature from the Chicago School of urban sociology and then responding to criticisms of this approach written by social disorganisation theorists and political economists. Chapters 3 and 4 describe the core theoretical principles employed in this book and the intellectual history of the PHDCN. Here Sampson details how he and his collaborators sought to conduct a longitudinal study that collected numerous types of primary data (interviews and observations of a cohort of children, surveys of neighbourhood organisations, observations of neighbourhood physical conditions, interviews with community leaders, accounting of civic events and a lost letter experiment) and examined secondary data on health, crime, housing, violence and population.</p>
<p>Following the introductory material, the book’s next section presents results describing social conditions within neighbourhoods. The data in chapters 5 and 6 show that disadvantage and racial segregation are spatially associated and that perceived disorder, rather than actual disorder, stigmatises neighbourhoods and reinforces the disorder over time. In chapter 7, the author introduces a new idea called collective efficacy theory, which argues that neighbourhood disadvantage is caused by a lack of social cohesion. Chapter 8 analyses 30 years of civic events, showing that a neighbourhood’s density of non-profit organisations and number of past civic events are the strongest predictors of that neighbourhood’s number of future civic events. Chapter 9 describes how neighbourhood altruism was measured using a lost letter experiment, which found return rates higher in neighbourhoods with friendly persons, residential land uses and a lack of high-rise public housing.</p>
<p>The book then turns to address broadly how neighbourhoods are connected to each other and how social processes interlock throughout the city. Chapter 10 discusses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0042098013494246">Tobler’s (1970)</xref> first law of geography, demonstrates how neighbourhoods affect adjacent neighbourhoods in both positive and negative ways and illustrates how neighbourhood adjacency effects ripple throughout the city. Chapter 11 examines the Moving to Opportunity programme and analyses its shortcomings. Chapters 12 and 13 also discuss household moves, examining the processes by which individual household relocations change the make-up of both destination and origin neighbourhoods. Here Sampson writes that neighbourhoods choose people, not the other way around, by arguing that movers are likely to move to neighbourhoods that are similar to origin neighbourhoods in terms of economic composition, social climate, perceived disorder and general location. Chapter 14 shows that neighbourhood leaders who are highly connected to other leaders tend to live in neighbourhoods that have high collective efficacy, many non-profit organisations and high net migration.</p>
<p>In the final section, chapter 15 summarises the entire book and discusses how the empirical findings fit into theory, arguing that neighbourhood effects need to be treated as seriously as macro-level forces. Chapters 16 and 17 revisit Chicago following the Great Recession and Chicago Housing Authority transformation, showing that concentrations of disadvantage have largely remained in the same locations.</p>
<p>The tone of this book is dense and academic throughout. Sampson tells the lengthy story of this comprehensive study, weaving a complex narrative of the many findings of the project while setting the stage for future results to be published. Interested readers will appreciate the exhaustive list of footnotes and citations and the detailed description of theory and methods. The graphs and maps illustrating empirical results and diagrams explaining theoretical concepts are of high quality and add to the text. Several photographs are used to show locations described by the author, providing welcome visuals to accompany the large aggregated datasets used. More maps would have been helpful, particularly one detailing Sampson’s interesting description of a journey down Michigan Avenue, from the primarily White and wealthy North Side to the primarily Black and poor South Side.</p>
<p>This book has two notable deficiencies. First, time and again, the author presents empirical data showing that past neighbourhood conditions are highly correlated with present conditions. This book would have been stronger had it included comprehensive proposals on how to overcome such durable geographies of disadvantage. Overcoming neighbourhood disadvantage is indeed a complex question, but as written, this book gives little hope to those working to improve conditions in disadvantaged neighbourhoods. Given his expertise in studying the subject, a second edition of this book would benefit from more of Sampson’s expert suggestions. The author’s idea to “intervene holistically at the scale of neighborhoods, communities, and cities themselves” (p. 420) needs to be fleshed out with specific policy recommendations. Secondly, this book only sparingly addresses macro-level mechanisms that have guided neighbourhood outcomes. While the book does recognise that deindustrialisation, government policies and racism have had some effect on neighbourhoods, the text stops short of fully explaining its empirical results in the context of powerful structural processes.</p>
<p>This book will be most useful to urban researchers working in the fields of neighbourhood effects and urban disadvantage. A secondary use of this book could be the inclusion of its literature review chapters in a graduate sociology course studying the Chicago School or using the methodology chapters in a graduate course on social science methods.</p>
<p>This book makes two main contributions to the literature on urban disadvantage, standing alongside important works by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0042098013494246">Wilson (2012)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0042098013494246">Massey and Denton (1993)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0042098013494246">Patillo-McCoy (2000)</xref>; and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0042098013494246">de Souza Briggs <italic>et al.</italic> (2010)</xref>. First and foremost, Sampson brings focus to the neighbourhood as a unit of analysis. Sampson shows that social problems are durable and interrelated at the neighbourhood level, adding to the literature that previously has studied individual-level durability and interrelatedness of social problems. Secondly, Sampson contributes the idea of neighbourhood as being socially productive because, as individuals react to neighbourhood differences, these actions and thoughts shape neighbourhoods and the city as a whole.</p>
