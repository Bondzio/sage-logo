<abstract>
<p>Composite hydrogel systems consisting of oxidized alginate, gelatin, and biphasic calcium phosphate were fabricated by the Schiff-base reaction and the effect of oxidation of alginate on the microstructure, material properties, and biocompatibility were evaluated. Alginate was modified by oxidizing the attached −OH groups to a −CHO group to facilitate interactions with the −NH<sub>2</sub> groups of gelatin. The increased interactions between the functional groups had several effects on the materials properties, physical behaviors, and bio-compatibility. A higher degree of oxidation and thereby a higher extent of crosslinking between the −CHO and −NH<sub>2</sub> groups resulted in an increase in water uptake and compressive strength, which was associated with a decrease in porosity, gelation time, bio-degradation rate, and to a smaller degree, biocompatibility. The hydrogel structure was highly porous and showed unique channel zed morphology with an extensive branching of the channels. The channels were not continuous and were divided into multiple segments by thin separators that were 5 µm thick and branched off of the 10–25 µm thick frame. The pores in the hydrogel system were interconnected and the porosity ranged from 44.45 to 67.89% with a pore size ranging from 100 to 300 µm. The compressive stress failure of the wet hydrogel was at 12.0 ± 1.2 MPa when the degree of alginate oxidation was 66.6%. The biocompatibility of the hydrogel system was excellent, although it was slightly lowered by oxidation. These hydrogels are promising biomaterials for bone regeneration with adjustable gelation and bio-degradation time, good mechanical strength, and excellent bio-compatibility.</p>

<p>Hydrogels are polymeric 3D networks that can absorb large amounts of water. These hydrogels are currently being used for a range of applications due to their unique features such as their high water uptake, space for drug or nutrient storage, ability for cell immobilization, creation of a microenvironment for cell culturing allowing nutrients and metabolites to diffuse to and from the cells, etc.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0885328211404265">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0885328211404265">2</xref></sup> Hydrogels have been prepared by several different methods, which have been based on physical or chemical crosslinking using thermo-sensitive polymers,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0885328211404265">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0885328211404265">4</xref></sup> and photochemical reactions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0885328211404265">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0885328211404265">6</xref></sup> Several methods have been investigated for the fabrication of hydrogels including the Michael-type reactions,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0885328211404265">7</xref></sup> enzyme-mediated reaction,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0885328211404265">8</xref></sup> Schiff-base reactions, etc.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0885328211404265">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0885328211404265">8</xref></sup> Physically crosslinked hydrogels have a low mechanical strength and minute changes in the external environment (pH, temperature, and ionic strength.) can destabilize the hydrogel system. Chemically crosslinked hydrogels are mechanically stronger and more stable because the interactions between the chemical linkages are stronger than physical linkages.</p>
<p>Hydrogel scaffolds have been shown to display excellent biocompatibility, and have suitable mechanical properties for promoting cell attachment and tissue formation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0885328211404265">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0885328211404265">10</xref></sup> In addition, its degradation products are not toxic in vivo. Cells can adhere to or be suspended within the 3D hydrogel framework of hydrogel scaffolds. Several studies have demonstrated that the mechanical properties of hydrogels play an important role in tissue regeneration because they create and maintain a space for cell proliferation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0885328211404265">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0885328211404265">10</xref></sup> Degradation of hydrogel scaffolds should be adequate and allow for the process of new tissue formation and eventual bio-integration and this should be neither too high, which could endanger the physical structure, nor too low to hamper tissue regeneration and integration. The degradation behavior of hydrogels can be controlled based on the type of backbone polymer and the crosslinking characteristics such as the amount of crosslinker, physical or chemical type, and size of crosslinking molecules.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0885328211404265">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0885328211404265">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Usually, hydrogel systems are fabricated with lower mechanical strength, which prohibits them from being used as a supporting implant under load bearing conditions. Thus, there are limitations in using hydrogels for hard-tissue regeneration because of their low mechanical properties. Since most skeletal elements of the body support a load, the repaired or implanted site has to be able to bear a minimum amount of load to maintain the mechanical stability of the implant site. Common hydrogel systems have inherently low mechanical strength under loading conditions. Composite hydrogels, which involve the incorporation of an inorganic reinforcing phase within the hydrogel, have been used to overcome this drawback.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0885328211404265">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is well-known that calcium phosphates such as hydroxyapatite (HAp) and β-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP) have osteogenic properties and can stimulate natural bone regeneration. HAp and β-TCP have been extensively used for hard tissue repair and augmentation related applications due to their osteoinductivity. BCP (mixture of HAp and TCP-biphasic calcium phosphate) has been reported to be more efficient than HAp alone for repairing periodontal defects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0885328211404265">12</xref></sup> However, their biodegradation rates are not within the range needed for biodegradable biomaterials. α-TCP and β-TCP, on the other hand, have a faster dissolution rate. Therefore, an optimal biodegradable material system may be achieved by combining HAp, α-TCP, and β-TCP. α-TCP hydrolyses through a dissolution–precipitation process under physiological conditions that leads to the formation of a network of Ca-deficient HAp crystals. The combination of HAp, α-TCP, and β-TCP improves the mechanical properties, allows for controlled biodegradation behavior, and promotes an osteointegration response, which increases the bioactivity of the composite.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0885328211404265">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Alginate is an anionic polysaccharide with a linear block copolymer of (1-4)-β-<sc>d</sc>-mannuronic acid (M) and (1-4)-α-<sc>l</sc>-guluronic acid (G).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0885328211404265">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0885328211404265">15</xref></sup> The polymer has attractive properties such as good biocompatibility and biodegradability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0885328211404265">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0885328211404265">16</xref></sup> To improve the reactive properties of native alginate, the polymeric chain has been chemically modified with sodium per iodate through oxidation reactions on the −OH groups at the C-2 and C-3 positions of the uronic units of sodium alginate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0885328211404265">17</xref></sup> Oxidized alginates possesses many reactive groups and a faster degradation profile than alginate alone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0885328211404265">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0885328211404265">19</xref></sup> For hydrogel applications, crosslinking can be achieved between the available aldehyde on the oxidized alginate and the amino groups from the other polymer by the Schiff- base reaction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0885328211404265">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0885328211404265">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>Gelatin is a natural polymer derived from collagen. It has been shown to be biocompatible in medical applications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0885328211404265">21</xref></sup> However, gelatin is soluble in water and cannot sustain a mechanical load. These limitations of gelatin can be overcome by chemical crosslinking.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0885328211404265">21</xref></sup> Gelatin is a cationic polymer and readily forms hydrogels with alginate or oxidized alginate.</p>
<p>We choose materials that can mimic the properties of bone: gelatin, alginate, and calcium phosphate. Because gelatin is derived from collagen, it has been shown to be biocompatible in medical application. Alginate is a biodegradable polysaccharide that can mimic the extracellular matrix. Calcium phosphate ceramics are biocompatible, bioactive, and osteoconductive. On the order hand, calcium phosphate gradually dissolves and releases calcium and phosphate ions, which are beneficial to bone formation.</p>
<p>In this work, hydrogel composites consisting of oxidized alginate/gelatin/BCP were prepared by crosslinking the amino groups of gelatin and the aldehyde groups of oxidized alginate through the Schiff-base reaction without using any extraneous chemical crosslinking agents. We investigated the effects of alginate oxidation on the cytotoxicity, physical and mechanical properties, and morphological characteristics of this hydrogel. This hydrogel is expected to form a biomimetic microenvironment with a high biocompatibility and biodegradation for bone tissue regeneration.</p>

<sec id="sec5-0885328211404265"><title>Determination of degree of oxidation</title>
<p>The degree of oxidation was determined by measuring the unconsumed sodium periodate before quenching the reaction with ethylene glycol. The difference between the initial and final amount of sodium periodate corresponded to sodium periodate, which reacted with sodium alginate. A 5.0 mL aliquot of the reaction mixture was added to 10 mL of a 10% sodium bicacbonate solution and 2 mL of a 20% potassium iodide solution. After incubation for 15 min in darkness, the standardized sodium thiosulphate solution was titrated with an iodine solution using a 1% sodium starch glycolate solution as an indicator.</p>

<sec id="sec6-0885328211404265"><title>Preparation of hydrogels</title>
<p>The hydrogel composite was prepared in vials from equal volumes of 20% oxidized alginate in PBS and 15% gelatin and 5% BCP in distilled water at 37°C, where the weight ratio of three components was 4/3/1, respectively. The hydrogel without BCP used as control for the EDS analysis was prepared in vials from equal volumes of 20% oxidized alginate in PBS and 15% gelatin in distilled water at 37°C, where the weight ratio of the three components was 4/3, respectively. The mixture was blended by vortex mixture until its state changed from liquid to gel.</p>

<sec id="sec7-0885328211404265"><title>Gelation time of the hydrogel</title>
<p>The test tube inverting method was used to determine the gelation time. The mixture solution, which consisted of oxidized alginate in PBS, gelatin and BCP in distilled water, was added to a vial and sealed tightly screw-capped. The chemical coupling between gelatin and oxidized alginate occurred during cross-linking. The solution was observed by inverting the vial and the gelation time was recorded when the solution stopped flowing.</p>

<p><italic>MTT assay</italic>: The cytotoxicity of the hydrogel was determined using a standard testing protocol (ISO 10993-5). Briefly, the samples were sterilized under UV light for 30 min. The hydrogel extracts were then prepared by placing the hydrogel in DMEM medium at a concentration of 0.1 g/mL and incubated at 37°C for 24 h. After incubation, the hydrogel extract was collected by filtration though 0.2 µm filters to obtain a 100% hydrogel extract. A 50% extract was obtained by diluting the 100% hydrogel extract with DMEM medium. The DMEM medium was used as a positive control and Triton X-100 (1% v/v in DMEM medium) was used as negative control. MG-63 osteoblast cells were seeded in 96 well culture plates, at a density of 3 × 10<sup>3</sup> cells/well. The plate was incubated for 12 h at 37°C. After incubation, the media was discarded and replaced with 100 µL of the hydrogel extracts. The 96-well culture plate was then placed in the incubator for 24 and 48 h, before the viability of the osteoblasts was determined using the MTT assay. At the end of the culturing time, 10 µL of the MTT solution (5 mg/mL) was added into each well. After a brief incubation time, the formazan was dissolved in DMSO and the absorbance of the solution was measured at 595 nm using an ELISA reader (EL, 312, Biokinetics reader, Bio-Tek instruments).

<p>Partial oxidation of sodium alginate is one type of specific reaction that can be used to modify polysaccharides. In this reaction, the vicinal glycols in the alginate are cleaved to form dialdehyde groups. Sodium periodate oxidizes the hydroxyl groups on carbons 2 and 3 of the uronic acid unit which ruptures the carbon-carbon bond and forms two aldehyde groups in the unit.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0885328211404265">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0885328211404265">20</xref></sup> This oxidation causes the proton resonance of the oxidized alginate to shift a lower field in the 1H NMR as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0885328211404265">Figure 1</xref>. The mole ratios of sodium periodate and sodium alginate affected the degree of oxidation of the polymer.

In this study, the sodium periodate feed moles were always lower than 75% of alginate because a high concentration of the aldehyde groups in the oxidized alginate can lead to hemiacetate formation between the aldehyde groups and hydroxyl groups, which would protect the OH groups from further oxidation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0885328211404265">17</xref></sup>

<sec id="sec16-0885328211404265"><title>Gelation time</title>
<p>The gelation time is defined as the time required for the formation and completion of crosslinking in the hydrogel. Hydrogel composites were prepared by crosslinking the gelatin and oxidized alginate while embedding BCP particles. After mixing the oxidized alginate and gelatin/BCP solution, an opaque solid state was formed as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0885328211404265">Figure 2</xref>. The mixed solutions were opaque because the solution contained nano BCP particles, resulting in opaque hydrogel phases after cross-linking. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0885328211404265">Figure 3</xref> shows the effect of the degree of alginate oxidation on the gelation time. A higher degree of alginate oxidation resulted in a shorter gelation time. The gelation time of the hydrogel composite decreased with an increase in the degree of alginate oxidation, which ranged from 739 to 165 s. This is a significant reduction in gelation time, which would be beneficial for practical applications. For injectable systems, a fast gelation time is highly important since this will facilitate the filling of the defect site. The faster gelation time could be explained by the fact that there is a higher concentration of reactive aldehyde groups with a higher degree of oxidation, which would increase the overall crosslinking reaction rate and facilitate gel formation. The cross linking between −OH group and −NH<sub>2</sub> group from alginate and gelatin, respectively is less vigorous compared to that of the −CHO and −NH<sub>2</sub> groups.

<sec id="sec17-0885328211404265"><title>Water uptake</title>
<p>Water uptake, which is the ability of a substrate to keep and diffuse water, by a biomaterial is related to its ability to absorb body fluid and transfer cell nutrients and metabolites and is one of the most important properties of hydrogel-based biomaterials. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0885328211404265">Figure 3</xref>, the water uptake increased with an increase in the degree of alginate oxidation. This indicates that network formation was more efficient when the concentrations of the aldehyde-crosslinkable groups were higher in the polymer solution. In contrast, in the hydrogels prepared from alginates with a low degree of oxidation, a network may have only been party formed due to the lack of aldehyde groups for crosslinking and this could have resulted in the dissolution of un-cross-linked gelatin and lower water retention. This was confirmed by determination of degree of cross-linking of hydrogel (data shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0885328211404265">Table 1</xref>). The number of uncrosslinked ε-amine groups in the hydrogel reacts with TNBS. The higher the degree of oxidation of alginate, higher the degree of crosslinking of hydrogel. As degree of crosslinking increased, the amount of water uptake increased. Based on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0885328211404265">Figure 3</xref>, we can conclude that two of the most important features of hydrogels were enhanced by oxidation and introducing −CHO functional groups in the alginate polymer chain.</p>

<sec id="sec18-0885328211404265"><title>Morphology of hydrogel</title>
<p>The hydrogel system was shown to be highly porous. Unique channelized microstructures were observed. A random branching of the channels was observed as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0885328211404265">Figure 4</xref>. The channels were not continuous and were divided into multiple segments by thin separators that were about 5 µm thick and branched off the 10–25 µm thick hydrogel frame. The image was taken from a lyophilized hydrogel after freeze drying where the degree of oxidation was 66.6%. The pores in the hydrogel system were interconnected and the porosity ranged from 44.45 to 67.89 %. The pores were channel like and the pore diameters were from 100 to 300 µm where the channel lengths were up to 1 mm with medium pore size of 500 µm. The porosity value decreased as the degree of oxidation increased as did the bulk density (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0885328211404265">Table 2</xref>). No gross differences in the pore structure of the hydrogel composites were observed. BCP particles were embedded in the hydrogel, which were not visible at this magnification. However, the EDS data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0885328211404265">Figure 5</xref> clearly indicates that the BCP phase was present in samples where it was added. In addition, BCP has been shown to be biocompatible, bioactive, and osteoconductive.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0885328211404265">12</xref></sup> BCP gradually dissolves to release calcium and phosphate ions which are beneficial to bone formation. However, some studies have reported that BCP can bond directly with host bone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0885328211404265">24</xref></sup> The dissolution of the BCP phase strongly depends on the surface exposed to the physiological environment and cellular activity. The nano phase BCP embedded inside the hydrogel system will come in slow contact with the environment at the outer peripheral surfaces as the hydrogel degrades. BCP loading is very low, which will ensure proper resorption of BCP. Moreover, the highly porous hydrogel will host tissue ingrowth, which will confine the BCP nanopowder-cell interaction within the hydrogel. Successful embedding of BCP within the hydrogel may provide a potential advantage in regards to bone regeneration. The presence of BCP in the matrix of the hydrogel will also produce a reinforcing effect.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0885328211404265">11</xref></sup> The SEM image of the hydrogel in the long directional pore showed that the interconnecting channels may serve as communication and transportation channels for cells and nutrients.

<sec id="sec19-0885328211404265"><title>Compressive strength</title>
<p>The compressive strength of the hydrogel composites demonstrated that an increase in the degree of alginate oxidation resulted in an increase in the mechanical strength of the material as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0885328211404265">Figure 6</xref>. The compressive strength curve of the hydrogel can be described as follows: As the load was slowly increased, the pore walls of the hydrogel bent. Then, the pore walls of the hydrogels gradually collapsed with increasing stress. The compressive strength was determined to be 2.2 ± 0.4, 6.3 ± 0.2, 12.0 ± 1.2 MPa for 49.1, 55.6, 66.6% degree of alginate oxidation, respectively. These results also showed that the compressive strength increased from a low to high degree of alginate oxidation. As mentioned above, a high concentration of crosslinkable groups in the oxidized alginate polymer solution resulted in an increase in the coupling between the two polymer chains, which thereby improved the mechanical strength. Failure in compressive loading of the hydrogels occurred between a strain of 41% and 43%, and depended on the degree of alginate oxidation where the strain was lower for a higher degree of oxidation. A higher degree of alginate oxidation produced a stiffer structure with a higher crosslinked polymer network. The porosity and mechanical behavior of hydrogels are inversibly proportional. The compressive strength curve shows that as the load is slowly increased, the pore walls of the hydrogel become bent and gradually collapse with increasing stress. With higher porosity the wall thickness is reduced bearing lower load and collapsing at lower load. These results show that the network formed by the oxidized alginate, gelatin and BCP exhibited a high mechanical strength. Moreover, these results show that the mechanical strength can be modulated by the hydrogel composition, which will be important to regenerative applications.

<sec id="sec20-0885328211404265"><title>Degradation behaviors of hydrogels</title>
<p>The degradability of the hydrogels was investigated by examining the weight loss of the hydrogels as a function of incubation time in PBS at 37°C. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0885328211404265">Figure 7</xref> shows the degradation profiles of the hydrogel with different degrees of alginate oxidation. The degradation process can be described by the following 2 steps: initially, a small number of crosslinked bonds were broken, which did not damage the whole hydrogel network, but the lattice size of the networks was enlarged, resulting in a large water absorbance. Subsequently, the broken crosslinked bonds reached a critical value and the whole crosslinking network was dissociated, which caused loss of hydrogel. After incubation in PBS for 2 days, all hydrogels displayed an increase in the weight ratio <italic>W</italic><sub>t</sub>/<italic>W</italic><sub>i</sub>, which corresponded with an increase in the degree of alginate oxidation, and at longer incubation times the weight ratio decreased. In addition, as the degree of alginate oxidation increased, the degradation of the hydrogel slowed down. Degradation of the hydrogel was maintained for over 2 months. The hydrogel should be maintained for a suitable time in order to enable replacement of new tissue. In these experiments, at a 66.6% oxidation, the hydrogel degraded to almost one third of its peak weight after water uptake whereas for the 49.1% oxidation hydrogel, almost two third of its mass had degraded. Maintaining the optimum biodegradation rate is crucial for the success of an implant and based on the above data we can conclude that the degradation time of the scaffold can be reliably tuned and controlled.

<p>The MTT assay was used to evaluate the <italic>in vitro</italic> cytotoxicity. This assay is based on the use of tetrazolium salt MTT, which can be converted by mitochondrial enzymes from viable cells into an insoluble blue formazan product. The effects of 100 and 50 vol% hydrogel extracts on MG 63 osteoblast cell viability after 24 and 48 h incubation are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0885328211404265">Figure 8</xref>(a) and (b). In these experiments, the remaining cell viability was over 75% for both 50 and 100 vol% hydrogel extracts after incubation, indicating that the hydrogel extracts were not cytotoxic. The cell viability in the extract solution decreased slightly as the degree of alginate oxidation increased for all extract concentrations. As the degree of oxidation of alginate increased, the number of aldehyde groups that remained on the polymer chain also increased, which led to a reduced biocompatibility. Many previous studies have reported the toxic effect of low molecular weight molecules such as formaldehyde<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0885328211404265">25</xref></sup> and glutaraldehyde<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0885328211404265">26</xref></sup> as well as high molecular weight aldehydes such as dextran dialdehyde.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0885328211404265">27</xref></sup> Because of their reactivity, aldehydes are able to interact with electron-rich biological macromolecules, which can induce an allergic reaction. Cell viability of extract solution decreased slightly after 48 h of incubation when compared with 24 h of incubation because cell viability % calculation is based on positive and negative control samples. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0885328211404265">Figure 9</xref> shows photomicrographs of MG 63 osteoblast cells incubated for 24 and 48 h, respectively. All cells were dead in the negative control. However, the MG 63 osteoblast cells in all hydrogel extracts were well grown, large, and spindle-shaped. More cells were observed on the hydrogel extract at longer incubation times. In addition, the morphology of the cells on the hydrogel extract was similar to the positive control group after 48 h. The MTT assay and the microscopic observation demonstrated that the hydrogel extracts were not cytotoxic towards MG 63 osteoblast cells. Based on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0885328211404265">Figure 9</xref>, it is evident that after 24-h cell proliferation was better with a lower degree of oxidation, which was consistent with the MTT results. However, after 48 h of incubation the effect of oxidation on cell proliferation diminished and a similar proliferation behavior as the positive control group was observed.

<p>In general, the oxidation of the polymer backbone for increased interaction provided a viable way to strengthen the hydrogel system, which was loaded with BCP, without compromising the required biocompatibility. Thus, these hydrogel systems are a very attractive material for tissue engineering applications for hard tissue regeneration and they also may be used for the development of more effective drug delivery systems due to the enhanced bonding capability after the oxidation modification.</p>

<p><italic>In situ</italic> composite hydrogels were prepared using oxidized alginate and gelatin/BCP by the Schiff-base reaction. The water absorbance, degradation behavior, and compressive strength of the hydrogel gels were shown to depend on the degree of alginate oxidation. In these experiments, a higher degree of alginate oxidation was shown to result in a higher degree of crosslinking. In addition, as the degree of crosslinking increased, the amount of water uptake and mechanical strength increased. These composite hydrogels have the advantages of a large amount of water absorbance, good mechanical strength, and suitable degradation time, all of which are important to the regeneration of new bone tissue. The MTT assay and the microscopic cellular observation confirmed that the hydrogel extracts were not cytotoxic towards MG 63 osteoblast cells. Thus, oxidized alginate/gelatin/BCP composite hydrogel may be used for bone regeneration applications.</p>
