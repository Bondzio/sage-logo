<p>If Gayle Sulik set out to merge the personal with the political, the micro-level analytic focus with the macro, and the individual with society, she certainly succeeded in <italic>Pink Ribbon Blues</italic>. Readers beware: prima facie, her thesis is about as popular as telling a child there is no Santa Claus. To suggest that breast cancer advocacy might have a downside is a hard thing to swallow—especially for those who proudly parade their car magnets, perpetually don a pearl pin, wheel out their pink waste receptacles week after week and get tickled over the “support your girls” billboards. These are responsible, even righteous, forms of activism, correct? How could these sincere intentions possibly detract from women’s health? Sulik will tell you exactly how, in this book—but she breaks the bad news so competently and gently, you will be calling her next winter to talk to your kid about St. Nick.</p>
<p>Like a seasoned distance runner, Sulik sets a strategic pace in order to lay the foundation for her thesis. She demonstrates knowledge of the clinical, social, cultural, and personal aspects surrounding breast cancer and breast cancer experiences. In other words, she is multidisciplinary in her approach, and wide ranging in her analytic focus. Granted, many laudable works on breast cancer in the disciplines of medicine, sociology, and psychology preceded Sulik’s book, but they were more specified. These books range from physician handbooks to self-help guides and from critiques of cancer organizations to autobiographies of illness experiences. They are authored by well-known and respected people such as physician Susan Love, political activist Barbara Ehrenreich, sociologist Susan Ferguson and poet Audre Lorde, to name only a few. Sulik ties together most, if not all, of these seminal works and then adds analyses from her own original research, making <italic>Pink Ribbon Blues</italic> perhaps the most comprehensive book, yet, on breast cancer.</p>
<p>Sulik demonstrates her knowledge of the clinical disease aspects which include, but are not limited to, the types and stages of breast cancer, and the tests, therapies, and surgeries involved in diagnosis and treatment. These variations are crucial to understanding the social experience of disease, to which she also attends. On the macro level, she lists and describes the many organizations and industries, throughout history, involved in research and development and fundraising for breast cancer awareness and education. (Hint: the Komen Race for the Cure is not the only game in town. Unfortunately, monies are not pooled nor are research agendas coordinated among the many players.) Here, she uncovers cases of less-than-altruistic philanthropy. An example is the Ford Motor Company. Their Warriors in Pink campaign was, ironically, launched when their image was suffering due to the 2007 industry slowdown and consequent abandonment of employees. Their association with breast cancer advocacy projected that they, indeed, did have a conscience. Sulik reveals conflicts of interest like that of pharmaceutical company Zeneca, which helped manufacture both carcinogenic pesticides and cancer therapy drugs, while at the same time sponsoring National Breast Cancer Awareness Month with the American Cancer Society. (Yes, Virginia, there is more to Santa Claus than meets the eye.)</p>
<p>On the micro level, Sulik analyzes narrative data from hundreds of in-depth interviews with women who had breast cancer. She points out that the iconic attitude promulgated by pink ribbon culture (i.e., positive outlook, uber-femininity, warrior behavior, collective rallying, survivorship) actually ignores men and isolates those women who have doubts, value gender neutrality, are private and—hello!—are dying. She refers to these countercurrent experiences as “shades of pink”; however, based on her claim that pink is infantilizing and sexist, it may be more apt to refer to these alternative narratives as blue, red, green, white and so on.</p>
<p>Though not addressed by Sulik, women over the age of sixty are often among those who are marginalized. To start with, they are not the target audiences of media, despite their being at greatest risk for developing breast cancer. Continuing on a more complex level, they are the cohort born and raised in a period before features of the postmodern era (i.e., consumption, simulation, and voyeurism) gained sway; therefore, they are very likely to have different experiences with illness and with pink ribbon culture. Sulik’s inattention to the modern/postmodern distinction and transition (which accounts for much of the culture of the pink ribbon) is understandable, as her endeavors were ambitious enough, already.</p>
<p>Another theme that emerges from Sulik’s micro-level analysis is that pink ribbon culture trivializes the realities of breast cancer and its treatments. Pink bears and stilettos mock the fear, anxiety, nausea, amputation, organ damage, broken relationships, loss of lives, and currency associated with the disease. Sulik helps readers realize that much of the money spent on kitschy products ends up in the same place as the pink toilet paper.</p>
<p>The final chapter of Sulik’s book is the ultimate kick at the end of a smartly paced run. She has deconstructed the culture behind the pink ribbon in the same way a winning athlete knows they snapped the race tape at the finish line. Her claim is loud and clear: <italic>even identity and advocacy are for sale, but the price is way too high</italic>. She warns “think before you pink.” If you want to do your part to eradicate breast cancer, read <italic>Pink Ribbon Blues</italic> and tell your friends to read it, too.</p>
