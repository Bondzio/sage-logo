<body>
<p>Acute otitis media (AOM) is one of the most frequent infections for which pediatric patients seek medical treatment and the source of a significant financial and sociologic burden in the United States.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599811431228">1</xref></sup> The socioeconomic impacts of AOM stem from cumulative treatment costs and school or workplace absenteeism, thereby resulting in an important public health challenge.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599811431228">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599811431228">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Unfortunately, disparities in health care access and medication affordability for the treatment of AOM are known to occur across different races, ethnicities, and economic strata. Included in these disparities are the known gaps in insurance status among children with AOM living below the poverty level in the United States and the approximate racial and ethnic distribution of these patients in the community.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599811431228">4</xref></sup> Currently, an estimated 30% to 40% of the nation’s children rely on state and federal funding for health care coverage. Regrettably, even with taxpayer-funded health care programs such as Medicaid or State Children’s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), nearly 9 million children remain without health insurance in the United States.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599811431228">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599811431228">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Despite the significant public health implications and financial burden associated with AOM, controversy continues to exist regarding the ideal treatment approach to this pathologic process. Currently, antibiotics remain a mainstay of therapy in the management of many pediatric patients with AOM. However, although antimicrobial medications are often necessary and frequently used, the presence of an uncomplicated AOM is not always an indication for antibiotic use. Over the past decade, guidelines have been developed that recommend the option for observation of patients with AOM, in lieu of antibiotic use, under select circumstances. Regardless, the most recently disseminated guidelines have been met with controversy, and the management principles governing antibiotic use for AOM vary among providers.</p>
<p>Inconsistencies in the management of such a common process would therefore be expected to occur secondary to both controversial guidelines, as well as known socioeconomic inequalities. Although several reports detail the influences of socioeconomic disparities on access to health care, there is a paucity of data that evaluates the impact of race, ethnicity, or insurance status on the specific treatment patterns of AOM at the level of the care provider.</p>
<p>By using a national ambulatory care database, we sought to evaluate antibiotic use and treatment strategies employed for pediatric patients diagnosed with AOM in the ambulatory setting. We hypothesized that patient demographics influences antibiotic prescribing for AOM, and we sought to determine if disparities in health care as they pertain to antibiotic prescribing for AOM in children exist. The influence of race, ethnicity, and insurance status on antibiotic prescribing patterns is assessed; results are discussed in the context of the current literature and evidence-based guidelines.</p>
<sec id="section1-0194599811431228" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>This study was performed using the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) and was determined to be exempt from institutional review board (IRB) review. The NAMCS is a national office visit–based survey administered by the National Center for Healthcare Statistics (a branch of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) and is designed to provide information pertaining to the use of outpatient medical services in the United States. The cross-sectional surveys are performed on an annual basis and designed to generate nationally representative data pertaining to ambulatory health care patient visits. The NAMCS surveys are distributed yearly to non-government-funded physician volunteers in predetermined geographic areas. Physicians are professionally trained in survey data collection prior to a 1-week participation period. During this time period, data such as patient diagnoses, symptoms, demographic characteristics, and management are collected and subsequently compiled into a nationally representative databank. Sample design variables are also maintained to account for probability sampling and weighting to obtain a sample that is nationally representative of care patterns in the United States. The NAMCS data have been previously used to study the diagnosis and management of otitis media and other upper respiratory tract infections in both pediatric and adult ambulatory medical care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599811431228">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599811431228">9</xref></sup> Furthermore, quality standards are continuously maintained by the NCHS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599811431228">10</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="section2-0194599811431228">
<title>Study Sample</title>
<p>All isolated cases of AOM with <italic>International Classification of Diseases</italic> (<italic>ICD-9</italic>) codes 382.0, 382.4, or 382.9 occurring in children (aged ≤16.0 years) <italic>with no other secondary diagnoses</italic> were extracted from the combined NAMCS survey for the years 2006 to 2008. Patients carrying a secondary diagnosis for which antibiotics may potentially be prescribed (ie, acute sinusitis or acute pharyngitis) during the same visit were excluded to prevent diagnostic contamination with other infectious diagnoses. Extracted data were imported into the SAS statistical software program (Version 9.2; SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, North Carolina).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0194599811431228">
<title>Analyses</title>
<p>For each clinical AOM encounter, common demographic data were extracted and tabulated, including patient age, sex, race (black vs white), ethnicity (Hispanic vs non-Hispanic), and insurance type (Medicaid/SCHIP vs private insurance). Each clinical encounter was evaluated for the presence of a new antibiotic prescription among the 8 data fields for medication prescribing in the NAMCS. The univariate influence of each demographic variable on the presence or absence of an antibiotic prescription for AOM was then tabulated and statistically compared.</p>
<p>The top 15 prescribed antibiotics that met reliability criteria according to the statistical analysis guidelines published by the National Center for Healthcare Statistics (NCHS) were evaluated on an individual-encounter basis. Antibiotics were classified using Lexicon Plus (Cerner Multum, Inc, Denver, Colorado), a proprietary database of all prescription and some nonprescription drug products available in the US drug market. For each visit in which a new antibiotic prescription was given, the visit was evaluated for the class of antibiotic prescribed. The frequency of overall antibiotic use was determined, and the individual prescribing frequency for each antibiotic was tabulated.</p>
<p>Statistical analysis was performed to compare proportions of visits with and without antibiotic prescriptions for each demographic variable. Univariate chi-squared analysis was used to evaluate the potential influence of demographic variables on antibiotic prescribing for AOM. A multivariate logistic regression model was computed, incorporating age, sex, race, ethnicity, and insurance type to determine the influence of these demographic variables on prescribing while controlling for potential confounding. Appropriate statistical methods to account for clustering, stratification, and weighting that are part of the survey design of the NAMCS were employed with statistical significance set at <italic>P</italic> = .05.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Acute otitis media is the most common acute illness affecting young children in the United States.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599811431228">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599811431228">4</xref></sup> Although the annual incidence of otitis media may be on the decline in this country, the number of children affected remains high, and the public health implications of AOM are substantial.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599811431228">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599811431228">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599811431228">12</xref></sup> Despite the sociologic and financial impact of AOM, the ideal treatment remains controversial. To further elucidate the current management strategies applied at the level of the health care provider, this report evaluates antibiotic prescribing rates and treatment patterns among patients diagnosed with AOM in the United States. Antibiotic prescribing rates are evaluated in the context of race, ethnicity, and economic status. In this study, economic status is measured as a factor of patients having private versus publicly funded insurance.</p>
<sec id="section6-0194599811431228">
<title>Antibiotic Prescribing Patterns</title>
<p>Because of the commonly seen bacterial etiology and natural history of AOM, antibiotics are the historical mainstay for the treatment of this patient population. Management guidelines have changed over the past decade, but AOM continues to be the most common indication for outpatient antibiotic use in the pediatric patient.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599811431228">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599811431228">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Antibiotics are selected based on their ability to combat the organisms frequently implicated in the pathogenesis of AOM. Despite the susceptibility of most AOM-associated bacteria to narrow-spectrum antibiotics, there has been increased evidence of antibiotic resistance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599811431228">13</xref></sup> Therefore, over the past 2 decades, an overall increase in broad-spectrum antibiotic use has occurred.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599811431228">14</xref></sup> Responding to concerns for the development of such significant increases in antibiotic resistance, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) issued guidelines for the management of AOM in 2004. In these guidelines, amoxicillin was recommended as the first-line antibiotic for the treatment of AOM, and watchful waiting was suggested as an option under select circumstances for children 6 to 23 months of age.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0194599811431228">15</xref></sup> These recommendations were based primarily on studies emphasizing the self-limiting nature of many uncomplicated episodes of AOM of presumed viral etiology, in combination with widespread efforts to avoid antibiotic overuse and the development of drug-resistant pathogens.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0194599811431228">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although the recommendation for watchful waiting may be expected to decrease the overall incidence of antibiotic use for acute otitis media, few changes appear to have taken place since the guidelines were issued in 2004.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0194599811431228">16</xref></sup> When using the 2006-2008 NAMCS data in the study reported here, we were able to evaluate “pure” cases of AOM by excluding other diagnoses for which antibiotics may potentially be prescribed. On the basis of these data, we demonstrate a similar percentage of AOM visits managed without antibiotics (17% ± 2.2%) to that reported using NAMCS data during the 30-month period following guideline publication (13%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1%-17%), suggesting a modest subsequent change, if any. Similarly, the most commonly prescribed antibiotic recognized in this study was amoxicillin, but the prescribing rate in this study (41% ± 3.3%) more closely resembles the preguideline percentages (40%) reported by Coco and colleagues in their 2010 report.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599811431228">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>The rate of beta-lactamase inhibitors prescribed in the current study (16.4% ± 2.1%) remains largely unchanged when compared with postguideline percentages of amoxicillin/clavulanate prescriptions (16%) reported. Third-generation cephalosporins also continue to be a popular antibiotic choice for the management of AOM in the pediatric population. Based on our data, the percentage of third-generation cephalosporins prescribed for AOM appears to remain elevated (14.1% ± 2.2%) when compared with reported preguideline prescribing patterns (7%). The significant increases in prescription frequency of third-generation cephalosporins has been attributed to a more attractive dosing regimen and/or improved side effect profile than is seen with the aminopenicillins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0194599811431228">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0194599811431228">18</xref></sup> When considering both pre- and postguideline literature, it is therefore apparent that clear evidence regarding the use of antibiotics for AOM is lacking. Data from the study presented here demonstrate that most patients with AOM continue to receive antibiotics.</p>

<title>Race, Ethnicity, and Insurance Status</title>
<p>Racial and socioeconomic disparities have long been associated with discrepancies in access to care, the ability to receive insurance coverage, and receipt of preventive care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599811431228">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599811431228">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599811431228">12</xref></sup> At the patient care level, however, the presence or absence of management inequalities is less obvious. As a result, although known inequalities in health care access exist, little is known about the effect of socioeconomic variability on the current antibiotic prescribing patterns for patients who have achieved access to care.</p>
<p>Socioeconomic disparities in treatment patterns may reflect differences in disease manifestations, delays in presentation, or preconceived notions by the physician regarding the willingness or ability to adhere to care recommendations. Similarly, disease prevalence in the patient populations being treated has additional implications that are worth consideration. Although children of different racial and socioeconomic groups are thought to have dissimilar rates of acute middle ear infections, variability exists among the results of reports published to date.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599811431228">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599811431228">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599811431228">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>The increased incidence of AOM demonstrated by some studies to occur in white patients and in children of higher socioeconomic strata has been speculated to be the result of a potential “overdiagnosis” in these populations. This phenomenon is based on the theory that children of higher socioeconomic standing may be more readily evaluated by an informed caregiver or a pediatrician and thus recognized as having an infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599811431228">13</xref></sup> In contrast, nonwhite children may be more likely to have an unrecognized AOM due to a lack of health care education or access to the preventive care that is less prevalent in households of racial and ethnic minorities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599811431228">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599811431228">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0194599811431228">19</xref></sup> Bhattacharyya and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599811431228">13</xref></sup> previously demonstrated that racial and ethnic disparities among children with frequent ear infections significantly influence the access to health care resources in the United States. Other studies similarly demonstrate an increased risk of delayed care and a reduced likelihood of seeing a medical specialist for populations comprising nonwhite children and those coming from lower income households.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599811431228">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0194599811431228">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>As a result of the health care access disparities described, the demographic and socioeconomic stratification of patients receiving medical care for AOM may be expected to inaccurately reflect the actual rate of AOM in the population. However, in the study presented here, the racial/ethnic distribution of children receiving care for AOM is similar to the population distribution for patients with frequent ear infections reported in the literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599811431228">13</xref></sup> Although these findings are indeed interesting, outcome measures are not identical, nor are they necessarily suggestive of an absence of socioeconomic inequalities in health care access. Instead, this may reflect an underrepresentation of patients with AOM in population-based studies or those using household surveys. Alternatively, patients with barriers to health care may ultimately receive treatment for AOM but present with more advanced stages of disease due to access delays. Although disease severity was not assessed in this study, it could be hypothesized that an increased incidence of advanced disease on presentation may result in a subsequent increase in the rate of antibiotic prescriptions in nonwhite patient populations. In this report, however, differences in race or ethnicity did not significantly influence antibiotic prescribing patterns. These results not only suggest that children are being managed for similar manifestations of AOM but also demonstrate that, regardless of race or ethnicity, patients are receiving similar treatment regimens.</p>
<p>In addition to demographic variables such as race or ethnicity, insurance status may potentially influence antibiotic prescribing patterns. For instance, physicians may be more inclined to prescribe antibiotics for patients with Medicaid/SCHIP because of concerns about the difficulty in arranging follow-up assessments. One could also surmise that privately insured patients, despite being seen more often, would be more readily treated for AOM in a conservative “watch-and-wait” fashion, given more accessibility for close follow-up examinations. In the current study, more than two-thirds of patients had private insurance. However, on univariate and multivariate analysis, insurance type did not significantly affect antibiotic prescribing patterns. This again suggests that, despite demographic variability among patients, children are receiving comparable treatment from their care providers. However, because nearly all patients receiving treatment were insured, further conclusions cannot be established based on insurance status alone.</p>

<sec id="section8-0194599811431228">
<title>Study Limitations</title>
<p>Several limitations to this study deserve mention, including those imperfections inherent in the NAMCS data set and the variability among treatment administered by individual physicians. These include discrepancies in physician training and experience among various providers that are not taken into consideration when analyzing the NAMCS data set. Similarly, patient-specific characteristics, including disease severity on physical examination, subjective symptomatology, and parental views on antibiotic use, were not evaluated. Each of these considerations has the potential to influence the diagnosis of AOM and/or the use of antibiotics. This potentially compounds an already prominent level of inaccuracy associated with the diagnosis of AOM. The problematic phenomenon of type I error in this setting results from providers inaccurately diagnosing or, more important, coding processes such as myringitis, tympanic membrane hyperemia, and sterile otitis media with effusion as “acute otitis media.” It is also well established that both viral myringitis and otitis media are frequently misdiagnosed as bacterial AOM, perhaps resulting in the unnecessary utilization of antibiotics. Thus, the data must be viewed as describing practice patterns associated with a “coded” diagnosis or a possibly “presumed” diagnosis of AOM. Despite these drawbacks, the NAMCS has been carefully designed to provide an objective estimate of patient care on a national level and remains the best data set to quantify prescribing patterns at this level.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This study represents a contemporary evaluation of specific antibiotic prescribing patterns seen in the treatment of pediatric patients with AOM. Although guidelines have been established that may be expected to reduce the overall percentage of antibiotic prescriptions for AOM, the vast majority of patients continue to receive antibiotics for the treatment of their infections. The findings of this report also demonstrate that despite the well-known disparities in access to health care in the United States, differences in race, ethnicity, sex, or age do not appear to influence the prescription treatment of AOM at the ambulatory care level. Encouragingly, children are receiving equivalent care in the treatment for AOM once they gain access to their care providers, independent of the widespread variations in demographic backgrounds in this patient population.</p>
