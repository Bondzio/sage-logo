<p>Most health care systems internationally have to face the problem of how to allocate limited resources across interventions and programs. This is true for any collectively funded system, whether financed from general taxation, private or social insurance, or a mix of sources. In part this relates to decisions about which medical technologies to fund and, in particular, whether to devote the system’s resources to the numerous new pharmaceuticals, devices, and procedures that become available each year. Health technology assessment (HTA) offers a broad set of tools to support these types of decisions including systematic review, analysis of clinical studies and routine administrative data, health outcome measurement and valuation, and economic evaluation. Jurisdictions differ in the way they use these tools. Some systems, such as those in Germany and the public sector systems in the US, use largely clinical evidence from trials, perhaps augmented with information on the impact of technology adoption on the system’s budget. In contrast, an increasing number of systems, including those in the UK, Canada, and Australia, inform decisions by synthesizing clinical evidence more formally with data on costs and patients’ health outcomes using cost-effectiveness analysis.</p>
<p>Despite this variety of ways in which HTA is used to support decision making, there are common issues that the HTA research community has sought to inform. The most appropriate ways in which HTA is used to inform decisions is one such issue. For example, in this issue of <italic>Medical Decision Making</italic>, Stevens and Longson describe the process by which the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) uses HTA to support decision making on new pharmaceuticals and other technologies in England and Wales and the challenges faced in using HTA for this purpose.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0272989X13480564">1</xref></sup> Taking an international perspective, Neumann and others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0272989X13480564">2</xref></sup> have reported on the extent to which 14 organizations using HTA to support decisions adhere to a series of key principles suggested by the International Working Group for HTA Advancement and organized into 4 broad areas: the structure of the program, methods, processes, and use of HTA in decision making. The review demonstrated considerable variation across organizations in the extent to which these principles were evident in the process and methods used.</p>
<p>Another important issue relating to the use of HTA to support decisions across a range of health systems is methodological uncertainty: Is the range of available HTA methods appropriate and fit for the purpose of informing decisions? Because many health systems have sought to use evidence and analysis to support resource allocation, questions have arisen about the adequacy of existing practices and the need for methodologists to sharpen the tools in the HTA toolbox. A key challenge, however, is to characterize the major gaps in existing methods and to set priorities for methods research. To a large extent the scientific community has determined these priorities through the work it undertakes. Indeed, there has been a flow of methods research for HTA, much of it published in this journal. For example, this issue sees contributions on the methods of systematic review with the purpose of speeding up the process of identifying new studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0272989X13480564">3</xref></sup>; various methods to estimate parameters relevant to HTA decisions, including the derivation of preference-based measures of health from disease-specific, patient-reported outcome measures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0272989X13480564">4</xref></sup>; the specification of prior probabilities in Bayesian methods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0272989X13480564">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0272989X13480564">6</xref></sup>; decision modeling including the use of multiple cohorts,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0272989X13480564">7</xref></sup> extrapolation methods,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0272989X13480564">8</xref></sup> and the value of reference models (sometimes called “policy” models) to address a number of different resource allocation questions in specific disease areas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0272989X13480564">9</xref></sup>; and the use of decision analysis and value of information methods to guide technology adoption and research prioritization when evidence is sparse.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0272989X13480564">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Given that the public sector in general and health systems in particular fund a large proportion of methods research, it seems appropriate for those using the outputs of HTA to support decisions to identify and prioritize the key methods challenges in the field. The recent Patient Centred Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) initiative on methods research identified a series of priorities including research on patient centeredness, methods for systematic review, and research into methods to enhance the reproducibility, transparency, and replication of patient-centered outcomes research.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0272989X13480564">11</xref></sup> These topics were selected based on the experience of PCORI’s Methodology Committee, which largely consists of academic methodologists, together with some representatives from public research funding agencies and large provider or payer organizations in the US. A similar exercise was undertaken by the Methods Work Group of the National Clinical Translational Science Awards Program Strategic Goal Committee on Comparative Effectiveness Research under the auspices of the National Institutes of Health.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0272989X13480564">12</xref></sup> It identified priority areas to address 3 critical needs for research on patient-centered outcomes: methods to identify and prioritize research questions, methods to improve clinical research studies, and linking the process and outcomes of practice to research priorities.</p>
<p>Methods research prioritization was also undertaken as part of a methodology forum organized by the Institute of Health Economics in Canada and sponsored by the Canadian Agency for Drugs, Technologies and Health, and Health Canada, and 3 parts of the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, organizations with a role in decision making about technologies or research.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0272989X13480564">13</xref></sup> The forum identified a number of areas of HTA methods as research priorities, including routine measurement of patient-reported outcomes, the use of multicriteria decision analysis in decision making, and how to reflect a broader perspective in evaluation including valuing innovation.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most ambitious approach to identifying and prioritizing methods research questions was funded by the UK Medical Research Council (MRC) and focused on research to support the decision-making needs of NICE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0272989X13480564">14</xref></sup> Priorities were identified by those undertaking evaluative research for NICE and those responsible for decision making. A survey was conducted of the views of these groups together with the NICE secretariat and the wider community of methodologists and researchers. Included in the survey were questions about research methods that could reduce uncertainty affecting the ability of NICE’s committees to make reliable decisions. The information was augmented by a workshop of invited participants from similar groups to the survey and a public Web-based consultation process.</p>
<p>An interesting feature of this process was that suggested research priorities varied by professional group. Groups close to NICE, including its academic HTA researchers and decision makers, identified topics such as indirect and mixed treatment comparisons, the synthesis of qualitative evidence, research relating to the use of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), methods and empirical research for establishing the cost-effectiveness threshold, and determining how uncertainty in effectiveness and cost-effectiveness evidence should be reflected in the decision-making process. Additional priority topics from those outside of NICE included methods for extrapolating beyond evidence observed in trials, approaches for capturing benefits not included in the QALY, and methods to assess when technologies should be recommended in the context of further evidence gathering. Following from this review, 9 methods projects were commissioned by the MRC’s Methodology Research Program.</p>
<p>The NICE priority-setting process highlighted some challenges that are likely to generalize to other systems using similar approaches. One is that identifying methodological uncertainties may be easy, but undertaking research to resolve them can be far from straightforward. An example of this is the use of the QALY in HTA: The need for a generic measure of health reflecting changes in life expectancy and health-related quality of life is widely understood in many systems, but so too are the strong assumptions regarding individual preferences embodied in the QALY. An apparently intractable research problem is to identify an improved practical measure that facilitates comparison of costs and benefits across different disease areas.</p>
<p>Another challenge is that there are important uncertainties in decision making that may not be resolved by methods research but which result in uncertainty about which types of HTA methods are appropriate. An example of this is uncertainty about the legitimate objectives of the system: Are they health, well-being, individuals’ choices and preferences, the distribution of such outcomes, or some combination? Furthermore, which resource considerations should be considered (if any): the system’s budget or some wider resource constraint? The choice of these objectives and constraints shapes the appropriate methods for HTA, but many systems lack explicitness about these considerations. A good example of where uncertainty about a system’s remit led to a debate about appropriate methods is the approach to economic evaluation proposed for the Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (IQWiG) in Germany.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0272989X13480564">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0272989X13480564">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>Inevitably, those conducting HTA and seeking to improve research methods will have strong opinions regarding where the focus should be in methodological research, and this writer is no different! But where to start? For the increasing number of systems for which cost-effectiveness is an explicit criterion in resource allocation decisions (and probably for those for which it is not yet a criterion), providing an empirical estimate of the cost-effectiveness threshold that reflects where the opportunity costs of additional expenditure on new technologies fall seems fundamental to making the tools of HTA “fit for purpose.” Some early work has been undertaken in the UK,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0272989X13480564">17</xref></sup> but a large research agenda exists in this area. An important but underresearched area relates to methods to inform early (prelaunch) decisions about which medical technologies warrant further development. Given the billions spent on developing new technologies and the limited evidence about their value that frequently accompanies decisions to make them available to health systems, methods are needed to guide development decisions that are consistent with health systems’ need for effective and cost-effective technologies at launch. There is no shortage of methods challenges in HTA, but there is inevitably limited funding to address these. Although there should always be scope for researchers to initiate their own HTA methods research ideas, these need to be justified on the basis of their impact on decision making. However, further use of more formalized approaches to identifying gaps in methods and prioritizing research concerning these methods is needed focused on the same criterion.</p>
