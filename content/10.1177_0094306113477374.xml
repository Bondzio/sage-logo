<p><italic>The context:</italic> “The baby was a boy. . . I had wanted a girl. Girls never leave their parents completely, as boys do. Also I should rather have looked forward to my child’s having a sheltered life, one in which the fine and beautiful ideals do not have to be molded into the gross, ugly forms of the practical. I may say, in passing, that I deplore the entrance of women into the world of struggle. Women are the natural and only custodians of the ideals. We men are compelled to wander, often to wander far, from the ideal. Unless our women remain aloof from action, how are the ideals to be preserved? Man for action; woman to purify man, when he returns stained with the blood and sin of battle.” (The hero’s soliloquy from David Graham Phillips, <italic>The Plum Tree</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0094306113477374">1905</xref>], p. 121.)</p>
<p><italic>The response:</italic> The “Konstanz School” of literary critics in Germany assembled a faculty colloqium in 1963 that soon produced “reception theory” (or the “aesthetics of reception”; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0094306113477374">de Man 1982</xref>: vii-x), which shortly thereafter formed a vital part of literary studies in the United States, reaching its apogee in the 1980s when the works of its founder, Hans Robert Jauss, were translated into English (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0094306113477374">Jauss 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0094306113477374">1989</xref>). Most sociologists, even sociolinguists and theorists, did not pay too much attention, even though Jauss wrote about “the sociological and aesthetic role concept” and related matters that could in principle have enlivened theoretical discussions at the time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0094306113477374">Jauss 1982</xref>: 134ff). It was not until the British cultural theorist, Stuart Hall, enlarged its utility by means of “encoding and decoding,” including thereby visual, non-literary “texts” like television and movies, that some social scientists, especially abroad, began to think more deeply about how various texts are creatively (mis)understood over time by their intended and unintended audiences, and what this might mean for the “advance” of a discipline’s canonical readings—not to mention for society at large. Similarly, it made sense in view of Umberto Eco’s time-bending novels that in 1965 Eco coined the term “aberrant coding,” another way of understanding how hard it is to interpret “correctly” or “for all time” what an important book might mean to a particular audience—often despite its author’s most adamantly stated intentions. All of this is compounded, of course, when a book becomes world-famous through translation into dozens of languages, as one can imagine when reflecting on <italic>The Merchant of Venice</italic> in German or <italic>Huck Finn</italic> in Arabic.</p>
<p>Of all the modern works that “every” sociologist ought to have read or otherwise know about, perhaps none has suffered more extremely in its wayward reception than Simone de Beauvoir’s <italic>The Second Sex</italic>, now routinely referred to as the Magna Carta of modern feminism, but rejected outright in earlier days. (Beauvoir was born in 1908, three years after the contextual epigraph above by David Graham Phillips appeared, and also three years after Jean-Paul Sartre’s birth.) She referred to it as “a book about women” when in 1948 she promised an old chum from her youthful teaching days that she, Beauvoir, would “write that book you were always talking about” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0094306113477374">Bair 1990</xref>, p.379). When her teaching colleague, Collette Audry, proposed the book around 1934, it reflected Audry’s own highly politicized worldview as a communist, and her wish to expose the downtrodden condition of women from a macro-economic perspective. But busy with political maneuvering, she did not write that “book about women,” intended to vindicate her gender’s role in politics, an avenue of thought about which Beauvoir at that time had no interest whatsoever. By her own admission, Beauvoir viewed the European political world, even in the murderous 1930s, as irrelevant to her personal and artistic concerns until Hitler’s army invaded France. She was first of all, by her own estimate and that of others, a philosopher, and secondly a novelist. It was finally Sartre, overhearing and long remembering these debates between the two youthful women, who told his lifelong partner that it was she, and not Audry, who should write such a book (according to her own testimony; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0094306113477374">Bair 1990</xref>: 325).</p>
<p>So fifteen years later, using only 14 months of hard work between October 1946 and June 1949 (with time out for a stimulating four-month trip to the United States in 1947, and the resulting account, <italic>America Day By Day</italic> [1954] which began in 1948 as magazine articles in France), she wrote <italic>Le Deuxième Sexe</italic>, with occasional help from the likes of Claude Levi-Strauss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0094306113477374">Beauvoir 1965</xref>: 167-68). She planned to call it <italic>The Other, the Second</italic> or <italic>The Other Sex?</italic>, but Jacques-Laurent Bost, a former lover, offered to her and Sartre <italic>The Second Sex</italic>: “. . . we thought it over and that was exactly right. Whereupon I set to work like a beaver on the second volume” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0094306113477374">Beauvoir 1965</xref>: 168; her first important male lover had named her <italic>Castor</italic> [beaver] because of her industrious work habits and serious demeanor, a nickname that stuck). The book appeared as two volumes in France at 972 dense pages in June and November 1949 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0094306113477374">Plessix Gray 2010</xref>). It was a stupendous scholarly achievement, but did not mean a great deal to its author, whose “memoirs and <italic>The Mandarins</italic>“ would become her chosen legacy. She also noted in 1982 that “of all my books it was truly the easiest to write, especially in the beginning. The material just seemed to arrange itself naturally into patterns of analysis” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0094306113477374">Bair 1990</xref>: 321, 371).</p>
<p>Sex sells and it surely worked for her book, initially in France where 22,000 copies flew off the shelves in its first week. This was largely because portions had been serialized beforehand in <italic>Les Temps modernes</italic> (a national magazine founded by Sartre, herself, and others not long before), with excerpts shrewdly titled “The Sexual Initiation of Women” and “The Lesbian,” “Maternity,” plus “Women and Myth” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0094306113477374">Beauvoir 1965</xref>: 175, 185). Everything she wrote on these topics infuriated almost everybody; the Vatican proscribed the book, which of course enhanced sales enormously. Therefore, Blanche Knopf, Alfred’s wife and an editor in their publishing house, heard about the book while in Paris from its French publishers, and believed due to faulty translation (her French being nonexistent) that it was a sex manual “like Kinsey and Havelock Ellis.”</p>
<p>Alfred Knopf asked an emeritus zoologist at Smith College who had reviewed books about sexuality for <italic>The New York Herald Tribune</italic> and knew French science well, to look it over with an eye for its marketability in the United States. Little could he, Howard Madison Parshley (1884-1953), have imagined that after four backbreaking years of work on the book, a stress-induced heart attack, and lots of effort to “get it right,” he would become anathema among Beauvoir’s followers for translating her enormous book the way he did. Knopf wrote to Parshley that “she certainly suffers from verbal diarrhea,” so with Beauvoir’s permission but not any help, about 15 per cent of the book was cut or condensed. Parshley worked diligently, spent time in the hospital because of the associated stress, earned $2750 for his work ($26,342 today), and was rewarded with death from another heart attack three months after the book appeared. This apparently amused Beauvoir who wrote to her American lover, the novelist Nelson Algren, “My poor translator is dead, do you know that? Dead from a heart attack. I guess he could not stand living when not translating <italic>The Second Sex</italic> any longer, life had lost all meaning for him, so he died” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0094306113477374">Beauvoir 1998</xref>; 483). In fact, he succumbed following a rehearsal of a local orchestra in which he played.</p>
<p>Parshley’s archived letters show that he wrote to her in detail many times about his translating strategy and proposed cuts, some of them owing to books in English that she had quoted at length, but which American readers could easily find on their own. She was non-responsive or truculent about his suggestions, but when the book appeared on February 23, 1953, she wrote glowingly to Knopf: “I find the book superb, the translation seems excellent to me” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0094306113477374">Bair 1990</xref>: 436), an endorsement she recanted in 1985, calling it “a white lie.” A chorus of Parshley-bashing has since sprung up in the United States, which finally helped prompt a second translation in 2009 at a cost of $50,000, shared between publishers and the French government. Some of Parshley’s former critics have denounced the latest English version as being even worse than his, except that the new one includes all the material Parshley omitted, about 145 out of 972 pages. (The expanding literature about this “translation war” will surely inspire a dissertation or two, and already includes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0094306113477374">Glazer 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0094306113477374">Grosholz 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0094306113477374">Moi 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0094306113477374">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0094306113477374">Plessix Gray 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0094306113477374">Romano 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0094306113477374">Simons 1983</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0094306113477374">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0094306113477374">Smith 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>It became a best seller (over a million copies in France, twice that many abroad), gave its author financial independence for her remaining years, and even renewed her reputation in her homeland, where American best-seller status was taken seriously. If some reviewers disliked her and her book,she was unfazed, so it seemed, “laughing all the way to the bank.” When the Bantam Books newsstand paperback edition appeared in 1961, it featured a quasi-pornographic cover of a young, thin, naked female, which must have disappointed certain readers once they understood the stark contradiction between the book’s contents and the cover art. And in 1979 the Franklin Press offered a “leatherbound” edition, signed by the author, which now sells for several hundred dollars on the used-book market. In fact, ABE Books currently offers nearly 350 copies of the book, including an $1800-copy of the first French edition, even without author’s autograph. Clearly, this book continues to live, 65 years after its composition.</p>
<p>One of the most interesting critics of the Knopf edition was the noted fiction author Katherine Anne Porter, who wrote angrily to Parshley about her work being misrepresented in <italic>The Second Sex</italic> (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0094306113477374">Beauvoir 1953</xref>: 357): “Only a zoologist trained to the rigors of the scientific method could, I feel sure, keep his head to the end of Mlle. de Beauvoir’s excursion into nightmare. . . what <italic>sex</italic> can she be talking about? . . . I could recognize neither men nor women as she described them. She lives I am afraid in that strange borderland neither male nor female; a pitiable state. Her book has a kind of phosphorescent brilliance, the real night-shine of decay. . . she not only comes near what we may accept as truth in many things, but symbolic truth as well; and then with a twist of that disordered mind, she perverts the whole thing just enough to spoil it” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0094306113477374">Bair 1990</xref>: 438). The book was widely reviewed, sometimes at length, and by all sorts of readers, and it is here, in its “reception,” that there lies a fascinating story. In fact, the book’s history as a cultural document will eventually, if it has not already, outdo in importance the book’s actual content, as an inspiring statement about “woman” or “a woman” (a subtle distinction in translation which has fomented lots of debate).</p>
<p>Part of readers’ stark responses to both the French and the English versions was due to Beauvoir’s personality, which permeated the book, and about which much could also be divined from her novels, then even more from her public statements and memoirs. She was not a “really nice person,” to use today’s favored positive characterization. In fact, when she dealt with anyone outside what she and Sartre called The Family (a small group of admirers, lovers, students, and colleagues), she put into practice “equal opportunity rudeness,” at least by non-French standards: “I didn’t mind being rude to get what I wanted” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0094306113477374">Bair 1990</xref>: 214). This is worth noting, not to be catty (as it were), but to help explain why her book was not “embraced” by its earliest audience in the same warm way that other often lesser books have been, owing to their authors’ widely known warm-heartedness or general affability.</p>
<p>A young French journalist explains how Beauvoir’s interactional armor worked: “I met her for the first time in 1970. It was not exactly a warm meeting—not on her part anyway. . . Simone de Beauvoir came into the room. She gave me a brief irritated look, and then quickly, almost brusquely, reminded Sartre that they had to go to a press conference. Then she sat down at Sartre’s desk at the back of the room to wait. She bristled with impatience. I could sense her annoyance at the delay and was embarrassed. It was my first experience of Simone de Beauvoir’s ‘<italic>tête de chameau</italic>,’ her notoriously dismissive manner when situations or people do not suit her. Much later, I realized that she is a very uncompromising person” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0094306113477374">Schwarzer 1984</xref>: 11-12). Beauvoir’s main biographer elaborates on this young woman’s observation: “Beauvoir was not usually considered a sympathetic figure. Indeed, for many who knew her but were not members of the magic intimate circle of the Family, she was considered ‘formidable,’ ‘distanced,’ ‘cold,’ ‘arrogant, ‘superior,’ or, in the words of a surprising number of French women of her generation, ‘not like us, different’“ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0094306113477374">Bair 1990</xref>: 383; and endnote 13). An author’s character might be considered trivial and irrelevant to a balanced assessment of a book, except for the fact that in this case the book is intensely personal in tone and intention—she often said it was a book “about myself,” about her need for self-clarification, which for a professional philosopher is no small matter.</p>
<p>The book, despite its great cost ($10 then, $86 today), 750 pages, and pervasive existentialist jargon (partly obscured by Parshley’s unfamiliarity with Sartre’s ideas) was very widely reviewed, and with great passion. The most interesting experiment in attempting to “tame” the book and make it comprehensible to the literate American public was the February 21, 1953 issue of <italic>The Saturday Review [of Literature]</italic>, appearing three days before the book itself. The editors assembled a reviewing team that included Karl Menninger (famous psychiatrist), Philip Wylie (allegedly misogynist writer and editor), Ashley Montagu (famous and popular anthropologist), Phyllis McGinley (self-identified “housewife” and poet from Larchmont, New York), Margaret Mead (another famous anthropologist, specializing in sex-roles), and Olive Goldman (U.S. representative to the UN Commission on the Status of Women, and professional French translator). They were given a lot of space (pp. 26-31, 41) to assess the book. This symposium is well known to Beauvoir scholars because of its organizational uniqueness, but also because the sentiments of the group—which would have been accepted by the magazine’s audience as high-powered intellectuals—were decidedly mixed, and tending toward the negative.</p>
<p>Menninger had nothing good to say: “the author attempts to put in twenty-four pages what Helene Deutsch summarized in two large volumes (<italic>The Psychology of Women</italic>)”; “a rather disorganized presentation of material, interspersed throughout with the author’s comments and interpretations”; “a brief and totally inadequate chapter on prostitutes and hetaerae. . . then back again to a repetitious summary”; the translator “has done a beautiful job in spite of the occasional slip”; “the author’s thesis is that whereas our society treats men as subjects, existents, and transcendents, it treats women as objects, beings, and immanents. These are largely metaphysical antinomies. . . This book is, in short, a scholarly and at the same time a pretentious and inflated tract on feminism. Hence, it is intrinsically tiresome and it is made more so by the author’s compulsion to repeat each idea many times, often in almost the same words as well as in paraphrases”; “The author repeatedly describes sexual relationships in the sense of sadistic violence to which the helpless woman has to submit. Woman in the ‘humiliating posture of defeat’ is invaded, violated, penetrated, polluted, and so forth”; “It is clear that Mlle. de Beauvoir is not intimately familiar with the content of modern thinking in psychoanalysis regarding feminine satisfactions and dissatisfactions”; “Mlle. de Beauvoir’s picture of an aggressive male cavalierly oppressing and abusing women in lustful glee is largely a fantasy. Every psychiatrist sees a dozen women complain of the passivity, dependence, and/or impotence of their husbands to one who complains of his ruthlessness”; “This is not to deny that women are frustrated, but so are men.” He then suggests that he wrote more accurately of these matters in <italic>Love Against Hate</italic>, a bestseller for decades. He also claims that lots of clinical data from his practice and that of other analysts in the United States contradicts Beauvoir’s (French) understanding of sexuality in general, and of male sexuality in particular.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, Philip Wylie, maligned author of <italic>Generation of Vipers</italic> (1942) where “Momism” was coined, adored the book: “it makes a fresh contribution to awareness that cannot be missed any more than the contributions of Freud, say, or Einstein, or Darwin—without the onset of a private ‘cultural lag’.” His review is short, but pleased. Ashley Montagu’s credentials as a right-thinking anthropologist were sealed with <italic>Man’s Most Dangerous Myth: The Fallacy of Race</italic> (1942). He saw “it is a great book. . . it ranks next to John Stuart Mill’s <italic>The Subjection of Women</italic>.” However, “As for the idea that ‘in a properly organized society where children would largely be taken in charge by the community, and the mother cared for and helped, maternity would not be incompatible with careers for women,’ I think this is a very dangerous suggestion. Ideally I don’t see why it shouldn’t work, but the quality of wisdom it would require in the community is frankly more than we could, as realists, expect within the next few hundred years at best—and Mlle. de Beauvoir writes for the present and the immediate future.” He then adverts to Plato, experiments in Russia, modern kibbutzim in Palestine, and so on, as examples of how poorly the practice of collective child-rearing works.</p>
<p>Phyllis McGinley, poet housewife, writes ironically: “Shame on me! What right have I to go about my humdrum tasks, wearing so cheerful a face? How can I traitorously sing as I add water to the frozen orange juice or put the slice of bread in the electric toaster? How do I dare take pleasure in flavoring a stew or designing a slipcover for the sofa? These are the labors of ignominy”; “The whole fierce, scholarly, stupendous, preposterous book is readable as a novel and twice as romantic.” As did many other reviewers, McGinley argues that Beauvoir underestimated the liberated postwar condition of American women, utterly “foreign” to the situation for women in France, who to that point hardly had the vote and could not get contraceptives nor abortions: “Who’d want to settle for simply being a man? It is such conviction of their own good fortune which, erroneous or not, may lead American women to regard this enormous treatise as curiously old-fashioned.” McGinley’s face graced the cover of <italic>Time</italic> on June 18, 1965 and she won the Pulitzer Prize in 1961 for a book of “light verse.”</p>
<p>Along with Ruth Benedict, for several decades Margaret Mead was the female anthropologist who mattered to a broad public. She wrote briefly: “To appreciate it properly, <italic>The Second Sex</italic> must be recognized as the work of a French woman novelist who has drawn with high personal selectivity from a large number of fields. . . and who has cast her work in the form of a piece of specialist non-fiction, which is exactly what it is not”; “The most curious point in the book is the author’s absolute failure to recognize anything creative in maternity. . . By refusing to include the structure of the human body in her theory, by denying childhood sexuality, by denigrating maternity, she constructs a picture in which the only way a woman can be a full human being is to be as much like a man as possible. The whole book is an impassioned, often overly elaborate, statement of the misery a gifted woman can feel in twentieth-century France, where contraception is forbidden and the number of abortions equals the number of births, where marriages of convenience are just going out, and where women have traditionally hidden their strength behind male figureheads. The book is very French in, among other things, the curious, essentially timeless, mythological handling of ‘antiquity’ and the ‘the primitive’; in the acceptance of Lesbianism and the disapproval of male homosexuality; in the bland identification of France as ‘the modern world,’ so that the past was a prelude to French civilization, and the present and future are seen uncritically in French terms, which are regarded as self-evident.”</p>
<p>Lastly, Olive Goldman praises the Knopf edition: “Professor H. M. Parshley’s translation has real verve. Also, judging from a comparison of certain puzzling passages with the French text, he has been conscientious even to the point of identical use of italics. Still, the format of the American edition is a vast improvement over the French, not only in typography and paper but in the paragraphing, which breaks up the solid mass of the original into more readable pages, and in the addition of an excellent index.” Later readers agreed that the U.S. edition was more useful than the original French version. “So much of the book seeks to demonstrate that woman is confused, abused, and downtrodden that this reviewer wonders if she is herself blind in regarding a number of women. . . as complete persons, happy and even useful citizens like the men of their families, even though supported by them.” She then points out that women in the Soviet Union are treated badly, despite propaganda to the contrary.</p>
<p>As an experiment in reviewing a challenging text, the <italic>Saturday Review</italic> gambit seemed to work a certain magic, since the anger that Menninger felt, the thrill from Wylie, kudos from Montagu, denunciation from Mead, and so on, all pointed to an <italic>interesting and important</italic> book which sold very well as an expensive clothbound item, and then by the millions in paperback during the 1960s and 1970s for the Boomer student audience. Like Marx’s <italic>Capital</italic> (to which it was compared), it was probably more often used as a totem, a symbol of defiance, than actually read, but as such it occupied a unique place in the modern feminist canon. That the author did not regard it as particularly important among her own works adds somehow to its fascination.</p>
<p>Other important writers reviewed the book when it first appeared, such as Dwight Macdonald and Elizabeth Hardwick. In <italic>Partisan Review</italic>, probably at Macdonald’s instigation, Hardwick wrote at length, “The Subjection of Women,” from which the famous quotation came: “this madly sensible and brilliantly obscure tome” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0094306113477374">Hardwick 1962</xref>: 167). She went on: “The effort required for this work must have been killing. . . I take up the bewildering inclusiveness of this book, because there is hardly a thing I would want to say contrary to her thesis that Simone de Beauvoir has not said herself, including the fact, mentioned in the preface, that problems peculiar to women are not particularly pressing at the moment and that, by and large, ‘we have won’“ (<italic>ibid</italic>.: 168-169). Hardwick seemed to admire the book, but from a safe distance: “<italic>The Second Sex</italic> is so briskly Utopian it fills one with a kind of shame and sadness, like coming upon old manifestoes and committee programs in the attic. . . Childbearing and housekeeping may be repetitive and even intellectually stunting. Yet nothing so fills one with despair as those products of misplaced transcendent hope, those millions of stupid books, lunatic pamphlets, absurd editorials, dead canvases and popular songs which have clogged up the sewers and ashcans of the modern world, representing more wretched labor, dreaming, madness, vanity, and waste of effort than one can bear to think of. There is an annihilating nothingness in these undertakings by comparison with which the production of one stupid, lazy, lying child is an event of some importance” (<italic>ibid</italic>.: 175). This is a crushing verdict upon Beauvoir’s worldview and labors, even if delivered with delicacy.</p>
<p>Sally Wood, a critic in <italic>The Kenyon Review</italic>, made unusually informative points: “One should remember that Sartre gave shape to Existentialism under the German occupation, during the Resistance. Its thinking requires that history be considered a conflict and that when there are two groups one be considered as oppressing the other. Miss de Beauvoir follows the Existentialist plot which tends to be like a poster, all black and white. She goes even further. A great deal of the book is written from the point of view of this imaginary aggressive male . . . It may be interesting to note that the over-aggressive male doesn’t appear in Miss de Beauvoir’s novels. Her men are realistic modern men, influenced by as much as they have influence upon women” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0094306113477374">Wood 1953</xref>: 486). She makes another uniquely intriguing connection: “Miss de Beauvoir’s long arguments about women’s sex being inferior have telling points but, oddly enough, one can come out at the same place by taking the opposite path. Everything is reversed if one reads the chapter called “The Dynamo and the Virgin” in <italic>The Education of Henry Adams</italic>. In 1900 Mr. Adams was convinced that force was embodied in woman (everywhere except in America which was too Puritanical)” (<italic>ibid</italic>.: 488). The chapter in question sports several observations that Beauvoir would have enjoyed, e.g., “Nothing in education is so astonishing as the amount of ignorance it accumulates in the form of inert facts” and “The Woman had once been supreme; in France, she still seemed potent, not merely as a sentiment but as a force; why was she unknown in America?” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0094306113477374">Adams 1990</xref>: 352, 356).</p>
<p>Finally we come to our colleagues, sociologists who reviewed the book for their peers. Margaret Park Redfield (daughter of a Chicago School founder, wife of a noted anthropologist) lambasted the book in <italic>The American Journal of Sociology</italic>. (There was no review in <italic>ASR</italic> or <italic>Social Forces</italic>.) In a lead review of unusual length for its time, Redfield refers to Beauvoir as “the extreme feminist personality type. To enter the world of Simone de Beauvoir is to come into a world in large degree vanished from the American scene” (Redfield 1953: 269). “The simple fact is that Simone de Beauvoir is not interested in common humanity, male or female, but in gifted woman kept from full expression by man-made limitations.” Redfield is concerned that Beauvoir disapproves of marriage since it “‘kills love’ and ‘mutilates women’“. . . Lesbianism (though not male homosexuality) is found to be natural and, as an an attitude, ‘at once motivated and freely adopted,’ quite defensible” (<italic>ibid</italic>.: 270). She dismisses the principal message of <italic>The Second Sex</italic> with a sentiment that was sounded in a number of reviews: “In spite of all this, many young women in America will assert that, having attained most of that economic and political freedom for which the early feminists struggled, they are now freely choosing to become wives and mothers.” She noted as well that such women often had careers.</p>
<p>A. R. Mangus (Ohio State University and the Langley Porter Clinic at the University of California) wrote in <italic>Marriage and Family Living</italic> that the book was “a work of great merit.” Beauvoir’s analysis of female sexuality was “exceedingly frank and objective. . . Some of the subjects in these chapters might lend themselves to pornography and sexual arousal. It is not likely, however, that their reading will awaken any erotic sensitivities in the inexperienced female. The more likely effect is sex repulsion and perhaps frigidity as a result of the unpleasant descriptions of the potentialities of sexual exploitation of women by men.” Because of Beauvoir’s “low estimation of homemaking, of wifehood and motherhood. . . One is led to wonder what is to become of the family and family life when women finally achieve the transcendence that Mlle. de Beauvoir advocates.” Yet he concludes, worries aside, that “this book will be read for generations to come as a great expression by a transcendent woman” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0094306113477374">Mangus 1953</xref>: 276-277).</p>
<p>Howard W. Jones, Jr., writing in <italic>The Quarterly Review of Biology</italic>, acknowledged the book’s philosophical interest, “but there is considerable doubt in my own mind that it should be classed with serious scientific works. . . the thesis presented by Mlle. de Beauvoir may have more application to the European than the American female” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0094306113477374">Jones 1954</xref>: 420). Marynia F. Farnham, MD reviewed the book for <italic>The Annals of the American Academy</italic>, and was not impressed: “Mme. de Beauvoir is particularly disturbed and angry at the dependency she finds in the position of women. . . [quoting Beauvoir] ‘love represents in its most touching form the curse that lies heavily upon woman confined in the feminine universe, woman mutilated, insufficient unto herself.’ It hardly seems necessary to elaborate upon such a statement with its extraordinary lack of insight. In spite of its erudition, this book does not provide an objective evaluation of the position and problems of women in today’s social organization. It is rather an intensely personal document: one woman’s outcry against her nature, the exposure ofher unregenerate rebellion against herfemininity” (Farnham 1954: 178). What Dr. Farnham could not have known was that Beauvoir was enduring the wrenching realization that she wanted badly to be with Nelson Algren in Chicago rather than with Sartre in Paris at the very time she was writing about the tortures of being in love with a man, now fully documented in her own letters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0094306113477374">Beauvoir 1998</xref>). It was a trying time for her to write an “objective” portrait of heterosexual love.</p>
<p>The noted sociological prose stylist, Robert Bierstedt, could be counted upon to render the longest, most subtle and interesting response to <italic>The Second Sex</italic>, which he wrote for <italic>The Antioch Review</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0094306113477374">Bierstedt 1954</xref>). He took on the heavy task of studying not only Beauvoir’s behemoth, but also the Kinsey report on female sexuality, Mirra Komarovsky’s <italic>Women in the Modern World</italic>, and a potboiler by Ashley Montagu, <italic>The Natural Superiority of Women</italic>. Bierstedt’s response is not so negative as many others, but not too bowled over as her fans, either. “For over seven hundred pages the author sustains a seething indignation over the relative position of the sexes. With a bitterness which feeds upon all the resources of an extensive scholarship she resents the fact that woman is not the first but only the second sex. Woman is vassal, slave, receptacle, utensil. She is conquered, subdued, vanquished, in sexual encounter as in life. Man takes, woman gives. Man acts, woman waits” (<italic>ibid</italic>.: 228). Like others, Bierstedt mentions the “exceptionally lucid translation of H. M. Parshley” (p. 229). He then gives a workmanlike summary of the book’s main theoretical points. He calls Beauvoir “an extraordinary—and an extraordinarily brilliant—woman. One is frequently astounded and steadily impressed by her erudition. She is also profound. . . She has a penchant for paradox.” And yet, of course, the other shoe must fall: “Audacious and subtle as our author often is, she is also, as mentioned above, overly clinical, repetitious, sometimes inconsistent, and even, at moments, bizarre. A deep and driving melancholy pervades her pages. Life and its processes oppress her. Menarche, defloration, parturition, and menopause—all these submerge the woman in the pullulation of the race and rob her of her existence as a person. We should not quite like to dismiss this as nonsense. But we should like to suggest that it has little to do with woman’s sex as such. It involves instead the inexorable and irreversible passage of time, time which is the enemy of everything that lives “(p. 232).</p>
<p>The transition in tone and substance from reviews of the first English translation, now 60 years old, to later commentaries on Beauvoir’s letters, diaries, and manifestoes is shocking, and not only for marked changes in syntax and practical concerns manifested by reviewers of her own age when compared with today’s. The direction of interests has altered. Now, rather than studying her analysis, say, of D. H. Lawrence’s or Stendhal’s treatment of women in their great oeuvres (Beauvoir 2009: 229-236; 252-260), much of the discussion centers around her originality as a philosopher, separate from Sartre (an identity she never claimed nor seemed to long for), her lesbian identity (which she publicly denied), her perplexing relationship with various women and men, sexually and otherwise, and her anger at not being cited by later feminists as the inspiration to them she believed herself to be. Much of this comes out in Louis Menand’s impishly titled “Stand by Your Man” in <italic>The New Yorker</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0094306113477374">Menand 2005</xref>), prior to the second translation’s availability. In a long piece Menand uses the Beauvoir-Sartre letters to show that they shared female students sexually, criticized them privately and for the sake of humor, and were as thoroughly engrossed in each other’s minds for 51 years as any two people can be, while often making the lives of those around them miserable. Beauvoir was banned from teaching French high school girls in 1943 because of her apparent affair with a young student, especially tricky at the time when German occupation authorities would imprison perpetrators of “unnatural acts” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0094306113477374">Bair 1990</xref>: 277ff). By today’s standards, in Menand’s telling, Sartre and Beauvoir would be in prison for their intimacies with students. Yet by 1945 they were the intellectual leaders of Paris, hence of France, and no-one questioned their “private arrangements.”</p>
<p>Given all this, it remains worthwhile to read the book (using Parshley’s translation for pleasure, the new one for completeness) with two viewpoints in mind: as a document of its time and one woman’s record of weighty “existential” discomfort, and then as a foundational text for the feminism that came after, acknowledged or not. One wonders, of course, if today’s young women will read it with a level of passionate interest equivalent in its own way to that of the American women who “needed” it in the 1960s and 1970s.</p>
