<abstract>
<p>In the aftermath of the 2009 national elections in India a number of commentators observed that Indian party politics is a dynastic affair. Why is this the case? This paper claims that absence of a party organization, independent civil society associations that mobilize support for the party, and centralized financing of elections has led to the emergence and sustenance of dynastic parties in India. The paper assesses the impact of dynastic parties and shows that not only are party systems more volatile when parties are dynastic but more important, dynastic parties serve to make the political system less representative.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Some political parties in India are dynastic: the top leadership comes from within a family. Consider the Congress Party, where the top leadership has stayed within the Nehru family, starting with Nehru himself and flowing to Indira Gandhi, Sanjay Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi, Sonia Gandhi, and now Rahul Gandhi.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1354068811406995">1</xref>
</sup> A whole slew of regional parties follow a similar pattern, where the top leadership remains within a single family.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1354068811406995">2</xref>
</sup> These state-level parties include the Akali Dal in Punjab; Shiv Sena in Maharashtra; National Congress Party of Maharashtra; the DMK (Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam) in Tamil Nadu; the Telugu Desam of Andhra Pradesh; the Biju Janata Dal in Orissa; and the Samajwadi Party of Uttar Pradesh. In the aftermath of the 2009 national elections there has been commentary in newspapers and on television in India and elsewhere noting the dynastic nature of Indian party politics.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1354068811406995">3</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Not all parties in India, however, are dynastic. For instance, the Communist Party of India (Marxist), the Communist Party of India, and the right wing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) are not. The empirical question this paper addresses is why some parties in India are dynastic and others are not. After providing some reasons for what sustains a dynastic party, the paper turns its attention to assessing the impact of dynastic parties. It shows that dynastic parties lead to greater party system instability and a representation deficit. By representation deficit I mean that voters are less likely to see dynastic parties as representing the interests of the voters.</p>
<p>Consistent with other work in the area (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1354068811406995">Kurtz, 1989</xref>), a dynastic party is defined as a party which has seen at least one or more successions that are all within a family and which result from the choice of a family member by the existing leader to be the next head of the party. The new leader is not selected through a free and fair election. I further argue that two factors influence whether a political party is dynastic. First, there must be an organization that can provide a base of support for a politician who seeks to challenge the existing leader. This organization can either be a party organization, which has rules and procedures or internal democracy to elect its leaders, or an independent civil society association that the party depends on for mobilizing voters and/or financial support. When there is no independent party organization or civil society association supporting the party, dynastic succession is far more likely. If there is a robust party organization or civil society association supporting a party then a party leader is far less able to handpick a successor. Second, if party finances are (used either for a campaign or other operations of a party) are illegal (often) and centralized with the leadership of the party then the party leader will likely pass the baton to a chosen one.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1354068811406995">4</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Why is this question important? There are four reasons. First, as I will show, there is more party instability when dynastic parties dominate the party system. Second, dynastic parties contribute to a representation deficit. The voters perceive dynastic parties as less representative. Third, this paper tries to address a theoretical concern which comes from an observation by Alan Ware that ‘one of the least examined subjects in the field of party politics is how a party’s internal structures affect how that party relates to other parties in the system: such as in how it competes against its opponents, or how it co-operates with them, or whether it seeks to merge with any of them’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1354068811406995">2007</xref>: 2). I show that dynasticism, as a form of party organization, has a significant impact on how a party behaves in relationship to other parties. Fourth, dynastic parties do not fit into the present system of classifying parties. How would one classify these parties? The electorally successful and relatively long lasting dynastic parties are a different species of party, since they contain elements of a mass party (in that they appeal to large masses and the electorate identifies with the party image, not particular people) but they are also different in that they are tied organizationally to particular individuals and families. These parties contain elements of the ‘legislative-electoral parties' in that they have no real permanent organization and are created by the ‘insiders' and are elite-led (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1354068811406995">Gunther and Diamond, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1354068811406995">Sartori, 2005</xref>) – except that the elite are within a family. These parties are closer to the personalistic parties as identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1354068811406995">Gunther and Diamond (2003)</xref>, but are not exactly personalistic parties because, while they are indeed leader-centered, the parties do not disappear after the leader of the party is no longer around.</p>
<p>Section I shows that in contemporary India dynastic leaders exist in most political parties, with clear exceptions being the Communist Party of India (CPI), the Communist Party of Indian Marxist (CPI(M)), and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). This section also uses data from an elite survey conducted in 1993 to show that clear organizational differences mark the non-dynastic/organized parties in India (CPI(M) and the BJP) and the dynastic parties. Section II develops an explanation for the emergence and sustenance of dynastic parties while discussing possible alternatives as well. Section III provides evidence from India that is supportive of the theoretical claims made in the previous section. Sections IV and V discuss the impact of dynastic parties. Section IV shows that dynastic parties make the party system more volatile while Section V discusses the representation deficit associated with dynastic parties. Section VI concludes the paper.</p>

<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1354068811406995">Table 1</xref>
 shows that dynastic control of political parties in India is fairly common. With a few notable exceptions of states such as West Bengal, Rajasthan, Kerala, and Madhya Pradesh, the top leadership position in most political parties is reserved for a family member.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1354068811406995">5</xref>
</sup> Dynastic control is common for a wide range of political parties at the state level, some of which are more ethnically or caste based (such as the Samajwadi Party of Uttar Pradesh), ideologically right-wing and fundamentalist (the Shiv Sena in Maharashtra), and others that are more ‘catch-all’ (Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam in Tamil Nadu; and Biju Janata Dal in Orissa).</p>

<p>The internal organization of these dynastic parties is systematically different from the non-dynastic parties. Analysis of a survey conducted of party elites in Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Kerala in 1993 reflects this. In total, 538 state-level party elites were interviewed.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1354068811406995">6</xref>
</sup> Respondents belonging to dynastic parties observed that having experience was far less important for obtaining a position in the party (only 48 percent of the respondents thought that experience was necessary for a position in the party) compared to respondents belonging to non-dynastic parties (where 70 percent felt experience was necessary for a position in the party). Dynastic parties are also more faction ridden (with 40 percent of respondents belonging to dynastic parties answering in the affirmative when asked whether there were factions in the state parties, compared to 15 percent of those in non-dynastic parties answering in the affirmative).</p>
<p>Party elites in these parties also have less allegiance to the party than in non-dynastic parties. Respondents were asked if the strength of their party originated in the organization and cadre or leadership and/or ideology. Fifty-six percent of respondents in the non-dynastic parties said that the strength of their party was its organization and cadre, whereas only 26 percent of those in dynastic parties thought similarly. Non-dynastic parties were far more organized, with only one in twelve respondents saying that there was hardly any control from above whereas one in four respondents from dynastic parties observed that there was hardly any control from above. Respondents from non-dynastic parties were also more ‘attached’ to their parties than those from dynastic parties. Respondents were asked to place their attachment to their party on a 1–10 scale (10 being high) and the average score for those in dynastic parties was 8.35 compared to 9.00 for those in non-dynastic parties. As <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1354068811406995">Table 2</xref>
 shows, the difference was statistically significant.<sup>

<p>Is there a selection bias at work in that only those who have ‘family ties' join dynastic parties, while in non-dynastic parties familial relationships are not significant in determining whether an individual joins the party or not? The 1993 elite survey asked whether the respondent had a family member who was active in politics. Forty-six percent of the respondents who belonged to dynastic parties did have a family member active in politics. At the same time, 44 percent of the respondents in non-dynastic parties affirmed their family ties. This virtual non-difference in the means belies any concerns about selection bias.</p>
<p>Could these differences between dynastic and non-dynastic parties be accounted for by other factors such as gender, place of residence (such as rural/urban), the education level of the respondent, or state-specific factors? To assess whether these results hold up controlling for these alternatives, a logistic model was estimated with the presence or absence of an organization as a binary dependent variable. The independent variables are: whether a party is dynastic/non-dynastic, place of residence, gender, educational level of the respondent and the state of the respondent. None of the demographic variables are significant. Respondents belonging to dynastic parties are indeed likely to say their parties have weaker organizations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1354068811406995">Table 3</xref>).</p>

<title>II. Dynastic political parties: The role of organization and finance</title>
<p>
<italic>Prima facie</italic>, a party leader would want to appoint a successor, especially if the party organization and finances are centralized in the leader. Japan provides an instructive example. In the 1990 general elections, 170 second-generation members ran for election to the Diet and 125 were elected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1354068811406995">Fukui and Fukui, 1992</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1354068811406995">Fukui and Fukui (1992)</xref> attribute this to the electoral rules that led candidates to develop ‘highly individualistic campaign organizations built by and for particular Diet members and aspirants' (p. 30). They claim that since these organizations are ‘expensive to build, it terms of both money and effort invested, these organizations are valuable assets that are closely guarded by the incumbents and, upon their retirement or death, often passed on to their heirs, usually relatives or staffers' (p. 31).</p>
<p>If this is the expected state of the world, then a more appropriate question is: what are the conditions that prevent a leader from appointing a successor? There could be two plausible sets of arguments. The first, and the focus of this paper, are based on the internal organization of a political party. I claim that dynastic parties have three organizational characteristics. First, the parties do not have an organization that is independent of the ‘elected’ wing of the party; the executive and the organization are one and the same. Second, dynastic parties do not rely on an independent civil society association for mobilizing support. Third, in dynastic parties, fund raising is centralized in the party leadership, although this could also be the case in non-dynastic parties.</p>
<p>Why does party organization matter? An independent party organization, to which a politician can be elected independently of the party leader, provides competitors to the leadership within the party with their own independent base of power. Civil society associations that support a political party can exercise significant control over the party leadership because they both mobilize electoral support and raise funds for a party. Money is also important. As long as politicians can raise their own finances they can assert some independence from the party. Funding from voters and/or independent interest groups provides politicians not only with money but also with a base from which to mobilize electoral support. If the political party raises and distributes funds centrally then it is extremely difficult for an individual politician to mount an independent campaign for power or to challenge the leadership.</p>
<p>A good example of the influence of party organization and civil society associations comes from the Labour Party in the United Kingdom. The Labour Party Organization has provided competitors to the party leadership with a base to mobilize support against the leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1354068811406995">Shaw, 1988</xref>). In the UK, Brown’s challenge to Blair, and Thatcher’s removal, were both engineered through the organization of the Labour Party and the Tories. Civil society associations which support the Labour Party – such as the Trade Unions – have exercised significant control over the party leadership because the unions both mobilized electoral support for the party and raised funds for the party (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1354068811406995">Shaw, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1354068811406995">Tsebelis, 1991</xref>). When a party neither has an organization nor can base its support on a social organization, then those who might seek to rise within the party have no basis on which to challenge the existing party leadership.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1354068811406995">8</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>This argument differs from other possible explanations for the sustenance of dynastic parties. One possible line of reasoning would attribute these differences to underlying cultural factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1354068811406995">Banfield, 1958</xref>), but if that were the case all Indian parties would be dynastic (especially the more traditional right-wing parties). As we have observed, that is not the case, as all kinds of parties – catchall, ethnic and ideological – are dynastic. Nor do the differences arise for a matter of size. In India, political parties of all sizes – from the large Congress Party to smaller parties such as the Shiv Sena – are dynastic, while some other large parties such as the BJP are not. An explanation that is now gaining some prominence in the Indian literature stresses the role of finance, suggesting that since parties need to raise black money the politician would rather keep the illegal funds in the family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1354068811406995">Sridharan, 2006</xref>). While this is intuitively plausible, the Communists and the BJP also raise black money but are not dynastic.</p>
<p>In addition to the intra-party organizational characteristics, environmental factors could lead to dynastic parties. An explanation, developed by economists, is that familial ties are more likely to dominate in weakly-institutionalized environments, especially where gains from private benefits of control are large (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1354068811406995">Burkart et al., 2003</xref>). This claim is akin to observations by political scientists that family and kinship are more important in unstable times and especially when the political economy yields dividends from political control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1354068811406995">Vilas, 1992</xref>). In other words, a fragmented party system in which control over the executive yields large dividends to the party in power is more likely to generate dynastic parties. This is indeed plausible cross-nationally, but in India all political parties in India operate in the same ‘environment’ yet only some are dynastic. A second, and perhaps more compelling, argument is that in weakly-institutionalized party systems the leadership remains within a family since a name-bearing dynastic successor inherits the brand name appeal of the name and the party simultaneously.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1354068811406995">9</xref>
</sup> Other politicians associated with the party are aware of the value of this brand name and therefore acquiesce to a dynastic succession. This is the case in Pakistan where, after Benazir’s Bhutto’s assassination, her husband Asif Ali Zardari was anointed a caretaker party leader until her son (and Zulfikar Ali Bhutto’s grandson) was ready to take over the party. A similar argument is made for India by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1354068811406995">Sisson (1990)</xref>. In India, however, since all political parties do not rely on this leadership based branding, I focus more on the organizational characteristics that lead some parties to be dynastic but not others.</p>

<title>Dynastic parties</title>
<p>The Congress Party – the largest dynastic party – has always had a weak organization. At the national level the party organization did have some independence from the executive in the two decades following independence. Since 1969, however, the Congress Party has had virtually no national party organization nor any independence from the executive or the Gandhi family except for the period 1991 to 1998. The party does not rely on any independent civil society associations to mobilize electoral support for it. Funding the party’s operations has been largely centralized since the early 1970s. The national party raises more funds for election campaigns compared with other parties.</p>
<p>The Congress Party’s electoral dominance was initially built on its image as part of the nationalist movement and also on its ability to function as the major link between state and society (which was facilitated by its control over the state). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1354068811406995">Manor (1981</xref>: 26) notes:<disp-quote>
<p>[W]hen the British withdrew in 1947, Congress quickly and smoothly took control of the machinery of the state at all levels. Congress then became India’s central political institutions, more important than Parliament or the civil service or any other formal institution of the state… [and] the party’s operatives soon came to dominate the civil service so that the formal machinery of the state was subordinated to the needs and demands of the party.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>While the Congress Party did support a party organization at the national level, in the districts the story was completely different (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1354068811406995">Ali, 1959</xref>). Myron Weiner reports an interview with a Congressman in Guntur who said:<disp-quote>
<p>My belief is that there is no Congress party organization in India. Congress has identified itself completely with the government machinery. When the government is lost, then Congress will disappear… I have yet to see a meeting of the Congress workers. They only meet when some minister comes. Otherwise they do not meet to pass resolutions or carry on any party business. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1354068811406995">Weiner, 1967</xref>: 176)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Nehru, as early as 1955, realized that the executive controlled the party organization at the local level. Addressing a conference of the Presidents of the Pradesh Congress Committees and the leaders of the Congress legislative parties, Nehru observed that in Congress the party boss had become the organization’s leader.</p>
<p>Despite these weaknesses at the local level, the Congress Party had a national organization that did, on occasion, influence the actions of the executive. In the early 1960s, a plan by an organizational leader, the President of the Congress Party, Kamaraj, led to radical changes in the cabinet. All of this changed with the arrival of Indira Gandhi. After the split of the Congress in 1969, the Indira Gandhi-led Congress made the organization of the party subservient to the executive. Since then, the leadership of the Congress has resided largely within the Gandhi family, with the exception of the period 1991–1998.</p>
<p>Political parties in India are notoriously secretive about their financing. Nonetheless, there is general agreement that:<disp-quote>
<p>[F]or the Congress, membership dues always played a small part. As early as the 1960s donations from large industrial houses played a major part. An increasingly large part of this came from the black money economy which grew rapidly under the public sector-led, import substituting industrialization model … With the centralization of the Congress Party after the 1969 split, Mrs. Gandhi being both the Prime Minister and party President, began to directly oversee fund collection. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1354068811406995">Sridharan, 2006</xref>: 322–3).</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>I interviewed a senior private sector executive who had given money to political parties in the 1980s. He said that the Congress High Command would generate a list that specified the amount of money to be provided to the Congress party by each business house. The party would keep meticulous records of how much money each business house provided and also of how much was disbursed to each candidate during an election. In some instances the central party organization would ask the business house to give money directly to a candidate. In his experience, this centralized nature of fund raising was unique to the Congress. The BJP also raised money from business houses centrally but it also raised more money locally, whereas the Communists did not engage in this process. Informal observations in the 2009 election reveal that candidates rely on the central party leadership for financing their election campaigns. Sometimes the party leadership puts a candidate in touch with ‘financiers' who, while beholden to the party leadership, provide funds directly to the candidate.</p>
<p>The other dynastic parties – whether they are centrist, ideologically right wing or ethnic/caste-based parties – show similar characteristics. Many of these parties have the same organizational characteristics as the Congress party: they are centralized and do not rely on independent association for mobilizing electoral support. In 1982, N.T. Rama Rao created the Telugu Desam Party in Andhra Pradesh. This centrist party ostensibly represented the interests of all the Andhra people when it came to power in 1983. At the time of its launching the party had ‘no organization worth its name’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1354068811406995">Suri, 2006</xref>: 281). N.T. Rama Rao:<disp-quote>
<p>[T]hought that the party organization at best was an extension of his self … [he] nominated all its top functionaries including the members of the politburu, executive committee and the heads of other party wings. The president nominated the party functionaries at the district levels too … (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1354068811406995">Suri, 2006</xref>: 288)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>A ‘palace coup’ in 1994 left the party in the hands of N. Chandrababu Naidu, N.T. Rama Rao’s son-in-law. Under Naidu, power in the party and government remains centralized in the party leader (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1354068811406995">Suri, 2006</xref>). With the Telugu Desam Party, the party organization is subservient to the leader, and the party relies on few or no independent social associations for mobilizing electoral support. The TDP does not have an elaborate organizational structure. Its apex decision-making body is a 14-member politburo headed by Naidu, the TDP’s only leader. There is no second-rung leadership in the party and Naidu does not encourage such a leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1354068811406995">Manor, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Bal Thackeray controls an ideologically right wing party – the Shiv Sena of Maharashtra, a fundamentalist right wing party. After its inception in Mumbai ‘in 1966 … [when it] had only an informal organizational structure’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1354068811406995">Palshikar, 2006</xref>: 257), the party has developed an organizational presence in many parts of Maharashtra. Despite this organizational proliferation, ‘Thackeray never allowed any doubts to be raised as to his pre-eminent position in the party’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1354068811406995">Palshikar, 2006</xref>: 260). Since 1999, Bal Thackeray’s son Uddhav has gradually been accepted as the next leader (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1354068811406995">Palshikar, 2006</xref>: 261–2). The Shiv Sena is both a movement and a party, although the party dominates the movement. The party is not tied to any other independent social association. In fact, it has its own social associations that owe allegiance to the party such as its own trade unions, including the Bharatiya Kamgar Sangh, the Shramik Sena, the Cotton Workers Sena, the Municipal Workers' Union, the Co-operative bank Employee’s Union; its women’s wing, the Shiv Sena Mahila Aghadi; its consumer protection association, the Shiv Sena Grahak Samrakshan Kash; and a students' union, the Vidhyarthi Sena (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1354068811406995">Palshikar, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Caste based parties such as the Samajwadi Party of Uttar Pradesh follow a similar path. Mulayam Singh Yadav, who is now promoting his son as the next leader, controls the party. The Samajwadi Party ostensibly relies on the Backward Castes, especially the Yadavs, for electoral support. However, the party has no formal relationship with the Yadav Mahasabha – the caste group of the Yadavs – and does not rely on that group to mobilize support for it during elections. The Rashtriya Janata Dal of Bihar, also a Backward Caste party, is centralized and dynastic, with the wife of the founder leader, Laloo Yadav, being appointed Chief Minister when the party was in power in Bihar. The Bahujan Samaj Party – the Dalit Party – is similarly organized. The party is centralized and without an organizational basis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1354068811406995">Jaffrelot, 1998</xref>). The party leader, Mayawati, controls the party. While the BSP did originate in a social movement – the BAMCEF and then the DS4 – the party is now independent of both associations. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1354068811406995">Jaffrelot (1998</xref>: 50) notes that while:<disp-quote>
<p>[T]he DS-4 has not been dissolved. BSP workers told me that it was now the party’s youth wing, in charge of agitations such as the one in favor of reservations. But no action has been held on behalf of the DS-4 over the last 15 years.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In the case of the BSP, fund raising is quite openly centralized. For Mayawati’s birthday celebrations there were clear instructions to party coordinators to collect at least Rs 300,000 (about US $6000) from each of the 400 Assembly segments.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1354068811406995">10</xref>
</sup> The absence of caste associations on whom the party relies for support implies that it is extremely difficult for another politician to oppose the current party leadership and this provides the leadership with far more flexibility to define a succession.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1354068811406995">
<title>Non-dynastic parties</title>
<p>The non-dynastic parties in India, by contrast, have a party organization that is not a rubber stamp for the executive. These organizations, furthermore, have rules for membership and advancement. Party funding is also more diffuse, not controlled only by the party leader or the top echelon of the party.</p>
<p>In the 1950s and for the early part of the 1960s the Congress party was not dynastic and its funding model was indeed different. In this period, while the party’s organization was indeed weak, at the local level –especially in rural areas – the landed elite controlled the party. For the first national elections in 1952 the party had neither the organization nor the financial resources to compete nationally. The Congress relied upon individual candidates to raise their own resources for electioneering. This is in sharp contrast to today when the party raises money centrally and then shares it with its nominees for election. Further, it was legal for industrialists to fund political parties untill Indira Gandhi made that illegal in 1969. The legality of corporate donation was restored in 1985.</p>
<p>The main non-dynastic parties in India are the Communist Parties – especially the Communist Party of India and the Communist Party of Indian (M) – and the right wing Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party. The Communist Parties of India have relatively well-functioning organizations. For both the CPI(M) and CPI, the party organization exercises some independence relative to the executive wing of the party. Even in a state like West Bengal where the CPI(M) has been in power for almost three decades, the party organization can and does determine the policies adopted by the executive.</p>
<p>The BJP too has a functioning party organization. Elections are held for the post of party president and the organization retains some independence from the elected wing of the party. In addition, the BJP has always relied on a social association – the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) – to mobilize support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1354068811406995">Andersen and Damle, 1987</xref>). Many of the current BJP leaders came to the party through the RSS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1354068811406995">Baxter, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1354068811406995">Graham, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1354068811406995">Jhangiani, 1967</xref>), and the RSS has a fair bit of sway over the BJP as far as electoral mobilization for the BJP is concerned. For the 1980 general elections, the BJP strayed too far from its right-wing Hindu agenda, and as a result the RSS did not mobilize votes for it leading to a resounding defeat for the BJP at the national polls. The RSS has often pressured the BJP to adopt particular policies especially those related to its cultural agenda.</p>
<p>For funding its party activities, the Communist parties rely on membership dues, mass collection drives, and charges on the salaries of its elected representatives. The trade unions also raise money for the parties. In the case of the CPI(M), which is in power in West Bengal, industry contributions to the party’s coffers are negotiated with the trade unions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1354068811406995">Sridharan, 2006</xref>: 325). When the BJP was a smaller party, it relied on collections from small and medium businesses, money that was raised and spent locally. Once the BJP came to power, however, it centralized fund raising, but with one notable difference from the Congress: ‘party funds were under the control of state party officers' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1354068811406995">Sridharan, 2006</xref>: 324). The central party would aid the deficit states by transferring funds to those states. More importantly in the BJP, some funds are still raised by constituency-level party offices and candidates themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1354068811406995">Sridharan, 2006</xref>).</p>

<title>IV. Dynastic parties and party system instability</title>
<p>What is the impact of dynastic parties? In this section I show that party volatility is higher when political competition is between dynastic parties. Why should this be the case? Ambitious politicians must have some reason to stay in a dynastic party, especially when they know that the top positions are taken. But the internal organization of the current party of these politicians is only half the story; they must also evaluate the other options that are available to them. Ambitious politicians will stay in dynastic parties only when there are no other options. This can happen either when the dynastic party appears to be the ‘only game in town’ or when the other parties are not willing to accept ‘defectors' from the dynastic party. The first situation is widely observed in the Philippines, where many politicians switch allegiance to the party of the President after an election. In conditions where one party is likely to win elections no matter what, one can expect ambitious politicians who seek either to influence policy or gain some club and/or private goods stay in that party. Politicians in other circumstances, however, would like to move up in a party, and if other options are available an ambitious politician is unlikely to remain in a dynastic party.</p>
<p>The second situation can be observed in India where politicians switch partisan allegiance but only when the other party will offer them a better position. This is, however, unlikely if the other party itself has a well-developed organization. Politicians in that organization will be more resistant to ‘defectors' joining their party as that has a direct bearing on their chances to move up the ladder. A non-dynastic party is far less likely to accept a newcomer because members of such a party would resist the lateral entry of a new politician who would – just by entry – affect the career possibilities of politicians who have already paid their dues. I interviewed a senior bureaucrat who held an important political position in the BJP government. I asked him why he did not join the BJP. He said that he could have but then he would have had to start far lower down than his current (albeit temporary) assignment. Lateral entry, according to him, in the BJP was far more difficult than in the Congress, with whom he had good contacts as well. This is not the case for a dynastic party. A dynastic party – since it is controlled by a leader – has far fewer constraints in permitting lateral entry as the decision on the position of an incoming politician is made only by the party leader. Of course, in some cases ambitious politicians set up their own party; especially when they feel that they can have a seat in government.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1354068811406995">11</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Examples of such behaviour in India abound in centrist, ideological and caste-based parties. In Andhra Pradesh, where the Telugu Desam is a dynastic party, ‘those who considered themselves number two in the party could not continue for long’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1354068811406995">Suri, 2006</xref>: 289). Some have left the party – either to form new parties or to move to other parties such as the Congress. Similarly, with the Shiv Sena, a leader, Chhagan Bhujbal, who ‘was instrumental in the expansion of the party’, was not given the top position in the legislature by Thackeray and ‘felt sidelined by this and left the party to join the Congress along with a drew MLAs' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1354068811406995">Palshikar, 2006</xref>: 261).</p>
<p>In Uttar Pradesh, where three of the four parties that compete for power – the Congress, the SP, and the BSP – are all dynastic, the outgoing assembly, the 14th Vidhan Sabha of Uttar Pradesh (2002 to 2007), had a record number of splits, mergers and disqualifications. The assembly session began with sixteen parties, but only eight remained by the end.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1354068811406995">12</xref>
</sup> The Congress and the BSP split. A segment of the BSP even joined the Samajwadi Party largely because the latter controlled the state government.</p>
<p>If we expect ambitious politicians to exit dynastic parties, we expect that in those Indian states in which dynastic parties dominate electoral politics competitive politicians would be more likely to move from one party to the other.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1354068811406995">13</xref>
</sup> Or, depending on the situation, they might form another party. In states where the main competition is between the dynastic and non-dynastic parties, the party system should be more stable, with fewer people moving from one party to another. In other words, there should be more parties in states where only dynastic parties compete, greater electoral volatility, and more independent candidates winning seats and votes. To test these hypotheses I examined the effective number of parties, electoral volatility, the seats won by independent candidates, and the votes received by independent candidates in dynastic and non-dynastic states. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1354068811406995">Table 4</xref>
 summarizes the results. A simple <italic>T</italic>-test shows that dynastic states have more parties, greater electoral volatility, and that independent candidates are more successful in terms of the votes they receive and the seats they win. The final row in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1354068811406995">Table 4</xref> reports the sign, value, and significance of the coefficient of a party organization variable (whether the party was dynastic or not) drawn from four separate OLS regressions with the dependent variables being the effective number of parties, electoral volatility, and the seats and votes won by independent candidates. The control variables in all models were turnout, ethnic fragmentation, the growth rate in per capita income and a time variable that captured the 1970s, 1980s, and the 1990s, since Indian politics is said to be more volatile in some decades compared to others.</p>

<p>It could be argued that ideology and whether a politician defects from or joins a party significantly overlap in India, since there are fewer movements in and out of the ideological (left and right) and hence if one finds lower volatility and party switching in states where the competition is between dynastic and non-dynastic parties one should not be surprised since the ideological chasm is rather large. Without denying the significance of ideology, the experience of the BJP in the Southern states somewhat belies this criticism. In Karnataka, for instance, where the BJP had a very weak electoral presence and a weak organization (the RSS is quite weak in the South), the party gained electoral prominence through defections. It was able to do so quite easily since there was not as much opposition possible to other politicians coming into the party. Once the party had gained electoral prominence, however, there was a lot tension between the newcomers and the old timers who had ‘paid their dues'.</p>

<sec id="section8-1354068811406995">
<title>V. Dynastic parties and the representation deficit</title>
<p>Does the presence of dynastic parties have an effect on political representation? How do I understand political representation? Without prejudice to the various claims and counter claims about whether political representation is a coherent concept, a consensus exists that political representation in a democracy (an institutional arrangement in which some group of voters elects a representative) entails authorization, a sympathetic relationship between the voters and the representative (either as advocacy and/or as stand in representation), and accountability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1354068811406995">Rehfeld, 2006</xref>; Urbinati, 2006). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1354068811406995">Urbinati (2000</xref>: 774) states this succinctly when she observes that political representation is the idea that:<disp-quote>
<p>a constituency must authorize a person (party) to represent them; that person (party) must act in some way to pursue her constituents' interests; and finally, the constituency must have some ability to hold that representative accountable for what she did. </p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The values of each of these terms could, however, vary widely; a fact that gives representation a multifaceted slipperiness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1354068811406995">Pitkin, 1967</xref>). Despite this elusiveness, contemporary theorists of representation agree that the three terms authorization, ‘substantive’ acting for, and accountability, are necessary for any case to be properly classed as ‘representative’. One way of determining the degree of political representation is asking voters whether their representatives (political parties and members of the legislature) have a sympathetic relationship with the voter – i.e. do they look after the interest of the voters or not? Since dynastic parties are inherently centered around the interests of particular individuals and families we would expect that they would be perceived as less representative of the interests of the voters.</p>
<p>In a national survey conducted in 2002, respondents were asked whether the first, second, and third parties in their area represented the interests of some citizens, all citizens or they did not know or could not say.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1354068811406995">14</xref>
</sup> The latter two responses were combined into one category – these were respondents who thought the parties represented no-one, since they could not identify whether a party represented particular interests. Forty-one percent of the respondents did not think that the first party in their area represented anyone’s interests and this number jumps to 50 percent for the second party and 64 percent for the third party. In the survey we also asked respondents whether the Member of Parliament (MP) and Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) cared for the interests of some, all, no-one or they did not know or could not say. Once again, we combined the latter two responses to indicate those elected politicians who were perceived as caring for no-one. Sixty-five percent of the respondents could not identify whose interests the MP represented and more than two in five of the respondents could not identify whom the MLA cared for. I then standardized the responses to the various questions, generated z-scores and then added them to create a variable that scored the extent to which the political system is perceived as representative. The standardized variables range from low values for politicians who represent the interests of no-one, to higher values for parties and politicians are seen as caring for someone. Negative numbers mean worse perceptions of representation. Since the survey did not include a question that asked the vote choice or preference of the respondents I assessed the nature of party competition in each of the primary sampling units (the state assembly constituency from which the respondent was selected). I then determined whether the nature of party competition (between the two major parties in the assembly constituency) in that assembly constituency was between dynastic parties, a dynastic and a non-dynastic party, or non-dynastic parties. The results are quite striking. In those assembly constituencies where only dynastic parties competed, parties and politicians were seen as far less representative than when there was even one non-dynastic party in the electoral arena (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1354068811406995">Figure 1</xref>

<p>It could be argued that including the ‘don’t know’s in an index of representation is not appropriate, and it is perhaps better to report the proportion of respondents who believed that the parties represent all, some, or who did not know.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1354068811406995">15</xref>
</sup> Analyzing the data this way provides results that are broadly supportive of the claims made from the data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1354068811406995">Figure 1</xref>. In assembly segments where non-dynastic parties compete for votes, 15 percent of the respondents reported that parties represent all, whereas in those assembly segments where only dynastic parties competed, 9 percent of the respondents felt that parties represented everyone.</p>
<p>A second test of the impact of dynastic parties on voters comes from the 2004 national election study.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1354068811406995">16</xref>
</sup> In that study, since there were direct questions on vote choice, I could distinguish those who voted for dynastic parties from those who did not. Since the survey did not address representation directly, I analyzed the impact of dynastic parties on citizen perceptions of the efficacy of their vote. What I found is that respondents who voted for a dynastic party were less likely to say that their vote had an effect compared to those who voted for a non-dynastic party. The difference was 4 percent and was statistically significant at 0.00 using the non-parametric Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.</p>

<title>VI. Conclusion</title>
<p>This paper makes an initial attempt to understand why some parties are dynastic. It posits that the internal organization of a party influences whether a party is dynastic or not. It has shown that three conditions can lead to a party becoming dynastic. First, the party should not have an independent party organization. Second, the party should not rely on an independent civil society association that will mobilize voters for the party. The third condition suggests that funds for the party must be collected and disbursed centrally. The paper then showed that the presence of dynastic parties leads to greater party system instability and also to a representation deficit.</p>
<p>Dynastic parties are more common than we imagine, and similar patterns may be found in other places. Jon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1354068811406995">Martz (1992)</xref>, writing on Colombia, observes that party organizations were weakly institutionalized and that leadership was based largely on kinship. Vilas observes that Nicaraguan parties were run through kinship and that this was true in El Salvador and Costa Rica as well. The most pronounced case of families running parties is in the Philippines, where the party system is characterized by a lack of intra-party cohesion and a lack of party organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1354068811406995">Hicken, 2007</xref>). Parties in the Philippines, quite unusually, often invite ‘guest candidates' – candidates of other parties – to run under their banner without formally switching parties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1354068811406995">Hicken, 2007</xref>). While there are structural reasons for this (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1354068811406995">Hicken, 2007</xref>, for details), Philippine politics is also characterized by strong parties that have ‘usually … acted as coalitions of powerful families' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1354068811406995">McCoy, 1993</xref>: 8). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1354068811406995">McCoy (1993</xref>: 24):<disp-quote>
<p>many politicians try to transform their electoral offices into lasting family assets, building what Filipinos call a ‘political dynasty’. Once entrenched, influential politicians often work to bequeath power and position to their children …</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>But, unlike in India, in the Philippines powerful political families are local, and hence funds to run campaigns flow more locally than in India where the funds are gathered either at the state or national level by dynastic parties.</p>
<p>Needless to say, the contrasting experiences of Latin America, the Philippines and India suggest that more work should be done to determine the relative impact of the internal organizational characteristics of a party and the environmental factors within which party competition occurs before we can assess which of these leads to dynastic parties.</p>

<p>Manmohan Singh, the current Prime Minister of India, said in a rally held for the Uttar Pradesh elections that ‘Rahul Gandhi is your future. He is sweating it out for you. Only one chance is needed to make this state a new Uttar Pradesh’. Singh told an election rally, his first during the current assemly polls: ‘Let’s make a new Uttar Pradesh, just like [late Prime Minister] Rajiv Gandhi dreamt of making a new India 20 years ago’ (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ibnlive.com/news/rahul-gandhi-is-ups-future-manmohan-singh/top/385944.html?xml&amp;news=Rahul%20Gandhi%20is%20future%20of%20UP:%20PM&amp;pubDate=Mon%2C+16+Apr+2007+01%3A06%3A10++0100&amp;keyword=ibn_home">http://www.ibnlive.com/news/rahul-gandhi-is-ups-future-manmohan-singh/top/385944.html?xml&amp;news=Rahul%20Gandhi%20is%20future%20of%20UP:%20PM&amp;pubDate=Mon%2C+16+Apr+2007+01%3A06%3A10++0100&amp;keyword=ibn_home</ext-link>).

<p>In the current national cabinet, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1354068811406995">Sanghvi (2009)</xref> notes, ‘Farooq Abdullah is the second generation of the political dynasty founded byhis father Sheikh Abdullah. (His son Omar is Chief Minister of J&amp;K.) Prithviraj Chavan is from a well-known Maharashtra political family. Salman Khurshid’s father was a minister in Indira Gandhi’s government. Dayanidhi Maran is the son of Murasoli Maran, a minister in A.B.Vajpayee’s government and is a close relative of M. Karunanidhi. Selja is the daughter of former Union Minister Choudhary Dalbir Singh. G.K. Vasan is the son of G.K. Moopanar. M.K. Azhagiri is the son of M. Karunanidhi. Parneet Kaur is the wife of former Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh. Ajay Maken is the nephew of noted Delhi leader, the late Lalit Maken.Bharatsinh Solanki is the son of former External Affairs Minister Madhavsinh Solanki.D. Purandeshwari is N.T. Rama Rao’s daughter. Tushar Choudhary is the son of the former Gujarat Chief Minister Amarsinh Choudhary. Jyotiraditya Scindia is the son of Madhavrao Scindia. Sachin Pilot is the son of Rajesh Pilot. Jitin Prasada is the son of Jitendra Prasada. R.P.N. Singh is the son of former Union Minister C.P.N. Singh. Prateek Patil is the grandson of former Maharashtra Chief Minister Vasantdada Patil. Agatha Sangma is the daughter of former Lok Sabha Speaker Purno Sangma. D. Napoleon is the nephew of former state minister K.N. Nehru, who made him his personal assistant.’ Singhvi then goes on to say that ‘on a TV programme on Thursday, Neerja Choudhary, who was a fellow-guest with me, predicted that if this trend continued, within five years we would reach a situation where the political class would become a self perpetuating dynastic elite. She was right.’ (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.virsanghvi.com/CounterPoint-ArticleDetail.aspx?ID=300">http://www.virsanghvi.com/CounterPoint-ArticleDetail.aspx?ID=300</ext-link>). For the 2009 Maharashtra assembly elections the ‘Congress has finally given tickets to Vilasrao Deshmukh’s son and Sushil Kumar Shinde’s daughter for the Maharashtra Assembly elections. Amit Deshmukh will contest from his father’s bastion Latur while Praniti Sinde will also contest from his father’s constituency Solapur’. (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ndtv.com/news/india/maharashtra_congress_heirs_get_tickets.php">http://www.ndtv.com/news/india/maharashtra_congress_heirs_get_tickets.php</ext-link>).

<p>How would we classify parties that have no national-level families in charge but where there is a lot of family control at the local level? It is difficult to get systematic data on local families. Whether a party is dynastic or not depends on the level at which decisions for the entire organization are made. So, for instance, if the Congress party at the national level decides who the leaders in a particular state should be we should be examining succession at the national not state level. In fact, there is currently pressure on the national Congress to anoint the son of the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh who died in a helicopter crash as the party’s leader in the state. The decision is not being made by the state Congress party but by the national leadership.</p>

<p>In the US, party organizations are relatively weak (compared, say, to the British Labour Party) but parties have deep societal roots with social organizations mobilizing support for and financing political parties. Politicians in the US can lay claim to the vote of particular social segments. Further, politicians raise their own finances. For these reasons dynasties in party leadership are far less likely. There have been local dynasties in the US – the Perez dynasty in Palquemines Parish in Louisiana is a good example. Perez controlled the party organization, held elected office, and controlled party finances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1354068811406995">Jeansonne, 1977</xref>).</p>

<p>The logic behind this intuition is being fully developed and tested in an agent-based model with Ken Kollman. The question we seek to answer there is: when will parties split and when will they coalesce to form bigger parties? In this model the agent is located in a hierarchy (in a tree form) and movement to another party depending on what you see as benefits from leaving and from staying. In simple formal terms the there are <italic>i</italic> agents and <italic>n</italic> parties, and within each party there is a rank <italic>R</italic> which is layers of rank; and <italic>r</italic> is a particular rank; <italic>t</italic> is the time period; <italic>w</italic> = 1 or 0 where 1 means your party wins. At any one moment in time an agent <italic>I</italic> is in party <italic>N</italic> at rank <italic>r</italic> and time period <italic>t</italic> = 0. At time <italic>t</italic> = 0 all agents are randomly assigned to one of two parties; the probability that <italic>w</italic> = 1 is defined as dependent on size of agents in a party relative to the size of the other parties; <italic>C</italic> is size of payoff to winning party; <italic>P</italic> is conditional of rank and size and the number of parties varies from 1 to <italic>N</italic>. The utility an agent gets from staying in Party <italic>N</italic> depends on <italic>N</italic> winning the election and on the person’s rank. An agent will move if the agent gets a higher rank. When an agents gets a higher rank depends on when the agents in the other party are willing to let this person come in, as that would affect their rank, and current and future payoff.</p>
