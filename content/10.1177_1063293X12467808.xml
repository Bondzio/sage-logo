<p>Platforms may enable offering a variety of products to the market while keeping the development cost down. Reusing design knowledge is a key concept, whether manifested as reusing parts, ideas, concepts, or technologies. This article describes processes and information technology solutions for holistically working with both technology platforms and product platforms. A platform framework was developed for managing information and to support the processes. The use of the framework is illustrated through a case study performed at a subsupplier in the aerospace industry focusing on technology development, platform-based product development, and platform configuration. A wiki system supports the technology platform, containing electronic guidelines, methods, and information about the technologies. To support the product platform, a product lifecycle management architecture is created. A turbine rear structure from a turbofan engine is used as an example, requiring several different analysis technologies to be used and coordinated when creating a variant. The solution is a product lifecycle management architecture created based on the technology platform. It integrates a product data management system, a computer-aided design tool, two computer-aided engineering tools, and a configurator.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Platforms may enable bringing a variety of products to the market while keeping the development cost down. Reusing knowledge in new designs is a key concept of platforms, whether it is about reusing entire parts or reusing ideas, concepts, and technology. Using product platforms as a means for reusing knowledge in the product design phase has received a great deal of attention the past few years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1063293X12467808">Jiao et al., 2007</xref>). As the concept is familiar to gain benefits of scale in production, product development and technology development are using platforms for the same reason (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1063293X12467808">Jiao et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1063293X12467808">Jolly and Nasiriyar, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1063293X12467808">Robertson and Ulrich, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>The benefits of platforms are rigorously examined in research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1063293X12467808">Jiao et al., 2007</xref>) and depend not only on definitions in theory, but also on how the platform effort is supported and how that support is implemented. For long, information technology (IT) tools have been employed to manage knowledge and knowledge reuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1063293X12467808">Abramovici, 2002</xref>). However, no software tool has the perfect fit for all business processes of a company, for example, technology development and product development. The combined capabilities of different tools may, on the other hand, satisfy the needs.</p>
<p>In technology development, there are no established or commonly used data management systems similar to those used in product development and production. On the product side, the rapid growth of product requirements in both number and complexity demands increasingly accurate analyses to be able to decide whether a concept is feasible or not. Furthermore, the complex processes of configuring products require vast databases that can store and mine complex relations, much different from the flexible structures required for technology development.</p>
<p>It is apparent that different stages of the product lifecycle require different supports; yet, there needs to be an integrated approach on how to leverage from the created knowledge throughout the lifecycle. To achieve efficiency across the lifecycle, several business processes run in parallel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1063293X12467808">Prasad, 1996</xref>). This type of concurrent engineering (CE) allows technology, product, and manufacturing development to start earlier than in pure sequential development, thus shortening development lead time. However, it requires integration of teams, tools, and product information. A reusable digital product and process models, such as seen in a platform, act as facilitator for concurrency engineering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1063293X12467808">Prasad, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>This article describes processes and IT support for concurrent lifecycle phases through integrating technology platforms and product platforms. A platform framework has been developed to support development across the entire lifecycle, from technology development, through product development to product variant configuration, bringing together state of the art in these fields.</p>
<p>The article is disposed as follows: The “introduction” section introduces and describes the context within which this research has been performed. Section “Paper scope” presents the scope of the article, together with the research questions. The method used during the studies is described in section “Method.” Section “Related research” gives a summary of theory related to this research. The resulting approach and solution are described in section “An integrated approach,” whereas section “Case study” describes a case study that was performed to illustrate the approach. Section “Discussion” discusses the result, and finally, section “Conclusions” summarizes the most crucial points.</p>
<sec id="section2-1063293X12467808">
<title>Time before platforms</title>
<p>Imagine an organization that develops technologies, products, and production systems, but does so completely without strategy or support for reuse. In this case, technologies would be developed for a single product or production system, possibly without other parts of the organization knowing about it. The technology may comply with the particular implementation it was developed for, but fail in any other application.</p>
<p>Moreover, information about technologies, products, and how they are connected will not be available, which obviates the awareness of development efforts throughout the organization. Hence, companies will risk redundancy in the technology or product portfolio, and development time will have been wasted on something that has already been developed by the company. A platform approach can solve the issues if implemented across the product lifecycle with appropriate support to work holistically and integrated.</p>

<sec id="section3-1063293X12467808">
<title>Defining technology-based configurable platforms</title>
<p>Traditional research regarding product platforms focuses on the economy of scale for manufacturers of consumer goods. The idea is to spread the cost of product development over a wide range of products that share the same components, or increasing the product offering by combining components with various performances in different configurations and price segments to the market.</p>
<p>However, all businesses do not have a product offering suitable for sharing components across product families; the reuse has to be found elsewhere. For example, suppliers of custom products with low series production can find economy of scale if they create and reuse knowledge on an abstraction level higher than components. A platform then refers to the reuse of abstract assets not necessarily connected to a specific part. The reusable knowledge blocks from technology development is an example of that, which when arranged in a systematic way can be referred to as technology platforms. Technology platforms are in the literature primarily described as a means to meet challenges with a diverse product portfolio where components cannot be reused (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1063293X12467808">Shapiro, 2006</xref>). In between, the extremes of sharing components and sharing generic knowledge assets are yet another form of reuse, where subsystems based on generic concepts are prepared for adaptation and reconfiguration.</p>
<p>Technology-based configurable platforms are used in this article to imply that the product platform contains reusable subsystems or design elements that are highly configurable that stands in contrast to the common view of product platforms. It is further implied that the configurable subsystems have an underlying knowledge base on a general level that is developed, tested, and described as independent technologies in a technology platform. This means that the finished product comprises both reusable technologies and reusable configurable components (CCs).</p>

<title>Paper scope</title>
<p>The aim of this article is to investigate the processes and IT support needed to realize the development using technology-based configurable platforms, using state-of-the-art research as well as new research in the field. The article will also discuss possible managerial and technical challenges in supporting technology-based configurable platforms.</p>
<p>The case company, which is a subsupplier in the aerospace industry, develops and manufactures parts for jet engines, a business characterized by low volumes and long development times to fulfill legislation and safety requirements. As in any business, it is important to achieve efficiency in product development, for example, through reusing design. The following research questions will be answered in this research article:</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>This study was conducted as a qualitative case study at one particular company, Volvo Aero Corporation (VAC), a subsidiary of AB Volvo. Main operations are located in Sweden, while subsidiaries can be found in Norway and the United States. VAC develops and produces components for aircraft, rocket, and stationary gas turbine engines of high technology content in cooperation with the world’s leading engine manufacturers. The company operates mainly as a subcontractor supplying customers with customized high-tech components.</p>
<p>VAC puts major focus on development and marketing of technology and advanced product development, which makes it a suitable company for this research. Further information about the platform strategies regarding VAC can be found in the article of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1063293X12467808">Berglund et al. (2008)</xref>. This article is the result of a research initiative to implement a platform approach at VAC. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1063293X12467808">Jørgensen (1992)</xref> presents an approach for applied research. Applied research has two starting points: the problem base, typically a phenomenon that is observed in reality, for example, an industrial need; and a theory base, where a knowledge gap is concluded through studying the knowledge base in the literature.</p>
<p>The theory base is synthesized into models, <italic>descriptive</italic> or <italic>prescriptive</italic>. These are tested and validated against the analyzed results from the problem base and may result in new scientific acknowledgements. Although the process seems sequential, it is not. The work of analyzing, synthesizing, and syncing between the two tracks is highly iterative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1063293X12467808">Jørgensen, 1992</xref>). At the research’s end, the new scientific acknowledgements come closer to implementation in industry.</p>
<p>The data collection for the problem base has been a combination of observations (attending meetings), semi-structured interviews (lasting for about 2 h, focused on reuse and platforms), and, finally, workshops and presentations at the participating company. Models and theories previously developed form the initial theory base.</p>
<p>The validation of the business impacts and implications resorts to acceptance from the case company because the approach is still on a demonstrator level and not fully operational at Volvo Aero, Thus, the discussion is verified by acceptance (as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1063293X12467808">Buur (1990)</xref>) at Volvo Aero, whereas the product lifecycle management (PLM) architecture has been validated through using real VAC data and methods.</p>

<p>This section presents research on which the results of this article rest aiming at giving a frame of reference to the research, and to highlight some important definitions and concepts that are used throughout the rest of the article.</p>
<sec id="section7-1063293X12467808">
<title>Platform-based design</title>
<p>A product platform is commonly recognized as reusing previously designed parts in future products to benefit from the economies of scale. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1063293X12467808">Meyer and Lehnerd (1997)</xref> have a slightly more abstract view of a platform stating that a platform is “a set of subsystems and interfaces developed to form a common structure from which a stream of derivative products can be efficiently developed and produced.” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1063293X12467808">Robertson and Ulrich (1998)</xref> define a platform on a more general level as the “collection of assets that are shared by a set of products,” which consequently can encompass more than just reusing parts.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1063293X12467808">Meyer and Lehnerd (1997)</xref> identify three different levels of a platform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1063293X12467808">Figure 1</xref>), much similar to the different abstraction levels described earlier: the common building blocks, similar to what is presented to be included in a technology platform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1063293X12467808">Jolly and Nasiriyar, 2007</xref>), the product platform described using subsystems, and variants generated from the product platform that together constitute a product family. A member of a product family is called product variant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1063293X12467808">Jiao et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1063293X12467808">Meyer and Lehnerd, 1997</xref>) or derivative. Each derivative possesses functionality in response to unique customer requirements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1063293X12467808">Meyer and Lehnerd, 1997</xref>).</p>

<p>Companies generally run platform development parallel to derivative and technology development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1063293X12467808">Wheelwright and Clark, 1992</xref>). However, a technology platform shall be the basis for developing a product platform, in the same way as a product platform constitutes basis for configuring product variants. Thereby, technology development can focus on the most essential or novel technologies to use in platform and derivative development.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1063293X12467808">
<title>Variability in product platforms</title>
<p>A cornerstone in platform-based product development is variability of the platform. Van Veen (1990), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1063293X12467808">Erens (1996)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1063293X12467808">Mannisto et al. (2001)</xref> present approaches to describe entire product families with one unified model, as opposed to describing them individually.</p>
<p>However, in a response to the inability of those early platform models to manage a number of different aspects—for example, a variety of multiple design parameters, determination of the number of product variants, and determination of the platform extent—other researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1063293X12467808">Hernandez et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1063293X12467808">Williams et al., 2007</xref>) propose approaches that use continuous variable design parameters. Another way of incorporating variability in product platforms and managing the above-mentioned problems is the CC concept first developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1063293X12467808">Claesson (2006)</xref> and further refined through several studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1063293X12467808">Edholm et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1063293X12467808">Gedell et al., 2011</xref>). The approach uses configurable subsystems to compose a product architecture based on input parameters such as customer demands. The CC concept is the approach used in this article and is more thoroughly described in section “CC concept.”</p>

<sec id="section9-1063293X12467808">
<title>PLM, computer-aided engineering, and configuration</title>
<p>PLM is widely recognized as a business approach to achieve fast and efficient product development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1063293X12467808">Grieves, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1063293X12467808">Ming et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1063293X12467808">Stark, 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1063293X12467808">CIMdata (2010)</xref> defines it as a strategic business approach that supports the collaborative creation, management, and use of product definition information, spanning from concept to the end of life of a product or plant, integrating people, processes, business systems, and information. Thus, PLM can be used to tie these various aspects together.</p>
<p>Contrary to common belief, PLM is not only an IT system. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1063293X12467808">Stark (2005)</xref> argues that there are several different parts of PLM, such as engineering methods and processes, the organization, the product and product information, and IT systems, which all need to be considered and coordinated. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1063293X12467808">Svensson et al. (1999)</xref> present the same perspective by stating four views of PLM: <italic>processes, information, systems</italic>, and <italic>roles</italic>.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1063293X12467808">Zimmerman (2008)</xref> defines a PLM architecture as an IT-centric enterprise architecture and comprises several layers or subarchitectures. These layers are described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1063293X12467808">Figure 2</xref>.</p>

</fig>
<p>The application layer is of particular interest when managing several IT applications with different purposes, as it assigns which tasks are to be performed by which application (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1063293X12467808">Catic, 2011</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1063293X12467808">Terzi et al. (2010)</xref> describe the application architecture of a PLM architecture as a system solution: PLM is an integrator of tools and technologies to facilitate swift and accurate information flow throughout the product lifecycle. It is apparent, but not agreed on by all, that product data management (PDM) systems may be one of the components of the PLM architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1063293X12467808">Abramovici, 2002</xref>), but are not considered to constitute the entire PLM strategy.</p>
<p>System integration is an essential issue in PLM. Computer-aided design (CAD) systems are in general well integrated with the PDM system and thus have access to the product meta data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1063293X12467808">Abramovici, 2002</xref>). However, there are today no satisfying examples from industry where computer-aided engineering (CAE) systems are integrated for analysis or synthesis. Information is transferred manually, or in some cases integrated in one direction only (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1063293X12467808">Abramovici, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1063293X12467808">Burr et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>There are examples within research on successful integration of CAE systems. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1063293X12467808">Inoue et al. (2010)</xref> argue that the paradigm of set-based CE is here, and that it can be supported through integrating three-dimensional (3D)-CAD and CAE systems. They present an approach to optimize structures within a set, finding the optimal solution within a bandwidth.</p>

<sec id="section10-1063293X12467808">
<title>Technology platforms</title>
<p>The primary result of technology development varies from the primary result of product development. Typically, technology development has the fuzzy goal of building knowledge or demonstrating feasibility, while product development has a concrete goal resulting in a commercial product (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1063293X12467808">Nobelius, 2002</xref>). Based on this reasoning, it is not far to start looking at technology platforms as a basis for the systematic reuse of solutions developed in technology development projects. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1063293X12467808">McGrath (2001)</xref> defines a technology platform as “a set of initiatives organized around a macro-level functionality that helps to manage and optimize technology investments across multiple product platforms.” Similar definitions of technology platforms as bases for different products and markets have also been proposed by, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1063293X12467808">Meyer and Lehnerd (1997)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1063293X12467808">Shapiro (2006)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1063293X12467808">Jolly and Nasiriyar (2007)</xref>, and the concept of technology platforms has similarities to core competencies and dynamic capabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1063293X12467808">Jolly and Nasiriyar, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1063293X12467808">McGrath, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Compared to product platforms, technology platforms capture a larger range of elements, including both physical and nonphysical elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1063293X12467808">Shapiro, 2006</xref>) and do not lend themselves to the building block modules and IF structures of product platforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1063293X12467808">McGrath, 2001</xref>). A well-known example of a company that uses a technology platform to drive innovations is 3M, which derives its core strength from 52 different technology elements, such as adhesives, abrasives, and vapor processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1063293X12467808">Shapiro, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Other benefits that have been attributed to technology platforms in the literature include the possibilities to diversify into new markets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1063293X12467808">Jolly and Nasiriyar, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1063293X12467808">Kim and Kogut, 1996</xref>) and the ability to forecast what to offer the market in the future by identifying what technologies, rather than what products, will be attractive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1063293X12467808">Kim and Kogut, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1063293X12467808">Jolly and Nasiriyar (2007)</xref> conclude that there are two important dimensions that make it possible to leverage technology platforms: the innate flexibility of the technologies used and the capability of the company to exploit their potential across different businesses through reconfiguration.</p>

<p>The technology platform framework, first presented in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1063293X12467808">Berglund et al.

</fig>
<p>The framework contains definitions of the core platform and related components. The core platform, consisting of a product platform, a production platform, and a technology platform, contains high value reusable assets of the company. The product platform in turn contains product families and design concepts that constitute the basis for VAC products. The production platform contains production methods and concepts configured and used in the factories. This framework excludes assets that are not reusable, such as manufactured components, machines in the factory, and immature technologies.</p>
<p>Within this framework, new product and production concepts are based on a series of mature and reusable technologies. The platform is also believed to help synchronization of product development and production by providing a process support for these parallel development processes. The mapping within the platform from technology to product and production concepts is one of the great challenges.</p>
<p>The platform needs to provide business value by integrating knowledge across domains to increase performance and reduce manufacturing costs. A key function of the platform is to facilitate better predictions to manage production and product development over time. Technologies can thus mature and be tested in different applications, reducing risk in both prediction and implementation. Another important aspect is gap analysis: finding and reducing research gaps, prioritizing development projects, and spreading new knowledge internally to other projects and development groups.</p>

<title>An integrated approach</title>
<p>There are several approaches to implement a platform and to make it accessible through IT systems. We propose a platform solution where the technology platform is expressed on an abstract level with common building blocks. The product platform is based on reconfigurable subsystems that can be configured to product variants corresponding to customer requirements.</p>
<p>The solution that we propose relates to the platform framework presented in section “Volvo Aero platform framework.” The two focus areas are product platform development using a technology platform and product variant development using a product platform. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1063293X12467808">Figure 4</xref> shows the condensed focus with the proposed IT support. The technology platform is implemented using a wiki, whereas the product platform is represented in a PLM architecture. The CC concept (see “CC concept”) is implemented in this PLM environment, with processes and IT tools to allow configuration of product variants for leveraging of the efforts put into the platform.</p>

<p>Platform activities can be divided into two categories: preparation and execution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1063293X12467808">Pedersen, 2009</xref>). The technology platform is prepared in technology platform development projects by generalizing results from advanced engineering. This platform is used to develop new technologies and to work as a knowledge base for developing the product platform. Thus, development is continuous and concurrent. In the front end, the technology platform acts as support in preparation of the product platform. It provides an overview of knowledge collected from previous technology development including trade-off curves, test results, working procedures, methods and lessons learned, and so on. An essential part of retrieving this knowledge and making it useful is to access the people who developed it and their deeper understanding for it. Hence, the wiki aims to help identify those experts.</p>
<p>The product platform supports development stages where geometries are set, IFs are mapped and when there is a rough idea about what bandwidth the platform is supposed to cover. The product platform configuration is typically used not only for support in start-up meetings with new customer requirements or answering to a quote for a change in the current product, but also to configure the quality-assured product variant directly for production.</p>
<p>The request for a new product may arise at any time during the development. Different supports are used, depending on how far development has progressed. A request may impose new development, so depending on the magnitude of the request (e.g. if it matches current development efforts or if it imposes new technologies or products), different actions are required, and with them different supports.</p>

<title>Technology platform solution</title>
<p>The technology platform proposed in this article is a systematic approach for leveraging the part of the core competencies of a company that have to do with technologies. It includes processes for maturing technologies and for managing their transition to product development, as well as suggestions for useful IT tools to increase awareness and support management of knowledge about technologies.</p>
<sec id="section14-1063293X12467808">
<title>Process for introducing new technologies</title>
<p>A fundamental process for which the technology platform needs provide support is the process of introducing new technologies in products. Many technology development projects are aimed at delivering results to upcoming or ongoing product development projects. The prescribed approach focuses on what the product development projects can use from previous technology development that has been stored in the technology platform. There are a few different views on the technology platform that are required in order to create a process for the utilization of the technology platform. The three main views are the <italic>Technology Developer</italic>, the <italic>Product Developer</italic>, and the <italic>Process Developer</italic>. A technology developer is responsible for developing the technology and making it available to the organization while product and process developers are responsible for incorporating that technology into their new processes and products. The technology platform imposes new requirements on the deliverables from technology development in order to prepare for applying a technology to a wider range of products than in single product development. The difference lies mainly in the description of a technology, general descriptions in a technology platform as opposed to specific data in the product and process development (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1063293X12467808">Table 1</xref>). A technology readiness level (TRL) indicates how mature technologies are, focusing on assessing the remaining risk and making the delivery to product development (or production) projects as seamless as possible.</p>

</table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap>
<p>The maturity of the technologies in a platform can be lower as well, because high maturity levels require tests in specific environments, which is not reasonable to do for all the potential applications. Instead, this raises the need for a new type of project that adapts the technologies retrieved from the platform to new applications by closing the knowledge gap between how to use it in the new context as compared to the one in which it was previously tested. A combination of technology elements with higher (TRL 8–9) and lower (TRL 6) readiness levels would be useful in the platform. Most technologies have already been matured to high TRLs for some specific application, and when they are applied in contexts that are similar to previously proven ones, they can be reused from a higher TRL. For the different variants of a product platform, the use of the technology is probably similar. Moreover, the maturation of a technology from TRL 6 to TRL 8–9 is likely to be performed within a product or process platform development project. The technology platform can thus be seen as the basis for designing the general product and process platforms.</p>

<title>IT support</title>
<p>In the proposed solution, the technology platform concept is realized using a wiki for managing short reports with links to official reports, as exemplified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1063293X12467808">Figure 5</xref>. A wiki is a website structure consisting of an indefinite collection of pages in which registered users can add or edit pages using a built-in editor. The best-known example is Wikipedia, an encyclopedia that has grown organically based on incremental contributions of information from users worldwide.</p>

</fig>
<p>The main ways of finding information in a wiki are through an efficient search engine and through links between pages. A version tracker is normally present to prevent loss of information from improper use. The wiki format was chosen for this demonstrator mainly based on its ability to give multiple authors an easy tool for sharing their knowledge and experience. A framework for the content was set up by creating a top-node page: <italic>Technologies</italic>, linking to four pages with technology categories called <italic>Manufacturing Methods, Design Solutions</italic> (DSs), <italic>Engineering Methods</italic>, and <italic>Test and Control Methods</italic>. These four pages contain links to pages about technologies identified at the case company with two to four A4 pages of information for each. The three page levels are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1063293X12467808">Figure 5</xref> with the third level containing proposed headings for a page about a manufacturing method. The content of the short reports in the wiki may include, for example, basic information about how technology works and where it is used, the current TRLs for different applications, the company’s plans for future use of the technology, and contact information to experts in the field.</p>

<title>Product platform configuration solution</title>
<p>Solving a design problem is a hard task that involves considering a large number of properties and their relation to each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1063293X12467808">Meerkamm, 1994</xref>), making it perfect for a computer. Automating parts of that design process can be used in combination with the designers’ potential for creative thinking and problem solving. Thus, the designers make the design decisions, whereas computers are left with tedious calculations and information transfer. Below is a description of how these issues can be managed through IT support.</p>
<sec id="section17-1063293X12467808">
<title>CC concept</title>
<p>A platform described using the CC concept consists of several autonomous systems, each described by a CC object. CC objects can <italic>use</italic> other CC objects to compose themselves. The CC concept has a great deal in common with a modular product platform, allowing for concurrency while developing various modules or subsystems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1063293X12467808">Prasad, 1996</xref>), but aims to support a platform approach based on the concept of subsystems and concepts rather than reusing parts. Each subsystem is configurable to fit a variety of contexts and fulfill the same function in each context.</p>
<p>A CC object may represent an entire car, a front door, or a rear view mirror. Essentially, CC objects do not represent merely one type of car door, but rather every door in a product platform; a CC is a model of a system family. Depending on the parameters inserted, different variants can be composed and as a result, the door will look or behave differently.</p>
<p>There is no generally accepted definition of a modular product (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1063293X12467808">Gershenson et al., 2003</xref>) other than it being made up of modules, building blocks, but a common belief is that fixed or standard IFs between modules are the condition for success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1063293X12467808">Schilling and Steensma, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1063293X12467808">Takeishi, 2002</xref>). The CC concept goes quite the opposite way and declares a bandwidth within which platform elements, including IFs, may vary. Thus, the IFs are co-configured to fit each other, which allows for keeping design flexibility intact throughout the development process.</p>
<p>The building blocks of the CC object can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1063293X12467808">Figure 6</xref>. The connections with other subsystems are realized through an “IF” object. The IFs are configurable and can be geometric, electrical, logical, and so on. An IF cannot be configured independently of its surroundings, thus making the <italic>interaction</italic> (IA) objects serve as communicators between IFs.</p>

<title>Requirements, activities, and system components</title>
<p>When developing advanced technical systems, there is a need for consulting various CAE tools to validate a design or aid in synthesis. Thus, depending on the requirements of a product, different sets of analysis tools need to be involved in configuring a product variant.</p>
<p>The design rationale is created using the technology platform. FRs and constraints are used to represent product requirements on each CC. The knowledge of appropriate assessment methods for a given requirement is also implemented in the product platform, which may later be used to determine which analysis to perform to ensure the fulfillment of each requirement. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1063293X12467808">Figure 7</xref> describes how analysis activities can be derived from product requirements.

<p>Manufacturing technologies, technical specifications, and other enabling and limiting factors are used when determining the bandwidth of the CC parameters. Trade-off curves, determining areas of “safe designs,” is one example of this type of knowledge that may be found in the technology platform.</p>
<p>The requirements will invoke a set of activities that need to be executed to complete the configuration. These activities form a process, which consequently will differ depending on what activities are necessary to assess the requirements. Each requirement is analyzed in one or several activities, which in turn are realized by one or several PLM system architecture components. Thus, the different analyses and synthesis activities can be derived directly from the requirements of the product. These requirements are stored in the design rationale of the CC object.</p>

<title>Case study</title>
<p>VAC, in Trollhättan, Sweden, designs and manufactures framings for aerospace engines and competes with several other actors for the contracts of engine manufacturers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1063293X12467808">Berglund et al., 2008</xref>). Reusing design knowledge is a hot issue at VAC, as in numerous manufacturing industries.

<p>As a setting for this case, a customer requests an estimation of ability of VAC to meet the requirements for the next generation of turbine rear structures (TRSs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1063293X12467808">Figure 8(a)</xref>) for a new engine.

</fig>
<p>The commercial turbofan engines of today are designed to be fuel efficient. The TRS acts as a support structure for the low-pressure shaft and is located in the rear of the engine where it redirects the exhaust flow from the low-pressure turbine to the exit nozzle. The TRSs affect fuel efficiency; to optimize fuel efficiency, they need to be as light and aerodynamic as possible. In addition, they need to withstand significant thermal and structural loads. These functionality criteria must be balanced to obtain an optimal design. For small engines, TRSs are usually cast in one piece. For the increasingly more common larger engines, however, TRSs are assemblies of welded cast goods, wrought, and sheet metal parts. There are several different fabrication strategies. For example, the TRS can be assembled using an inner ring—a hub section—and connected it to a number of T-sections (to the left in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1063293X12467808">Figure 8(b)</xref>), each containing a vane and shroud part. Another strategy is simply to use H-sections (to the right in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1063293X12467808">Figure 8(b)</xref>) including hub sections.</p>
<p>Six different tests are carried out to assess the requirements on the TRS: pressure loss, buckling load factor, thermal stress, overturning moment (OTM), and shear compliance:</p>
<list id="list4-1063293X12467808" list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>Aerodynamic analysis—evaluates the aerodynamic performance of the part. Specifically, the pressure loss over the TRS and the velocity angle at the outlet are calculated. Furthermore, aero surface temperatures are calculated and fed into the subsequent thermal analysis.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Thermal analysis—calculates the material temperature from given boundary surface temperatures. The results of the thermal analysis are used to calculate thermal stress.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Thermal stress—The recurring thermal loads on the frame create large stresses in the material, which is a limiting factor for product life. Consequently, the thermal stress gives an indication of estimated life of the product. The centerline shift, the movement of the motor shaft centerline because of thermal expansion, is also calculated.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Ultimate stress—assesses whether the turbine structure can withstand extreme events, such as a loss of a fan or turbine blade, or a wheels-up landing. The engine does not need to be operational after such an event, but it must not separate from the wing and no parts must be lost. Ultimate stress is measured on the primary and secondary load paths.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Shear compliance—calculating the inverse of the stiffness of the product, when a unit load is acting on the bearing housing. Compliance is chosen instead of stiffness in order to consistently define the output as a parameter that is to be minimized.</p>

<p>Overturning moment—similar to shear compliance, but instead of a force, a torque on the bearing housing around the pitch axis.</p>

<title>Creating the product platform</title>
<p>While the product platform is developed, it is created using knowledge that resides within the company at that time, for example, as represented in the technology platform, and on new knowledge that is acquired during a product platform development project. The technology platform acts as both facilitator during the prestudy to find existing knowledge, avoid reinventing ideas, and perform redundant development activities in the downstream project, as well as in detailed development, for example, as a base for setting bandwidth of subsystems. This knowledge resides within the Wiki, but also in the minds of experts at the company and its affiliated partners. It is therefore found using the overview provided by the technology platform wiki and by contacting people listed in the wiki yellow-pages section.</p>
<p>A prestudy may result in an analysis of the knowledge gaps to reach the intended performance, providing a number of objectives for the subsequent development. The result of the efforts to close the knowledge gaps is then fed back into the technology platform.</p>

<title>Product platform configuration</title>
<p>As the product platform is prepared according to section “Product platform preparation with technology platform support,” it is now possible to quickly configure a product variant that meets the new requirements proposed by the customer. A full system architecture is sown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1063293X12467808">Figure 10</xref>.</p>

<p>The configuration is automatic and initiated by CCM based on the generic concept model that is expressed using the CC concept. The two parameters chosen for this case are varied so that six different configurations are generated. These concepts are then created in the PDM system (1) and the correct CAD files are created using the generic model (2). These CAD files are connected to their respective concepts in the PDM system (3). The PDM system returns the six different concept CAD models to CCM (4). Steps 1–4 correspond to A1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1063293X12467808">Figure 9</xref>.</p>
<p>The first analysis activity is executed by AnSYS, which upon request (5) uses the CAD files of the six concepts to perform MCA. The analyses are addressing <italic>pressure loss, buckling load factor, thermal stress, OTM</italic>, and <italic>shear compliance</italic>, for all six concepts. As the result is returned (6), it is both stored in the CCM database, for later displaying, and in the PDM system (7) for reuse in future projects. Steps 5 and 6 correspond to A2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1063293X12467808">Figure 9</xref>.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the second analysis is executed in which the flush analysis is performed by the robust design tool RD&amp;T. Similar to the MCA, the CAD files are used in the analysis, which now addresses how well the concepts perform if manufacturing variations are considered. The analysis is called for (8), the result is returned (9) and stored in both CCM and Share-A-space (10). Steps 8 and 9 correspond to A3 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1063293X12467808">Figure 9</xref>.</p>
<p>After the analyses are done, the results are presented in a graph showing the different concepts as polygons (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1063293X12467808">Figure 11</xref>). This sheet may act as foundation for discussion and decision about which concept to pursue or to eliminate. The configuration process is finished in a matter of hours, depending on the granularity of the analyses.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This section discusses the results focusing on implementation of the integrated approach. It aims to answer Research Questions 2 and 3 from section “Paper scope.”</p>
<sec id="section27-1063293X12467808">
<title>Benefits of an integrated platform approach</title>
<p>Using technology-based configurable platforms will impact technology and product development in several aspects. One such business impact is that an integrated approach provides a holistic perspective on how to leverage benefits of reuse from early phases of technology development to late product configuration phases. Consequently, an arena is created for discussing and planning platform initiatives with additional synergies and greater planning horizon. A better overview of both technology and product platform enables more informed decisions on technology introduction regarding risks in deployment for different applications. This will facilitate concurrency between technology development and product development.</p>
<p>Another business impact of using technology-based configurable platforms is reduction of time-to-market, which is achieved by supporting as well as speeding up the bidding process. There are four typical requests from customers in the aero engine business: a request to develop technology together, a demonstrator engine, components for commercial engines, or to manufacture a component that has been designed by the customer. In all four cases, the combination of technology and product platform will help assessing risk and cost of such venture. During early stages, the technology platform will display current knowledge and gaps that need to be filled to ensure that the bandwidth of the technology portfolio includes the requested specifications. During later stages, a CC model can be used in simulations to assure that components can be realized with current technology and design. The approach is particularly useful when a combination of both technologies and components needs to be developed.</p>
<p>Ultimately, platform-based design requires a frontloaded process where the effort needed in the beginning of the process for creating and preparing the platform can be well compensated for later when product variants can be configured and tested at a much more rapid pace than before. This gives the advantage of faster and more accurately formulated answers to customer quotes, which provides the company with an advantage compared to competitors.</p>
<p>Applying a technology platform perspective requires more reflection about the usability of a technology in other similar applications. This implies more testing and more knowledge building within the organization. As platform elements, technologies are not immediately reusable in the same way as components and must be adapted to new conditions. To ensure that the usefulness of a technology is not overestimated for applications that differ from already tested conditions, guidelines about how to use the technology should include comments from experts about how the test results can be generalized as well as how to particularize them for preparing the product platform.</p>
<p>Developing CCs that are tested to be reliable for specific architecture and performance intervals is going to reduce the product development time, and with the use of automatic configuration and multicriteria optimization, this could be even further improved. In its current state, the proposed solution may be used to configure product variants based on a generic product concept. The solution enables comparisons between different solutions, through which the best solution within the design space can be found by using analysis methods described in the technology platform and realized through the PLM architecture. This may aid the company in, for example, a bidding process. Future study will involve using requirements as the input for the configuration process storing them as design rationale within the CCs. An available DS space defined by a requirement fulfillment bandwidth can then be used to find functionally valid solutions. It can also be used to identify needs for bandwidth extensions to satisfy future customer needs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section28-1063293X12467808">
<title>Challenges to implementation</title>
<p>The benefits of the platform approach are clear in theory. However, they depend on its realization in business processes and IT architecture. To transform a traditional developing organization into one that uses technology-based configurable platform means dealing with several challenges, some of which the most important are discussed below.</p>
<p>To plan, develop, and administer, platforms will require major changes in the development organization. Products that were previously developed separately have to be synchronized looking at IFs and bandwidths to comply with the CC-based product architecture and to enable the MCA deployed in the case. Engineers will have to design differently, most likely in other types of projects because more of the development work is aimed at creating a platform, rather than single products targeting a specific customer. As for management, roles for making decisions about trade-offs between different needs of product variants will be needed, high up in the organization hierarchy, or at least with a strong mandate.</p>
<p>The frontloading of development all the way from technology development also inflicts another distribution of costs and revenue over time, where large investments in early phases are predicted to deliver a lower total cost in the long run.</p>
<p>As of today, there is no clear picture of what the best approach is for integrating IT support for technology platform and product platform. However, several different approaches are possible, such as a service-oriented architecture (SOA) solution previously tested for the CC concept (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1063293X12467808">Levandowski et al., 2011</xref>). An SOA approach complies with the idea of making the solution as scalable as possible to be able to manage any number of different requirements on the product. Requirements that cannot be expressed in numeric values, such as aesthetic requirements, may be assessed manually using a method rather than an IT system. Such knowledge would be captured in a technology platform, but not be represented in the PLM system architecture.</p>
<p>For distributed environments, similar to what can be observed between technology development and product development, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1063293X12467808">Prasad et al. (1997)</xref> express the importance of a shared data model as a common ground for CE. There is always an issue of redundancy of data if data are used without clear references to the origin. As soon as the data in the technology platform are transferred to the product platform, it loses the direct connection to the source of the information. Should the technology be updated, the product platform will not automatically follow. In product development, such issues are commonly managed in engineering change management (ECM) processes, which build upon rigid product structures. A cross-platform ECM process and support would have to look quite different from the commonly used ECM processes if it should be powerful enough to support both technology platform development and product platform development. These issues are subject for future research.</p>
<p>Sharing technologies and product information across a range of customers can be a sensitive topic. Because the customers of the case company are competitors and contribute to developing the products they are supplied with, a certain separation of information is necessary in the platform descriptions to ensure that they do not gain access to sensitive information. The issue of data security and access is relevant and has to account for who is allowed to see what and how the information can be used.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>As the competition for market shares becomes fiercer, companies cannot stagnate in their development of the way they work. Using platforms as a way to build up a solid knowledge base and leverage-on in future development is a potent solution for taking one step further in being truly effective. The case study shows that technology-based configurable platforms can be used as a basis for configuration of complex systems. A PLM architecture incorporates not only the system side, but also the processes, information, and people using it. The proposed PLM architecture involves several different systems, whose uses are directly derived from the customer demands that need to be managed. This results in a CAD system, two CAE systems, one configurator, and one PDM system, all of which are integrated.</p>
<p>The developed approach for technology-based configurable platforms, together with the underlying processes and the IT solutions to support such platforms, has proven feasible to facilitate technology and product development. A crucial process within this framework is the process from technology development to technology platform compatible entities. Another most vital process is the process in which the technology platform is <italic>used</italic> to <italic>create</italic> the product platform.</p>
<p>The case shows <italic>one</italic> example of what platforms can be used for. Additionally, the power of a common knowledge repository in combination with a PLM architecture to support rapid concept generation opens up for significant possibilities. Concerning the tool integration side, an SOA approach would surely be a feasible way to incorporate scalability in the PLM architecture.</p>
<p>Ultimately, working with platforms, rather than point solutions, will require a new way of working. It will require the processes to be frontloaded and to focus on building knowledge that can be leveraged on later. Unfortunately, this is not something done overnight, neither is it something that can be implemented overnight—the platform must come from within, and the organization must be transformed working with it.</p>
