<p>It was not that long ago—1978, in fact—when Josef Konvitz complained of the surprising neglect by urban historians of port cities. Since then much water has flowed under the bridge, so to speak, and the two books on ports under review here have plenty of company on their shelf. A number of collective volumes along with a drove of individual monographs have appeared on maritime urban nodes and networks in a wide range of venues.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0096144211432284">1</xref></sup> And while the Atlantic has been especially favored in early modern history, recent work has focused on other seas as well. As a result, this particular, even peculiar urban typology has been subjected to close inspection from the Mediterranean basin to the coasts of Malabar. The lessons to be learned are many and concern virtually all aspects of the history of cities and of the broader systems—economic, ecological, imperial, and other—in which they find themselves enmeshed and which they contribute to keeping together.</p>
<p>The first book deals with port cities in all three spheres—Africa, Asia, and Brazil—of the early modern Portuguese empire. It opens with two general essays: a brief but effective overview by the volume’s editor, Liam Matthew Brockey, followed by a similarly empire-wide survey, this time of the urban presence and activities of converted Jews by José Alberto Rodrigues da Silva Tavim. The rest of the work consists of chapters on individual towns. These fall roughly into two categories. The first includes standard urban biographies designed to present relatively unknown centers to a wider readership, as in the case of J. S. A. Elisondas on Nagasaki, Malyn Newitt on Mozambique Island, Glenn J. Ames on a cluster of fortified cities in India north of Mumbai (especially Diu and Daman), and Catarina Madeira Santos on Luanda. The remaining chapters deal with more specific topics, and usually in regard to a single city. Thus, in separate essays Charlotte de Castelnau-L’Estoile and Stuart B. Schwartz explore ceremonial life in the Brazilian capital of Salvador da Bahia, Isabel dos Guimarães Sá examines confraternal charity in Macau, Diogo Ramada Curto briefly reconstructs plans to rebuild and reform Goa in the 1720s, and Kirsten Schulz discusses the links between urban expansion and colonial discourse in eighteenth-century Brazil.</p>
<p>Those who like to groan over the shortcomings of collected conference papers will be pleasantly surprised by this work. All its chapters are solid and informative, as one would expect from a volume that tries to put new subjects on the map. For a collection it is also fairly coherent, in that despite the diverse aims of its authors it is easy to identify a number of common emphases and observations. Among these, three classic themes of urban history stand out as particularly relevant: typology, hierarchy, and the factors making for civic success and failure.</p>
<p>Colonial cities shared a number of characteristics. As Brockey points out in his introduction, they were by nature highly cosmopolitan. Far from being enclaves, their very survival depended on different forms of interaction with the non-Portuguese and non-Catholic local population. (That there were firm limits to this interaction due to religious and racial policies and prejudices lent additional complexity to urban societies that differed visibly from their metropolitan counterparts.) These cities also enjoyed considerable autonomy in their relations with higher authorities. The huge distances separating them from Lisbon—and often from each other—ensured that royal or viceregal oversight existed more as a political ideal than an administrative reality. Finally, distance also conferred more numerous and strategic functions on standard institutions transferred from Portugal. Military authority was obviously stronger in these imperial outposts than in the homeland. And charitable institutions such as the much studied <italic>misericórdias</italic>, or all-purpose confraternities, wound up performing a broader range of tasks than was the norm back at home. These involved not just assuming greater responsibility for banking and credit. Their expanded public role also included maintaining Portuguese identity and a minimum of cohesion within societies simultaneously tugged in many directions by diverse opportunities (economic and otherwise) within radically alien local contexts.</p>
<p>That said, not all colonial settlements looked alike, nor can they be reduced to a uniform model. While hierarchies of size and function ran a wide gamut, three levels can be clearly distinguished. At the bottom stood the fortified locations the Portuguese referred to as <italic>praças</italic>. While small garrisons of this sort proved vital to imperial maintenance, they occupied a sub-urban berth and carried out very few civic functions. The middling level involved towns proper. These were overwhelmingly defined by their economic functions, which centered on the extraction and export of local resources and above all the forwarding of trade goods and payments within the lengthy chain that linked the metropolis with the outermost endpoints of empire. The top of the pyramid was dominated by those cities that served as political as well as commercial centers. Goa and Salvador were viceregal courts and administrative capitals (the latter until the mid-eighteenth century), and as such were endowed with much greater social as well as institutional complexity. It is hardly a coincidence that several chapters in this book focus on the considerable tensions that marked urban life at this higher level and on the mechanisms—particularly of the more informal sort, ranging from religious rituals to street riots—that helped preserve order among an unusually mixed and mobile urban populace.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is the predictable effect of the way the book is organized, but in the end what wins out is the impression of diversity. This assortment of Portuguese cities seems to have been just that: a loose array of urban configurations, each one defined by its own local arrangements and acting largely as independent agents within a broader system whose ability to enforce its will was visibly limited. And while the authors do not speculate much in this direction, this looseness may well have played a major role in keeping this empire together for so long; the “strength of weak ties” comes readily to mind in such a context. In any event, <italic>Portuguese Colonial Cities</italic> offers an excellent general introduction to a series of interesting as well as important cities. One looks forward to further work along the lines explored in this valuable joint effort.</p>
<p>Patrick O’Flanagan’s <italic>Port Cities of Atlantic Iberia</italic> is a very different book. It offers an ambitious synthesis of the evolution of the leading port cities of Portugal and Atlantic Spain from the early modern era through the nineteenth century. Its point of departure is the Iberian penchant for creating in a single city—Lisbon in the case of Portugal and first Seville and then Cádiz in Spain—a series of institutions whose task was to channel all economic communication and commerce with their respective overseas empires. O’Flanagan devotes the rest of the book to a systematic review of the interplay among this exceptional policy of state monopoly, the dynamics of trade, and the growth and decline of individual urban centers along the entire Atlantic coastline of the peninsula.</p>
<p>This work has a number of strengths. Many readers will find useful the close-up examination one by one of the main Iberian port cities (for the record, they include Seville, Cádiz and the smaller ports in its vicinity, the Atlantic archipelagoes of the Canary and Azores Islands and Madeira, Lisbon, Oporto, Corunna, Santander, and finally Bilbao and the minor Basque ports). In each case O’Flanagan surveys the changing characteristics of the urban economy, especially long-term shifts in interaction between the city and its hinterland and foreland. He also pays close attention to the evolving relation between economic activity and civic development, as reflected in urban morphology, housing types, and residential patterns. I for one find it admirable, though hardly unprecedented, that an urban geographer digs so deeply in a historical direction and winds up venturing a preliminary prospection that historians of Iberia cities have yet to provide. This work is moreover based on wide reading, as its thirty-three–page bibliography amply testifies. Finally, it is a considerable feat to bring together into a common schema the traditionally separate urban histories of Spain and Portugal. This is, in fact, to my knowledge the first such attempt to do so since E. A. Gutkind’s pioneering effort of 1967 and the valuable but selective historical atlas of Iberian cities produced by Barcelona’s Centre de Cultura Contemporània in 1995.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0096144211432284">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Above all, O’Flanagan’s overall conclusions are convincing, even if the way they are constructed leaves something to be desired (more on this follows). One would hardly argue with his main contentions, which can be summarized roughly as follows. First is that early modern port cities cover a range of recognizable settlement types that were marked by a number of specific and in some cases singular characteristics. Outstanding among them are: higher levels of complexity, one especially visible manifestation of which was the prevalence of multiethnic populations, often comprising dense networks of foreigners; the presence of an “extra” social layer of often extremely wealthy overseas merchants given to unusually cosmopolitan behavior and beliefs; and the tendency to offer ample latitude to informal economic activities, particularly fraud and smuggling. Second, that while the imposition of monopoly succeeded in promoting port concentration and creating an internal—which in this case meant imperial as well as national—hierarchy of centers of maritime commerce, in all three cases it failed to deter effective control of strategic aspects of transatlantic trade by northern European interlopers. Finally is that the three hundred years of monopoly had disastrous consequences for the nonmetropolitan ports, not only in the Mediterranean, and that its distorting effects were revealed by the notably rapid realignment of the urban hierarchy after monopoly was partially abolished in 1778. These are large claims, to be sure, and O’Flanagan takes pains to introduce nuance in his argument. To cite one example, he points to important differences between the Spanish and Portuguese ventures in imperial political economy. Foremost among these were the fact that Portugal at no point prohibited other cities (e.g., Oporto) from participating in colonial trade, as long as the goods involved cleared the Lisbon offices. Also relevant was the difference in outcomes: the three monopoly cities did not repeat the same boom-bust cycle. Instead, Lisbon largely managed to escape the rise-and-fall fate of Seville and Cádiz thanks to its ability to retain its traditional functions of political and administrative capital of a still profitable empire.</p>
<p>That said, this book’s many strengths are undermined by a number of unfortunate stylistic features. Foremost among these is a choppy, often confusing presentation, hamstrung by much repetition. Its rather nervous prose also includes more than its share of questionable and poorly defined or phrased assertions. Finally, the presence of an excessive number of errata damages the credibility of the work’s substantial bibliography. All this is quite unfortunate, as O’Flanagan has clearly read widely and thought hard about his subject. But in the end this book gives the impression that while its author is demonstrably good at locating and piling up many nuggets of useful information, he is weaker when it comes to making solid connections and building convincing arguments, especially at an intermediate level. Firmer editorial guidance could have turned this into a stronger (and leaner) book while sparing the reader the extra effort required to distill greater coherence on his or her own.</p>
<p>I conclude this review with a brief coda devoted to a recent work whose cautious, tight focus contrasts with O’Flanagan’s broad brush. Xabier Lamikiz’s <italic>Trade and Trust in the Eighteenth-Century Atlantic World</italic>, while set in the cities of Lima, Cádiz, and above all Bilbao, tackles urban history only indirectly. But there is a great deal to be learned in this work about the operations of a key figure in many port cities, the overseas merchant. Lamikiz looks to such agents as a means of weighing the diverse factors—legal and cultural, as well as more personalized situations such as variable access to communication and information—that affect the balance of risk and trust on which their decision making depends. In focusing on the latter he joins a growing number of historians who seek to explore the impact of these and other influences on the allegiances, identities, and calculated choices of these leading economic actors.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0096144211432284">3</xref></sup> Yet instead of scrutinizing a single national, religious, or ethnic group, as most “diaspora” studies do, Lamikiz reconstructs interaction among individuals of different backgrounds, even if his main interest lays with Basque merchants. To this end he isolates two spheres of Bilbao’s international trade, that with the northern Atlantic powers and with the colony of Peru, and presses into service a highly unusual source: merchant correspondence from ships the British navy confiscated as prizes, which has survived among the Admiralty papers in London. His close and intelligent reading of these sacks of mail uncovers the workings of (and limits to) trust in these transatlantic transactions. It also allows him to suggest that the control Spanish merchants continued to exercise over information regarding colonial markets limited the inroads of foreign interests during the volatile period of declining formal regulation of the imperial system. True, his conclusion—that toward the end of the eighteenth century the Spanish monopoly over goods traded with the colonies became more of a fact and less of the legal fiction it had traditionally been—may be overstated. One nevertheless cannot overlook the interest of this work for a new understanding of the role of overseas merchants in what was not only an imperial system, but also a markedly urban one.</p>
