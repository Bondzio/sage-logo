<abstract>
<p>Drawing on data generated by life history interviews and fieldwork observations we illuminate the ways in which a young elite athlete named David (a pseudonym) gave meaning to his experiences of cancer that eventually led to his death. Central to this process were the ways in which David utilized both social comparisons and a narrative map provided by the published autobiography of Lance Armstrong (2000). Our analysis reveals the selective manner in which social comparison processes operated around the following key dimensions: mental attitude to treatment; the sporting body; the ageing body; and physical appearance. The manner in which different comparison targets were chosen, the ways in which these were framed by Armstrong’s autobiography, and the work that the restitution narrative as an actor did in this process are also examined. Some reflections are offered regarding the experiential consequences of the social comparison processes utilized by David when these are shaped by specific forms of embodiment and selective narrative maps of cancer survival.</p>

<body>
<p>Originally formulated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1363459311428229">Festinger (1954)</xref>, the basic premise of social comparison theory is that comparisons with others (comparison targets) become the basis for self-evaluation. Such comparisons can be made upwards or downwards. With respect to upward social comparisons, individuals compare themselves with others who are in a more favourable situation and appear to be doing better than them on the particular dimension being compared. Individuals, however, may compare themselves with others who are in a less favourable position and appear to be worse off. This is referred to as downward social comparison. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1363459311428229">Buunk and Gibbons (2007</xref>: 16), social comparison is a ubiquitous social phenomenon that virtually everybody practices from time to time because it can fulfil functions that are fundamental, such as, ‘providing’ useful information about where one stands on one’s social world, feeling better about oneself, and learning how to adapt to challenging situations’.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1363459311428229">Carmack Taylor et al. (2007)</xref> suggest two other motivations for social comparison when people are faced with threat: the desire for self-enhancement, and the desire for self-improvement. Downward comparisons can lead to self-enhancement or more positive views of self, situation and mood. In contrast, upward comparisons can be inspiring, service self-improvement desires and have an adaptive function. Relating one’s own actual or potential characteristics to those of other individuals may, therefore, have consequences for how individuals feel and for how they evaluate their situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1363459311428229">Buunk et al., 2006</xref>)</p>
<p>The identification-contrast model proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1363459311428229">Buunk and Ybema (1997)</xref> suggests that people may evoke both contrast and identification processes in each direction of social comparison. Both downward and upward comparison would involve identification or contrast processes, although the consequences may be different. Contrast processes would help people to open up a psychological distance between themselves and their comparison targets (both upwards and downwards), while identification would serve to close the distance.</p>
<p>For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1363459311428229">Bardel et al. (2010)</xref>, complex relationships are involved in these processes so that not only the direction of comparison, but also the degree and nature of contrast/identification processes with the target of the social comparison may produce either positive or negative feelings about the self that can influence evaluations of the new situation. Therefore, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1363459311428229">Locock and Brown (2010)</xref> argue, simple either–or dichotomies do not capture the nuances and variability of how and why people make social comparisons as they do not occupy static or mutually exclusive positions on this issue.</p>
<p>The identification-contrast model suggests that in order to maintain positive well-being, cancer patients have to contrast their situation against patients who are worse off and to identify themselves with patients who are doing better (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1363459311428229">Van Der Zee et al., 2000</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1363459311428229">Carmack Taylor et al. (2007)</xref> note that research with cancer patients has consistently demonstrated the comparison patterns described above. The self-evaluations of cancer patients have been found to be more positive as a result of downward comparisons perhaps because such comparisons increase self-esteem and assist in mood management as part of an emotion-focused coping strategy. However, even though downward comparisons may be preferred for the purposes of self-enhancement, patients tend to avoid interacting with worse-off others. Instead they prefer ‘contact with others who are faring better than they are, particularly if patients have hope that they can improve on the comparison dimension’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1363459311428229">Carmack Taylor et al., 2007</xref>: 266).</p>
<p>In making upward comparisons, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1363459311428229">Carmack Taylor et al. (2007)</xref> suggest that patients generally desire information from others who are doing better and have a more positive affective reaction to such people. Upward comparisons to obtain information usually represent problem-focused coping by seeking potential strategies for self-improvement. They acknowledge that ‘gaining upward comparison information may also be inspirational if it conveys positive outcomes that the recipient feels he or she can obtain’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1363459311428229">Carmack Taylor et al., 2007</xref>: 266). Against this, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1363459311428229">Buunk and Gibbons (2007)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1363459311428229">Locock and Brown (2010)</xref> note, evaluating oneself against others who are coping better can have a negative impact on self-esteem, particularly when it comes to the difficulties of living up to heroic narratives.</p>
<p>In this article we examine the case of a young, Spanish, elite athlete named David (all names are pseudonyms) who was diagnosed with cancer and died from this illness. His experiences provide important insights into the manner in which upward and downward social comparisons operate over time in the course of an illness. They also illuminate how different comparison targets are selected and how this process is informed by specific narrative maps available to him as an elite athlete in the form of an autobiography published by Lance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1363459311428229">Armstrong (2000)</xref>. David’s story also illustrates the narrative menu he has to draw on and the power that one specific narrative type has to dominate all others throughout his illness. The affinity David has for the restitution narrative as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1363459311428229">Frank (1995)</xref> and the manner in which this narrative operates to consistently frame his interpretation of events, regardless of his changing physical condition and the differing narrative environments in which he finds himself, are also examined in detail.</p>
<p>In methodological terms, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1363459311428229">Bellizzi et al. (2006)</xref> argue that little is actually known about the types of social comparison processes used by people and the resulting outcomes on their lives within real-life situations. Therefore, qualitative studies can contribute by focusing on the lived experiences of individuals facing threatening situations and how they utilize social comparisons <italic>in situ</italic>. This is particularly relevant if, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1363459311428229">Van Der Zee et al. (1999)</xref> suggest, individual differences may exist in the tendency or ability to interpret social comparison information in a positive way.</p>
<p>In examining the case of David, we also focus on two issues that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1363459311428229">Buunk et al. (2006)</xref> claim have received little attention in the literature on social comparison and health. First, is the choice of a comparison targets. That is, the others that people compare themselves with. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1363459311428229">Buunk et al. (2006</xref>: 678) note, with the exception of a substantial number of studies on the preference for upward versus downward targets, ‘little information exists as to whether individuals facing serious diseases compare themselves with similar or dissimilar others’. The second issue involves the dimensions on which individuals compare themselves. These could include a wide range of issues such as mental state, symptoms, social activities and physical activities. Also, dimensions of comparison may be different not only in terms of the type of illness but also depending on the type of person and their expression in a social comparison orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1363459311428229">Buunk and Gibbons, 2007</xref>). Likewise, the choice of comparison targets and the dimensions on which individuals compare themselves will be influenced by the narrative resources available to individuals and how they utilize these resources to give meaning to their experiences in changing sets of circumstance.</p>

<title>The participant</title>
<p>David first entered cycling competitions aged 11 and was successful at the regional level. Aged 14 he started competing in triathlon. In 2003, aged 20, David won both National and European Junior Triathlon championships. Due to the socialization processes involved in his sport David developed several of the typical and discrete styles of body usage described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1363459311428229">Frank (1991)</xref> in terms of the disciplined and dominating body. He tried to make his performances predictable by following rigorous training regimes and tended to dissociate from himself by depersonalizing pain and injury, objectifying his body and punishing others and absorbing punishment himself as part of the competitive process.</p>
<p>David also developed a strong athletic identity. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1363459311428229">Brewer et al. (1993)</xref>, this is the degree to which an individual identifies with the athlete role. They note that people with a strong or exclusive athletic identity are more likely to interpret a given event in terms of its implications for their athletic functioning than people who only identify weakly with the athletic role. Such people are thought to be at risk of emotional disturbance on the termination of an athletic career.</p>
<p>In 2005, aged 22, during his second year at university, studying for a degree in Sports Science, and hoping to become an Olympic athlete, David noticed a spot growing on his scalp. His doctor diagnosed melanoma that required immediate surgery, followed by immunotherapy and chemotherapy. Throughout his treatment and during periods of remission, David continued to train and take part in cross-country, swimming and triathlon competitions. Six months before entering hospital for the last time, David took part in a national cross-country race. He was leading for the first two kilometres, but then had to drop out due to exhaustion.</p>
<p>Two years after the initial visit to this doctor and subsequent treatment David felt pain in his kidneys. The diagnosis confirmed that cancer had spread to his kidney, lungs and brain. In February 2007, he was admitted to hospital for palliative chemotherapy. At the end of March 2007, David, aged 24, died in hospital.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1363459311428229">
<title>Data collection and analysis</title>
<p>David was a former student of Víctor Pérez-Samaniego (VPS), who learned about his cancer in November 2006 and invited him to take part in a series of recorded interviews that would explore his experiences of illness as an elite athlete. Prior to the first interview, the ethical principles informing the process were discussed and particularly the issue of anonymity. For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1363459311428229">Tilley and Woodthorpe (2011</xref>: 198) anonymity refers ‘specifically to removing or obscuring the names of participants or research sites, and not including information that might lead participants or research sites to be identified’. In exploring the normalization of this ethical principle in qualitative research they note how difficult it is to achieve ‘total’ anonymity. This was very much so in David’s case because, as was explained to him, even if we used pseudonyms and changed place names in any future publications, his status as an elite athlete who had won major competitions meant that it would be easy for interested parties to identify him.</p>
<p>Against this, VPS discussed with David the possibility of using his real name in the research if he so wished. At the time, while David acknowledged that he was easily identifiable, he preferred that a pseudonym be used as he, like VPS, did not know where the interviews would take him in terms of what he revealed about himself and others and so he felt more comfortable not using his real name in the first instance. It is highly likely that this issue would have been revisited at the end of the study and David could then have made an informed choice about whether or not his real name should be used in our writing about him. David’s death meant that this discussion never took place. In these circumstances, a case might be made that in terms of honouring David’s memory we should, if his close family gave their permission, use his real name. Even if such permission were given, we would not be comfortable doing so because we agreed with David on a certain strategy and, as we could not renegotiate this with him before he died, we prefer to stay with this strategy as a mark of our respect for his wishes.</p>
<p>Following ethical approval from the University of Alcalá, data collection commenced. At first, data were generated in the form of two life history interviews. These took place in VPS’s university office, were conducted in December 2006 and January 2007, and lasted four hours in total. The interviews were conducted by VPS, transcribed verbatim by him, and then read through several times. The data were then subjected to both a thematic and a structural analysis.</p>
<p>A thematic analysis as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1363459311428229">Riessman (2008)</xref> focuses exclusively on the content of ‘what’ is said as opposed to ‘how’ something is said, ‘to whom,’ or ‘for what purposes’. Initially, descriptive exploratory comments were made about the data, for example, reoccurring phrases were underlined and key events highlighted. Conceptual comments were then made on the content of the transcripts that involved moving away from the explicit claims of David. Here, preliminary and tentative connections were made to various theoretical concepts that might be related to specific issues raised by him. Finally, key emergent themes were identified in the data. This involved making connections across narrative segments of David’s life story and attempting to identify patterns and meanings as constructed by him.</p>
<p>One of the emergent themes related to the ways in which David compared himself to others with cancer. Having identified this theme in the data the literature on social comparison theory was then accessed and used as a framing device for the analysis of this aspect of David’s story. That is, the phenomenon of social comparison was grounded in the specific characteristics of the collected data and not constructed or shaped in accord with the pre-existing theories and the work of the scholars mentioned in the introduction to this article.</p>
<p>The interviewing process was interrupted following David’s re-entry to hospital in February 2007 to start palliative chemotherapy. At this point, VPS visited David in a personal capacity to offer him support and he suggested that the research project be abandoned. However, David insisted that the project continue. In accordance with his wishes, VPS then made a further six visits to him in hospital for the purposes of data collection and offering personal support. In the last of these visits on 29 March 2007, VPS was present when David died and experienced the pain and grief that followed this moment with his family, relatives and friends who were there at the time. These six meetings with David were not tape recorded as this was deemed to be intrusive and unethical in the circumstances. Instead, data were collected via field notes of conversations, situations and events. For analytical purposes, these were then utilized in combination with the data generated from the life history interviews conducted with David prior to his hospitalization.</p>
<p>Besides analysing what David told us about his experiences we also focused on ‘how’ he constructed his story. Here, the interview data and the field diary data were subjected to what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1363459311428229">Riessman (2008</xref>: 77) describes as a structural analysis that shifts attention ‘from the “told” to the “telling” and from exclusive focus on a narrator’s experience to the narrative itself’. Such a shift can add insights beyond what can be learned from referential meanings alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1363459311428229">Gubrium and Holstein, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1363459311428229">Riessman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1363459311428229">Sparkes, 2005</xref>). Accordingly, we focused on the structure, plot-line, and type of David’s narrative regarding his cancer experience.</p>
<p>Our analysis revealed that David had adopted what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1363459311428229">Frank (1995</xref>: 77) describes as a <italic>restitution</italic> narrative which has the following storyline, ‘Yesterday I was healthy, today I’m sick, but tomorrow I’ll be healthy again.’ The primary actors in this narrative are medical staff, especially physicians, supported by nurses and technologies (machines, pharmaceuticals). Frank describes two other narrative types. These are the <italic>quest</italic> and <italic>chaos</italic> narratives. In the former, people meet suffering head on. They accept illness and seek to <italic>use</italic> it. Just what is quested for may never be wholly clear, but the quest is defined by the person’s belief that something is to be gained from the experience. In contrast, in the chaos narrative, the plot imagines life never getting better. These stories are chaotic in their absence of narrative order. They are told as the storyteller experiences life: without sequence or discernable causality.</p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1363459311428229">Smith and Sparkes (2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1363459311428229">2005)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1363459311428229">Sparkes and Smith (2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1363459311428229">2011)</xref> have illustrated in their work on men who have suffered catastrophic spinal cord injury and become disabled through playing sport, within each of these narratives certain metaphors, time tenses and kinds of hope work in combination to give very different meanings to the past, current and future body–self relations in ways that shape action on a daily basis. Importantly, we found little or no evidence of the chaos and the quest narratives as described above in action throughout the time spent with David. The dominant storyline was that of restitution. In view of this, following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1363459311428229">Frank’s (2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1363459311428229">2010)</xref> notion that narratives are actors that <italic>do</italic> things that make a difference, part of our analysis focused on the work that the restitution narrative actually did in David’s life with regard to influencing the social comparisons he made and how each of these were woven into and influenced by his interpretations of a narrative map provided in the published autobiography of Lance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1363459311428229">Armstrong (2000)</xref>.</p>
<p>Throughout the project, in order to assist in the development of plausible interpretations, the findings and emergent themes were shared with two colleagues (Andrew C. Sparkes and Brett Smith) who had specific expertise in life history and narrative studies. Their role was to act as critical friends who provided a theoretical sounding board to encourage reflection on, and exploration of, alternative interpretations of events in the field and the analysis of the data. Each was also fully involved in the crafting of the current article.</p>
<p>The fatal outcome of David’s illness raised a number of ethical issues for us as authors that have been noted by others involved with terminally ill people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1363459311428229">Seymour and Ingleton, 2005</xref>). The most obvious was whether or not to continue the research once David was readmitted to hospital and his condition began to deteriorate. This was no easy decision given that David clearly constituted a ‘vulnerable subject’ as defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1363459311428229">Couser (2004)</xref>. Such persons ‘are liable to exposure by someone with whom they are involved in an intimate or trust-based relationship but are unable to represent themselves in writing, or to offer meaningful consent to their representation by somebody else’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1363459311428229">Couser, 2004</xref>: xii). On this issue, we were guided by David himself who asked us to document his story until the very end of his life so that others might learn from his experiences. Our involvement and continuation was also discussed by VPS with David’s father who felt it was appropriate that his son’s wishes be honoured. What follows is part of that commitment to these wishes.</p>
<p>Early in the project, the transcripts of the two life history interviews were returned to David so that he could check their accuracy. However, due to his death, our use of these along with the data from the field notes to generate an interpretation of his life have not undergone the normal procedures of ‘member checking’ or ‘respondent validation’ in which researchers return to participants to ensure that their categories, constructs, explanations and interpretations are deemed fair, appropriate, plausible and appear to be ‘right’ and ‘true’. Some might suggest that such procedures could have been carried out by using the oncologist or a family member to respond to our findings and interpretations of David’s experiences. At the time we did not consider this. However, on reflection we feel that this would not have been appropriate in this case for a number of reasons.</p>
<p>First, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1363459311428229">Goldblatt et al. (2011</xref>: 389) note, applying member checking in health care settings is complex and they question not only the methodological usefulness of this strategy but also its ethical basis:<disp-quote>
<p>Although this strategy has good intentions, it is not necessarily the best method for achieving credibility. Harm can be caused to participants, researchers and the doctor–patient relationship, risking researchers’ commitment to ethical principles … Because participants’ experience regarding member-check is difficult to predict, such a procedure should be undertaken cautiously.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Linked to this issue, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1363459311428229">Holloway (1997)</xref> points out that the process of member checking is intended to give the participants in a setting the opportunity to comment and indicate whether they recognize <italic>their own experiences</italic> from the findings presented to them and whether or not they feel the researcher’s interpretations of their lives and events is fair. While the oncologist and family members might have been able to comment on how they recognize their own experiences in the story we have constructed about David, they do not have direct access to David’s experiences of events and so are not in a position to verify our findings and interpretations of <italic>his</italic> experiences over time. This is not to say that we have not used such people to check on the accuracy of when and where events happened in David’s life. However, this is very different from asking them to comment on what he was actually experiencing at any given moment.</p>
<p>Both <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1363459311428229">Goldblatt et al. (2011)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1363459311428229">Holloway (1997)</xref> note that member checking is problematic when a long time has elapsed between the original data collection and the checking is undertaken. This is because the life situations of participants could have changed which, in turn, might alter their perspectives and experience so that they construct a different interpretation of events now than they would have when it actually happened some time ago. In our case, four years has elapsed since the data were collected and so the value of now going back to David’s family members or his oncologist remains questionable.</p>
<p>This is particularly so with regard to the possibility of member checking working to remind family members of their painful emotional experiences leading up to and including David’s death. Here, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1363459311428229">Goldblatt et al. (2011)</xref> suggest, the potential for enhancing the credibility of our interpretations of David’s life needs to be balanced against that of invading family members’ privacy and the negative emotions this might instigate. In addition, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1363459311428229">Holloway (1997)</xref> points out, it can be difficult for participants to be ‘objective’ about the interpretations made by the researcher of events they have been involved in as they might take these as criticisms of themselves and their actions. In this regard, some of the comments made by David about his treatment options might be taken as criticisms by his oncologist and family members in ways that influence their judgements of his story as told by us.</p>
<p>The interpretation offered of David’s life in this article is, therefore, wholly ours which places a heavy burden of responsibility on us as writers. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1363459311428229">Couser (2004</xref>: 16, emphasis in original) states:<disp-quote>
<p><italic>Death</italic> … might seem to suggest utter invulnerability to harm; but I would argue that it entails maximum vulnerability to posthumous misrepresentation because it precludes self-defence. Thus, we trust that after we die our corpse will be treated with respect, that our ‘will’ be honored, and that secrets we may have divulged will be respected, either by being kept or being communicated only to certain parties in certain ways. In this regard, death may be the state of ultimate vulnerability and dependency.</p>

<p>Building on principles from biomedical ethics, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1363459311428229">Couser (2004)</xref> explores what respect for autonomy, non-maleficence, beneficence and justice might mean for those who write about the lives of others. He notes that ‘a primary principle of ethical representation of vulnerable subjects should be respect for autonomy, which is rooted in a fundamental ethical principle, respect for persons’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1363459311428229">2004</xref>: 18). Accordingly, we have made every effort to portray David’s life in a respectful manner throughout this article.</p>
<p>With regard to notions of beneficence, we hope that David gained some benefit from telling his story to us. We feel that knowing we would make his story public with a view to helping others with cancer was a source of gratification for David. In this regard, VPS maintained contact with David’s father, keeping him informed about the steps taken by us in the analysis and writing of this article as a sign of our commitment to David’s final wishes. In these meetings, David’s father reaffirmed his trust in us as researchers to represent his son in a fair and ethical manner. He also confirmed his hope that David’s story might help others who find themselves in similar circumstances. Accordingly, we now proceed to explore moments of David’s life and how he gave meaning to his cancer experience as an elite athlete.</p>

<title>Upward social comparison targets</title>
<p>In making sense and coping with his cancer experience, David tended to identify himself with other people who were doing better than him. The following comment is one of many that illustrated this engagement with upward social comparisons:<disp-quote>
<p>I see myself like those who beat cancer. It’s these people I identify with. When all this is over, when I’ve beaten cancer, everything is going to be good. There are always people who beat cancer. It is like in sport, you must keep on struggling, battling. If you want to win, just do not think you can be defeated. I see people that beat cancer as bunkers, indestructible. I can identify with them, because being two years like this [in remission] is a big deal … I know I am going to be one of them. I am a bunker too! [Laughs.]</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Besides illustrating how David engaged in upward social identification with cancer survivors, his comment also indicates the privileged role of sport in providing particular meaning to this process. This is especially so with regard to his use of sporting-war metaphors associated with struggling, battling, beating and winning the fight with cancer. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1363459311428229">Smith and Sparkes (2004)</xref> suggest, such usage signals his association with the western cultural notion of the archetypical hero who overrides needs and limitations to fight or push onward towards victory over his body despite pain, fatigue and hardship. David often made upward comparisons with sportsmen who had experienced life threatening illnesses but then made a successful comeback to their sport. For example, José Francisco Mol, a footballer who survived pancreatic cancer and Andres López, a cyclist known by David who overcame testicular cancer to return to this sport.</p>
<p>One figure, however, dominated David’s upward identification. This person was Lance Armstrong, who in 1996 was the top ranked cyclist in the world when he was also diagnosed with Stage 4 testicular cancer that had spread to his brain and lungs, giving him a less than 40 per cent chance of survival. Less than three years after being diagnosed, having undergone surgery to remove a testicle, and following chemotherapy treatment, brain surgery and the subsequent remission of the disease, Armstrong won the Tour de France in 1999. In achieving this victory, Armstrong made perhaps the most astonishing comeback in contemporary sports history before going on to win the Tour a further six times. These sentiments are echoed by David.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>David:</speaker>
<p>Nearly everybody, more or less, knows Armstrong, don’t they? I know he was there [had cancer] and then he won seven Tours. I think that there is nothing impossible in life.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>Have you read his autobiography?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>David:</speaker>
<p>Four times at least. It’s my bible. I see that guy right now as a God. Because, he had a 3 per cent chance of life expectancy. This guy is physically gifted. He won seven Tours and the guy was a triathlete. He won the USA championship. For me he is the best. Not just the most important athlete of all times, but the most important figure in history. The most important historical figure existing and who ever existed. He overcame cancer and won seven Tours. Amazing! Like Armstrong, I’m going to beat cancer and win big sports events. Knowing that makes me feel good, positive.</p>
</speech>
<p>Unusually for a sporting autobiography, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1363459311428229">Armstrong’s (2000)</xref> book entitled <italic>It’s Not about the Bike: My Journey Back to Life</italic> was a best seller around the world and read by millions of people. This included David who had read it prior to being diagnosed with cancer. However, following his diagnosis Armstrong’s autobiography took on even greater significance, and as he states, he read it again as his ‘bible’ at least four more times from his new positioning as a cancer patient. Reading this autobiography prior to diagnosis may have provided David with a preliminary narrative map of how an elite athlete might experience and deal with cancer. Following his diagnosis it most certainly became a key resource and a strongly contoured narrative map that David drew upon to give meaning to his cancer experience.</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1363459311428229">Pollner and Stein (1996)</xref>, narrative maps provide a cultural mechanism for learning how to act and negotiate new identities in unfamiliar situations. For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1363459311428229">Frank (2002</xref>: 166), published illness narratives like Armstrong’s operate as a <italic>selective</italic> map that affect social perceptions of illness and play a ‘significant role in teaching people how to be ill, how to interpret their own and others’ illness experiences, and what stories are worth attending to. More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1363459311428229">Frank (2010</xref>: 48) emphasizes that this is particularly so once certain stories have got under people’s skin and begun their work of affecting the terms in which people think, know, and perceive: ‘Stories teach people what to look for and what can be ignored; they teach what to value and what to hold in contempt’.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1363459311428229">Armstrong’s (2000)</xref> autobiography influenced the directionality of David’s upward social comparisons and his choice of comparison targets. His close affinity for the disciplined and dominating body as well as the exclusive athletic identity that Armstrong had developed through his sport also connected with David. Thus, a powerful identification occurred via the similarities in his own embodied dispositions to the restitution narrative that dominates the early parts of Armstrong’s autobiography which deal with treatment regimes and ‘battling’ cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1363459311428229">Sparkes, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>As stated earlier, the restitution narrative, as defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1363459311428229">Frank (1995</xref>: 77), has the following storyline: ‘Yesterday I was healthy, today I’m sick, but tomorrow I’ll be healthy again.’ This narrative is intimately linked to the notion of the restorable body–self, and is ‘filled out with talk of tests and their interpretation, treatments and possible outcomes, the competence of physicians, and alternative treatments’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1363459311428229">1995</xref>: 77). For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1363459311428229">Armstrong (2000</xref>: 92) this meant him learning the language of oncology, its regimes, tests and interpretations, ‘I mastered a whole new language … I began to throw around phrases like “treatment protocol”. I wanted to know it all.’</p>
<p>Likewise, David also learned this language as evidenced in the following comment:<disp-quote>
<p>I sweat a lot now, especially at night. The other morning I woke up wet, like if I had pissed on my pyjamas [laughs]. But this is good, because it means that the interleukins are fighting against the tumour. It is disgusting, but if that cures me I would wake up wet every morning [laughs].</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>David’s willingness and ability to engage with and adopt the language of oncology in search of a cure was further enhanced by his status as a university student of sport science which gave him access to specialized medical texts and data bases (e.g. Medline). Indeed, on certain occasions, David felt that through his own research into the topic, he actually had more knowledge about certain cancer treatments than his oncologists. This was especially so with regard to gene therapy as evidenced in the following comment which also hints that David’s expectations of what an oncologist should do, that is, help him to live the restitution narrative fully, are not being met in this instance.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>David:</speaker>
<p>There is a guy at the National Cancer Institute of the USA that does gene therapy. He made experiments with 17 men with advanced melanoma. More advanced than the one I have. They take some tumour cells out, they create an anti-gene at the laboratory and they put them in. Well, 15 out of the 17 were cured and the rest had important remissions. I told the doctor [oncologist] that I have contacted this guy. He did not know a damn, of course.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>Your doctor didn’t know about gene therapy?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>David:</speaker>
<p>No. Most doctors here say ‘I told you not to search on the internet … Don’t do it. You will become crazy.’ And I say, ‘Look, Director of the National Cancer Institute of USA, gene therapy.’ And they go … ‘Oh well, you know, we are open to new possibilities, alternatives, and so on.’</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>Do you think they don’t want to treat you with gene therapy?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>David:</speaker>
<p>Fuck no! I know they do it at the Central Hospital. And they [oncologists] have not mentioned it!</p>
</speech>
<p>Given his sport science background and access to medical literature, David was capable of reading the results of tests on him in an ‘objective’ manner. During VPS’s second visit to him in the hospital he learned that the previous day David’s medical notes and scan results were inadvertently left on his bed while he was taking a walk around the hospital. Reading these on his return David was faced with the knowledge that the cancer had spread throughout his body and that his condition was terminal.</p>
<p>Despite knowing his illness was terminal, the net effect of David focusing upon Armstrong as his (almost exclusive) upward comparison target and linking into the restitution narrative, with its reliance on medical technology, was to instil in him a belief that no matter how advanced the cancer was, as long as he displayed the attitudes and behaviours of Armstrong and got appropriate medical treatment, his cancer could be beaten and he would eventually return to health and make a successful comeback in sport. One week before his death, terminally ill and under sedative therapy, David told VPS in his fifth visit to the hospital: ‘I know I am bad, but not as bad as Armstrong used to be.’ That is, there was still a chance of recovery that would be the beginning of his comeback. This comment reflects how David’s identification with Armstrong as an upward comparison target served him until the very end of his life as a metaphorical compass indicating the direction that his illness journey could, and should, take.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1363459311428229">
<title>Upward social comparison dimensions</title>
<p>The thematic analysis we conducted revealed that when identifying with Armstrong, along with other sporting people, David operated with three interrelated upward social comparison dimensions. These are best described as <italic>mental attitude to treatment, the sporting body</italic> and the <italic>ageing body</italic>. With regard to mental attitude to treatment, David only compared himself to those who adopted the attitude that cancer can be beaten as long as the characteristics of heroic masculinity (mental toughness, stoicism and courage) were adopted so as to complete successfully the treatment regimes and ‘beat’ cancer. This mental attitude to treatment incorporates a mind/body dualism that conceptualizes the body as a machine, an ‘it’, in need of fixing. The mind is deemed to play a central role in this fixing process as the following comment illustrates:<disp-quote>
<p>I think that what is most important is your mind …You have to be tough, like Armstrong. You’ve got to be tough to keep on with all this [the treatments] … I know many people that are not here, but I know many that are here [cancer survivors]. I know people that are out of this shit. They are special people, like I am, because in order to cope with all this you must be willing to win. And I will win. No doubt about it. I’ll be a winner like Armstrong.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>When engaging in upward identifications, David also compared himself to others on the dimension of the <italic>sporting body</italic>. This dimension works around the notion that the odds of beating cancer are influenced by the previous fitness levels and training regimes undertaken by the individual as these provide a reservoir of physical resource that the individual can draw on. Here, it is <italic>believed</italic> that highly trained, elite sport performers have a distinct corporeal advantage in the ‘battle’ to ‘beat’ cancer when compared to ‘ordinary’ others. This is evident in the following comment from David:<disp-quote>
<p>I have more chances of coming out of this than others because, basically, my oxygen consumption is higher. My VO<sub>2</sub>Max is much higher than the average person. The higher your oxygen consumption is, the more chance of you living. It is scientifically <italic>proven</italic>. Armstrong is the living proof. It is also proved that the higher your VO<sub>2</sub>Max is, the better you resist chemotherapy. Pedro (a sport physiologist) is certain of this. I can <italic>see</italic> it. I’ve seen it in Armstrong.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The third dimension on which David compared himself was to the <italic>ageing body</italic>. Here, the belief is that the younger one is, the better the chances are of surviving cancer and regaining health. As David commented:<disp-quote>
<p>They [doctors] say: ‘A guy so young with melanoma, that’s strange.’ They do not know what to do. They are more used to old people. If I had got this at 60 maybe I would have had it differently. I probably would have died. But like Armstrong, I’m young, an athlete, and will beat cancer.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>When attempting to gain purchase on an unfamiliar world as a cancer patient and to cope with his illness it appears that David sought specific people who were similar to him in terms of sport, age and body type. This is consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1363459311428229">Franzoi and Klaiber’s (2007</xref>: 211) findings that ‘people who most frequently compare their bodies to a particular reference group are those who use their bodies in a manner similar to the reference group members’. In their study that included US Olympic speed skating team members, professional models and college students, the Olympic athletes were more likely than the others to compare themselves to elite same-sex athletes. Engaging in a similar action that involved making upward social comparisons that evoked strong identification processes would appear to have had a positive effect on David’s ability to cope with cancer and shaped his reactions to events during treatment and his hopes for the future.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1363459311428229">
<title>Downward social comparison targets and dimensions</title>
<p>Even though David engaged predominantly in upward social comparisons and avoided downward comparisons, there were occasions when he did compare himself with persons who were worse off than himself. When he did, there was no sense of identification with the comparison target. Rather, David contrasted his situation with those patients with whom he did not wish to be associated, and constructed a sense of distance from them. They were defined as ‘different’ and seen as the negative ‘other’. This is evident from his following comment:<disp-quote>
<p>The worst moment? Well, at the beginning, when I went to the waiting room [for chemotherapy] … They stuck everybody there, all together … Then you sit down there for an hour or so, with those people, old, dull, sad, speechless, looking at nowhere … It is depressing. It is the only time I’ve felt like crying.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In the process of creating this difference and distance, David operated along two interrelated comparison dimensions. These were <italic>mental attitude to treatment</italic> and <italic>physical appearance</italic>. With regard to the former, David saw some cancer patients as not having the characteristics of heroic masculinity that would ensure they beat cancer. In downward comparisons on this dimension the ‘other’ is defined in terms of ‘lack’ and ‘deficiency’ as the following comment indicates:<disp-quote>
<p>Many times, I saw them [cancer patients] looking at me … They saw me, arriving in my car, cool as can be, relaxed. With my magazines and my newspapers under my arm, I strolled in, talking. I tried to cheer them up. Some are depressed. You know, this is tough. It is easy to get depressed. But I prefer to be with those that battle cancer like I do. They are special people. Only those who fight the battle can win. The rest, they have already lost it. They have nothing to do.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>With downward comparisons, the other dimension on which David compared himself was <italic>physical appearance</italic>. Apart from the scar on his neck, the lack of any other recognizable signs of cancer enabled David to mask his status as a patient from other people. Consequently, David contrasted his bodily appearance with other cancer patients who were worse off than himself in terms of weight, muscularity and especially hair loss. For many cancer patients (including Lance Armstrong) hair loss is an effect of the chemotherapy and a visible symbol to self and other that one is a cancer patient. David did not lose his hair at any point during his cancer treatment, and this became a significant marker for differentiating himself from other cancer sufferers. This was a source of great satisfaction to him, enabled him to feel positively about his body and signalled to him that his body was going to beat cancer. Referring to the barely visible scars on his skull caused by surgery, David commented:<disp-quote>
<p>I’ve got 70 stitches [showing his skull]. Maybe you cannot notice. I have plenty of hair. Fortunately, I haven’t lost my hair. I wouldn’t like to go out there bald, looking gloomy, like a pool ball [laughs]. I do not want people looking at me saying, ‘Look, he’s bald, he’s got cancer – poor boy.’ I’ve got enough with what I’ve got … I prefer to keep my hair, it makes me feel good, satisfied with how my body is dealing with cancer.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This is not to say that noticeable bodily change did not take place once David was admitted to hospital in February 2007. For example, one visible effect of the treatment noted by VPS in his field diary on his first hospital visit was David’s swollen stomach and a general puffiness of his features. In contrast to this, VPS noted that on the walls next to his bed, David had hung pictures of himself crossing the finishing line in a big race, receiving a winner’s trophy and sitting by a pool wearing his Spanish Team tracksuit. Besides him having hair, these pictures were another reminder that David was different from the other cancer patients in the hospital and contributed to the consistency with which he made his downward comparisons even at this late stage in his illness.</p>
<p>The outcome of making such downward comparisons, in line with the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1363459311428229">Carmack Taylor et al. (2007)</xref>, was generally positive for David in terms of self-enhancement, how he defined himself as a cancer patient and how he coped with this disease and its treatment. On the very few occasions, however, when David identified with downward comparison targets, it had a negative impact on him. An example of this can be seen in the comments he makes about a former athlete he knew who died from cancer.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>David:</speaker>
<p>I had a bad experience with a guy that was a former swimming trainer who I could identify with. And, well, this guy died. He had cancer of the colon. And he died. Then, I went to compete with my swimming club to [city], and it was his Memorial. Posters and stickers with his picture were all over the place. I met his wife and his young daughter, one year old. Well, I hugged her and so on. Then, in the afternoon session, I did not know what to do, so I bought the baby some presents and I gave them to her. Then she called me, but I did not answer, because I did not want to. I did not answer. Because … I don’t know. It was horrible. Sometimes I think that … [Long pause. He sinks his head into his arms and exhales loudly.]</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>Who called you?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>David:</speaker>
<p>His wife, to thank me for the presents.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>Why didn’t you answer?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>David:</speaker>
<p>Because I did not feel like I could. I think she noticed because she called a couple of times … I do not want to remember that time. It’s gone. It makes me think I could [five second pause], well, you know … [die].</p>
</speech>
<p>Making this downward comparison to a target who David identified with as both an athlete and a cancer patient, but who died from this disease, was clearly disturbing. His inability or unwillingness to finish the sentence and utter the word ‘death’ signals the proximity of the chaos narrative described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1363459311428229">Frank (1995)</xref> and challenged all that David had constructed in his upward comparisons. Indeed, this episode directly confronts David with his most feared future self (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1363459311428229">Markus and Nurius, 1986</xref>) who might die from cancer despite all the factors described earlier that, for him, in terms of upward comparisons should prevent this outcome. This episode and downward comparison also serves to remind David of the limitations of the restitution narrative that his upward comparisons lead him to embrace. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1363459311428229">Frank (1995)</xref> notes, problems arise with this narrative when the ill person does not find restitution, or when someone who can only tell restitution stories encounters another person whose health will not be restored. For him, ‘When restitution does not happen, other stories have to be prepared or the narrative wreckage will be real’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1363459311428229">1995</xref>: 94).</p>
<p>The death of this former athlete and David’s interactions with his wife and child provided him with a glimpse of what might yet come to be in his life. This glimpse, acted as a poignant reminder that while restitution stories might be true in some cases they are not so in all cases. Hence, David is forced to acknowledge what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1363459311428229">Frank (1995</xref>: 94) describes as the often neglected limitation of the modernist deconstruction of mortality embedded in such stories which is that, ‘when it doesn’t work any longer, there is no other story to fall back on’. Given these circumstances and the question marks it raises about his belief in restitution and his upward comparisons with survivors like Lance Armstrong, David’s unwillingness to engage in downward comparisons is understandable.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section8-1363459311428229" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this article we have explored the ways in which David, an elite athlete, gave meaning to his experiences of cancer prior to dying from this disease. In doing so, we have utilized two frameworks that may, at first glance, seem an unusual coupling. That is, while social comparison theory identifies patterns in what is said without to any great extent considering the context in which it is said (e.g. which interview, at which point in time, how it is produced in interactions), the narrative approach identifies how meaning unfolds in the course of an account (or series of accounts) over time. For us, however, we have found this coupling to be analytically useful for several reasons.</p>
<p>The first reason is that, almost by definition, the narrative approach with its interest in the unfolding of meaning over time demands that we consider the temporal dimensions of how, when and where David made his upward and downward social comparisons. Likewise, the narrative aspect of our work makes us acutely aware of the different narrative environments in which talk about social comparisons was activated. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1363459311428229">Gubrium and Holstein (2009)</xref> remind us, narrative work takes place in real time and concrete places that often have their own specialized interpretive demands that draw on distinctive vocabularies and forms of knowledge. They point out that some of the most important contingencies of narration ‘are the material mediations of a social setting. The appearances of people’s bodies, the location of rooms and objects such as doors and furniture, and lighting can prompt particular kinds of storytelling’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1363459311428229">2009</xref>: 32). Thus, VPS’s quiet university office when David was in remission and feeling well, provides a very different situation for storytelling than the hospital setting that he was admitted to when something was ‘wrong’, he was medicated and his condition rapidly deteriorated.</p>
<p>Against this, it is interesting to note the consistency over time and place in the ways that David made his social comparisons throughout the trajectory of his illness. For example, even when he was receiving palliative treatment, upward comparisons dominated his story with Lance Armstrong being the key comparison target. Similarly, his downward comparisons throughout the different stages of his illness were consistently made by contrasting his appearance, fitness and age with <italic>other</italic> cancer patients as a means of avoiding any identification with them. Such consistency is also evident in the ways that the restitution narrative described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1363459311428229">Frank (1995)</xref> continued to frame David’s telling of his cancer story despite the obvious differences in the narrative environments in which these tellings took place.</p>
<p>A second reason why we have found the coupling of a narrative approach with that of social comparison theory to be useful is that by focusing on how David utilized the latter we have been able to gain some insight into the work that the restitution narrative, as an ‘actor’ in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1363459311428229">Frank’s (2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1363459311428229">2010)</xref> terms, actually <italic>does</italic> in shaping this process and its attendant consequences. For example, framed by notions of restitution, David’s story works, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1363459311428229">Carmack Taylor et al. (2007)</xref> suggest it might, to direct his upward and downward comparisons in ways that help David manage his emotions and give meaning to his changing condition. His story also confirms that both upward and downward comparisons can be undertaken for a number of reasons and be given a variety of meanings depending on context and the degree of contrast/identification that is made with the target of the social comparison (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1363459311428229">Bardel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1363459311428229">Blanton and Stapel, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1363459311428229">Buunk and Ybema, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>David’s story also develops our understanding of upward identification comparisons by illuminating the dimensions of mental attitude to treatment, the sporting body, and the aging body on which individuals like him may compare themselves to others. While our analysis reveals that both contrast and identification comparisons operate in downward processes, they also indicate that the dimensions of mental attitude to treatment and physical appearance play a combined role in the ways in which individuals compare themselves. Given the predominant upward identifications made by David as an elite athlete and cancer patient who had invested a great deal in developing a disciplined-dominating sporting body and an exclusive athletic identity, it is interesting to note that one way in which he made sense of and coped with his illness was by identifying himself with comparison targets whom he strategically selected according to their specific characteristics and body types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1363459311428229">Franzoi and Klaiber, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Our analysis also suggests that the processes involved in making a positive interpretation of events differed for David in terms of the psychological distance with comparison targets. In upward identification, the result was a sense of closeness with Lance Armstrong as a comparison target, who David deemed to be similar to him in a number of significant ways. In downward contrast, however, the consequence was a sense of distance from those cancer patients that David believed he shared no similarities with. Such patients were defined as both alien and the feared ‘Other’ by him.</p>
<p>This suggests, therefore, that David’s sporting identity and the kind of body he had were influential in establishing a psychological distance with the comparison targets. One implication of this is that in selecting comparison targets, athletes who have cancer may assess psychological distance according to their pre-cancer body–self rather than by their actual body–self with cancer. This being especially so when their story is framed predominantly by the restitution narrative. Importantly, both downward contrast and upward identification comparison processes are perceived by David as having positive affective consequences.</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1363459311428229">Van Der Zee et al. (2000)</xref>, engaging in these comparison processes can be a useful coping style that enhances positive interpretations by developing optimism, effort and behavioural change. It is evident from David’s story that when trying to make sense of and cope with cancer, upward identification comparisons provided him with a sense of concrete hope. For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1363459311428229">Smith and Sparkes (2005)</xref>, this kind of hope is directly associated with the restitution narrative and is oriented to the positive expectation of realizing desirable outcomes. It is connected to themes relating to the technology of a medical cure and restoring the body–self to its former healthy state. Concrete hope, they stress, may help to palliate or assuage misery and create a plot structure in which having this kind of hope means not just having a future, but having a future of a certain kind.</p>
<p>For David, engaging in upward identification comparisons and having concrete hope was sustained by the restitution narrative. The usefulness of this narrative in his life should not be underestimated as it provided him with a positive storyline that he could get better and survive cancer. Downwards contrasts may also result in positive affects in terms of fostering a useful coping style that helped David to endure the severity of his treatment, keep his anguish at bay and remain hopeful and optimistic, even in the hardest moments. The restitution narrative in this instance is enabling David to hold his own in difficult conditions of extreme vulnerability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1363459311428229">Frank, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1363459311428229">2012</xref>).</p>
<p>David’s sense of concrete hope for the future and the interpretation of his embodied experiences with cancer in terms of upward and downward comparisons, were clearly influenced by the narrative map provided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1363459311428229">Armstrong’s (2000)</xref> autobiography. Here, it is interesting to note David’s highly selective use of this autobiography in the comparison process. For example, David makes upward comparisons and strongly identifies with the early part of Armstrong’s autobiography that foregrounds his disciplined and dominating body along with his exclusive athletic identity as being prominent in helping him to ‘fight’ and ‘beat’ cancer in line with the restitution narrative. In many ways, given the kind of body that David had developed over the years via his involvement in sporting practices and the social network this has connected him to, his elective affinity for the restitution narrative in general, and the restitution aspects of Armstrong’s autobiography is not surprising.</p>
<p>For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1363459311428229">McAdams (2006)</xref> culture provides people with a menu of narrative forms and contents from which they selectively draw in an effort to line up their lived experience with the kinds of stories available to organize and express it to their self and others. This narrative menu operates as a key resource in linking the sensorial materiality of the body to wider social structures that shape the meaning-making process at the individual and group level. With regard to this menu in terms of illness, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1363459311428229">Frank (1995)</xref> suggests that the restitution narrative is the most popular in western cultures that treat health as the normal condition that people ought to have restored. For him, ‘the ill person’s own desire for restitution is compounded by the expectation that other people want to hear restitution stories’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1363459311428229">1995</xref>: 77). This menu choice is further accentuated in sporting subcultures where, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1363459311428229">Sparkes (1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1363459311428229">1998)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1363459311428229">Sparkes and Smith (2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1363459311428229">2011)</xref>, the restitution narrative often overwhelms any other narrative form in relation to serious injury and illness to the extent that for many athletes, in the first instance, it is the <italic>only</italic> meal on the menu.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note how, when it was announced that David had been diagnosed with cancer, a national newspaper carried a story about him in its sports section with the headline, ‘Competing against cancer.’ This was followed by a report that highlighted the heroic qualities of David as an athlete and drew on all the metaphors associated with the restitution narrative, such as, his bravery in fighting to win the battle against cancer. The popularity of this narrative and its transmission via parts of Armstrong’s autobiography is also evident in the way it is often given as a gift when a person is diagnosed with cancer. For example, soon after he was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2005, the former England rugby international Andy Ripley received no less than <italic>five</italic> copies of Armstrong’s book sent by well-meaning friends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1363459311428229">Ripley, 2008</xref>). Just as much as athletes are hailed or interpellated by the restitution narrative they are also likely to be unwittingly propelled into it by those around them.</p>
<p>There are other reasons why David might have been drawn to restitution stories over others that relate to the narrative habitus he has developed over the years via his socialization into elite sport. Drawing on Pierre Bourdieu’s work, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1363459311428229">Frank (2010)</xref> describes this kind of habitus as the embedding of stories in bodies so that some stories are heard, immediately and intuitively, as belonging to one’s body and self. For Frank, narrative habitus is a ‘disposition to hear some stories as those one ought to listen to, ought to repeat on appropriate occasions, and ought to be guided by’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1363459311428229">2010</xref>: 52). It describes the embodied sense of attraction, indifference, or repulsion that people feel in response to stories which leads them to define some story as for us or not for us. Narrative habitus, therefore, ‘is the unchosen force in any choice to be interpellated by a story, and the complementary rejection of the interpellation that other stories would effect if a person were caught up in them’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1363459311428229">2010</xref>: 53).</p>
<p>David’s adoption of the restitution narrative should not be viewed deterministically. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1363459311428229">Frank (2006)</xref> notes, while stories perform the work of <italic>subjectification</italic> (telling people who they ought to be, who they might like to be and who they can be), he also emphasizes that any given story as a subjectifier can have different effects. That is, ‘people are rarely docile selves who passively accept any story’s claims to represent who that self is’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1363459311428229">2006</xref>: 430). This view is supported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1363459311428229">Gubrium and Holstein (2009</xref>: 30) who recognize that people work at assembling their stories, ‘artfully picking and choosing from what is experientially available to articulate inner lives and social worlds’. Narratives are not mere reproductions of social worlds and storytellers are neither automatic information transmitters nor cultural dopes. This said, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1363459311428229">Frank (2006)</xref> emphasizes, the artful composition of health or illness stories necessarily involves the selection of some over others, and some parts of the same story over others depending on the circumstances. Thus, a person’s health or illness consciousness comprises which stories they take on board from what is available in the cultural menu:<disp-quote>
<p>Taking something on board implies making space for it, reorganizing what has been there to provide for this new arrival and its claim. Many stories call out to be taken on board; space can be found for relatively few. <italic>Health</italic> for any person is a fluid process of living with certain stories and taking on board some new stories, while leaving many competing stories to float in the river of not-for-me. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1363459311428229">Frank, 2006</xref>: 424, emphasis in original)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>On leaving certain stories to float in the river of not-for-me, it is significant how David chooses to ignore the fact that as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1363459311428229">Armstrong’s (2000)</xref> autobiography unfolds, he shows signs of moving towards the quest narrative as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1363459311428229">Frank (1995)</xref>. Here, Armstrong accepts the illness and redefines cancer as a journey that transforms the individual who gains something positive in the process of sharing his insights with others. On this journey, Armstrong begins to redefine his previously negative views of cancer patients made as part of his downward social comparisons. He comments, ‘As I went through therapy, I felt increasing companionship with my fellow patients’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1363459311428229">2000</xref>: 154). This increasing companionship is illustrated by acts of care given to other cancer patients. Importantly, this sharing of his body and experiences with other cancer patients is seen by Armstrong to have a positive effect on himself and his fellow sufferers.</p>
<p>The downward social comparisons made by David in relation to other cancer patients generated very different outcomes than those made by Armstrong. For example, David’s steadfast adherence to the restitution narrative meant that he remained locked into the demands and elective affinities of the disciplined and dominating bodies that maintained his separation from others worse off than himself in his downward social comparisons. In this regard, David’s selective use of parts of Armstrong’s autobiography would seem to confirm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1363459311428229">Frank’s (1995)</xref> view that narrative maps are not taken on by bodies with no history. For him,<disp-quote>
<p>The old map may now be less useful, but it has hardly been carbonized. Disease happens in a life that already has a story, and this story goes on, changed by the illness but also affecting how the illness story is formed. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1363459311428229">1995</xref>: 54)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>David’s use of Armstrong as an upward comparison target, and his selective use of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1363459311428229">Armstrong’s (2000)</xref> autobiography clearly enabled him to maintain a positive view of himself as a cancer patient and assisted him to cope with experiences. However, it must be acknowledged that ultimately this kind of narrative map, with its notion of restitution, failed to work for David and will fail for many other athletes (and non-athletes) who confront cancer in the future. Therefore, functioning as a potential ‘master’ narrative map of illness, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1363459311428229">Sparkes (2004)</xref> has pointed out, Armstrong’s autobiography may be problematic in certain sets of circumstance. For example, while Sparkes recognizes that the restitution narrative, when linked to notions of heroic masculinity and certain kinds of performing bodies, may be inspirational for some, he notes that it may also lock people into one pattern of response, thereby directing the course of recovery in personally limiting ways. This is particularly so when this ‘locking in’ reduces people’s access to other narratives available within the cultural repertoire that may work to provide very different experiences of, and ways to respond to, life threatening illness over time.</p>
<p>In this regard, we are left wondering about the work that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1363459311428229">Frank’s (1995)</xref> quest narrative might have done in shaping David’s upward and downward social comparisons, his ways of coping and his overall cancer experience, should he have chosen to adopt aspects, or even all, of this different narrative form. Of course, such questions are beyond the scope of this article and further studies are required to illuminate the narrative resources made available to those who inhabit elite performing bodies, why they develop elective affinities for certain narratives over others within the available cultural repertoire, and how these narratives do their work on a daily basis in shaping the illness experience of athletes and non-athletes in very different ways. We hope this article has made a modest contribution to this venture.</p>
