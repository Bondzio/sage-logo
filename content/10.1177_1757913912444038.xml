<p>As CEO of ART, I’m creating a substantial internet resource on ageing and health. My work on this will take me to the computer, where I seek to keep all the plates spinning. These include a study we’re doing with our fellow members of the Dementia Action Alliance, and other leading stakeholders, on timely diagnosis and better pathways to treatment for Alzheimer’s and other dementias. The proportion of people in NHS hospital beds with dementia is enormous, and better approaches are sorely needed to avoid the slow-motion train wreck most of us see coming if we don’t act. Dementia is the sharp end of a very big wedge, and in seeking to deal with this I find that each day brings more influential and clever support for dealing with the whole wedge.</p>
<p>I’ll also be riding another of my public health hobby horses- the value of first aid training for the general public. Many acknowledge this, yet the proportion of people with any such training remains very low indeed. On a good day I work with private sector partners which will soon make such training easy and readily available to everyone over 50 for the sake of their communities, children and grandchildren.</p>
<p>All this will complete my desk work sufficiently to go off for a five or three mile run and some circuit training. This is an enjoyable and stabilising habit from my previous career as a performer in film, stage and TV. Evening sees me back at the computer for the day’s substantial written and creative work. A meal with my wife, some relaxation together, and - as we’re describing a good day here - gratefully off to bed.</p>

<p>My day is usually a juggling act between my many roles; as a public health physician, project manager and also an ICT development expert. Earlier today, I had an advocacy meeting with the Majority Leader of the House of Representatives of Nigeria, where we discussed legislative issues concerning maternal, newborn and child health and heath-related Millennium Development Goals.</p>
<p>Between 2002 and 2003, I worked with the Senate Committee on Health as a legislative intern and advisor, a platform that enabled me to collaborate with UNICEF and WHO to introduce the ‘Rights –based Approach’ to reproductive health in Nigerian medical circle.</p>
<p>Prior to my visit to the National Assembly, my day started with a series of internal meetings. Usually my first meeting is with the Synergy PMP team, a major consulting firm that I head. One of our main aims for this year is to deliver public health management courses across the federation. I also chair the International Public Health Forum (IPHF), and we are currently in the process of reorganizing the IPHF, which has over 2000 members worldwide.</p>
<p>I also serve as a senior consultant to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation-funded Nigerian Urban Reproductive Health Initiative (NURHI) and the Health Reform Foundation of Nigeria (HERFON), which is a leading non-profit policy organization in Nigeria.</p>
<p>It’s a humbling to look back at how far I have come. I am lucky to have worked across Africa with the likes of UNICEF, UNHCR, WHO, USAID, DFID and other international development partners. Public Health has opened my eyes to the daily health challenges of our world.</p>
