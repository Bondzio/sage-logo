<abstract>
<p>In this article, we discuss how certain sexual norms currently labeled as ‘Norwegian’ come into play in immigration policy related to marriage migrants and homosexuals who seek asylum in Norway. Our analyses indicate that discourses on sexuality in immigration politics are gendered and racialized at the Norwegian border. We discuss the continued significance of Orientalist notions that render its sexual subjects as inherently ‘different’ and supposedly premodern in contemporary regulation of immigration to Norway. Independence, freedom of choice and informed, strategic initiative, usually considered late modern ideals, seem to be grounds for suspecting the motivation for migration. Migration seems to be legitimate only when it is a result of necessity caused by the inherent emotional and sexual needs which signify the authentic homosexual and marriage migrant.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1363460712436540" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>In recent years, intimate citizenship has become increasingly important in relation to immigration and integration policy in several European countries, including Norway. At the same time, researchers have suggested that feminism, gender equality and gay and lesbian rights play a significant role in distinctions between ethnic nationals and non-western immigrants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1363460712436540">Gressgård and Jacobsen, 2008</xref>; Haritaworn, 2008, 2010; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1363460712436540">Puar, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1363460712436540">Røthing and Svendsen, 2009</xref>). Adopting certain sexual norms seems to have become a prerequisite for citizenship in these contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1363460712436540">Butler, 2009</xref>). The Norwegian anthropologist Marianne Gullestad noted in 2002 that gender equality seemed to have become a border marker between ethnic Norwegians and immigrants of non-western origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1363460712436540">Gullestad, 2002</xref>). Scholars have since traced an increasing tendency to link both gender equality and support of gay rights to Norwegian culture in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1363460712436540">Mühleisen and Røthing, 2009</xref>; Røthing and Svendsen, 2011). In this article, we analyze how certain sexual norms currently labeled as ‘Norwegian’ come into play in immigration regulation. The state-sponsored couple-counseling course <italic>Living Together</italic> (2005) is used to define ‘Norwegian sexuality’ in this context.</p>
<p>We have chosen two empirical fields to explore how certain Norwegian sexual norms play into inclusion and exclusion in immigration policy: firstly, regulation of family immigration based on marriage; secondly, immigration authorities’ regulations and guidelines concerning applications for asylum based on persecution for homosexuality. We argue that late modern ideals concerning independence, freedom of choice and informed, strategic initiative seem to be grounds for suspecting the motivation for migration. Migration seems to be legitimate only when it is a result of necessity caused by the inherent emotional and sexual needs which signify the authentic homosexual and marriage migrant.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-1363460712436540"><title>Norwegian sexual politics</title>
<p>Discussions about citizens’ rights and possibilities concerning sexuality, as well as how their sexuality defines their rights and prospects, are fundamentally about citizenship. Citizenship defines the formal rights and privileges of citizens as well as their opportunities for influence in society. Sociologist Ken Plummer has developed the term ‘intimate citizenship’ (1995, 2001, 2003), which is used to shed light on how individuals’ choices and practices concerning relationships, intimacy and sexuality have to be negotiated with public discourses, institutions and policies, such as law, health services, family policy and media representations.</p>
<p>State regulations of intimate citizenship in Norway, influenced by Nordic state feminism, have fostered a combination of individualization and a high degree of social stability.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1363460712436540">1</xref></sup> Beck and Beck-Gernsheim (1995, 2002) argue that individualization can be seen as a social transformation that increasingly produces individuals who negotiate and choose personal relationships and form life choices in relation to the welfare state and the market (see also Roseneil, 2007). In the Nordic context, comprehensive welfare services provide for healthcare, childcare and unemployment security, thereby mitigating the personal risks of the neo-liberal workplace and the potential precariousness that the decline in traditional family structures may be argued to produce (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1363460712436540">Honneth, 2004</xref>). This situation is a result of closer co-operation between feminist activism, the state, parliamentary politics and research than has been the case in Anglo-American contexts (Hagemann, 2003; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1363460712436540">Halsaa, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1363460712436540">Hernes, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1363460712436540">Holst, 2005</xref>). The state’s effort to stabilize cohabitation and parenting through welfare benefits and regulation are an example of this (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1363460712436540">Andersen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1363460712436540">Danielsen and Mühleisen, 2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1363460712436540">2009b</xref>).</p>
<p>In <italic>Norske seksualiteter</italic> (<italic>Norwegian Sexualities</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1363460712436540">Mühleisen and Røthing, 2009</xref>), we argue that the Norwegian state has assimilated a number of policy proposals made by the feminist and gay and lesbian movements and turned them into national policy over the last few decades. Marriage, or the ‘patriarchal nuclear family’, so widely attacked by feminism and queer activists in the 1970s, now seems to have become the norm for all sexual relationships, regardless of gender and sexuality. The Gender Neutral Marriage Act implemented on 1 January 2009 can thus be seen as the last accomplishment of the Norwegian state’s extensive will to reform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1363460712436540">Andersen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1363460712436540">Mühleisen et al., 2009b</xref>: 21).</p>
<p>The Norwegian state-initiated and financed course for first-time parents, <italic>Living Together</italic> (2005), may serve as an illustration of current sexual norms and ideals in Norwegian intimate citizenship. The prevailing model for family life in western culture is based on a strong link between parenting and mutual sexual attraction, as well as a strong emotional relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1363460712436540">Stacey, 1998</xref>). In accordance with this ideal, the broad political consensus in Norway is to support couples with children in strengthening their relationships. In 2004, a majority in the Norwegian parliament, excluding representatives of the right-wing progress party, voted to fund a course for all couples who give birth to their first child (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1363460712436540">St. meld. 29, 2002–2003</xref>). The reasoning behind the measure was that a stable and lasting couple relationship ‘concerns children’s living conditions in a fundamental way’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1363460712436540">Ludvigsen and Danielsen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1363460712436540">St. meld. 29, 2002–2003</xref>: 14).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1363460712436540">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>The eight-hour course, <italic>Living Together</italic>, was offered from 2005 with its primary objective being to strengthen the long-lasting and committed relationship as a normative frame for parenting, as well as to prevent couples with children from breaking up.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1363460712436540">3</xref></sup> Analyses of the content of this course show that participants are presented with a strategic, constructivist understanding of sexuality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1363460712436540">Danielsen and Mühleisen, 2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1363460712436540">2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1363460712436540">Mühleisen et al., 2009a</xref>). This reflects how sexuality in late modernity no longer has reproduction as its ultimate end, but instead serves a range of purposes, including lust, the establishment and maintenance of relationships, and signifying lifestyle choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1363460712436540">Plummer, 2003</xref>: 19). Anthony Giddens’ term for these changes is ‘plastic sexuality’ – an open and flexible sexuality (1992). Mutual sexual attraction is identified as the ultimate indication of love in the course. This implies that in a ‘good couple’ the two continually desire each other and have sex regularly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1363460712436540">Danielsen and Mühleisen, 2009a</xref>). This way of thinking draws on the one hand on an understanding of sexuality as inherent, authentic and spontaneous; on the other hand, sexuality is described in the course literature as synonymous with ‘hard work’, which can be seen to indicate a constructivist and strategic view of sexuality. The prevailing understanding of sexuality in the course can be understood in light of a tension-filled but reconcilable negotiation between encouraging individual responsibility through taking one’s share of the sexual ‘work’ involved, and faith in an authentic, true sexuality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1363460712436540">Danielsen and Mühleisen, 2009b</xref>), which is also typical of the self-help genre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1363460712436540">Petrella, 2007</xref>: 155–156; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1363460712436540">Plummer, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>The course, in accordance with Norwegian sexual norms, also embraces couples besides those in traditional heterosexual relationships. Same-sex couples, couples with ethnic minority backgrounds, parents with adopted children and couples who have children with disabilities are included in the course material and invited as participants. Explicit inclusion conveys an ambition to assimilate different sexual and relationship forms into the model of the gender-equal, heteronormative parenting couple (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1363460712436540">Danielsen and Mühleisen, 2009a</xref>). The reproducing couple thus appears as a flexible and potentially integrating norm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1363460712436540">Mühleisen et al., 2009a</xref>) and the couple-counseling course can be seen as part of the dominant trend in Norwegian sexual politics in recent years, which has been marked by both inclusion in public institutions and heteronormalization. The course could thus be described as an example of the various inclusive – or rather equalizing – strategies also for immigrant couples educated, through participation in <italic>Living Together,</italic> in the Norwegian gender-equal model for parenting. In this way, they become part of what is ‘Norwegian’ and could produce children who become full Norwegian citizens, culturally as well as legally, thereby serving to contribute to the reproduction of the nation rather than to threaten it.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec3-1363460712436540"><title>Negotiating Norwegian sexuality in marriage migration</title>
<p>About one-third of migrants to Norway in the period 1990–2007 were family migrants. Of these, 60% were granted residence permits based on their status as spouses of legal Norwegian residents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1363460712436540">Daugstad, 2006</xref>: 13). Political concern with restricting immigration is thus relevant for regulation of which types of marriage offer grounds for granting residence permits in Norway.</p>
<p>Pro forma marriage emerged as a political problem in Norway in conjunction with the 1975 immigration stop and the decreasing quota of residence permits allowed as a result. In the new Immigration Act implemented on 1 January 2010, pro forma marriage was addressed as follows:<disp-quote>
<p>Residence permit can be denied if it appears highly probable that the main objective with the marriage is to establish a foundation for residence permit in the kingdom for the applicant. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1363460712436540">Ot. Prp. Nr. 75, 2006–2007</xref>: 188)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Previously established legislation likewise states: ‘For the granting of family reunification, it is required that the marriage is formally valid, that the spouses must share residence, and that the marriage is authentic’ (§9 first section cf. Immigration directive §23 first section, letter a). If these demands are not met, the party that does not have an individual right to a residence permit in Norway can be denied entrance to the country, or be returned to his or her country of origin.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1363460712436540">4</xref></sup></p>
    <p>Though Norwegian law does not list specific requirements for an ‘authentic’ marriage, a number of facets are listed in the proposition to the new Immigration Act of 2010 as grounds for suspecting that a marriage is not authentic. These include the ‘character’ of the relationship, its length, age difference and how well the parties knew each other prior to the marriage. It is suggested that the marriage should also be scrutinized if the reference person (Norwegian resident) has a marriage history that is atypical, or if there is a suspicion of polygamy or money being involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1363460712436540">Eggebø, forthcoming</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1363460712436540">Ot. Prp. Nr. 75, 2006–2007</xref>: 187).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1363460712436540">5</xref></sup> The recommendations are vague, however, and left to the discretion of police and immigration authorities. Nevertheless, the implicit criteria for authentic marriages can be said to lean on modern, western motivations for marriage in relation to love and individualism, similar to those that appear in <italic>Living Together.</italic> The only concrete requirement the authorities have to navigate from separating authentic from pro forma marriages is that of a shared residence. In legal documents that require transnational spouses to share a residence, there is an implicit expectation that they should share a bedroom, a bed, and have sex with each other.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1363460712436540">6</xref></sup> Sexual activity thus seems to be an unspoken but central point when distinguishing authentic love-marriages of western custom, and authentic arranged marriages, from illegal pro forma marriages. Sexual activity is seen as a private activity conducted in the home, as an authentic and ‘pure’ activity which cannot be conducted for purposes other than strengthening the relationship – as also advised in <italic>Living Together</italic> – and not least as the only hard proof that a marriage is not pro forma.</p>
<p>It is evident from the new Immigration Act, however, that ‘arranged marriages’, as currently practiced in parts of Norwegian society, are also taken into account. Following the listed facets of a marriage which may render it pro forma, it is noted that authentic arranged marriages should not be prevented by the new law (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1363460712436540">Ot. Prp. Nr. 75, 2006–2007</xref>: 187–190). This appears to be a difficult balancing act, as both pro forma marriages and arranged marriages can be said to be ‘marriages of convenience’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1363460712436540">Staring, 1998</xref>) and at odds withwestern ideals concerning self-chosen romantic love and mutual sexual attraction as the foundations for marriage. The arranged – as opposed to pro forma – marriage can acquire an authentic character, however, as it is meant to last over time and thus be a stable and potentially reproductive relationship.</p>
<p>Different kinds of transnational marriages seem to raise varying degrees of attention from immigration authorities. Marriages between ethnic Norwegian men and non-western women, granted that the age difference appears ‘normal’, seem to attract less suspicion than marriages between ethnic Norwegian women and non-western men, or marriages between two persons of non-western origin. More ethnic Norwegian men than women engage in transnational marriages and tend to marry women who are citizens of the Philippines, Thailand, or Russia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1363460712436540">Daugstad, 2006</xref>: 14). This kind of transnational marriage has been acknowledged as problematic by Norwegian authorities because the women in question are potentially more at risk from domestic violence, especially because their residence permits depend on their marriage status for three years following their family reunification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1363460712436540">Ot. Prp. Nr. 75, 2006–2007</xref>: 184).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1363460712436540">7</xref></sup> These marriages can also be met by skepticism from ethnic Norwegians when men assert that part of their reason for marrying an East European or Asian woman is that they are (or are assumed to be) more willing than Norwegian women to comply with traditional gender roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1363460712436540">Flemmen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1363460712436540">Lotherington, 2008</xref>). Both the new Immigration Act and Flemmen and Lotherington’s research point to concerns regarding whether these couples are complying with Norwegian norms concerning gender equality.</p>
<p>In spite of these concerns, there seem to be several legitimate reasons for a man to marry a woman who would not otherwise have access to a Norwegian residence permit. Such reasons include having someone to help with the housework and as a remedy for loneliness. The spouse can also be assumed to fulfill certain sexual needs and offer the opportunity to start a family. These reasons seem to make the marriage appear sufficiently stable, normal and beneficial to society. Since the motivation for the marriage is assumed to include a wish to reproduce, the marriage can seem advantageous both for the Norwegian man who marries a foreign woman and for Norwegian society in general.</p>
<p>For a foreign woman involved in these types of heterosexual transnational marriages, her reasons for marrying an ethnic Norwegian may include economic prosperity for herself, as well as for any children or other family members in her country of origin. This kind of strategic motivation is addressed in the new Immigration Act, in which it is stated that such reasons should <italic>not</italic> jeopardize the spouse’s residence permit ‘as long as the marriage is also intended to be authentic’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1363460712436540">Ot. prp. Nr 75, 2006–2007</xref>: 190). A foreign woman’s reasons can be of a kind that renders the marriage illegal because of their pro forma nature, but it is still treated as authentic and does not seem to arouse negative attention. How can this be understood? Could it indicate that her reasons appear to be <italic>compatible</italic> with those of her Norwegian spouse?</p>
<p>In accordance with a certain discourse about male sexual drives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1363460712436540">Hollway, 1984</xref>), the man’s reason for seeking a transnational marriage can be assumed to include satisfaction of sexual needs. The established notion about female sexuality, however, is that she is not motivated by a desire to fulfill sexual needs. How can their motives still seem compatible? A possible answer is that she is implicitly assumed to be ready to engage in strategic sex to obtain what she herself seeks in the marriage. There is also a long tradition of understanding women’s participation in marital sexual activity as a part of the work women are expected to do in the relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1363460712436540">Cacchioni, 2007</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1363460712436540">Jackson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1363460712436540">Jackson and Scott, 1997</xref>). Such female gendered willingness to participate in strategic sex is also hinted at in <italic>Living Together,</italic> in spite of the course’s gender-neutral rhetoric, when it is pointed out that it is women who most often are reluctant to have sex in the time after a baby has been born, while also recommending that the couple engage in sexual activity for the strategic reason of strengthening the relationship during this time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1363460712436540">Danielsen and Mühleisen, 2009a</xref>). When the transnational marriages that we discuss here so easily seem to pass as authentic and not strategic and pro forma, it may be that women’s willingness to participate in marital sex for reasons other than lust is a common denominator that can be used to explain both western and non-western women’s actions. Established notions about women’s assumed willingness to trade sex for other goods in heteronormative exchanges clearly feed into this interpretation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1363460712436540">Cacchioni, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1363460712436540">Jackson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1363460712436540">Jackson and Scott, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Assumptions about women’s willingness to trade sex for other goods in heteronormative exchanges seem to be strengthened by racialized and Orientalist assumptions about non-white women’s availability to white men as symbolic conquerors. Orientalism is, according to Edward Said, a way of knowing about or ‘coming to terms with the Orient that is based on the Orient’s special place in European and Western experience’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1363460712436540">Said, 2003 [1978]: 1</xref>). Said notes how the Oriental woman in Orientalist literature has been depicted as both indiscriminate in her choice of sexual partners, and, more than anything, willing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1363460712436540">Said, 2003 [1978]: 188</xref>). Feminist postcolonial scholars have further noted that the non-western woman is assumed to be, not only available, but also willing and promiscuous also in contemporary international and national discourse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1363460712436540">Arnfred, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1363460712436540">Oyewumi, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1363460712436540">Skilbrei, 2009</xref>). This understanding serves to legitimize her sexual availability, and her participation in the transnational marriage, however dubious, seems to pass as legally acceptable rather than strategic and pro forma.</p>
<p>Establishing the authenticity of transnational marriages between ethnic Norwegian women and non-western men without individual rights to a residence permit, would seem to be more problematic. In summary, our analyses indicate that traditional gendered notions about sexuality distribute both agency and potential shame differently between women and men. Non-western women’s assumed willingness to engage in strategic sex passes unnoticed in the evaluations of immigration authorities, and it does not appear as potentially shameful or embarrassing for ethnic Norwegian men to accept or make use of the opportunity for strategic sex. Marriages between ethnic Norwegian women and non-western men, however, especially if the woman is significantly older than the man, are referred to as ‘hormonal disturbances’ in police jargon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1363460712436540">Hagesæther, 2008</xref>: 34). It is assumed that the marriage is authentic on the part of the woman, that it is based on love and sexual attraction, but it is assumed to be pro forma and ‘trickery’ on the part of the non-western man. It also illustrates that these kinds of sexual relations are not understood in light of the same naturalized connections between sexuality, ethnicity, age and power as transnational marriages between Norwegian men and non-western women. This may be seen as the gendered flipside of Orientalist notions about sexual prowess in considerations regarding the authenticity of transnational marriages. The virility of the non-western man has also featured prominently in Orientalist discourse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1363460712436540">Said, 2003 [1978]</xref>: 311), but does not seem to align as seamlessly with Norwegian sexual norms or result in unproblematic marriage migration. Even if the sexual nature of the marriage is not in doubt, the agency granted the non-western man still makes him seem to be subverting the nation, rather than strengthening it.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec4-1363460712436540"><title>Essential sexual identity?</title>
<p>Research on reasons for and consequences of international migration has only to a limited degree focused on how sexuality in different ways can shape migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1363460712436540">Luibhéid, 2005</xref>: ix).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1363460712436540">8</xref></sup> This is also the case in Norwegian migration research. There are currently no systematic studies available of how applications for asylum grounded in persecution for homosexuality are considered in Norway. A close reading of the Directorate of Immigration’s latest praxis notes from 2008, and other documents available on the Directorate of Immigration website, give some hints about what kind of understandings of sexuality are at work in considerations of specific applications.</p>
<p>Asylum can usually be granted, according to UN guidelines, if the applicant risks persecution on the grounds of race, religion, nationality, political standpoint or membership in a particular social group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1363460712436540">Luibhéid, 2005</xref>: xvi). In the Directorate of Immigration’s documents, it is noted that ‘homosexuals’ from certain countries are considered ‘a social group in (UN) convention terms’ and that such persons thus have the right to asylum if they ‘risk reactions that can be characterized as persecution’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1363460712436540">Directorate of Immigration, 2010b</xref>). A key question in the Directorate of Immigration’s considerations, however, is whether the danger of persecution was already an issue when the applicants resided in their home countries, or whether it has appeared or increased after they came to Norway. The rule is that asylum should <italic>not</italic> be granted in cases where the danger of persecution has appeared or increased after the applicants’ arrival in Norway. Concerning ‘persecution on the grounds of homosexual inclination’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1363460712436540">9</xref></sup> however, the relevant guidelines state:<disp-quote>
<p>If the applicant is considered to be homosexual, and that he or she by <italic>taking the consequence of his/her inclination</italic> risks persecution in the terms of the Convention, the rule is that asylum should be given, in principle without regard to the applicant’s past in the country of origin before departure. (Ministry of Work and Inclusion, 2009: AI 2009-105. Our italics)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>This exception from the general rule implies a specific understanding of sexuality: the applicants’ homosexual ‘inclination’ is assumed to be inherent, and the applicants are considered to have been homosexual also in their home country even if they did not ‘take the consequence of their inclination’ before leaving. If the applicants can make a probable case that they are authentic homosexuals, they have the right to asylum in Norway, granted that homosexuals as a social group are subject to persecution in their home country. Homosexuality thus appears as a congenital trait that establishes an automatic affiliation with the international group ‘homosexuals’. Members of this group are considered to be at risk of potential persecution because of their affiliation with it. In other words, there is a demand for an inherent and essential sexual identity, which other studies have also indicated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1363460712436540">Cantú et al., 2005</xref>; Drud-Jensen and Knudsen, 2008; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1363460712436540">Luibhéid, 2005</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1363460712436540">Razack, 1998</xref>). Such an essentialist understanding of sexual orientation can explain the exception from the Directorate of Immigration’s general rules, allowing the granting of asylum without consideration of the applicants’ conduct in their country of origin.</p>
<p>In the Directorate of Immigration’s praxis notes for Eritrea from 2008, however, it is noted that whether the applicant ‘has practiced her/his sexual inclination before departure, how this has been done, and whether this has caused any problems for the applicant should also be taken into account. This is at odds with the general rule cited earlier, which states that the applicants should be granted asylum independent of their past conduct. This indicates that an applicant’s presumed inherent homosexuality is expected to be expressed in ways that are possible to document. It could further imply an understanding of homosexuality as life-determining for the applicant in ways that can only be ‘hidden’ with difficulty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1363460712436540">Foucault, 1999</xref>: 53). This essentialist understanding can also be used to question the authentic character of the applicant’s homosexuality: if the person has managed to remain closeted in the past, or has been able to ‘postpone’ his or her sexual practice, is he or she an authentic homosexual?</p>
<p>The authentic character of the applicant’s homosexuality is not the only matter considered in the evaluation process of an application for asylum based on persecution of homosexuality. As previously discussed, it is also important to consider whether homosexuals as a social group are subjected to persecution in the applicant’s country of origin. The Directorate of Immigration’s report on the situation for homosexuals in Iran, for instance, noted that ‘according to Iranian penal codes, it is the homosexual practice that is illegal, not the homosexual inclination as such’. The Directorate thus conditionally assumes that ‘a homosexual person can practice his or her sexual inclination if this happens within the socio-cultural limits of Iranian society’, and that ‘Iranian authorities will only press charges if the homosexual activity is evident in the public space’. Based on this, the Directorate concludes that ‘homosexuals are not in general subject to persecution in Iran’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1363460712436540">Directorate of Immigration, 2010c</xref>). The reasoning and choice of terms in the report on asylum practice for applicants from Afghanistan are noticeably similar:<disp-quote>
<p>Homosexuality is illegal in the statutory framework. … It has not been reported that any homosexuals have been convicted after the fall of the Taliban. It is difficult to say anything concrete about the situation for homosexuals, because nobody is openly gay. It is assumed that homosexuals will not have problems if they keep their inclination hidden, and do not transgress the socio cultural limits in society. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1363460712436540">Directorate of Immigration 2010a</xref>)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Homosexual applicants have to present a case that they belong to a specific social group and claim that they are subject to persecution precisely because of this affiliation. It seems, however, that the opportunity to belong to such a group is limited, as all Afghani homosexuals are presumed to be closeted. There is, so to speak, no social group to which they could belong. In Iran, on the other hand, the Directorate asserts that homosexuals are not subjected to persecution as long as they practice their sexual inclination within the socio-cultural limits in society. Homosexual asylum seekers from Iran can, in other words, claim to belong to the social group of homosexuals in Iran, but this will not necessarily help their case as persecution is not considered likely if they keep their practice out of ‘the public space’. The Directorate’s praxis notes and country reports thus establish a distinction between sexual inclination and sexual practice, implying that applicants can safely have a homosexual ‘inclination’ in their country of origin – and applications can thus be turned down – granted that the applicants are careful regarding how they <italic>practice</italic> their inclination.</p>
<p>Our review of the Directorate of Immigration’s documents on homosexuality and asylum in Norway reveals a tension between different understandings of sexuality. It is evident that homosexuals are granted the status of a social group with particular traits. Such an understanding has become common in several countries and is linked to a rhetoric of identity and civil rights that depicts homosexuals as a ‘quasi-ethnic’ group, perceived to have common (imagined) ‘traits’ similar to other ethnic groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1363460712436540">Seidman, 2005</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1363460712436540">Anderson, 1991</xref>). An applicant who can prove his or her membership in this group, based on authentic homosexuality, can in principle be granted asylum, depending on their country of origin. Conversely, the Directorate of Immigration recognizes a distinction between homosexual ‘inclination’ and homosexual practice that in a Norwegian context is associated with the oppression of homosexuals before the decriminalization of male homosexuality in 1972. Non-western asylum applicants from certain countries are required to establish a distinction which in the development narrative of Norwegian sexual politics belongs to a repressive past.</p>
<p>The placing of non-western asylum applicants outside the Norwegian present could indicate that an Oriental gaze is at work in immigration authorities’ consideration of their applications. In his article ‘Capitalism and gay identity’ (1983), John D’Emilio argues that homosexual identity, as defined by Foucault, developed as an option in modern capitalist societies due to the social changes prompted by capitalist production and wage labor. D’Emilio further argues that ‘there was quite simply no social space in the colonial system for production that allowed men and women to be gay’ (1983: 104). This understanding of homosexuality may serve to illuminate the considerations made by the Norwegian Directorate of Immigration in granting applications for asylum. It is worth asking whether, or to what degree, homosexual asylum applicants from societies that are considered to be premodern can be seen to have a homosexual identity in a modern sense? Can they be imagined as <italic>authentic</italic> homosexuals only with difficulty if they have fled countries that are assumed not to offer ‘social spaces’ that render homosexuality possible?</p>
<p>The Directorate of Immigration’s documents on asylum based on persecution for homosexuality are generally gender neutral. They may, however, have some gendered implications. This is particularly visible when applications for asylum depend on whether the applicant can be said to belong to a particular social group. It is reasonable to assume that women have less opportunity for sexual autonomy in those countries from which applicants seek asylum in Norway. This is particularly significant as membership in a social group is part of the grounds for determining rights to asylum. When, for instance, the Directorate of Immigration argues that homosexuals can practice their inclination within the socio-cultural limits of Iranian society, it is worth asking whether this is also the case for women. The Directorate of Immigration also notes that there seems to be sparse conditions for a homosexual – implicitly male – subculture in Afghanistan. Given their social standing in Afghanistan, it is safe to assume that it is even less likely that such a subculture would include women.</p>
<p>As previously discussed, the notions of homosexuality that seem to be at work in the Directorate of Immigration’s discussions are alternately that of a modern individual whose being is entirely homosexual, or that of a premodern sodomite who has sex with men, but is not ‘homosexual’ in a modern sense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1363460712436540">Foucault, 1999</xref>). Only the modern homosexual has the right to asylum in Norway. The sodomite, imagined as one who can distinguish between ‘inclination’ and ‘practice’, and who does not have an all-encompassing identity, does not have the right to asylum. The country report for Iran implies that homosexuals there are seen as premodern sodomites who consequently can have sex with men within the socio-cultural limits of society. This also has gendered implications: both the sodomite and the modern homosexual are figures with strong male connotations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1363460712436540">10</xref></sup></p></sec>
<sec id="sec5-1363460712436540"><title>Correct sexuality – affective integration?</title>
<p>In this article we have argued that notions about a late modern,western, strategic sexuality on the one hand, and a non-western, pre-modern, inherent, patriarchal sexuality on the other, come into play in Norwegian immigration policy, and that sexuality emerges as a focal point in state considerations of Norwegian citizenship. We have outlined how various regulatory regimes make use of different understandings of sexuality and how these understandings ‘stick’ to different ethnicities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1363460712436540">Ahmed, 2004</xref>: 60). Staging a sexual or gender performance that increases the chances of being granted asylum based on persecution for homosexuality, or depicting a non-sexual relationship as a marriage, is considered illegal exploitation of the system. Suspected pro forma marriages are met with an understanding of sexuality in which sex is seen as a natural part of marriage, a private activity conducted in the home, and an authentic and ‘pure’ activity which is not linked to any purpose other than strengthening the relationship and potential reproduction. It is also expected that the asylum applicant’s homosexuality is a genuine and ‘involuntary’ need: the homosexuality is inherent, determining for the applicant’s personality and cannot be hidden or chosen away (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1363460712436540">Foucault, 1999</xref>). At the same time, strategic sex to acquire increased intimacy in a relationship is considered acceptable and even encouraged as a means to achieve a good foundation for parenting in <italic>Living Together</italic>. Independence, freedom of choice and informed, strategic initiative, usually considered late modern ideals, seem to be grounds for suspecting the motivation for migration. Migration seems to be legitimate only when it is a result of necessity caused by the inherent emotional and sexual needs that signify the authentic homosexual and marriage migrant.</p>
<p>Our focus in this article has been on which understandings of sexuality come into play at the Norwegian border, not on the integration policy that meets those who are granted a residence permit. There are, however, good reasons for seeing the practices of inclusion and exclusion at the border in light of the <italic>potential</italic> for integration into Norwegian society that different subjects may have. Sara Ahmed has noted how ‘happy integration’ in a nation can be furthered by alignment with some common activities and ideals that are of great value to the nation state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1363460712436540">Ahmed, 2008</xref>). She suggests that ‘happiness is attributed to certain objects that circulate as social goods. When we feel pleasure from such objects, we are aligned; we are facing the right way. We become alienated – out of line with an affective community – when we do not experience pleasure from proximity to objects that are attributed as being good.’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1363460712436540">Ahmed, 2008</xref>: 126). <italic>Living Together</italic> can be understood in light of this: it includes all first-time parents regardless of ethnicity, sexual orientation, and ability. This is managed within a presumed common framework: parenting is based on self-chosen, romantic love, lasting sexual attraction and a common obligation to sustain the relationship over time. Couples are assimilated into a specific notion of the Norwegian couple and Norwegian sexuality, and the course can be said to produce gender-equal parenting as a valuable, integrating activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1363460712436540">Danielsen and Mühleisen, 2009a</xref>). It is crucial, however, that the migrant aligns affectively on terms that strengthen the nation. In the case of marriage migration, the relatively seamless integration of non-western female marriage migrants, compared with the suspicion directed toward male marriage migrants, is an example of this. While the migrating woman is expected to benefit her new husband and the nation, the male migrant is less likely to be seen as an amenable subject.</p>
<p>In the cases we have discussed, certain forms of ‘affect alignment’ with ‘Norwegian’ sexuality could possibly make the migrant eligible for a residence permit in Norway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1363460712436540">Ahmed, 2008</xref>). The requirement seems to be their alignment with the model for the Norwegian heteronormative couple through an authentic marriage, or alignment with homosexual identity through authentic homosexual inclination. Failure to align with Norwegian sexuality in this way does however result in a kind of ‘affect alienation’, to use Sara <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1363460712436540">Ahmed’s term (2008: 126)</xref>, which in turn could make migrants appear to be undeserving to immigration authorities. This may occur if their marriage or homosexuality is seen as pro forma or invalid by Norwegian standards. In the case of asylum seekers, it is particularly evident how racialized understandings of sexuality play into this process. The Iranian homosexual would seem to be cast as a sodomite, not an ‘authentic’ homosexual. We suspect that this is possible partly because of the continued significance of Orientalist notions in Norwegian immigration authorities’ assessment of Iran’s sexual norms. The country report leans both on the notion of ‘arrested development’, which is integral in rendering the Orient and its sexual subjects as inherently ‘different’ and supposedly premodern, as well as notions about the presumed ‘licentiousness’ of sex between men that emerges in Orientialist scholarship in tandem with the institutionalization of sex in 18th-century Europe (Massad, 2007: 9; Said, 2003 [1978]: 190). Writing on the discourse of ‘migrant homophobia’ in Germany, Jin Haritaworn argues that the affect alienation of migrants that nationalist discourses on gay-friendliness seem to produce serves to both ‘alienate migrants and homophobia’ (2010). This ‘dual function’ that Haritaworn points out is also at work in Norwegian immigration authorities’ consideration of homosexuals’ asylum applications. If applicants are not considered ‘homosexual’ in awestern sense, they can be rejected without jeopardizing Norway’s image of itself as a country that protects the civil rights of homosexuals.</p>
<p>The different understandings of sexuality of which Norwegian family and immigration policy makes use is situated in a geopolitical discursive landscape. Notions about ‘Norwegian sexuality’ will necessarily bring forth notions about ‘other sexualities’. In this way, understandings of sexualities play a part in national border constructions, both symbolic and concrete, through authorities’ considerations and refusal of applications for residence permits in Norway.</p></sec>
