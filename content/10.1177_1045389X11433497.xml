<abstract>
<p>Novel concepts for the magnetic circuit in magnetorheological dampers have been proven. In contrast to the established magnetic circuits where the magnetic field for the control of the magnetorheological fluid is generated by the coil of an electromagnet, hybrid magnetic circuits consisting of at least one permanent or hard magnet and an electromagnet are used in the new approaches. Three different technical configurations are distinguished: (1) The electromagnet is combined with two permanent magnets, whose magnetization cannot be modified even by strong magnetic fields of the electromagnet. The main advantage is the improved fail-safe behavior of the damper in case of a power failure. (2) The electromagnet is combined with a hard magnet, whose magnetization can be modified by the electromagnet. This configuration leads to high energy efficiency, because electric power is only required in short pulses for the switching of the hard magnet. (3) All three types of magnetic field sources, permanent, hard, and electromagnet, are combined in the magnetic circuit, which gives the highest flexibility of the magnetic field generation and the damping control at the expense of a relatively large effort. Demonstrators for magnetorheological dampers with all three magnetic circuits were constructed and their performances were tested. The results of the investigations are described in this paper.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Magnetorheological (MR) dampers are semi-active devices that exploit the outstanding capabilities of MR fluids to change their rheological properties in a magnetic field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1045389X11433497">Lange et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1045389X11433497">Mao et al., 2007</xref>). Various applications of MR dampers, such as automotive shock absorbers, vibration reducers for driver seats in trucks and buses as well as the mitigation of vibration excitation in cable-stayed bridges, have already been commercialized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1045389X11433497">Maslanka, 2007</xref>). In the past, much work has been devoted to the design of various types of dampers, to the development of suitable MR fluids, and to different control strategies. However, less attention has been paid to the magnetic circuit and the generation of the magnetic field.</p>
<p>In the MR dampers, which are state of the art, the magnetic field is generated by the electric current in a coil and guided by a ferromagnetic material to the MR fluid. The corresponding magnetic circuit includes the electromagnet, the flux-guiding material, and the gap, which is filled with the MR fluid. This configuration suffers from drawbacks in terms of fail-safe behavior and energy efficiency. The first problem is that in case of an electric power failure, the magnetic field is not maintained and the damping force drops to its lowest level. As a second drawback, electric power is permanently consumed, even for the maintenance of a constant magnetic field.</p>
<p>In this work, novel concepts of magnetic circuits are introduced, in which a basic magnetic field is generated by permanent or hard magnets and modified by the additional electromagnet. The magnetic circuits are called hybrid due to the superposition of different magnetic sources. Due to the crucial importance of the magnetic circuit in MR damping systems, some work has been performed on the design of conventional magnetic circuits containing electromagnets only (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1045389X11433497">Luo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1045389X11433497">Nam and Park, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1045389X11433497">Yang et al., 2010</xref>). However, very few work concerning hybrid magnetic circuits for MR dampers has been published till now (Wulff et al., 1997). This lack is surprising, because the combination of different magnetic sources offers a large benefit for novel concepts of MR dampers.</p>
<p>Three cases are distinguished that differ in the type of the permanent or hard magnet used in the magnetic circuit. The three concepts offer different solutions to the drawbacks identified. In all concepts, we start from the usual configuration of a conventional MR damper where the entire magnetic circuit is integrated in the piston of the damper. This allows a more compact damper design in comparison with other designs like an MR fluid flow through a bypass.</p>

<title>Electromagnet and permanent magnets</title>
<sec id="section3-1045389X11433497">
<title>Design of the magnetic circuit</title>
<p>The first hybrid magnetic circuit contains an electromagnet with a coil in the center of the piston (fine crossing lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1045389X11433497">Figure 1</xref>). In addition, two permanent magnets at the top and the bottom of the piston are introduced (dark disks in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1045389X11433497">Figure 1</xref>). These three sources of the magnetic field define three magnetic subcircuits, whose magnetic fluxes can superpose in the active zones of the annular MR fluid gap between the coil and the permanent magnets. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1045389X11433497">Figure 1</xref> also shows the three relevant working modes of the magnetic circuit. In the left scheme, the coil is not activated and the magnetic field is generated merely by the permanent magnets. The mid scheme in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1045389X11433497">Figure 1</xref> depicts a strengthening of the magnetic field of the permanent magnets by the electromagnet. Finally, in the right scheme, the coil current is reversed, which leads to a weakening of the magnetic fields of the permanent magnets and the electromagnet.</p>
<fig id="fig1-1045389X11433497" position="float">
<label>Figure 1.</label>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1045389X11433497-fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>The components in the hybrid magnetic circuit were designed such that the magnetic field of the permanent magnets can nearly be canceled by the electromagnet. Furthermore, a very high magnetic flux density of 830 mT in the active MR fluid gap can be achieved in case of the strengthening of the magnetic fields. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1045389X11433497">Figure 2</xref> shows the results of the simulation of the magnetic flux density for the three working modes described. The magnetic flux density was calculated along the line of the MR fluid gap between the two permanent magnets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1045389X11433497">Figure 2</xref>, left). The length of this line is 125 mm, which is caused by the length of the coil.</p>

</fig>
<p>Another result of the simulation is the flux density of 420 mT in the powerless working mode, in which no current is applied to the coil. This flux density determines the damping force in case of a power failure. Finally, in case of weakening of the magnetic field by the two magnetic sources, the magnetic flux density in the active MR gap is less than 100 mT.</p>

<sec id="section4-1045389X11433497">
<title>Demonstrator</title>
<p>A demonstrator of the MR damper was designed and constructed in order to evaluate the benefit of the hybrid magnetic circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1045389X11433497">Ehrlich and Böse, 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1045389X11433497">Figure 3</xref> shows the piston and the complete damper, which contains a gas cushion in order to balance the volume change due to the motion of the piston rod.</p>

</fig>
<p>The MR damper was filled with an MR fluid having an iron particle concentration of 36 vol.%. The iron particle concentration determines the achievable shear stress and the corresponding damping force at a given magnetic flux density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1045389X11433497">Böse and Ehrlich, 2009</xref>). The demonstrator was mounted in a mechanical testing machine, and the performance was investigated.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1045389X11433497">Figure 4</xref> shows the measured damping force versus the displacement of the damper piston at a frequency of 1 Hz and different currents in the coil. As already indicated in the magnetic flux simulation, the damping force without any coil current is in a medium range of about ±1.5 kN. This figure gives the damping force in case of an electric power failure and demonstrates the high fail-safe stability of the MR damper.</p>

</fig>
<p>If a positive current of +3 A is applied to the coil strengthening the magnetic field of the permanent magnets, the corresponding damping force is increased to nearly ±4 kN. However, if the coil current is reversed to −3 A, the damping force is lowered to ca. ±0.5 kN (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1045389X11433497">Figure 4</xref>). These results confirm the intended behavior of the damper and show the wide spread of the achievable damping force.</p>
<p>The damping force received in the three different working modes of the MR damper (+3, 0, and −3 A) was also calculated using a simple theoretical model. For this purpose, the damping force was assumed to be the sum of the MR yield stress depending on the magnetic flux density and the viscous force of the MR fluid, which depends on the piston velocity. This approach corresponds to the Bingham model, which is the simplest model for the description of the MR fluid behavior in the magnetic field. In this model, the damping force is the sum of the MR force in terms of the field-dependent yield stress of the MR fluid and the hydraulic force of the nonactivated MR fluid. However, in contrast to the Bingham model, the hydraulic force in this model is calculated with the use of a nonlinear approach, considering also turbulence of the MR fluid flow. The required data of the magnetic field dependent yield stress and the base viscosity of the MR fluid in the absence of the magnetic field were received from rheological measurements. The calculations were conducted for various velocities of the damper piston.</p>
<p>The results of the calculations were compared with the experimental data, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1045389X11433497">Figure 5</xref>. In the working mode in which the electromagnet strengthens the field of the permanent magnets (+3 A), the agreement between calculated and measured data is excellent. In the mode without electromagnet (0 A) and that of field cancelation (−3 A), the measured damping forces exceed the calculated values. This deviation can be referred to disturbing effects like friction of seals.</p>

</fig>
<p>Direct measurements of the mechanical response time of the damper after switching the magnetic field strength have not been performed. However, the increase of the coil current upon a stepwise rise of the voltage was investigated. The time constant of the current increase which is determined by the inductance of the whole magnetic circuit should be an adequate criterion for the mechanical response time of the damper. This time constant, representing the time for an increase of the current by 63% of the final value, was experimentally determined to be ca. 60 ms.</p>

<title>Design of the magnetic circuit</title>
<p>The purpose of this second type of hybrid magnetic circuit is also to generate a magnetic field in the active MR fluid gap without any supply of electric energy, by using a hard magnet, as for the damper type discussed earlier. However, here the magnetization of the hard magnet can be changed by the electromagnet. The benefit of this configuration is that different magnetic flux densities and corresponding damping forces can be maintained without permanent electric energy consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1045389X11433497">Ehrlich et al., 2010</xref>). Electric energy supply is required only for the switching of the magnetization of the hard magnet. As the most suitable material for the hard magnet, an AlNiCo alloy was selected, because it combines high saturation magnetization with low coercive field strength.</p>
<p>The task to switch the magnetization of the hard magnet requires another design of the magnetic circuit system than in the first damper type. In this type, the hard magnet is located in the same circuit as the coil. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1045389X11433497">Figure 6</xref> (left) depicts the scheme of the magnetic circuit and the flux lines generated by the two magnetic field sources. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1045389X11433497">Figure 6</xref> (right) shows also the simulated magnetic flux density along the line of the MR fluid gap over a distance of nearly 40 mm, which is the length of the damper piston in this configuration.</p>

<p>The maximum achievable magnetic flux density in the active MR fluid gap was calculated as ca. 0.6 T (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1045389X11433497">Figure 6</xref>, right). However, the flux density can be continuously lowered down to zero by a lower magnetization or even a complete demagnetization of the AlNiCo magnet.</p>

<sec id="section8-1045389X11433497">
<title>Demonstrator</title>
<p>A demonstrator for an MR damper with a piston containing a magnetic circuit with the configuration shown earlier was constructed and tested. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1045389X11433497">Figure 7</xref> shows the damper piston as well as the complete damper. Due to the compact design with a single magnetic circuit, the piston is considerably shorter than that of the damper with two permanent magnets.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The tests of this damper were performed with a self-designed mechanical test setup, where the motion is generated by a servo motor with a linear gear transmission. In this investigation, the magnetization of the AlNiCo magnet was varied by short pulses of the coil current up to 5 A.</p>
<p>The results of the measurements in the mechanical test setup are depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1045389X11433497">Figure 8</xref>. Upon rising current in the coil, the magnetization of the AlNiCo magnet and the corresponding damping force are enhanced. The nonsymmetric damping force is caused by the air cushion of the damper.</p>

</fig>
<p>The influence of the coil current on the magnetic flux density in the gap of the MR fluid is demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1045389X11433497">Figure 9</xref>. In order to compare experimental results with those of simulation, all data were determined for an empty gap without MR fluid. The experimental data were measured using a Hall probe. The experiment starts with a fully magnetized AlNiCo magnet causing a magnetic flux density of ca. +250 mT without any coil current (0 A). The result of the simulation is represented by the horizontal dash-dotted line at 290 mT and is close to the experimental value. When the current with negative sign is stepwise increased, the measured magnetic flux density decreases, following the curve with the arrows. At 2.8 A, the AlNiCo magnet is fully demagnetized, which gives rise to a flux density of zero. A further increase of the coil current leads to a reversed magnetization of the AlNiCo magnet and a negative flux density up to −230 mT. In the following, the sign of the coil current is reversed. Increasing the positive coil current from 0 to 7 A, the magnetic flux density increases from −230 to +230 mT on the rising dashed line. Again, at 2.8 A, the magnetization and the flux density change their algebraic sign.</p>

</fig>
<p>Just as for the damper with electromagnet and permanent magnets, the damping forces were also calculated for the damper configuration with electromagnet and switchable hard magnet using the Bingham-like model. The calculations were conducted in the demagnetized state of the AlNiCo magnet as well as in the fully magnetized state at various velocities of the damper piston. The results of the calculations in comparison with experimental data are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1045389X11433497">Figure 10</xref>. The experimental damping forces are above the calculated ones, which probably is due to the neglect of the seal friction and other effects in the calculations.</p>

</fig>
<p>Moreover, the rise of the coil current after a stepwise increase of the voltage was investigated. The time constant derived from the current increase was determined to be ca. 10 ms. The faster response in comparison with the damper with the combination of electromagnet and permanent magnets is due to the lower inductance of the magnetic circuit with the AlNiCo magnet.</p>

<p>As in the first configuration, the magnetic circuit consists of three subcircuits, where the mid subcircuit contains the coil and the AlNiCo magnet and the permanent magnets are located in the bottom and top subcircuits. The magnetic flux density was calculated along the line of the MR fluid gap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1045389X11433497">Figure 11</xref>, left). Three operation states are distinguished in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1045389X11433497">Figure 11</xref>, right. If the magnetic fields of the permanent magnets and the switchable hard magnet nearly cancel each other, the flux density in the active MR fluid gap is about 60 mT. The reverse polarization of the AlNiCo magnet causes a strengthening of the fields and leads to a flux density of ca. 570 mT. These operation states and all intermediate states can be held without permanent supply of electric energy. Furthermore, the largest flux density achieved this way can even be increased by the additional field of the electromagnet to nearly 630 mT.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The investigations of the MR damper with the three magnetic sources were performed on the same self-designed experimental test setup as those with the MR damper with just the electromagnet and AlNiCo magnet. Measurements were conducted for different magnetizations of the AlNiCo magnet without an additional permanent coil current.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-1045389X11433497">Figure 13</xref> reveals the results of the force measurements. The inner curve named cancelation shows the state, in which the magnetic fields of the permanent magnets and the switchable hard magnet nearly cancel each other, which causes the lowest damping force. In the following, the magnetization of the AlNiCo magnet was changed stepwise by rising short pulses of the coil current. This leads to stepwise increased flux densities and corresponding damping forces. At a short pulse of 2.5 A, a maximum damping force of 3.3 kN was achieved.</p>

<p>The investigations were performed with an MR fluid that contains only 25 vol.% iron particles. Higher damping forces in the same MR damper can be generated with an MR fluid with a higher concentration of iron particles.</p>
<p>The calculated damping forces in dependence on the piston velocity are depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-1045389X11433497">Figure 14</xref>. The calculations describe the operation states of cancelation and strengthening of the magnetic fields of the different magnetic sources. Like for the other dampers, the calculated forces were compared with experimental data. The measured damping forces are higher than the calculated data, which again is attributed to disturbing effects such as seal friction in the damper.</p>

<p>For the time constant of the current rise after a stepwise increment of the voltage applied to the coil, a value of ca. 20 ms was experimentally determined. This result shows that the inductance of the magnetic circuit with permanent and hard magnets is higher than that of the magnetic circuit with the AlNiCo magnet only, which had a time constant of 10 ms.</p>
<p>The temporal change of the damping force upon switching the hard magnet is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-1045389X11433497">Figure 15</xref>. The pulse length of the current generated in the coil is only 70 ms, which is sufficient to magnetize or demagnetize the AlNiCo magnet. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-1045389X11433497">Figure 15</xref> (left) reveals the instantaneous increase of the damping force from 0.4 to 2.5 kN at 6 s and the corresponding decrease at 12 s, the mechanical excitation frequency being 1 Hz. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-1045389X11433497">Figure 15</xref> (right), the reversed course at an excitation frequency of 0.5 Hz is shown. First, at 6 s, the damping force is diminished from 2 to 0.4 kN and rises back to 2 kN at 12 s.</p>

<p>The required power for the switching of the hard magnet amounts to about 10 W. In combination with the pulse length of 70 ms, the required energy for the change of the magnetization and the corresponding alteration of the damping force is limited to less than 1 J. If the damping force has not to be changed frequently, the required average power is very low. To give an example, in order to change the damping force once per minute, a medium power of ca. 20 mW is needed. This behavior renders this damper extremely energy efficient.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Three different types of new MR dampers with hybrid magnetic circuit systems containing an electromagnet and additional permanent or hard magnets were introduced. These approaches result in a high variability of the damping force and offer far-reaching perspectives for MR dampers with improved fail-safe behavior and increased energy efficiency as well.</p>
<p>The configuration of the MR damper with an electromagnet and permanent magnets gives an improved fail-safe stability, because the permanent magnets generate a medium damping force in case of an electric power failure. This feature is important for shock absorbers, which operate in a stable state even without electric power, but are additionally capable of generating also softer damping for the sake of comfort.</p>
<p>The second MR damper configuration with an electromagnet and a switchable hard AlNiCo magnet has the advantage of increased energy efficiency since the magnetization of the AlNiCo magnet can be changed by short pulses of the coil current. For the switching process, an electric energy of less than 1 J is required. This type of MR damper is especially efficient for applications in which the damping force is not continuously changed. An example is a vehicle that transports very different loads, where the damping force can be adapted after loading or unloading.</p>
<p>Finally, the MR damper configuration with an electromagnet, permanent magnets, and a switchable hard AlNiCo magnet merges the benefits of the former configurations at the expense of an increased effort. All three types of new MR dampers with hybrid magnetic circuit systems have a high potential for various applications in the automotive industry and in mechanical engineering.</p>
