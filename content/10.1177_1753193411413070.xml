<abstract>
<p>We compared the radiological and functional outcomes in patients with radial longitudinal deficiency treated surgically with those managed nonoperatively and correlated the ease of performance of activities with radiological and functional parameters in the two groups. A retrospective analysis was done in 446 type 3 and 4 hands (modified Bayne classification) over 20 years comparing the subjective assessment, objective and functional scores in nonoperatively managed hands (Group 1; <italic>n</italic> = 137) to hands managed with centralization or radialization (Group 2; <italic>n</italic> = 309). The subjective, objective and functional measures were significantly better in Group 2. Improved alignment, finger and wrist range of motion and grip strength were related to improvement in functional score. Surgical treatment of radial longitudinal deficiency provides improvement in cosmesis, function and ease of performance of activities when compared with nonoperatively managed hands.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Radial longitudinal deficiency is characterized by a varying degree of deficiency of the radius, carpal bones and thumb, typically producing radial deviation, flexion and pronation of the hand with forearm shortening. The reported incidence varies from 1:30 000 to 1:100 000 live births with around 50% of patients having bilateral radial deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1753193411413070">Geck et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1753193411413070">Lourie and Lins, 1998</xref>: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1753193411413070">Urban and Osterman, 1990</xref>). Children with bilateral and severe forms have significant functional limitations due to wrist instability, shortness and malalignment of the limb and associated thumb dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1753193411413070">Lourie and Lins, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1753193411413070">Urban and Osterman, 1990</xref>). Treatment for radial dysplasia is still evolving. The aims are to bring the hand in alignment with the forearm, improve the function of the long flexor tendons, gain functional length by correcting the wrist deformity, provide wrist-like mobility, preserve ulnar growth and attain acceptable cosmetic correction with or without forearm lengthening and pollicization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193411413070">Bayne and Klug, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193411413070">Bora et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753193411413070">Buck-Gramcko, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1753193411413070">Damore et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1753193411413070">Goldberg and Meyne, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1753193411413070">Goldfarb et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1753193411413070">Hulsbergen-Kruger et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1753193411413070">Maschke et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1753193411413070">Peterson et al., 2007</xref>). Surgical treatment is considered to be an appropriate intervention, especially for types 3 and 4 (modified Bayne classification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1753193411413070">James and Bedmer, 2005</xref>]) and possibly type 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1753193411413070">Damore et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1753193411413070">James and Bedmer, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1753193411413070">Manske et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1753193411413070">Maschke et al., 2007</xref>).

Preoperative soft tissue stretching is recommended by many (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1753193411413070">James and Bedmer, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1753193411413070">Kessler, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1753193411413070">Nanchahal and Tonkin, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1753193411413070">Peterson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1753193411413070">Smith and Greene, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1753193411413070">Vilkki, 1998</xref>). Pollicization is often required to improve function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1753193411413070">Geck et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1753193411413070">James and Bedmer, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1753193411413070">Kozin et al., 1992</xref>). The postoperative functional improvement is a matter of debate, with some investigators finding no significant functional gain after surgery; others have found good results with nonoperative management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193411413070">Banskota et al., 2005</xref>). Loss of adaptive function, especially in comparatively older patients when surgery has been done for cosmetic gain, has been put forward as a reason for nonoperative management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193411413070">Banskota et al., 2005</xref>). Others support surgical management for improving function, especially in severe and bilateral forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193411413070">Bora et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1753193411413070">Damore et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1753193411413070">James and Bedmer, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1753193411413070">Kozin et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1753193411413070">Maschke et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1753193411413070">Tsuge and Watari, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1753193411413070">Urban and Osterman, 1990</xref>). If surgery is chosen, preoperative counselling and educating parents about the possible outcomes requires information that should be obtained by comparison of surgically treated patients with a nonoperatively managed group. There have been few such direct comparisons. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193411413070">Bora et al. (1981)</xref> compared the outcome in surgically treated patients with respect to those managed nonoperatively, but the numbers of patients were few. With the current availability and use of reconstructive methods it is often difficult to find a reasonable number of patients managed nonoperatively for comparison (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1753193411413070">Geck et al., 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>In this retrospective study we compared patients with types 3 and 4 radial longitudinal deficiency managed with surgical treatment (Group 2) with those managed nonoperatively (Group 1). The null hypothesis was that there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups with respect to radiological and functional outcomes, both subjective and objective. We also looked at the correlation of radiological parameters and hand function to the ease of carrying out activities.</p>

<title>Patients and methods</title>
<p>The medical records of all patients with radial longitudinal deficiency treated between January 1985 and December 2004 were reviewed. The study group was made up of all patients with types 3 and 4 radial longitudinal deficiency (modified Bayne classification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1753193411413070">James et al., 1999</xref>]) treated over the period. The following inclusion and exclusion criteria were used.</p>

</list>
<p>The study received approval from the institutional review board. Out of 486 patients (with types 3 and 4 radial longitudinal deficiency) 342 patients could be identified using the criteria. Of the 144 patients lost or excluded from evaluation 67 could not be traced, 39 had died, 15 refused to come for follow-up visits, records were incomplete for 12 patients, and 11 patients were managed with methods other than radialization or centralization due to an older age at presentation. One hundred and three patients (<italic>n</italic> = 137 hands) were managed nonoperatively (Group 1) due to either unwillingness for surgical treatment (<italic>n</italic> = 55), severe associated abnormalities precluding surgery (<italic>n</italic> = 49), uncorrectable elbow contractures in extension (<italic>n</italic> = 28), age more than 2 years and development of adaptive function (<italic>n</italic> = 5). Two hundred and thirty-nine patients (<italic>n</italic> = 309 hands) were managed with operative treatment (Group 2). There was no patient who was classifiable into both groups.</p>
<p>Patients in Group 1 were managed by passive stretching of radial tissues using serial casts applied every week as soon as possible until the carpus could be passively aligned with the ulna (<italic>n</italic> = 31), followed by application of a thermoplastic brace and functional adaptive training. Hands that could not be aligned with the long axis of the ulna (no progress after six serial cast applications and/or age more than 2 years, <italic>n</italic> = 106) were managed with the application of a brace in the maximal corrective position and functional adaptive training. All hands in Group 2 were initially managed with stretching of radial soft tissues using manipulation and weekly corrective below-elbow casts. Stretching was continued until the hand could be passively placed in line with the forearm and the child was at least 11 months old (<italic>n</italic> = 214). Older patients (&gt;11 months, <italic>n</italic> = 95) presenting for the first time were also treated initially with application of serial casts to stretch radial structures. However strict guidelines for the number of casts or magnitude of correction were not laid down and the patient was given surgical treatment (age ≤2 years for all patients) when it was thought appropriate by the senior surgeon (P.P.K.), balancing the risk of losing any functional adaptation that might have developed against the benefit of improved alignment and possible functional gain. The elbow contracture was corrected by manipulation in all patients before surgery. Typically the older the patient the fewer the casts used. No patient who was more than 2 years of age at presentation was managed with centralization or radialization.</p>
<p>Surgical treatment was done by centralization (<italic>n</italic> = 202) or radialization (<italic>n</italic> = 107) by a single surgeon (P.P.K.). Centralization was done as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1753193411413070">Manske et al. (1981)</xref> using a transverse ulnar incision and removal of an ellipse of skin. Ulnar capsulotomy was done and subsequently repaired by ulnar capsulorrhaphy. A carpal notch was made in all cases as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193411413070">Bora et al. (1981)</xref>. The distal ulnar physis was preserved in all cases as recommended by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1753193411413070">Skerik and Flatt (1969)</xref>. Carpal resection (33 hands) was done in cases if acceptable reduction (in neutral to slight ulnar deviation) of the carpus was not achieved. A 1.6 mm K-wire was passed across the carpus into the long-finger metacarpal and then in retrograde fashion to the centralized ulna, transfixing any ulnar osteotomy (<italic>n</italic> = 91) (which was done if the preoperative ulnar bow was &gt;30°). After 1987 an extensor carpi ulnaris tendon advancement was added to the centralization as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193411413070">Bayne and Klug (1987)</xref> to counter the tendency towards a radial and flexor deformity; however, the rest of the procedure remained the same. Radialization was carried out according to the description of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753193411413070">Buck-Gramcko (1985)</xref>; this preserves the carpus and in addition includes transfer of the radial wrist motors (flexor carpi radialis and extensor carpi radialis tendons) to the ulnar side. The K-wire fixation was done through the index finger metacarpal. K-wires were retained in all patients for minimum of 8 weeks (range 8–12 weeks). Patients were given a thermoplastic maintenance brace for 1 year that was worn throughout day and night (self-reported) and removed only for cleaning purposes. For the subsequent 1–2 years patients were asked to wear the brace during day for functional activities like writing and play. Parents of the patients were made aware of the importance of bracing during counselling for surgery and were asked to follow the schedule strictly and report any inconsistencies.</p>
<p>The patient characteristics in the two groups are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1753193411413070">Table 1</xref>. Index finger pollicization (only in Group 2) was done in 87 hands (58 centralization and 29 radialization) as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753193411413070">Buck-Gramcko (1971)</xref>. The mean follow-up was 10.1 years (range, 5–18.5 years) in Group 1 and 11.1 years (5.5–19.2 years) in Group 2. For study purpose treatment failure in Group 2 only was defined as patients requiring revision surgery (ulnar osteotomy for ulnar bow ≥30° or repeat centralization or radialization) for unacceptable recurrent deformity (typically a hand forearm angle. &gt;35°and/or &gt;15° anterior subluxation) as judged by the senior surgeon and agreed by the patient. However, a similar end-point could not be identified for Group 1. The patients in Group 2 were also studied for the number of procedures per hand, complications and revisions, to assess and compare the centralization and radialization subgroups. The two-sample Kolmogorov test demonstrated normally distributed data in the two groups with respect to testing variables; however, for Group 1 there was higher frequency of older patients at presentation.</p>

<title>Subjective assessment</title>
<p>For pain and aesthetic appearance of limb(s) assessment was done using a 100-point (100 mm calibrated scale) visual analogue scale (VAS) separately for each. The VAS scoring was reported by patients if older than 15 years or parents and patients if the child was younger than this and recorded by a single person (A.S.) who was not blinded to the patient population. When the parents and children both recorded a score, the higher score (i.e. the worse of the two) was recorded. A score of 20 or more was taken as a painful or cosmetically unacceptable deformity. For bilateral cases separate recording was done.</p>

<title>Objective assessment</title>
<p>Using a hand-held goniometer the resting wrist angle and total flexion–extension wrist arc of motion were noted. To maintain uniformity of data and comparability (in patients with and without thumbs) total active motion of digits was determined from the sum total of the motion at the metacarpophalangeal, proximal and distal interphalangeal joints of the long finger (i.e. the finger that would be the middle finger in the normal hand). Grip strength assessment was done using a Jamar dynamometer (Asimov Engineering, Los Angeles, CA, USA) with the shoulder adducted and in neutral rotation and the elbow flexed to 90°. The mean of three maximal values was taken and expressed as a percentage of published normative values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1753193411413070">Mathiowetz et al., 1986</xref>) matched for age, gender and hand dominance for both groups. Pinch strength measurement was not done as the population was heterogeneous, some having a hypoplastic thumb, others no thumb (those who refused pollicization) and others having a reconstructed thumb.</p>

<sec id="section5-1753193411413070">
<title>Radiographic assessment</title>
<p>The hand–forearm angle was measured as the angle between the axis of the long finger metacarpal and a perpendicular dropped from the midpoint of the distal ulnar physis as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1753193411413070">Manske et al. (1981)</xref>. The hand–forearm position was calculated as the shortest distance between the midpoint of the distal ulnar physis and ulnar proximal pole of small finger metacarpal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1753193411413070">Manske et al., 1981</xref>). The ulnar bow was calculated as the angle formed between the perpendiculars dropped from the midpoint of the distal ulnar physis and a similar line drawn from the proximal ulna. The measurements were recorded preoperatively in the resting position (without any brace or cast), immediately postoperatively and at the last follow-up for Group 2. For patients in Group 1 the measurements were made on the last follow-up radiographs done with or without brace, depending on whether the patient wore a brace regularly. This was done to specifically correlate and compare the effect of radiographic measurements on outcome scores in the functional position.</p>

<title>Functional assessment</title>
<p>The prosthetic upper extremity functional index (PUFI) questionnaire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1753193411413070">Wright et al., 2003</xref>) was developed for children with transverse limb deficiencies and evaluates the ease of performing activities. It conforms to the World Health Organization’s model for measurement of disability and outcomes of the rehabilitation process on function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1753193411413070">Jutai et al., 1996</xref>). The validity and reliability of the instrument has been studied in longitudinal radial deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1753193411413070">Buffart et al., 2008</xref>) and it was used to compare the functional outcome in the two groups. The ease of carrying out activities was scored on a five-point ordinal scale ranging from ‘no difficulty’ to ‘cannot do’ as proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1753193411413070">Buffart et al. (2008)</xref>. The PUFI includes 26 upper-extremity bimanual activities for the young-child version (ages 3 to 6 years), and the older-child version “≥ 7 years” (7 years or older) includes 38 bimanual activities. Scaled sum scores ranging from 0 to 100 points are calculated for both versions. Higher scores correspond to less difficulty with performance. The parents filled out the PUFI questionnaire but patients 8 years or older also completed the PUFI by themselves. The assessment and evaluation for the functional score was done by a single person (A.S.) who was not a part of the operative or patient management team.</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Mean, percentages and standard deviations were calculated for variables and expressed as mean (SD). The Kolmogorov–Smirnov test was used to determine the normality of distribution and for comparison of non-parametric data. Analysis of variance for radiographic measures (hand–forearm angle and position; preoperative, postoperative and at last follow-up) was done to find if there was a difference between groups, controlling for type I error using Bonferroni’s <italic>t</italic>-procedure. Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test was used for comparison of continuous variables. Pearson’s coefficient (<italic>r</italic>) was used to detect correlations between continuous variables.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Surgical treatment for radial longitudinal deficiency has been based on the finding that over time an uncorrected deformity leads to loss of prehensile function in the hand, which develops into a terminal device used mainly to trap objects between the arm and forearm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193411413070">Bora et al., 1981</xref>). Centralization of the wrist on the forearm has been the standard procedure to restore the balance of the wrist and augment function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193411413070">Bora et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1753193411413070">Geck et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1753193411413070">Goldberg and Meyne, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1753193411413070">James and Bedmer, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1753193411413070">Lamb, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1753193411413070">Lourie and Lins, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1753193411413070">Manske et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1753193411413070">Urban and Osterman, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1753193411413070">Watson et al., 1984</xref>). Radialization additionally protects the growth potential of the ulna and maximizes wrist function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753193411413070">Buck-Gramcko, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1753193411413070">Geck et al., 1999</xref>). The major problem has been the frequent recurrence of radial deviation over the long term, erasing the functional gain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1753193411413070">Damore et al., 2000</xref>), while remarkable functional adaptation has been found with growth in untreated patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193411413070">Banskota et al., 2005</xref>). A comparison of the outcomes of surgical and nonoperative approaches is required to enable parents to be advised properly and to improve practice.</p>
<p>Our study has some limitations. The study was a retrospective appraisal of the hospital records and may have selection bias, as patients were selected in non-random fashion, and this may have influenced the outcome measures that we used; however, the groups were comparable with respect to most of the confounding variables (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1753193411413070">Table 1</xref>). The experience of a surgeon changes with time and refinements in technique have been introduced. There was a high attrition rate of around 20%, which could influence the result and reduce the validity of the outcome. However, such a high loss of patients for follow-up is expected due to the migrating population, the long span of the study and because it was done in a tertiary care referral centre to which patients are referred from far off places. Not all patients in our study agreed to pollicization, which has been reported to improve function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1753193411413070">Geck et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1753193411413070">James and Bedmer, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1753193411413070">Kozin et al., 1992</xref>). There was considerable difficulty in measuring the grip strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1753193411413070">Mathiowetz et al., 1986</xref>) particularly for untreated patients and the values may not be representative despite the cautious protocol followed. The functional scoring system we used was developed for assessment of children with transverse absences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1753193411413070">Wright et al., 2003</xref>) and may not be ideal in radial longitudinal deficiency. However, the PUFI has been specifically validated for use in this condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1753193411413070">Buffart et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The chosen null hypothesis – that there is no statistically significant difference in outcome for patients managed surgically and those who did not undergo surgery – is not supported by the results. Although both groups were subjectively pain free and rated the limbs cosmetically poor, the untreated group was more dissatisfied with the appearance of the limb. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1753193411413070">Goldberg and Meyne (1976)</xref> also found that cosmetic acceptance of the surgically corrected limb was poor. We concur that improved cosmesis associated with surgery is given importance by patients and parents. Surgical treatment is associated with significantly improved hand–forearm angles and hand–forearm positions when compared with nonoperative treatment and has a strong inverse linear relation with PUFI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753193411413070">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1753193411413070">Table 2</xref>) supporting the generally accepted view that improving the alignment of the limb and balancing the wrist on the forearm improves function. However <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1753193411413070">Goldberg and Meyne (1976)</xref> did not find a correlation between function and improved hand–forearm angles. This may be partly attributed to the use of a different measure to judge the functional status of the hand (the Jebsen–Taylor test) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1753193411413070">Taylor et al., 1973</xref>). Improved alignment may also secondarily improve finger and wrist function and that may be more directly linked to improved function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1753193411413070">Buffart et al., 2008</xref>). The correlation between hand–forearm angle and position to the PUFI score in the nonoperatively managed group was less strong (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753193411413070">Figure 1</xref>) probably due to differential functional adaptation for varying severities of involvement. There was a strong positive correlation and linear pattern of improved function with the long finger ROM for both surgically treated patients and nonoperatively managed patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753193411413070">Figure 2</xref>). Similar findings were reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1753193411413070">Buffart et al. (2008)</xref> and it was suggested that improving mobility could have a positive effect on performing functional activities. However <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1753193411413070">Goldfarb et al. (2002)</xref> did not find such correlation although they agreed that the function of the hand primarily depends on motion and strength in the digits and the presence and quality of the thumb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193411413070">Bora et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1753193411413070">Goldberg and Meyne, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1753193411413070">Lamb, 1977</xref>).</p>
<p>The PUFI scores showed moderate correlation with the wrist ROM for both groups (especially Group 1). Scatter plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1753193411413070">Figure 3</xref>) demonstrate that patients in Group 2 showed a good early increase in PUFI scores with slight improvement in wrist ROM possibly due to stabilized wrists (with lower overall wrist ROM), an effect seen in wrists arthrodesed for unstable/painful conditions. Patients in Group 1 showed significant and rapid improvement in PUFI scores with good wrist ROM. This may be due to the fact that such patients have milder involvement and preserved function of the forearm. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193411413070">Bora et al. (1981)</xref> found that when limbs that were not treated by centralization were arthrodesed for recurrent wrist instability they achieved comparable function to centralized limbs with wrist movements; suggesting that good wrist ROM is not essential for improved function. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1753193411413070">Buffart et al. (2008)</xref> however found a linear correlation between wrist ROM and PUFI. The discrepancy with our findings could be accounted for partly by the fewer patients in their study and the possibility of missing a nonlinear relationship.</p>
<p>Grip strength was positively correlated with PUFI in both groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1753193411413070">Figure 4</xref>). Scatter plots suggested that PUFI improved quickly with slight increases in grip strength for Group 1 whereas the relationship was linear for Group 2. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1753193411413070">Buffart et al. (2008)</xref> also pointed out a possible logarithmic distribution, suggesting that high levels of grip strength may not be a prerequisite for good hand function. Other authors suggest that grip strength is important for satisfactory use of the hand after surgery for radial deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193411413070">Bora et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1753193411413070">Goldberg and Meyne, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1753193411413070">Goldfarb et al., 2002</xref>). Measuring grip strength is difficult in these patients and is affected by various factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1753193411413070">Mathiowetz et al., 1986</xref>). The linear relationship in surgically treated patients could be due to improved finger ROM and alignment. Patients managed nonoperatively rely more on an arm and/or forearm to body grasp (functional adaptation), with the hand serving as a terminal device to trap any object. Minimal power in the hand may be sufficient to trap objects while any improved grip strength may not be used due to functional adaptation, as also found by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1753193411413070">Buffart et al.

We found a mean 16° loss of correction with hand–forearm angle &gt;35° in 47 hands (15%) of which 31 hands (10%) required further surgery. This lower incidence could be possibly due to the delayed removal of the K-wire (8–12 weeks after surgery) and prolonged usage of a splint in the postoperative period preventing early loss of correction to some extent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1753193411413070">Damore et al., 2000</xref>). Also the meticulous preoperative stretching of radial structures possibly leads to less surgical dissection being required for carpal centralization and hence less reactive fibrosis. Importantly it was observed that despite good centralization of the carpus any late radial bow of the ulna produced a radially bowed limb that was cosmetically unacceptable, especially to the parents. Hence sequential ulnar osteotomy is an important part of cosmetic correction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1753193411413070">Damore et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1753193411413070">Geck et al., 1999</xref>). The need for later ulnar osteotomy in 48 hands (22%) could be related to the fact that radial tethering structures, though adequately released during surgery, heal with fibrosis which acts as a static tether over years of growth producing a radial bow of the ulna. Tendon transfers may not be adequately protective as the muscles are often non-functional and act more like static supports rather than by dynamically stabilizing the hand. We feel that recurrence of deformity over time after initial surgical treatment is a major complication. Nevertheless, surgical centralization of the carpus on the ulna is associated with improved appearance and function of the limb and better performance of tasks in patients with radial longitudinal deficiency in comparison with nonoperative management.</p>
