<abstract>
<p>A remarkable expansion of secondary and tertiary education has been witnessed in mainland China in the past decades, resulting in changing returns to educational credentials. Using data from the 2003 and 2008 Chinese General Social Survey, this article examines (1) the changing returns to secondary and tertiary credentials in urban China from 2003 and 2008; and (2) the changing education requirements of employers across the same period. This research highlights a significant decline in economic returns to college credentials, but no significant changes in the economic returns to secondary educational credentials are detected. The percentage of job positions requiring secondary education on the labor market is stagnant while there is a significant increase in the job positions which require tertiary education credentials. This research highlights the potential effects of employers’ responses to educational expansion on the returns to educational credentials.</p>

<p>A remarkable expansion of secondary and tertiary education has taken place in mainland China in the past decades. Based on statistical data released from the Ministry of Education of the People’s Republic of China, the number of graduates from regular secondary school, which combines regular junior and senior high school, increased from 20,474,344 in 2001 to 26,989,536 in 2008. The number of college graduates rose almost five-fold across the same period, from 1,036,323 in 2001 to 5,119,498 in 2008 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0268580913489323">Ministry of Education, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0268580913489323">2008</xref>). Such expansion has resulted in a large-scale increase in the number of credential holders of secondary and tertiary education in the population.</p>
<p>Education, as an investment in human capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0268580913489323">Becker, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0268580913489323">Manski, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0268580913489323">Mincer, 1974</xref>), has been intrinsically connected to occupational benefits such as income, likelihood of promotion, and occupational prestige (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0268580913489323">Bills, 2004</xref>). Individuals who decide to continue their education always expect that their efforts at school will be rewarded in the future job market. However, the proliferation of educational credentials in the context of educational expansion may result in an increase in the well-educated labor force, which, based on the law of supply and demand, might pull down the average level of occupational reward for educational credentials. Is this the case in contemporary urban China? The present study attempts to answer this question based on an analysis of two sets of representative nationwide data.</p>
<p>Although research on the returns to educational credentials abounds (for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0268580913489323">Hout, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0268580913489323">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>), two major limitations have not yet been well addressed. First, most sociological research to date has not taken into account the education requirements of employers for their employees, which can be termed the limitation of ‘over-concentration on characteristics of labor supply relative to labor demand’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0268580913489323">Breen et al., 1995</xref>: 60). For instance, a widely applied analytical strategy is to set up a regression-like model between a respondent’s educational credentials and his or her occupational benefits. This analytical approach, nevertheless, usually only examines the predictors associated with the characteristics of employees, such as gender, educational credentials, or experience, while the effects of employers are not revealed. Such an approach might not be sufficient as the economic returns to educational credentials are jointly determined by both parties, that is, employers and employees. In the context of credential proliferation, for example, employers may raise their credential requirements for the same job position, and consequently, the level of return to the educational credentials may decrease, other things being equal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0268580913489323">Collins, 1971</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0268580913489323">1979</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0268580913489323">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0268580913489323">Thurow, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0268580913489323">Von Ours and Ridder, 1995</xref>). Thus, the responses of employers to the expansion of education should be examined in order to fully understand the changing returns to educational credentials. Second, one methodological limitation in previous studies has been the reliance on ordinary least squares (OLS) linear regression models. The focus of this kind of model is on how educational credentials influence the <italic>average</italic> level of certain occupational benefits such as salaries. Analysis using OLS regression models cannot shed light on the returns to educational credentials across <italic>the whole distribution</italic> of variables like salaries. Besides, OLS regression models are not able to handle extreme values well.</p>
<p>The present research attempts to overcome these limitations by studying (1) the changing returns to secondary and tertiary credentials in urban China from 2003 and 2008 and (2) the changing education requirements of employers across the same period. Methodologically, in order to show the effects of educational credentials on the whole distribution of occupational benefits, we used a quantile regression model instead of OLS regression models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0268580913489323">Koenker and Bassett, 1978</xref>). Results from quantile regression are robust for the extreme-value problem. In the following sections, a brief discussion about the complex relationship between expansion of education and the corresponding changing economic returns in the context of China is provided, followed by a discussion of the data, methodology, and findings. Concluding remarks are provided in the end.</p>
<sec id="section1-0268580913489323">
<title>Returns to educational credentials in the process of educational expansion</title>
<p>How would the returns to educational credentials change in the context of credential proliferation? One straightforward answer to this question is that the market values of educational credentials will decrease. The rationale underpinning this answer follows the economic law of the supply–demand equilibrium: under the condition of the existing market structure, the growth in the number of educational credential holders will lower the equilibrium point of the returns to educational credentials (e.g. salaries). This line of thought can be found in many economic studies (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0268580913489323">Bishop, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0268580913489323">Folger et al., 1967</xref>). In this school, one widely cited theory is the job competition theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0268580913489323">Thurow, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0268580913489323">Von Ours and Ridder, 1995</xref>). Job competition theory provides a structural explanation for the decline in credential returns in the process of educational expansion. In particular, this theory states that the occupational benefits corresponding to certain educational credentials depend on the match between job seekers who are ranked by their educational attainment and job positions which are ranked by their benefit levels. In the process of credential proliferation, highly educated individuals outnumber the available lucrative positions, so the surplus of highly educated workers tempts qualified individuals to move downward in the job queue. Consequently, the returns within a specific educational category (e.g. college graduates) decline and the average level of economic return to educational credentials decreases.</p>
<p>Besides this economic perspective derived from the supply–demand equilibrium, sociologists also draw a similar conclusion from a different perspective. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0268580913489323">Collins (1971</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0268580913489323">1979</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0268580913489323">2011</xref>), viewing educational credentials as a mechanism for maintaining class closure and the monopoly of privileges by the upper class, contends that the market value of educational credentials increasingly inflates as more individuals receive educational degrees. That is, because credential proliferation in the population raises the average educational level of the masses, elites have to lift up the credential requirements for access to social resources in the interest of maintaining class closure. Consequently, the returns to a specific educational credential such as a college degree decline.</p>
<p>Although the theories mentioned above are logically persuasive, a simple application of them to the Chinese context might not be appropriate because these theories were developed based on the cases of western industrialized countries where a mature labor market is established and conventionalized. This might not be the case in China, where the state has monopolized labor allocation via the work unit system in urban China for a long time. But a labor market has been emerging since the reform of the 1980s in urban areas. Thus, the returns to educational credentials in mainland China should be analyzed within the context of the institutional transition from state socialism to a market economy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0268580913489323">Nee, 1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0268580913489323">1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0268580913489323">Nee and Cao, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0268580913489323">2005</xref>), and the returns to educational credentials are not necessarily diminishing.</p>
<p>In particular, in the pre-reform era, it was political loyalty such as Communist Party membership rather than educational credentials that mattered for individuals’ access to a variety of occupational resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0268580913489323">Walder, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0268580913489323">Whyte and Parish, 1984</xref>). For instance, a crucial step for occupational promotion was ‘political inspection’, and only politically qualified individuals could move upward, where educational credentials were just one relevant factor. Besides, the egalitarianism communist ideology before the reform required the distribution of compensations to be more or less equal across employees within a work unit, remarkably limiting the magnitude of salary differentials among urban residents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0268580913489323">Walder, 1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0268580913489323">1995</xref>). Therefore, educational credentials were largely not an influential factor in an individual’s economic life in the era of state socialism, and thus the returns to educational credentials were extraordinarily small.</p>
<p>This situation began to change in the process of reform in which the relevance of political capital (e.g. Communist Party membership) to the access to social resources has diminished while human capital has become increasingly important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0268580913489323">Dickson and Rublee, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0268580913489323">Nee, 1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0268580913489323">1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0268580913489323">Nee and Cao, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0268580913489323">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0268580913489323">Verhoeven et al., 2005</xref>). In a research article, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0268580913489323">Nee and Cao (2005)</xref> proposed three mechanisms through which the market transition affects income inequality in urban China. First, the higher marginal productivity of private enterprises relative to state-owned enterprises in the reform era suggests that private enterprises are more capable of recruiting skilled workers through providing them with a commensurate payment. Second, the development of a labor market following the demise of the state monopoly on labor allocation has promoted the free job hunting of job seekers as well as competition among firms for talented workers. Third, the competition among enterprises on the market has driven firms, both private and public ones, to become more meritocratic. All three mechanisms underscore the fact that human capital has gradually been paying off in the reform era. Education credentials, as a signal of human capital on the labor market (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0268580913489323">Arkes, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0268580913489323">Spence, 1973</xref>), are therefore increasingly becoming a major determinant of social resource accessibility.</p>
<p>In this regard, the increase in the number of well-educated individuals might be taking place concomitant with the gradual establishment of a meritocratic society valuing educational credentials, which is complicating the relationship between credential proliferation and credential returns. For instance, the long-time depreciation of educational attainment before the reform may have resulted in an undersupply in the skilled labor force in the reform era when the high-speed economic growth, the integration into the global economy, and the development of high-tech industries all called for a greater number of better-skilled workers (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0268580913489323">Zhao and Jiang, 2011</xref>). Therefore, some scholars have argued that credential proliferation might happen together with an increase in credential returns because the percentage of people in the highly educated labor force in the population of mainland China was much lower than the international average (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0268580913489323">Chen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0268580913489323">Yue, 2004</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0268580913489323">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>The theoretical discussions above provide diverse or even opposite hypotheses on the relationship between educational expansion and the returns to educational credentials. In order to integrate them into a consistent framework, we apply Seidman’s discussion on the dynamics between the rising school enrollment ratio and the changing economic returns to educational credentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0268580913489323">1982</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0268580913489323">1996</xref>). Although Seidman focused on high school in the United States, the <italic>rationale</italic> underpinning his model underscores the dynamics between the supply and the demand of an educated labor force. Therefore, it is practically reasonable to apply this model to analyze other educational levels such as tertiary education. Because of this, we believe Seidman’s model can shed new light on the changing returns to higher education in Chinese society as the supply of college degree holders is continuously rising. Seidman’s model is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0268580913489323">Figure 1</xref>.</p>
<fig id="fig1-0268580913489323" position="float">

<p>Seidman’s model.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0268580913489323-fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Without losing generality, Seidman assumed that the educational system expands at a uniform rate (the diagonal line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0268580913489323">Figure 1</xref>). Under this condition, Seidman proposed three distinct phases (A through C) in which the relationship between educational expansion and the returns to educational credentials can vary. At phase A, the increasing supply of educated individuals is concomitant with rising returns. Such rising returns gradually slow down at phase B to stay at a roughly constant level, though the supply in the educated labor force is continuously increasing. At phase C, a greater supply of educated workers would result in diminishing returns to educational credentials. Seeing the theories reviewed above from Seidman’s framework, we can see that the job competition theory and the credential inflation theory mainly describe the situation at phase C, while the implications of the market transition theory mainly refer to the case at phase A.</p>
<p>Why do the dynamics between the proliferation of educational credentials and the economic returns exhibit such cross-phase variation? Since the returns to educational credentials are jointly determined by both employees and employers and the educational credentials of employees have been set to rise uniformly in Seidman’s model, the answer to this question may be found in the educational requirements of employers. As Seidman put it, the attitude towards educational credentials on the part of employers is an important factor shifting the returns to educational credentials across phases. At phase A, to labor recruiters, ‘a high school diploma becomes a highly sought after good’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0268580913489323">1996</xref>: 7). At phase B, ‘when the system becomes fairly large … the personal and social belief in it [namely, educational credentials] remains high [for employers]’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0268580913489323">1996</xref>: 7). Finally, at phase C, employers start to feel ‘the mere possession of the high school diploma can have no socioeconomic meaning whatsoever’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0268580913489323">1996</xref>: 6–7). Thus, the attitudes towards educational credentials of employers are influential on the changing returns to educational credentials, assuming a uniform pattern of credential proliferation.</p>
<p>Also, it is readily noticeable that the three phases specified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0268580913489323">Seidman (1982</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0268580913489323">1996</xref>) correspond to three matching statuses between labor supply and labor demand. At phase A, well-educated individuals are in undersupply, as implied by the market transition theory, so the education requirement of firms may be constant or even lowered in order to recruit scarce educated workers. In this case, a greater supply of college graduates and rising occupational returns can take place at the same time. At phase B, the supply and demand of well-educated individuals on the market gradually reaches a point of equilibrium and the education requirements of job positions may be stagnant or slightly increase, so the returns to educational credentials would be largely constant, neither significantly increasing nor decreasing. When phase C finally comes, well-educated workers are in such oversupply that employers raise their education requirements in order to get ‘better’ workers. As argued by scholars such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0268580913489323">Thurow (1975)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0268580913489323">Collins (2011)</xref>, the returns to educational credentials in this case decline.</p>
<p>In summary, it might be too hasty to draw a simple conclusion that the increasing supply of well-educated individuals in China would immediately cause a decline in the returns to educational credentials. What we should do is to ascertain, through vigorous research, the locations of phase of secondary and tertiary education in Seidman’s model in contemporary China. Because education requirements of employers are such an important factor in determining phase locations, we have decided to examine (1) the changing returns to educational credentials and (2) the changing occupational requirements of education between 2003 and 2008, a period of large-scale expansion in secondary and tertiary education. Due to employers’ responses to the proliferation of credentials, there are good reasons to expect that if the returns to educational credentials change, the corresponding occupational education requirements will change too. In other words, we expect to find that the changing returns to educational credentials <italic>covariates</italic> with the changing education requirements.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0268580913489323">2</xref></sup></p>

<title>Data and methods</title>
<sec id="section3-0268580913489323">
<title>Data</title>
<p>The representative sample data used in this research are from the Chinese General Social Survey (CGSS) collected in 2003 and the urban section of 2008.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0268580913489323">3</xref></sup> Both surveys adopted multi-level random sampling and covered 22 provinces (omitting Tibet), four autonomous regions, and four municipalities directly under the Central Government. The sampled respondents were over 18 years of age and the sample sizes were 5894 in CGSS 2003 and 3982 in CGSS 2008 (the urban section). In the following analysis, we restrict cases to people who (1) have completed corresponding education; and (2) were employed at the time of survey. These restrictions are desirable for our research objectives. Since the final diploma is an important signal of human capital, we want to leave out drop-out students. The sample restriction to active labor force participants is a widely held operation. For instance, several studies set an age restriction to approximately guarantee the analyzed cases are active labor market participants (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0268580913489323">Hauser and Xie, 2005</xref>). However, a potential caveat should be mentioned. If we exclude those college students who are not holding a job, we may <italic>overestimate</italic> the returns to a college degree because we de facto focus on individuals whose credentials can <italic>at least</italic> guarantee a position on the labor market. Since the objective of this study is to examine how credential inflation reduces returns to college credentials, the empirical results shown below may give a conservative estimate of how much credential inflation reduces returns.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0268580913489323">4</xref></sup> After sample restriction, our final sample sizes were 2783 and 2279, respectively, for CGSS 2003 and CGSS 2008. CGSS includes many variables measuring individuals’ educational background and labor market status, so it is an ideal data source for our research. Moreover, these two waves of data sets applied consistent sampling procedures, making comparisons between them appropriate.</p>

<sec id="section4-0268580913489323">
<title>Method</title>
<p>Selection bias has always been a potential issue in the research on the returns to educational credentials. Seen from the perspective of sampling, selection bias refers to the bias in statistical inference caused by the non-random coverage of some portion of the target population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0268580913489323">Lohr, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0268580913489323">Winship and Mare, 1992</xref>). In the examination of the economic consequences of educational credentials, selection bias is not uncommon because school enrollment involves both the subjective preferences of students and the screening process of educational institutions. Consequently, the treatment of receiving a certain level of education is not randomly distributed among school-age individuals. In China, such a selection process is especially prominent. According to the statistics collected by UNESCO, for instance, the average tertiary enrollment rate for China was 26% in 2010, a rather smaller number compared with advanced societies such as in the United States.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0268580913489323">5</xref></sup> Therefore, in light of the large number of people in the college-age population in China, this low enrollment rate suggests that only a small portion of high school graduates have the opportunity to go to college. The enrollment rate for secondary education is not universal either (81% in China in 2010 vs 96% in the US in 2010). Thus, the selection process is prevalent in the context of Chinese society.</p>
<p>One consequence of the selection process is that those factors determining an individual’s likelihood of schooling may at the same time be related to the labor market outcome such as salaries. This is understandable because those who are more intelligent or come from a better-off family have a better chance to both receive more education and find a good job on the labor market. Therefore, the relationship between educational credentials and labor market outcomes would be confounded by such factors. In the past years, how to deal with selection bias has become one of the major issues in the study of the returns to educational credentials (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0268580913489323">Brand and Halaby, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0268580913489323">Brand and Xie, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0268580913489323">Dale and Krueger, 2002</xref>). In this research, we use propensity score matching (PSM) to deal with potential selection bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0268580913489323">Guo and Fraser, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0268580913489323">Morgan and Winship, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0268580913489323">Rubin, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0268580913489323">Rubin and Thomas, 1996</xref>). The propensity score is the predicted probability of attending a certain level of school conditional on a series of pre-school covariates. Based on the propensity score, a matched sample will then be constructed in which one educated individual is matched with one or several uneducated individuals as long as their propensity score values are sufficiently close. The most desirable attribute of such a matched sample is that both educated and uneducated individuals in this sample, for a specific value of the propensity score, have similar odds of receiving a specific level of education, since the pre-school factors which differentiate people’s school entrance opportunities are ‘balanced’ via the propensity score. Therefore, the difference in the economic status between better educated and less educated individuals can be attributed to whether or not they receive the education instead of confounding factors such as family origin. In this way, the potential selection bias is dealt with.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0268580913489323">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>In order to reveal the economic returns to educational credentials across the whole distribution of the outcome variable <bold>Y</bold>, we fit a quantile regression model based on the matched sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0268580913489323">Buhai, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0268580913489323">Koenker and Bassett, 1978</xref>). Unlike regular OLS linear regression, quantile regression modeling investigates the effects of predictors on quantile values (e.g. the 0.25, 0.50, and 0.75 quantiles) of the outcome variable. In particular, a quantile regression model sets a linear relationship between the θth quantile of the outcome variable <bold>Y</bold> and predictors <bold>X</bold> as follows:</p>

<p>In previous studies, quantile regression has been widely used in econometric analysis of educational returns in many societies such as the United States (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0268580913489323">Buchinsky, 1994</xref>), the United Kingdom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0268580913489323">Gosling et al., 2000</xref>), and India (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0268580913489323">Azam, 2012</xref>), among others. In the research on Chinese society, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0268580913489323">Knight and Song (2003)</xref> used quantile regression modeling to address the increasing urban wage inequality in China. In addition to the advantage of examining the effects of educational credentials across different quantiles of the outcome distribution, quantile regression, compared with regular OLS models, was also robust with regard to the potential extreme-value-problem. These attributes of quantile regression are desirable for our study.</p>

<p>In this research, the Mincer earnings regression model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0268580913489323">Mincer, 1974</xref>) was fitted with the outcome variable the log-transformed individual annual income. We acknowledge that personal income is only a gross measure of personal salaries because of the potential earnings from other non-occupational sources. However, such a limitation, we believe, is tolerable because the major income source for most urban residents is their occupational salaries and wages. For instance, based on data released from the National Bureau of Statistics of China, the average percentage of income from wages and salaries in disposable income was 76% in 2003 and 72% in 2008 among urban residents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0268580913489323">National Bureau of Statistics of China, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0268580913489323">2008</xref>). Thus, the gross measure of wages used in this research can be seen to approximately reflect occupational salaries. Also, it is worth mentioning that we have restricted our sample respondents to those who are employed, and such a restriction lends support to the validity of the gross measure used here.</p>
<p>Following the routine construction of the Mincer earnings regression model in previous research (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0268580913489323">Zhu, 2011</xref>), we included a series of predictors, including <italic>educational attainment/credentials</italic> (1 = below junior high school; 2 = junior high school; 3 = senior high school; and 4 = college level education); <italic>gender</italic> (0 = male; 1 = female); <italic>ethnicity</italic> (0 = minority ethnicity; 1 = Han ethnicity); <italic>Mincer-type experience</italic> (age minus 6 minus years of schooling) and its square term; <italic>political identity</italic> (0 = not a Communist Party member; 1 = Communist Party member); and <italic>region</italic> (the provinces where the survey was conducted). These variables were used to predict the quartile values of log annual income. Since Mincer-type experience is constructed based on an individual’s age, we do not include age as a predictor to avoid the collinearity problem.</p>
<p>As for the <italic>occupational requirement</italic> for educational credentials, it is measured with a question asking respondents what educational credentials were required to get his/her position (1 = no requirement; 2 = junior high school; 3 = senior high school; and 4 = college level education). Although the information on this variable was collected from employees rather than employers, the longitudinal changes of the education requirement for those who were employed between 2003 and 2008, we believe, can still shed light on the changing attitudes towards educational credentials of employers in the context of credential proliferation.</p>

<p>First of all, both secondary (except for junior high school at the 0.50 quantile in 2008) and tertiary credentials can significantly contribute to the increase of individual annual income across different quantiles, relative to educational levels below junior high school. In addition, the tertiary credential was the most valued by the labor market compared with secondary educational credentials, as shown by the larger coefficients of tertiary education across quantiles. These findings provide support for the relevance of educational credentials to the differential access to life chances in the reform era of China. Moreover, the returns to educational credentials become increasingly salient from the secondary level to the tertiary level. Unlike the findings obtained based on OLS models, such pro-income effects of educational credentials held across different quantiles of the whole income distribution.</p>
<p>Second, across different quantiles, the effects for a specific educational credential were pretty homogeneous. For instance, the returns to a college education at different quantiles of log personal annual income stayed at around 0.9 in 2003. Such stability across quantiles was also the case for 2008 as the economic returns to a college degree were all between 0.6 and 0.8. For secondary education, obtaining a junior high school and a senior high school diploma could increase individuals’ log annual income, respectively, by around 0.2 and 0.4–0.5, again, being stable across quantiles. The findings here suggest that across the distribution of an individual’s annual income, the effects of a specific educational credential were fairly homogeneous, which is different from the pattern highlighted in the United States where the credential effect was increasingly stronger towards the high-income end (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0268580913489323">Lemieux, 2006</xref>), and also different from the pattern evident in China at the end of the 20th century when the returns to educational credentials decline from the lowest to the highest quantiles of income (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0268580913489323">Knight and Song, 2003</xref>). More discussion on this is provided in the concluding remarks.</p>
<p>Third, across the period between 2003 and 2008, a significant decline in the returns to a college degree was detected for the 0.50 and 0.75 quantiles of log annual income, based on the findings in the last column of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0268580913489323">Table 1</xref>. In particular, the coefficients for college education significantly declined by around 0.2 for both quantiles, respectively, at the 0.01 significance level and 0.05 significance level. In terms of secondary education, however, no significant cross-period differences are revealed. Thus, the trajectories in the returns to educational credentials shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0268580913489323">Table 1</xref> suggest that, at least for the 0.50 and 0.75 quantiles of log personal income, a college degree was inflated between 2003 and 2008 while the returns to secondary education were always stable.</p>
<p>If we view our findings from Seidman’s model, we can see that the returns to secondary education and tertiary education stayed in two distinct phases, though both educational credentials underwent significant proliferation between 2003 and 2008. The roughly constant returns to secondary education suggest that the number of jobs only requiring secondary education and the number of workers who held secondary educational credentials were somewhat matched, or balanced, which corresponds to phase B in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0268580913489323">Figure 1</xref>. Tertiary education, on the other hand, can be treated as at phase C, in light of the diminishing returns to a college degree in the context of credential proliferation.</p>
<p>As reviewed above, the educational requirements of employers may be a key factor in determining the location of the phases. In this regard, we want to further investigate the changing requirements for educational credentials between 2003 and 2008, and we are expecting to see an insignificant change for secondary education but a significant change for tertiary education.</p>

</fig>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0268580913489323">Figure 2</xref>, the percentage of occupations that do not require a formal education credential declined from around 59% to 53% from 2003 to 2008. At the same time, the percentages of occupations requiring a junior high school credential, a senior high school credential, and a college degree all increased in the same period, respectively, by 1%, 1%, and 8%. Further analysis shows that only the decline in the percentage of no requirement positions and the increase in the percentage of college level requirement positions were statistically significant at the 0.001 level. These findings suggest that there was a significant increase in the occupational positions from 2003 to 2008 which required college credentials, which further caused the significant decline in the number of no requirement positions on the job market.</p>
<p>Taking both the findings here and the findings shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0268580913489323">Table 1</xref> into account, an intriguing correspondence between credential requirements and credential returns emerges. That is, <italic>from 2003 to 2008, the insignificant increase in the number of positions requiring secondary education credentials corresponds to their insignificant changes in economic returns; while the significant rise in the number of positions requiring a college degree corresponded to the significant decline in the returns to college level credentials</italic>. Although based on the information of cross-sectional data, we cannot make a causal interpretation of such a correspondence, and these findings still suggest certain covariation dynamics between labor supply and labor demand which jointly determine the changes in the returns to educational credentials in the context of educational expansion.</p>

<title>Concluding remarks</title>
<p>Using data collected from two representative samples of CGSS, this research highlights the significant decline in the economic returns to college credentials at the 0.50 and 0.75 quantiles of the log individual annual income, between 2003 and 2008. At the same time, no significant changes in the economic returns to secondary educational credentials were detected across the same period. The relative insensitivity of the labor market to secondary education credentials may account for such a stagnation of returns, as shown by the stable percentages of job positions requiring secondary educational credentials. With regard to college education, nevertheless, a significant increase in the number of jobs which required tertiary education credentials was found from 2003 to 2008. This is concomitant with the significant decline in the economic returns to a college degree, illustrating the dynamics between employers and employees in urban China.</p>
<p>The declining returns to a college education bear significant implications. Because of the decline in the expected market rewards from tertiary education, individuals may either opt to enter the job market without pursuing a college degree or decide to extend their educational career to earn a master’s or doctoral degree. In contemporary China, both options have followers. For instance, on the one hand, many high school graduates decide to give up higher education opportunities due to the perception that ‘higher education is futile’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0268580913489323">Hao, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0268580913489323">Yu and Zhang, 2006</xref>). On the other hand, the enrollment rate in graduate schools has increased remarkably. From 2003 to 2008, the number of newly admitted graduate students almost doubled – from 268,925 to 446,422 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0268580913489323">Ministry of Education, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0268580913489323">2008</xref>). These two situations, however, might not benefit the whole society. If a large proportion of candidates for a college degree, even though well prepared, decide to opt out, the overall quality of the labor force would become lower. Meanwhile, if most qualified college graduates decide to postpone entering the job market, the match between education and the labor market for society would not be efficient and, thus, there would be a waste of social resources, or ‘over-education’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0268580913489323">Yang et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, how to maintain a considerable level of returns to a college degree may be one of the focuses of education-related policies.</p>
<p>Although not the focus of this study, the findings in this research also shed light on the debate about the relative significance between human capital and political capital in the reform era in light of the fact that many sociologists argue that political capital is still an important factor determining people’s access to social resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0268580913489323">Bian and Logan, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0268580913489323">Bian and Zhang, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0268580913489323">Walder, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0268580913489323">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0268580913489323">Zang, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0268580913489323">Zhou, 2000</xref>). From <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0268580913489323">Table 1</xref>, we see that Communist Party membership has been largely contributive to an individual’s annual income. However, such effect diminishes from the 0.25 quantile to the 0.75 quantile. When it comes to the 0.75 quantile, Communist Party membership was insignificant in 2003 and just significant at a marginal level in 2008. In addition, if we make a comparison between the coefficients between Communist Party membership and educational credentials, we can find that education credentials above senior high school have larger regression coefficients than Communist Party membership. In summary, our findings suggest that although political capital is still relevant to an individual’s income at and below the median of income distribution, it is now less influential than an individual’s human capital in the reform era of China.</p>
<p>One distinctive finding of this study is that the returns to educational credentials, for both secondary and tertiary ones, are somewhat homogeneous across quartiles of the income distribution. This is different from either the pattern in societies such as the United States, where the returns are higher at the high-income end (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0268580913489323">Lemieux, 2006</xref>), or the pattern found at the end of last century in Chinese society when the returns were lower at the high-income end (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0268580913489323">Knight and Song, 2003</xref>). How can we explain such differences?</p>
<p>Of course, the most straightforward explanation for such differences may lie in methodology. For instance, instead of using a categorical variable of educational attainment, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0268580913489323">Lemieux (2006)</xref> studied years of schooling, a continuous variable. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0268580913489323">Knight and Song (2003)</xref> used a categorical variable, but they set the reference group to be unschooled individuals while in our research the reference group is those who are educated below junior high school level. These methodological and measurement differences account for the different findings. Nevertheless, bearing these technical causes in mind, we want to further explore potential substantive causes for the differences in our findings from previous studies. In other words, do such differences reflect certain substantive uniqueness of contemporary Chinese society?</p>
<p>In the first place, the differences in our findings from the western pattern, we believe, may be attributed to distinct occupational structures. Unlike the United States, where well-paid occupations, such as lawyers or physicians, usually require a higher level of education,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0268580913489323">7</xref></sup> the high-income occupations in contemporary China are more likely to be those that do not require much in terms of educational credentials (e.g. running a business). Thus, the pattern of ‘higher returns to educational credentials at the high-income quantiles’ is not detected in this research.</p>
<p>Then, why do the findings in this research differ from those of earlier studies on Chinese society? In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0268580913489323">Knight and Song (2003)</xref>, for example, urban data were also used to study the changing returns to educational attainment between 1988 and 1995, and they found that the coefficients of credential returns declined from the lowest to the highest quantiles. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0268580913489323">Knight and Song (2003)</xref> attributed such diminishing effects to the mechanism of ‘sharing profit’. In particular, they argued that ‘profitable enterprises raise wages by informally sharing profits with their employees’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0268580913489323">Knight and Song, 2003</xref>: 614). Such discretionary payments are always equally distributed within an enterprise without taking into account recipients’ educational credentials. Since people who work in such profitable enterprises are more likely to be located at the high-income end across the income distribution, the returns to educational credentials are therefore lower at the high quantiles. Knight and Song’s explanation is persuasive about the situation in the late 1980s and the early 1990s when many profitable enterprises were still state-owned and where it was more likely that there would be a lower level of compensation differences among employees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0268580913489323">Walder, 1995</xref>). However, after 10 years of reform (the period between 2003 and 2008 examined in this study), there are good reasons to suspect that such a profit sharing mechanism cannot be as influential as before, as argued by the market transition theory (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0268580913489323">Nee and Cao, 2005</xref>). As the state budgetary investment is gradually being replaced by bank loans, state-owned enterprises also face competition on the market. Economic effectiveness would then be emphasized and most enterprises have to distribute their compensation in a meritocratic manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0268580913489323">Nee and Cao, 2005</xref>). These aspects of social change may provide one possible explanation for the differences in our findings from those of previous studies of Chinese society.</p>
<p>We acknowledge several limitations of this research. First of all, two waves of CGSS were used and the time span between them was only five years. This time span may be not sufficiently long to reveal the longitudinal trends in the returns to educational credentials in the long run. Thus, any extrapolations of the trend pointed out in this research should be made with caution. Second, the measure of personal economic status does not make a distinction between salaries and other sources of income such as income from financial investment. Although we provide our defense for such a coarse measure, better measures are definitely called for in future research. Third, the negative relationship between the occupational requirements and the returns to educational credentials revealed in this research, strictly speaking, can only be interpreted as a kind of correlation. It implies, but is not equal to, causation. In order to make reliable causal conclusions, more nuanced measures and more waves of data should be investigated so as to ascertain the temporal ordering of these two variables. Bearing these limitations in mind, we still believe that this research makes a considerable contribution to the existing studies on the returns to educational credentials with this special but important case of a rapidly and comprehensively transitioning society: mainland China. The findings of this research, furthermore, may be the basis for more nuanced studies in the future.</p>

For instance, the data examined in previous research so far focused on the late 1980s, the 1990s, or early 2000s, but higher education expansion was officially implemented in 1999 when the Ministry of Education of the People’s Republic of China launched the project, Action Scheme for Invigorating Education Towards the 21st Century, setting forth the explicit goal that the rate of gross higher education enrollment among the school-age population would reach 15% by 2010. So the first cohort of college graduates who experienced higher education expansion entered the job market in 2006. Therefore, in order to shed light on how the returns to higher education vary in the process of higher education expansion, we should investigate survey data collected after 2006.</p>
