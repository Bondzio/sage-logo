<abstract>
<p>As part of a study of intercultural contribution to workplace practices, an interview with Sara, a long-term newcomer to Britain, reveals how her non-Western background has made her a more effective manager despite a sustained feeling of being “foreign.” However, much of what she says appears to be in response to considerable researcher suggestion that might invalidate the interview. Further analysis of the interview interaction is set within the context of the need to interrogate established scripts about culture, to uncover alternative, tacit understandings, to address creatively the subjectivities of the interview, and to “dig deep.” The analysis reveals that the researcher’s participation indeed contributes to “getting to the bottom of things” and is validated by there still being space for the autonomous emergence of the unexpected in Sara’s contribution, which goes beyond the agenda of the researcher.</p>

<body>
<p>This article looks at a single interview with Sara (pseudonym), who holds an executive administrative position in a large British institution. Although she has lived, been educated, and worked in Britain since the age of 12, the interview explores the extent to which she feels that a cultural dimension from her country of birth, Iran, continues to contribute to her performance at work. The article also looks at how the researcher’s own participation during the process of the hour-long interview itself contributes to the emergence of intercultural understandings. This in turn leads to an interrogation of the role played by the researcher’s influence and agenda within the wider domain of qualitative research.</p>
<p>I will begin by describing the research project to contextualize the purpose and methodology of the interview, and then I look in detail at the interview data.</p>
<sec id="section1-1077800412442811">
<title>Development of the Project</title>
<p>The research question that underpins this study asks <italic>how far experience from a “foreign” cultural background enables contribution to and enrichment of found work practices</italic>. I use the term <italic>foreign</italic> guardedly, simply to mean foreign to the place where the work practice is taking place. The question seeks to interrogate the established view that national cultures are different to each other in behavioral norms and values to such a degree that adapting to social practices in a foreign cultural domain will always be inhibited. Within this view, the concept of an intercultural line is often used to indicate a division of values that in turn indicates a division in what people are prepared to do or are capable of doing. While it is generally acknowledged that cultural stereotypes are overgeneralized and do not adequately represent cultural complexity and variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1077800412442811">Spencer-Oatey &amp; Franklin, 2009</xref>, p. 47), the cultural line is still felt to be uncrossable because “members of different cultures” have beliefs, values, and practices that suit them but might “compromise one’s own values” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1077800412442811">Spencer-Oatey &amp; Stadler, 2009</xref>, p. 9) and remain “incompatible” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077800412442811">Byram, 2008</xref>, p. 69). Accompanying the notion of an indelible intercultural line is that of a third space, where the best that can be achieved is a sense of hybridity, which, no matter how creative, will remain poorly tolerated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077800412442811">Byram, 2008</xref>, p. 62).</p>
<p>This position has been critiqued from a critical cosmopolitan perspective and broad ethnographic observation of behavior, which suggest that the intercultural line is sufficiently indistinct for cultural newcomers not only to succeed but also to contribute to and enrich the practices that they find (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077800412442811">Holliday, 2011</xref>, p. 184). This critique argues that the established view is neo-essentialist because, while acknowledging variability, national cultural descriptions remain the dominant measure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077800412442811">Holliday, 2011</xref>, p. 6), and that the notion of an uncrossable intercultural line is a methodological fiction borne from 19th century European nationalism (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077800412442811">Beck &amp; Sznaider, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1077800412442811">Schudson, 1994</xref>). The national cultural descriptions espouses by the established view are accused of supporting an academic establishment which depends on accountable, specialist theory building (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1077800412442811">Kumaravadivelu, 2007</xref>, p. 68; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1077800412442811">Moon, 2008</xref>, p. 15; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1077800412442811">Shuter, 2008</xref>, p. 38; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1077800412442811">Vayda, 1994</xref>, p. 320). One such set of descriptions maintains the influential distinction between (a) collectivist cultures, which are characterized as group-oriented, resistant to change, and employing circular thinking, and (b) individualist cultures, which, are characterized by autonomy, personal goals, self-improvement, achievement, assertiveness, self-reliance, consistency, and being open to new experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1077800412442811">Triandis, 2004</xref>, pp. x-xi). The critical cosmopolitan critique argues that, rather than being neutral, objective categories, such descriptions feed an Orientalist idealization of a Western Self and demonization of a non-Western Other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077800412442811">Holliday, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1077800412442811">Kim, 2005</xref>, p. 108; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1077800412442811">Kumaravadivelu, 2007</xref>) and represent the “nice,” de-politicized face of neo-racist profiling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1077800412442811">Delanty, Wodak, &amp; Jones, 2008</xref>, p. 1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1077800412442811">Lentin, 2008</xref>, pp. 102-103; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1077800412442811">Spears, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Given the influential nature of this individualism–collectivism divide, to interrogate the established theory, I therefore looked for research subjects who had a so-called collectivist cultural background, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1077800412442811">Triandis’s (2004</xref>, pp. x-xi) classification, but nevertheless appeared successful in a so-called individualist British work environment. Sara, with her Iranian background suited this definition.</p>
<p>The interview with Sara was the first of a number in what I initially intended to be an extended sample. However, on transcribing and analyzing the data my first inclination was to discard the interview for two reasons. I suspected first that, as Sara had come to Britain at such an early age, at 12, her Iranian influence must be negligible and second that my own participation in the interview, as I pursued my research question agenda, was so powerful that Sara might have chosen, for whatever reason, to collude with conclusions that I had fed. However, further scrutiny of the interview text began to produce a different picture. First, Sara had a lot to say about the still powerful influence of her Iranian background, ranging from vivid recollections of her school life, which seemed still very relevant in her workplace experience over 25 years later. Secondly, my own participation seemed possibly to play a positive role in drawing out and pursuing what she had to say. My agenda, attached to the research question, was clear; but it seemed in delicate dialogue with what she was telling me; and her side of this dialogue was sufficiently independent to take me to places that significantly revised my initial agenda.</p>
<p>I therefore decided to focus only on Sara’s interview in this article, to explore in some detail the complexity of what Sara had to say, and also to interrogate my own researcher role in “getting to the bottom of” this complexity. Complexity is feature worthy of exploration because, as argued by the critical cosmopolitan stance referred to above, it represents the virulence of non-Western cultural realities which the center-led theories of “cultures” tend to avoid, marginalize, and hide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077800412442811">Bhabha, 1994</xref>, pp. xiv-xvi). Indeed, it can be argued that a true understanding of the nature of culture must come from these marginal sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1077800412442811">Hall, 1991</xref>, p. 34).</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>Acknowledging the complexities of marginal conditions in the face of discouraging neo-essentialist theories requires creative research methodology. The postmodern critique of positivism rejects as naïve the notion of a researcher who is not involved, subjective and ideologically implicated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077800412442811">Blackman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077800412442811">Clifford, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1077800412442811">Denzin &amp; Lincoln, 2005</xref>, p. 11; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1077800412442811">Gubrium &amp; Holstein, 1997</xref>). Especially within biographical research it is recognized that researchers are only able to construct the biographies of others by reflecting on the structures and values of their own autobiographies by means of an “auto/biographical” methodology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1077800412442811">Merrill &amp; West, 2009</xref>, p. 5, citing Stanley). Furthermore, interviews themselves are far from a straightforward asking of questions and collecting answers in an objective fashion. They are “co-constructed discourse events” in which what the people being interviewed choose to say is a strategic product of how they wish to project themselves in response to the unavoidable presence of the researcher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1077800412442811">Block, 2000</xref>, p. 758).</p>
<p>What people choose to say about culture will not necessarily reflect the nature of their culture, but, instead, represent how they prefer to project it. Their statements represent tacit “discourses of and about culture” which are related to prevailing narratives, ideologies, and prejudices, and rationalizations of Self and Other within a politics of global positioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077800412442811">Holliday, 2011</xref>, p. 131). This positioning may result in a process of Self-Othering, where people align themselves with dominant cultural stereotypes, no matter how negative or limiting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077800412442811">Kumaravadivelu, 2006</xref>, p. 22), as part of a strategy of preservation of Self, resistance against domination or cultural play to manipulate or make sense of the Other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077800412442811">Grimshaw, 2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1077800412442811">2010b</xref>), or, with specific reference to the workplace, in using cultural labeling as an instrument of power play (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077800412442811">Angouri &amp; Glynos, 2009</xref>, p. 8). Where people are invited to tell their life stories within the interview setting, they will employ “the social scripts” available to them which must in turn be “contextualized” within “their historical location in a particular time and place” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1077800412442811">Goodson, 2006</xref>, p. 15). In some cases, the dominant notions of collectivism and individualism may be among these scripts, as is reference to the notion of “culture” itself. In all cases, when people speak about culture they may be unaware of such strategies and discourses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1077800412442811">Fairclough, 1995</xref>, p. 36). Statements about culture are thus “texts to be interrogated rather than taken at face value” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077800412442811">Holliday, 2011</xref>, p. 23; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1077800412442811">Spradley, 1980</xref>, p. 7).</p>
<p>Researching cultural identity therefore requires a persistent “digging deep” to try and get to the bottom of things. At the same time, the interview must be a place where the participant has space to respond in her or his own terms, with the researcher submitting to and building on what emerges. The rigor and validity of the research thus shifts to a management of subjectivity in which researchers become conscious of their presence and use disciplines to deal with it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1077800412442811">Holliday, 2007</xref>). I am particularly inspired in this regard with the manner in which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1077800412442811">Honarbin-Holliday (2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1077800412442811">2012</xref>) writes herself, as a first person participant, into her ethnography of an Iranian university art department, to come clean about the way in which her presence is instrumental in the positioning of all parties present, within a strongly emerging literature on Iranian women (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1077800412442811">Naghibi, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077800412442811">Osanloo, 2009</xref>)</p>
<p>Inevitably, the data collected in this project presents a richness of important lines of enquiry, concerning gender, immigration, perceptions of Britishness and foreignness, the culture of work, and so on, which I was not able to pursue.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1077800412442811">
<title>The Interview</title>
<p>I will now present extracts from the interview that are selected because they indicate the developing sense of cultural complexity in what Sara has to say, which at least partially begins to emerge in dialogue with my own participation. I also try to lay bare my own intentions. I use minimum notation. Italics indicate emphasis; . . . indicates omitted material; – – indicates interruption. In some places, there is a brief field note, made at the time of transcription, and therefore indented with the transcript, to describe the event or summarize part of the interview. The first person is used in the analysis to show that I am taking into consideration my own memory of the event and what I thought at the time. Rough thematic headings are used to help break up the description; though, these emerge as I write rather than from a coded analysis. It is important to note here that although I had met Sara a number of times in formal meetings when visiting her institution, I had had no prior knowledge of her background or life history other than that she was Iranian by birth, which she had told me when the subject came up naturally in a conversation after a meeting.</p>
<sec id="section4-1077800412442811">
<title>Establishing Common Ground</title>
<p>When Sara arrives I am interested to note how far she seems comfortable and is able to mark her own territory. I am conscious of my own chair being higher than hers, but do not want to make an intrusive issue of it. She had made her own decision about where to sit:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>The interview takes place in my office. Sara arrives and I show her in. She sits on one of the lower chairs, some way into the office, near the table cluttered with papers and books. (There are several to choose from.) I sit on a higher chair at right angles to her. I think that she looks eager.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In the opening sequence of the interview, I am however quite strong in introducing what I am looking for, to the extent that I even try to put into lay terms the nature of my theoretical perspective:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Researcher:</speaker>
<p>The reason I asked you was because you told me that you had an Iranian background; so I was interested in that. So I had some idea what that is.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Sara:</speaker>
<p>You probably have a better idea that I do.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Researcher:</speaker>
<p>Well some sort of idea. And of course that’s a difficult thing to get right anyway. It’s complicated.</p>
</speech>
<p>I then set quite a strong scene about how “what is happening in the world” is quite different to cultural stereotypes. I recount the incident of the non-British shop assistants who successfully serve more than one person at once in a shop in London and thus demonstrate that they are able to import practices from another cultural background.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Researcher:</speaker>
<p>It occurred to me that it might be worth looking at people’s experience of arriving somewhere different with a whole load of stuff they’ve been living—that it might actually be useful—and they might even see that they’re changing things for the better around them because of where they have come from. Does that make some – –</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Sara:</speaker>
<p>It makes <italic>perfect</italic> sense. Yes. Given that I came here when I was so young, I’m not sure how much I can relate that to the <italic>workplace</italic>.</p>
</speech>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1077800412442811">
<title>Cultural Innovation at Secondary School</title>
<p>Sara’s final, emphatic assertion that “it makes <italic>perfect</italic> sense” nevertheless indicated to me that, despite my barrage of educative background, she is forming her own opinion that what I am talking about does in fact resonate with her own experience, though unsure about the relevance to workplace. I therefore invite her to talk about what it <italic>is</italic> relevant to, and, after what I consider to be minimal prompting, she begins to speak at length about her experience of introducing what she considers to be Iranian cultural behavior into her secondary school life:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Researcher:</speaker>
<p>Can you relate it to something else?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Sara:</speaker>
<p>Well – –</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Researcher:</speaker>
<p>How old <italic>were</italic> you when you came – –</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Sara:</speaker>
<p>I was 12. So I came here to secondary school. And I do remember <italic>some</italic> of the difficulties I <italic>had</italic>, culturally—which is why I’m saying that it’s a choice you have to make. There comes a point where you have to make a choice, to be someone that you haven’t been before simply to fit in. In a secondary school environment, it was more about survival and fitting in than me thinking what can I bring from my culture. Perhaps if you’ve made that transition, in adulthood, you deal with it differently. But simple things like—and it could be the region that I was living in—I don’t know—exactly [responding to Researcher’ agreement]. In the school that I was attending—it wasn’t that I’m going to look at somebody—but I do remember many people [Researcher laughing with her here] making comments about what are you looking at. Whereas where I came from you looked at people. [Researcher indicating recognition of what she is talking about] It wasn’t impolite, it wasn’t rude, it wasn’t considered as something offensive – –</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Researcher:</speaker>
<p>Looking at people in what sort of way?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Sara:</speaker>
<p>It was standing in the lunch queue—one example—and—there is not very much else to do—in a lunch queue—other than that you look around, you look to hear conversations—so I’d be looking at people’s body language, the way they spoke to each other, their—just <italic>general</italic> observation. And I do remember <italic>many</italic> times being asked <italic>what</italic> am I looking at—very abruptly—and told to mind my own business—not that I’m <italic>interfering</italic> in anybody’s business. So that was <italic>one</italic> thing I quickly had to learn <italic>not</italic> to do—simply <italic>not</italic> look at people because it was considered to be rude.</p>
</speech>
<p>I do feel it is appropriate to join with her in a conversational manner, showing recognition and sharing enthusiasm. I also interrupt with a question because I want to encourage her to get into detail. While being professional, I need to show that I am genuinely interested and behaving as I would in any conversation I was engaged with.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1077800412442811">
<title>Looking at People</title>
<p>Five minutes in, I then try and bring what she is saying about her school experience round to my agenda of how the intercultural strategies that she has described relate to her current professional experience. However, at the same time, a theme has emerged, concerning how one looks at people, which I want to pursue. I therefore respond again in an interrogative manner, to the extent that I suggest quite strongly that something is cultural which she thinks might not be. I go back into educative mode with examples from my own experience and from other research, and I am keen to note that she seems “interested in this”:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Researcher:</speaker>
<p>Do you <italic>still</italic> feel that? Do you now look at people more than – –</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Sara:</speaker>
<p>I <italic>still</italic>—I guess that’s just who I am. I do like to <italic>watch</italic> people and see how they do things—that’s how you <italic>learn</italic>. So I tend to watch people, but just do it in a way that’s not noticeable.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Researcher:</speaker>
<p>You’re more conscious of that?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Sara:</speaker>
<p>I’m very conscious of this, <italic>yes</italic>.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Researcher:</speaker>
<p>You say this was when you were 12—a long time ago. But obviously you still remember</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Sara:</speaker>
<p>Absolutely. It’s very vivid in my mind.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Researcher:</speaker>
<p>It’s still.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Sara:</speaker>
<p>Yes. It was a very real change for me. It was going against what was natural to me. It was something that I found interesting—that seemed like a natural <italic>human</italic> thing to do. But it didn’t seem like a cultural thing at all. It seemed quite offensive.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Researcher:</speaker>
<p>I think it <italic>is</italic> a cultural thing, because that resonates with what I know.</p>
</speech>
<p>I then talk about different rules of privacy. I describe my own experience of people looking at other people in Iran, and refer to an account in a recent ethnographic study of young students coming from the provinces to the capital and looking at each other in public spaces, and how they are interested in how other students look and dress. Sara shows interest in this.</p>
<p>While my participation here might seem to be leading the interview, I am also sharing with Sara what I feel I know about what she is talking about. I have lived in Iran and visited a number of times since. Through my Iranian marriage, I continue to have contact with an Iranian community in Britain. I am therefore building on and engaging with what is emerging from her account, and I feel that this justifies a participation, which is necessary to get deeper, to get to the bottom of what she is talking about. The ethnographic account referred to in the above note is <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1077800412442811">Honarbin-Holliday (2008</xref>), already referred to earlier.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1077800412442811">
<title>Crossing the Intercultural Line</title>
<p>Then, I decide to respond further with a major statement to emphasize cultural difference. This may seem surprising because one of my agendas is to interrogate the dominant understanding of how different national cultures are. However, I want to push the interview further into the domain of difference. At the same time, I pose a direct question about the positive influence of this difference. The outcome is that Sara begins to talk about her strategy for crossing the intercultural line, and how difficult it is:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Researcher:</speaker>
<p>Here, it <italic>is</italic> different, isn’t it.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Sara:</speaker>
<p>Yes, I do think it’s very different.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Researcher:</speaker>
<p>But, isn’t that a <italic>quality</italic> that is worth <italic>contributing</italic> [forcefully but hesitantly introducing his main idea]</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Sara:</speaker>
<p>The thing is that how do you <italic>do</italic> that? How do you cross those barriers that are clearly <italic>there</italic>.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Researcher:</speaker>
<p>Do you feel that?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Sara:</speaker>
<p>As I say, it’s something that comes naturally to me. I <italic>learn</italic> by observing people; and I’ve learnt many things by just <italic>watching</italic> other people—who do things in a particular way, whether it’s presentations, whether it’s just the way they deal with meeting situations, how they deal with people, how they communicate, their body language, <italic>whatever</italic> it may be, that’s how I personally learn. So I still <italic>look</italic>, I still <italic>observe</italic>, and I try and absorb it. I just have to be—I just have to do it in a different way that it’s not healthy to people.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Researcher:</speaker>
<p>You see what you’re describing is exactly what a social researcher does; and <italic>I’ve</italic> been there because that’s what I <italic>am</italic>. [She shows agreement] But it also is probably something to with what sort of personality I have as well. I was always a bit of an outsider when I was at school. And so I used to survive by watching people.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Sara:</speaker>
<p>Mmm [with recognition]</p>
<p>I describe watching people when I first came to my current job to work out how to behave—the senior common room situation and tacit rules for how people left without saying goodbye and not talking about work.</p>
<p>I am then getting anxious that the notion of an intercultural line might be becoming too dominant, because what I want to get at is the skills used to cross it, so that here I am participating again, with an example from my own experience, to suggest that the skills she is using come from a broader set of universal research strategies.</p>
<p>Again, I feel at the time that her enthusiastic response—wanting to break in—validates me saying more. Sara acknowledges that she has managed to practice looking at people, which she feels she brings from Iran, in a way that blends with the new cultural reality in which she finds herself. I then push this acknowledgement back to the proposition that this enables contribution to the workplace, and Sara enters into a discussion with herself about how far her abilities to learn from watching are cultural or personal. This concludes with some recognition that being foreign, an outsider might not just be a matter of having different cultural behavior but of behaving more consciously:</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Researcher:</speaker>
<p>This happens everywhere; but this is something to do with <italic>how</italic> you do it. I mean people are obviously also looking at <italic>you</italic>. [She is enthusiastic to break in]</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Sara:</speaker>
<p>Obviously, something about the way I was doing it <italic>then</italic> was different—yes—was different to the way I do it <italic>now</italic>. Because <italic>now</italic> nobody mentions when I’m—the way I look at them.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Researcher:</speaker>
<p>I was just wondering if in some complicated way that has contributed to how you go about your work. You might not be conscious of it. [Again, purposeful but cautious]</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Sara:</speaker>
<p>[after a pause] I certainly feel that—yes—but that’s my personality, or it is cultural—I don’t know. I think it’s probably a bit of both. Certainly that’s the way I <italic>learn</italic> to deal with – –</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Researcher:</speaker>
<p>Of course it is.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Sara:</speaker>
<p>People in meetings and I <italic>think</italic>, from a personal point of view, what I have contributed to the workplace or to my <italic>work</italic>. From a <italic>personal</italic> point of view, to one of the things that has helped me to <italic>progress</italic> in my career—watching people, learning, and, applying it. So – –</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Researcher:</speaker>
<p>Might you have said that this is what you do, this is how you—operate [cautiously suggesting]—but, in a sense, feeling that you are somehow foreign actually masks that—that you might be more <italic>conscious</italic> [she agrees] of looking around—than someone else [she agrees] might be.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Sara:</speaker>
<p>That would <italic>definitely</italic> be true because I do feel like an outsider, and I do feel like I have to do <italic>more</italic> to—be in the same place as everybody else—if you have the right to be there—if that makes sense. [pause]</p>

<title>Foreign or British?</title>
<p>Ten minutes in, the focus on the workplace seems to be established. There follows a brief discussion of the different places where Sara has worked, and of how her current place of work seems less inviting toward foreigners. This seems to precipitate a change in mood in the interview as I pose the question that she therefore feels that she does have indeed another culture:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Sara:</speaker>
<p>It <italic>feels</italic> very different. I’m conscious of the fact that I don’t fit in, and I am different. I’ve put that down to different working practices actually rather than a cultural . . . Yes, I think it’s more to do with the working culture than – – Not being inviting or welcoming of other cultures, if that makes sense.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Researcher:</speaker>
<p>So you do feel you have another culture.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Sara:</speaker>
<p>[pause] Yes [with cautious resonance].</p>
<p>At this point the atmosphere changes. Sara’s voice rises as though with greater excitement and laughter, and the rapport gains some intimacy.</p>
<p>There follows a brief discussion about whether or not Sara feels British. Then, her statement that she is immediately followed with what I interpret to be an emotional account of being Othered by responses to her name. It needs to be noted here that her real name is unusual and difficult to place and pronounce even within a multicultural British context:</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Sara:</speaker>
<p>I am British. Yes. And I’ve grown up here. So it is – –</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Researcher:</speaker>
<p>But you still feel foreign.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Sara:</speaker>
<p>Yes [higher pitch]. In many ways—yes [lower pitch], I do.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Researcher:</speaker>
<p>That’s interesting isn’t it—after all that time.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Sara:</speaker>
<p>Well I’ll give you an example of my experience here. And it’s one that I haven’t had since leaving school. But while <italic>here</italic>, it was very bizarre to me—that at one point I was in the . . . Building. I heard some giggling outside my door, and then I heard some . . . [one] trying to pronounce my name. . . . And, I came out expecting to— I wasn’t offended—I was just going to make light of it and have a joke with them. And I came out expecting an 18-year-old, really young, and new to the . . . [organization], and what I found was actually two quite mature people, probably around my own age, standing around my door, pointing at my name, trying to figure out how to say it and <italic>giggling</italic>. And it was just . . . It was, you know, it was quite—nudging each other and saying you ask or—you know it was . . . I don’t mind people’s curiosity, and I don’t mind people’s interest, and I don’t mind them not being able to pronounce my name. It was just the giggling. It was—there’s a difference, between being interested, curious, or just not aware of something, and mocking it. And it’s a fine line I think that people often cross where at one point it can be amusing, it can be funny, and then it can become effective. And I think sometimes people find it difficult to know where that line is.</p>

<title>Getting Things Done at Work</title>
<p>Although the interview is now firmly in the workplace domain, I still feel I need to push further, after 15 minutes in, to ask my basic research question again, to focus on the possibility of positive cultural contribution. I feel that my participation is successful because Sara, after pausing to think, although she states here that she can only think of “general examples,” embarks on a detailed account of precisely how her different cultural background leads her to enrich and to be innovative in her work environment. This continues for the next 20 minutes of the interview. I continue to intercede in a supportive manner, with examples from my own work experience, showing agreement and asking for clarification. I also spend some time describing the collectivist and individualist stereotypes, which Sara seems to be relatively unfamiliar with, to see how she responds to this context:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Researcher:</speaker>
<p>I’m still curious about—I don’t want to push this, but I just feel it must be true—and I’m showing my own prejudice here—a positive prejudice I hope—that there must be something worthwhile coming out of this, because – –</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Sara:</speaker>
<p>Out of my background?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Researcher:</speaker>
<p>Yes. To ask you a very direct question—here, taken that this comes from the past—have you—or even in your last job—have you experienced any examples of your presence, and your way of looking at things, and doing things, actually, possibly making an improvement?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Sara:</speaker>
<p>I’d like to think so.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Researcher:</speaker>
<p>Can you think of any examples?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Sara:</speaker>
<p>[pause] I can think of general examples rather than specific ones. I think the way I work is obviously influenced by my experiences, and my experiences to some extent were in Iran, in a different culture. So, the way I was raised, and where I grew up, have shaped who I am and therefore how I deal with situations. So, some of the things as I was growing up that I think have helped me adapt to a different way of working which I think works quite well, but unexpectedly for some people.</p>
<p>Sara then gets deeper into her example and explains that she has a particularly informal mode of “getting things done” which is effective but does not agree with everyone:</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Sara:</speaker>
<p>One is that a lot of things were just done informally—whether it’s a conversation or—a lot of things were achieved by just informal processes. And I think we overlook that quite often. We think it must be written down, it must be done in this way, and I’ve managed to get a lot of things done, build a lot of relations by working informally. And possibly the way I manage my team—although some people have <italic>criticized</italic> me for being <italic>so</italic> informal—but I think it works well in a small team, and we get a lot more done. . . . Flexible. I guess it’s a different type of relationship. I mean there are some—working hours for example. I know there are people who feel very strongly that you must be here at this time, and that you must finish at this time. Whereas what I find is that actually if my staff need to leave half an hour or an hour early on occasions, they’re often a lot more responsive when I need them to stay behind or come in earlier. and, that’s not worked out in a formal way. They know that they can ask informally whether they can leave early. And by the same token, I don’t have to formalize that process of asking them to stay behind.</p>
<p>She seems realistic and thoughtful about how far this is to do with culture and how much with prior experience in Britain; I try to push her to interrogate this further:</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Sara:</speaker>
<p>I think it works. And I think some of that is about <italic>my</italic> cultural background. It’s also to do with my previous work experience.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Researcher:</speaker>
<p>So it might not be so much to do with your ethnicity as you say, but something to do with just the nature of the institution.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Sara:</speaker>
<p>Possibly [thoughtful]</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Researcher:</speaker>
<p>Mm [thoughtfully] so it might be something to do with this corner of Britain in particular—not that it’s anything to do with the region.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Sara:</speaker>
<p>I have no idea. I’ve tried to work it out, but there are so many variables [agreement] that you can’t actually pinpoint it. If I could it’d be a lot easier to deal with.</p>
<p>We also talk about her education and training to see what sort of impact that has. She then goes on to talk about her effectiveness in introducing difficult improvements, even though not always appreciated:</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Sara:</speaker>
<p>I’m right in the middle of quite a few things actually—and that can be quite problematic. One of the things that was quite important when I arrived was to raise the profile of the . . . office which had been in existence for two years. And while clearly they were doing some work, no one actually knew where the . . . Office was, what the role of it was. I had—when I first arrived—had some very bizarre conversations with very senior people—welcomed me, very <italic>warmly</italic>, and then said what are you here to do—which in some ways was very off-putting—to think that there were some very senior people who actually don’t know what I’m supposed to be doing, what the . . . office is <italic>supposed</italic> to do, how it’s supposed to function. So, raising the profile of the . . . office, and, doing things in a backward way in some ways, where, we’d be doing work which we hadn’t been asked to do just to simply show what we <italic>could do</italic>—what the potential is. So, I think that again ties in to my background to some extent—doing the work before and not getting credit for it.</p>
<p>She feels that her approach to meetings is refreshingly non-British:</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Sara:</speaker>
<p>I do find a bit . . . that we just get on with it and do it—whereas I think the British culture—I guess the way of working is let’s have a meeting about having meetings. . . . I mean the number of meetings I’ve had, just to organize other meetings—to get together for two hours just to talk around something. . . . I just think [speeds up] I could have done it ten times over on my own.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Researcher:</speaker>
<p>It creates work.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Sara:</speaker>
<p>Yes, it does. Having said that I think I’m actually—I’m quite a keen record keeper. So, I’m organized in the sense that I’m very much for record keeping, documenting, having processes in place. But I think it doesn’t actually take ten meetings to set up a process. It can be a very simple one. You just lay it out on half a side of A4—or this is what you do in this order, and that’s it. It’s in place. So I’m a very keen record keeper; and I’m all up for documentation and regular meetings—all of those things—but I do think it’s over done. And sometimes it’s not as focused as it needs to be to get the job done. There are too many committees I find, here [very quietly]. And again, I realize there need to be formal processes; but then I think you know we have millions of committees and working groups and task groups and steering groups and whatever; but actually when you get down to it, the processes—all processes are not in place. I mean—talk about planning—you’ve got forms to fill in; we have committees that consider the forms; but actually the process in itself is actually not as comprehensive as it ought to be.</p>

<sec id="section10-1077800412442811">
<title>Getting Things Done in Life</title>
<p>I draw attention to the organizational ability Sara emphasizes here because it does not conform to the notion of a collectivist culture:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Researcher:</speaker>
<p>Have you always been good at organizing things?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Sara:</speaker>
<p>I have no idea [tone rises again]. That’s a difficult one to answer because, I was a young mum, and I think once you’re thrown into that situation you kind of have to get good at organizing very quickly for – – So some of what I do now is just the fact that I’ve had to do it for myself from a very <italic>young</italic> age. But some of it is again what I observed as I was growing up. My parents were both doctors. I remember spending <italic>many</italic> hours after school in the hospital, just watching them do what <italic>they</italic> do. So the multi-tasking, the organizing your life because you simply have to do all of those things—it’s not an option, and it’s not a choice. They have to be done. So you just work with it.</p>
<p>This reference to being a young mother takes us on to talk about other aspects of Sara’s background; and she talks for a moment about her parents; and I enquire about their experience of coming to Britain:</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Sara:</speaker>
<p>They were working in the hospital, they had a private surgery, either they were studying in between, they had a whole range of responsibilities—so, spending many hours with my cousins in their home, or being in the hospital, with my parents, and just helping them to multitask – –</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Researcher:</speaker>
<p>Is there anything there to do with people coming from another country and having to struggle to establish themselves, and not fitting in precisely to the existing system, and having to build a new life and all that sort of thing?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Sara:</speaker>
<p>There was that as well—yes—my dad became a—he managed to continue with his own work—he did a PhD in his own area; and mum, on the other hand, found it a struggle. She actually abandoned <italic>all</italic> of her background really, because she didn’t feel she could do the exams here. Her language was just not up to scratch, so she didn’t feel very good, so she went into a completely different field which. Yes, I think it’s been difficult for her because over there she was a doctor and her, although she still uses the title because she’s still a doctor, she’s never practiced in any way, so – – [quiet detail]</p>
<p>Sara then reveals that she has four children</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Researcher:</speaker>
<p>[laughs] Sorry. Excuse me for being surprised.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Sara:</speaker>
<p>No it’s OK. I’ll take it as a compliment.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Researcher:</speaker>
<p>Yes, or as an achievement. I mean in this society anyone with more than two is considered to be doing something quite fantastic.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Sara:</speaker>
<p>Unusual I think is the word you’re looking for. Yes, and it’s the same in Iran I think. All of my family are quite surprised at—that I chose to have four children.</p>
</speech>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1077800412442811">
<title>Complex Identities</title>
<p>In the last 15 minutes of the interview, Sara begins to talk more widely about her position as an Iranian immigrant in Britain. She distinguishes herself quite strongly from someone who was born in Britain. She recalled an event, in a previous organization she worked for:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Sara:</speaker>
<p>They set up a group for—I can’t remember what they called it—black and ethnic minority group—because they wanted to make sure that everyone was included . . . that everyone’s needs was taken into consideration. And one of the interesting things is this group, although you would think we were all from, you know, an ethnic minority background—or had some—we shared a view of things, it—there was a clear distinction. . . . Those who were born and raised here . . . wanted their language represented, and they want <italic>this</italic> and they want <italic>that</italic> and they think that their needs and their background should be considered. And the rest of us, who’d come here—we were saying actually if you came to my country that’s not how you would be treated. You would be expected to fit in with my culture. So, with us, who have come here—we respect your culture; but that doesn’t mean we let go of our heritage; but, we expect that we are in your country. . . . I wasn’t born here. I still consider myself as—I have a right to be here as a British national; and I think I’ve made enough of a contribution to society. . . . But even so, I wouldn’t want the culture of this country to change simply because we have so many people of another country coming here – –</p>
<p>This leads me to ask again about cultural difference; and there follows a discussion about the complexities of the relationship between British and Iranian identity and culture, and about the difference between incidental and imposed cultural change:</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Researcher:</speaker>
<p>So do you have a clear picture of what the culture of this country actually is?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Sara:</speaker>
<p>Do I have a clear picture [laughs]? [a lot of loud cross-talking and laughing] I’m just being flippant now. But I mean, there is a culture. There is a culture.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Researcher:</speaker>
<p>Well of course there is.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Sara:</speaker>
<p>There are certain elements of what you do and how you do it that’s quite unique to Britain.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Researcher:</speaker>
<p>Do you feel part of that?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Sara:</speaker>
<p>I do feel part of it, and I’m quite, yes—and I think that should be maintained. But that doesn’t mean that other people have to completely forget their <italic>own</italic> cultural heritage and there’s nothing that you can bring in to [pause] share. But it doesn’t have to change. Does that make sense?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Researcher:</speaker>
<p>But perhaps it <italic>is</italic> changing, just because these “other people” are there.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Sara:</speaker>
<p>Yes. But it’s a different <italic>kind</italic> of change . . . There is a change that happens naturally, as soon as you have got within the group someone from a different background the dynamics change, because they have different views, they have a different experience of things. The same with society, surely. But, then there is an <italic>imposed</italic> change when somebody comes over and says because I’m here you must change this, this and this to accommodate me. They’re two different things. . . . What I’m saying is that there’s a difference between a change that happens naturally just because you have a different mix of people. So you contribute things, you share things. That is very different.</p>
<p>The laughter in this section of the interview indicates an increasingly warm rapport with Sara, which continues as we get into, and perhaps makes possible a tricky discussion of the complex interplay between “British” and “Iranian” cultural identity.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Researcher:</speaker>
<p>Are you Iranian?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Sara:</speaker>
<p>Well I think so.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Researcher:</speaker>
<p>Are you British-Iranian? Do you belong to a group of British-Iranian people? Are you – –</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Sara:</speaker>
<p>No, I don’t like to define myself. [laughing]</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Researcher:</speaker>
<p>What about your children? I mean what do they see <italic>them</italic>selves as? And all this sort of thing.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Sara:</speaker>
<p>They see themselves as very mixed. They take – –</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Researcher:</speaker>
<p>They do? Their mother, came here when she was 12 years old. They still see themselves as very mixed.</p>

<speaker>Sara:</speaker>
<p>Absolutely. They love Iranian food. They love getting money from all of my family for New Year [excited] . . .</p>

<speech>
<speaker>Researcher:</speaker>
<p>By British you mean what? [laughs]</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Sara:</speaker>
<p>I mean English and born here. Yes. And they feel that – –</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Researcher:</speaker>
<p>Not ethnic.[rises to the laughter]</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Sara:</speaker>
<p>Not ethnic, yes—born and raised here.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Researcher:</speaker>
<p>Yes. <italic>Your</italic> children are born and raised here.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Sara:</speaker>
<p>True. That’s not a distinction is it. How would you distinguish someone who’s—I don’t know—genuinely from here?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Researcher:</speaker>
<p>Well, you see this is something we’re all brought up now to be very careful about saying things like this.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Sara:</speaker>
<p>Oh but <italic>I</italic> can be – –</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Researcher:</speaker>
<p>but <italic>I</italic> have to be very careful what I say.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Sara:</speaker>
<p>OK, well I . . . I don’t know that people should be so, cautious. . . . I—yes but—as I say, there is a <italic>line</italic> that sometimes people cross. You know you can have a laugh and a joke and be quite relaxed about it; but at one point—at some point it does become offensive and it gets to—that line’s not so obvious.</p>
<p>The final exchange I feel gets to the crux of the complex border lines between difference, Othering, and the serious possibility that people can feel being different things at the same time—one minute British, one minute Iranian, one minute both—and at the same time be conscious of a politics underlying what is thought of this. The important “line” which emerges in this exchange is not between one culture and another, but between being understood and being reduced by a debilitating label.</p>
<p>The interview ends with small talk—finding other people to interview, the ethics of approaching people, and her mother returning from Iran—which seems to confirm that we have succeeded in a genuine sharing of mutual interests.</p>
</speech>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1077800412442811">
<title>Contribution and Enrichment</title>
<p>At a surface level, in answer to my research question, Sara provides evidence that her non-British, non-Western cultural background does indeed provide her with resources with which to be successful and indeed to innovate and enrich her professional practice. She traces her effectiveness to an outsider ability to watch and observe, to a creative approach to management, and to an appreciation for hard work, all of which she claims from her Iranian upbringing and her parents. However, these “findings” are just the beginning when other factors in the interview are considered.</p>
<p>Before getting into these deeper elements, it is first important to be reassured that the anxieties stated at the beginning of the article, about Sara’s tenuous interculturality and the level of researcher participation, are points of departure rather than a disqualification of the data.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1077800412442811">
<title>Mediating Factors</title>
<p>It is true that attributing the things Sara notes about her experiences at school and work to cultural difference may be too “easy.” Her feelings of being different at school could instead be attributed to the common experience of most early teenagers. She could be reading cultural difference into her feelings of being an outsider as a means of rationalizing feelings of insecurity which are felt by many people. It is common for all of us to imagine that we are the only ones having such difficulties. It is also very clear that I do make considerable contribution to the interview which may have led Sara’s responses in the direction of cultural difference. I tell her that I am interested in cultural difference, that I am looking for evidence that it has a positive influence on the workplace, and that I am dissatisfied with the individualism–collectivism differentiation. I push the interview in the directions I am interested in.</p>
<p>However, my participation is also carefully positioned in dialogue with and building on what Sara has to say. Rather than being imposed on by my agenda, Sara takes me to places which I had not expected. That this emergence of the unexpected is possible is evidence of a critical interpretivist approach, which must consciously create opportunities for such emergence. My intention is not to get specific answers to specific questions, but to ask questions in such a way that there are broad possibilities of different types of responses. I am inviting complexity rather than trying to close things down (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1077800412442811">Holliday, 2007</xref>, p. 93). This process of dialogue with Sara also contains an element of co-construction in which I show some familiarity with her cultural background; and this may well contribute to a more intimate rapport. The outcome is a series of meanings in Sara’s narrative which are sustained regardless of my participation, and which also indicate elements of interculturality despite her having been in Britain since the age of 12.</p>

She now rationalizes this as culturally different behavior because it was such a natural thing to do. She has now learnt to do this in a less offensive manner because it helps her to learn how to behave.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>She feels that she does not fit in, and that the degree to which she feels this has something do with the lack of acceptance of “other cultures” by the “work culture.”</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>She feels British at the same time as feeling foreign. She is regularly reminded of her foreignness, and of an example being Othered by giggling surprise at her name.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>She connects her abilities at work, through creative, informal styles of getting on with things, which are effective but often criticized, to this sense of being foreign and with her parents’ work practices.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>She feels there is something particular about British culture, which she is never totally part of, but to which she can bring change as an outsider.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The notion of realities from a different cultural background therefore persists, even though from childhood, within an ongoing struggle for identity cultural identity. At the same time, she projects a narrative of coping and competence. Perhaps most significance in relation to the original research question, there is no evidence whatever of the lack of individualism and associated inability to plan, organize and be self-directed which is thought to be characteristic of someone coming from a collectivist culture. Indeed, the cultural characteristics which she most associates with her Iranian cultural background <italic>are</italic> a sharply individualistic sense of self-direction.</p>

<title>Implications</title>
<p>What is also clear from the data, and especially from the manner in which a conversation develops between Sara and the researcher, is that the issue of culture is not to do with distinctly defined characteristics of particular national cultures. Instead, the data represents people using the notion of culture as they struggle to make sense of ambivalences and uncertainties in their lives. Other people may make other connections. The notion of “culture” as a “floating signifier” is useful in this respect—in that “its meaning and significance emerges only in and through the process of articulation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077800412442811">Angouri &amp; Glynos, 2009</xref>, p. 11) or “as a window into which subjects feel it possible to project their meanings, aspirations and fantasies” (p. 14). This does not make the meaning of cultural difference to Sara less real. Indeed, she is involved in a personal cultural trajectory, which, it can be argued, is at the core of what makes culture real to the individual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077800412442811">Holliday, 2011</xref>, p. 49).</p>
<p>If one is looking for a practical application of this study, specific to the workplace, it provides a confirmation of the findings presented by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077800412442811">Angouri (2010)</xref> that, rather than pinpointing specific national cultural traits:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Employees would need to be prepared for the generic diversity they are likely to encounter when they join a new workplace (whether nationally homogenous or heterogeneous) so that they can more efficiently adapt their skills to the local setting, various situations and (multinational) audiences. To achieve these ends, (future) employees would need to be assisted to develop their observational and analytical skills. (p. 220)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>It is because of her particular cultural trajectory that Sara can claim a development of such skills to a high level and can connect them specifically to her success in the workplace.</p>
