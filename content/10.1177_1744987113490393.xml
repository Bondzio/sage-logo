<p>Palliative care has traditionally been overshadowed both in terms of resources and profile by curative approaches to healthcare. However, in recent years, things have begun to change with hospice and palliative care increasingly being seen as essential activities that require sufficient investment to ensure that high-quality services can be accessed by those who require them. This special issue of the <italic>Journal of Research in Nursing</italic> recognises that palliative care is a key component of nursing, and further endorses the efforts being made to improve people’s experience in receiving palliative care.</p>
<p>The increased recognition of the importance of palliative care puts an even greater onus on those of us who are involved in it to supply the highest quality of care which is underpinned by the best research evidence and framed by the most effective policies. The <italic>Journal of Research in Nursing</italic>’s recognition of the importance of the linkages between research, policy and practice is one of its great strengths. Such recognition is also the driving force behind an exciting new development taking place across the island of Ireland.</p>
<p>In 2010, the All Ireland Institute of Hospice and Palliative Care was formally established. The Institute, which consists of a consortium of hospice and palliative care providers and universities, was set up to ensure that the strategic activities of education, research, policy and practice, which together offer the greatest potential to make real progress in building capacity and effecting change, are fully integrated across the palliative care communities in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>The strategic aims of the Institute can be summarised under four headings.
<list id="list1-1744987113490393" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Meaningful involvement of users, carers and communities in the development and delivery of palliative care education, research, policy and practice. Our goal is to implement structures and methodologies through which users, carers and communities will be meaningfully, appropriately and consistently engaged in the design and evaluation of palliative care services, research, education and training programmes. The active engagement of users, carers and communities will help AIIHPC to understand and address the true issues impacting on people receiving care.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Development of a coherent and collaborative palliative care community. Building on the excellent work already carried out across the palliative care sector, the Institute brings together different parties in a strategic, co-ordinated manner to achieve greater impact, value for money and lasting improvements to palliative care service delivery. Such collaboration will require the use of clear and unambiguous language about the issues which frame contemporary understanding of hospice and palliative care, that is death, dying and loss.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Supporting the delivery of innovative, high-quality palliative care education and research. Education and Research are integral to the development of hospice and palliative care and need to be embedded in practice. Consolidation and innovation are needed to ensure the most appropriate and consistently high-quality learning opportunities are available across the sector. Similarly, developing greater coherence across the focussed areas of research will enable all Irish networks to consistently contribute to the international palliative care research agenda.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Translation of knowledge and learning for the development of palliative care policy and practice nationally and internationally. The Institute aims to close the gap between evidence and practice by working in partnership with users, health professionals, researchers, organisations, policymakers and international collaborators. By embedding translation in all its work packages, the Institute will have a powerful impact in helping to drive positive policy change and support practice development thus improving the experience of people at the end of life.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Reflecting its collaborative ethos, funding for the Institute is highly integrated. Led by The Atlantic Philanthropies, funders include public bodies (the Health Research Board in the Republic of Ireland and the Public Health Agency in the Northern Ireland); charities (the Irish Hospice Foundation and the Irish Cancer Society); and the hospices, palliative care providers and universities that make up the consortium membership. This wide array of financial commitment reinforces the commonality of purpose of all those involved.</p>
<p>The fact that the activities of the Institute take place across two jurisdictions, with the aim of strengthening the co-ordination of research, education, policy and practice across them is of particular significance within the context of the European Union. We aim to provide a template of what can be done to promote the best of palliative care through cross-border cooperation. The Institute is committed to building international links. Our Expert Advisory Board and Panel of Expert Collaborators have strong international representation of leaders in the field. It is my earnest hope that more researchers, policy makers and practitioners from around the globe will join us in this unique initiative to move forward palliative care in an integrated and collaborative manner.</p>
