<title>SPTS Members Receive APTA’s Highest Honors</title>
<p>At PT 2012, several SPTS members were awarded recognition by the American Physical Therapy Association (APTA).</p>
<p>The highest honor was presented to Kevin E. Wilk, PT, DPT, former president of the SPTS, who was named a Catherine Worthingham Fellow of the APTA.</p>
<p>Wilk has made numerous professional contributions in the areas of sports physical therapy clinical practice, education, research, and advocacy.</p>
<p>As present vice president of education and associate clinical director for Physiotherapy Associates and Champion Sports Medical/Physiotherapy Clinic in Birmingham, Alabama, Wilk is also a rehabilitation consultant for the Tampa Bay Devil Rays baseball team and director of rehabilitation research for American Sports Institute, also in Birmingham. Past posts have included vice president of education for Champion Sports Medicine/Benchmark Medical, and co-owner/codirector of Champion Sports Medicine, both in Birmingham. Wilk earned his DPT from Massachusetts General Health Institute and his BS in physical therapy from Northwestern University Medical School Programs in Physical Therapy.</p>
<p>In his role as full-time clinician, known nationally and internationally for his expertise and skill in treating patients, Wilk has worked with many of the most famous professional and collegiate athletes in the United States. Widely recognized as an expert in rehabilitation after injury to the knee or shoulder, Wilk integrates the best available evidence with his clinical experience and expertise to provide the best care for individual patients. The guidelines and standards he has developed—including the Throwers 10 exercise program and Short Toss–Long Toss program for return to throwing for patients with shoulder and elbow complaints—have been adopted by other PTs and have influenced the care of sports patients worldwide. Wilk’s research includes reports of clinical outcome after thermal capsulorrhaphy, published in the <italic>Journal of Orthopaedic &amp; Sports Physical Therapy</italic>, for which he received the 2002 Breg Award for Excellence in Sports Physical Therapy Research.</p>
<p>Wilk has contributed to education through his service in the SPTS as president, vice president, and program chair and coordinator of the section’s home study courses. For more than 20 years, Wilk has held responsibility for planning and organizing the educational content for the SPTS at the Combined Sections Meeting, the Physical Therapy Section, and the AOSSM. He has presented at professional society and continuing education meetings and is a regular presenter at APTA’s Combined Sections Meeting and Annual Conference. As coordinator of the SPTS’s Home Study Courses, Wilk served as the guest editor for the <italic>Journal of Orthopaedic &amp; Sports Physical Therapy</italic> 5 times. Wilk has published over 100 articles in peer-reviewed journals and has edited or written 5 textbooks.</p>
<p>Kevin Wilk will be a speaker at the 2012 Team Concept Conference in Las Vegas.</p>
