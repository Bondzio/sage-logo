<abstract>
<p>The Patient Safety Indicator postoperative respiratory failure (PRF) flags cases using <italic>International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification</italic> (<italic>ICD-9-CM</italic>) codes for acute respiratory failure or mechanical ventilation/intubation. The authors examined how frequently PRF missed events and ways to improve event identification. A total of 125 high-risk unflagged cases were selected based on predicted probability and presence of clinically relevant codes. False-negative (FN) proportion and associated reasons were determined through chart review, and likelihood ratios (LRs) of associated codes were calculated. In all, 27% of elective cases were FNs; 55% of FNs lacked ventilation/intubation codes. “Respiratory arrest,” 799.1, had the highest LR (5.4) but occurred in only 8% of FNs. All other individual diagnostic or procedure codes had relatively low LRs (≤3.1), despite occurring in up to 36% of FNs. Among high-risk cases, the PRF algorithm often missed events. Improved ventilation/intubation coding will have more of an impact on case identification than adding <italic>ICD-9-CM</italic> codes to the algorithm.</p>

<body>
<p>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Patient Safety Indicators (PSIs) use hospital administrative data to detect potentially preventable inpatient adverse events.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1062860612468482">1</xref></sup> They were originally intended as screens for patient safety problems, highlighting areas requiring further investigation, rather than as definitive measures. However, based on evidence of their validity to date, the National Quality Forum has endorsed several PSIs as hospital performance measures, and so far, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has added 6 individual PSIs and a composite PSI to its hospital quality reporting initiative.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1062860612468482">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1062860612468482"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1062860612468482">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>The growing use of PSIs as performance measures requires users to understand their strengths and limitations. PSIs were developed using a consensus panel of clinical experts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1062860612468482">1</xref></sup> Hospital-level rates of several PSIs, especially those representing postoperative complications, are positively correlated,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1062860612468482">5</xref></sup> and occurrence of PSIs is associated with excess hospitalization days, hospital costs, and in-hospital deaths.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1062860612468482">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1062860612468482">7</xref></sup> However, relatively little is known about the “criterion validity” of these indicators (ie, their agreement with medical record review). In previous Veterans Health Administration (VA) work, the authors determined how well 10 of the 17 adult PSI algorithms identified true events (ie, their positive predictive value [PPV]) using a medical record review.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1062860612468482">8</xref></sup> However, relatively little is known about how often any of the PSIs miss true events.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1062860612468482">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1062860612468482">10</xref></sup> This is essential given the current public reporting and pay-for-performance climate (eg, higher-performing hospitals may not actually provide better care but may be undercoding events).</p>
<p>This study focuses on PSI 11, postoperative respiratory failure (PRF). Previous analysis of this indicator by AHRQ investigators and the authors’ group revealed that PRF has among the highest PPVs (especially in the non-VA setting) and the lowest rate of present-on-admission cases of all the PSIs. In the non-VA setting, PRF had a PPV of 83%; this was slightly lower in the VA (67%), mainly because of difficulty in accurately identifying nonelective admissions using VA data. The PPV would have been 88% if nonelective admissions were included.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1062860612468482">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1062860612468482">12</xref></sup> Present on admission rates were 0.8% in the non-VA and 0% in the VA setting. PRF was added as an individual measure for public reporting to CMS’ Hospital Compare Web site and pay-for-reporting initiative as of 2012.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1062860612468482">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1062860612468482">13</xref></sup> (However, CMS is proposing to remove this and 4 other individual PSIs starting in 2013 in order to decrease overlap with other measures.)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1062860612468482">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the current study, the authors examined the proportion of false-negative (FN) cases in a population deemed to be at high risk for this PSI in the VA. To determine how to improve detection of true events using the PSI algorithm, they also examined reasons for missed cases and the potential impact of adding specific <italic>International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification</italic> (<italic>ICD-9-CM</italic>) codes to identify this complication.</p>

<title>Study Design</title>
<p>This was a retrospective cross-sectional study using VA administrative and electronic medical record (EMR) data from October 1, 2002, to September 30, 2007. Institutional review board approvals were obtained from the Bedford VA Medical Center and the VA Boston Healthcare System.</p>

<title>Data Sources</title>
<p>The authors used hospital discharge information (ie, demographics, <italic>ICD-9-CM</italic> coded diagnoses and procedures, and discharge status) from the VA’s National Patient Care Database.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1062860612468482">15</xref></sup> Per prior PSI work, nonacute care (eg, long-term care) was eliminated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1062860612468482">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1062860612468482">16</xref></sup> EMR data were accessed using VistAWeb, a program enabling centralized access to EMR data from all VA facilities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1062860612468482">17</xref></sup></p>

<title>PRF Definition</title>
<p>The numerator requires either a secondary diagnosis code for acute respiratory failure or an intubation or mechanical ventilation procedure code occurring at a specific time in relation to a major operation. The denominator excludes discharges for which the condition was present on admission or for which a tracheostomy procedure was the only procedure or was performed prior to the first operation. It further excludes patients with major respiratory or circulatory disorders, based on their principal diagnosis, as well as nonelective hospitalizations because complications in these patients are less likely to be preventable (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1062860612468482">Table 1</xref> shows the full PRF definition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1062860612468482">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1062860612468482">18</xref></sup>). Unlike nonfederal databases that include an admission type, VA data lack such a variable. (Neither source includes a surgery status field; admission type is intended as a proxy for surgery status.) Thus, an algorithm characterizing admission type using diagnosis-related groups, admission date and time, and principal procedure date and time was developed in prior VA work.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1062860612468482">16</xref></sup></p>

<title>Study Sample</title>
<p>Case identification involved several steps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1062860612468482">Figure 1</xref>). First, the authors applied the AHRQ PSI software (v.3.1.a) to the hospital discharge file and excluded discharges that flagged positive for PRF (n = 2850). Second, the VA-wide pool of surgical discharges at risk of PRF were identified based on specific PSI denominator criteria (n = 198 342); this was restricted to presumed elective admissions identified using criteria developed by Rivard et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1062860612468482">16</xref></sup> Third, because abstracting the entire pool of missed cases was not possible, the authors selected cases deemed to be at higher risk for PRF as follows: (1) scores representing the predicted probability of developing PRF were derived from a logistic regression model that included age, sex, diagnosis-related groups, and selected comorbidities from the current admission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1062860612468482">19</xref></sup>; (2) a list of diagnostic (eg, 799.02, hypoxemia) and procedure codes (eg, 93.90, noninvasive mechanical ventilation) derived by AHRQ clinician-investigators were used that were considered more likely to be present in FN cases (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1062860612468482">Table 2</xref>; P. Romano, MD, personal e-mail communication, December 10, 2009). The authors selected 125 cases with the highest prediction scores out of the 2066 cases that had at least 1 of the listed codes.</p>

<title>Medical Record Abstraction</title>
<p>Two trained nurse-abstractors reviewed EMRs using a standardized abstraction instrument developed for the PPV review.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1062860612468482">12</xref></sup> The instrument included initial questions about ascertainment of the event, including exclusions. For all cases, reviewers were advised to document the codes that resulted in the discharge being included in the sample and provide a brief clinical scenario describing the circumstances of any respiratory complications. If a case was deemed a true negative (TN), abstraction ceased. Study physicians (AMB, MC) reviewed cases for clarification as required throughout the abstraction process.</p>
<p>Because abstractors were familiar with the abstraction tool and had previously achieved high interrater reliability,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1062860612468482">12</xref></sup> especially with respect to case ascertainment (100% agreement on the interrater sample), interrater reliability was not assessed in the current study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1062860612468482">
<title>Analyses</title>
<p>Cases were categorized as FNs or TNs based on abstracted information. Initially, this was done by applying a clinical definition of PRF. This consisted of the following: (1) cases that underwent an unplanned intubation or ongoing ventilation, either mechanical or noninvasive; (2) cases that had an acute deterioration in respiratory status that necessitated an emergent invasive procedure, such as a tracheotomy or a chest tube placement; or (3) cases that normally would have been intubated but had “do not resuscitate” or “do not intubate” orders. Study clinicians reviewed all abstracted information in detail.</p>
<p>Clinicians rereviewed EMRs of cases not initially identified as FNs but that received any intubation/ventilation codes, mechanical or noninvasive (n = 22), that showed a deterioration in respiratory status that necessitated transfer to a higher level of care but were not intubated (n = 10) or that had a respiratory arrest code (799.1; n = 3). This was done to determine whether any of these fit the authors’ clinical definition of acute respiratory failure, and to better understand why they were not flagged by the PSI. One of the study clinicians (AMB) initially reviewed these cases and eliminated 23 of them as not fitting the clinical definition. The remaining 12 were then independently reviewed by another clinician (MC). Clinicians agreed that all 12 of these cases fit the clinical definition.</p>
<p>The authors then calculated the proportion of FNs (ie, FNs/all unflagged cases) and associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) based on the clinical definition. To determine whether any particular codes or combination of codes might be added to the existing PSI algorithm to increase identification of true events, the authors calculated likelihood ratios (LRs) of associated codes (ie, how likely a code was to occur in a FN vs a TN) from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1062860612468482">Table 2</xref>. A LR greater than 1.0 indicates that the code is more likely to occur in a FN; a LR less than 1.0 indicates that the code is less likely to occur in a FN. LRs greater than 10 are considered high and provide strong evidence in favor of a true event.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1062860612468482">20</xref></sup> LRs of 5 to 10 are considered moderate. For cases with a noninvasive ventilation code (93.90), the authors also examined the impact on the LR of excluding cases with an accompanying <italic>ICD-9-CM</italic> diagnosis code of obstructive sleep apnea as presumed nonevents. Although nonelective admissions are intended to be excluded per the PSI algorithm, because the authors were interested in identifying possible codes related to respiratory failure, they initially retained any misidentified nonelective admissions. All calculations were then repeated with nonelective cases removed from the sample.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The high-risk sample of 125 PRF cases was drawn from 59 of a possible 158 acute care hospitals, with a median of 2.5 cases per hospital (range 1-13). Of these, 38 cases or 30% were FNs (95% CI = 23%-39%). Excluding the 32 cases with nonelective admissions resulted in a similar FN proportion of 27% (95% CI = 18%-37%). (Because results were similar in analyses that included nonelectives compared with electives, results primarily for cases with elective admissions are presented in the text that follows.)</p>

<title>Reasons for False Negatives</title>
<p>Of the 25 elective FNs, more than half (56%, n = 14) represented cases that underwent unplanned reintubation or ongoing mechanical ventilation; 9 (35%) underwent noninvasive ventilation; the remaining 2 were on the verge of respiratory arrest and required emergent tracheostomy or chest tube placement. (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1062860612468482">Table 3</xref> shows results for both the elective sample and the full sample, including nonelective admissions. Clinical reasons were identical when including nonelectives, except that there also was a small proportion [n = 4; 11%] who experienced acute respiratory failure but were not reintubated because of “do not resuscitate” or “do not intubate” orders.)</p>

<p>Most of these cases (10 among elective admissions and 16 among all PRF FNs) were missing any intubation/mechanical ventilation codes.

<p>Of the 14 reintubated/ventilated cases, 10 (71%) lacked any intubation or ventilation codes; these were clearly coding errors. Of the 4 with codes, 3 cases had reintubation codes appropriately assigned to the day of the index operation; the fourth case had an inappropriate intubation code assigned to the day of the surgery but an appropriate intubation code from postoperative day 3. In the former circumstance, the timing of the reintubation code excludes the patient per the PSI algorithm (the code has to occur ≥1 day after the major operation); in the latter case, the PSI software program is set up such that it considers only the earliest intubation/ventilation procedure code. If the timing of that code is inappropriate, the case does not get flagged; the program does not look for codes that occur later, even if appropriately timed.</p>
<p>Of note, 3 of the 9 (33%) FNs undergoing noninvasive ventilation lacked appropriate codes (eg, they lacked a 93.90 code). Additionally, 2 FNs missing mechanical ventilation codes were incorrectly assigned 93.90 codes; they received continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) strictly as a means of weaning from the ventilator.</p>

The most commonly occurring codes among FNs were 518.5 (pulmonary insufficiency postsurgery or trauma) and 93.90 (BiPAP or CPAP), seen in 32% and 36% of FNs respectively. The associated respective LRs were 3.11 and 2.72. Exclusion of cases with a 93.90 code and obstructive sleep apnea diagnosis code (780.53, 780.57 or 327.2x; seen in 2 FNs and 5 TNs) increased the LR slightly to 4.76. Only 2 individual codes or coding combinations had a LR &gt;5.0 (code 799.1, respiratory arrest, and the combination of 518.5 and 93.90). These represented at most 10% of FNs.

<title>Summary of Coding-Related Findings</title>
<p>This is the first study to the authors’ knowledge to report the proportion of FNs associated with the PSI PRF and to examine in-depth reasons for missed cases and potential codes that might be added to the PSI algorithm to improve identification of cases. The authors found that among cases at high risk for PRF, existing PSI algorithms frequently missed true events (~30% of the time).</p>
<p>Of note, the original definition of this PSI included only an acute respiratory failure diagnosis code. The intubation and ventilation codes were added based on an earlier VA study by members of the authors’ team that found that adding these procedure codes increased the sensitivity considerably from 19% to 63%, with no change in specificity (&gt;99.5% for both definitions and little change in PPV, 74% vs 68%).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1062860612468482">9</xref></sup> The requirement for an appropriately timed intubation/ventilation code is designed to favor specificity over sensitivity. Therefore, intubations occurring on the day of the operation are intentionally excluded to avoid capturing cases of preoperative intubation or incorrect coding of intubation associated with the index procedure. Similarly, cases that remain on the ventilator for less than 2 days postoperatively are excluded. The previous study represents the largest study reporting PRF sensitivity to date.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1062860612468482">9</xref></sup> The sensitivity of 63% is consistent with the current finding that true cases are still frequently missed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1062860612468482">9</xref></sup> (The proportion of FNs calculated from published numbers was 0.5% among this lower-risk sample).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1062860612468482">9</xref></sup> However, this earlier study did not include detailed analysis of missed cases.</p>
<p>Despite current algorithm restrictions, almost half of missed true cases in this study were caused by coding errors related to a lack of assigned intubation or mechanical ventilation codes. In fact, relatively few cases (12% of FNs with elective admissions or 8% of all FNs) were missed because of limitations of the PSI algorithm (these patients had postoperative intubations with code 96.04 occurring on the day of the operation). Although removing these timing restrictions would improve the detection of true cases slightly, the impact on PPV would require further study (ie, detection of false positives might increase).</p>
<p>In theory, these missed ventilated cases and the remaining FN cases could have been flagged based on an acute respiratory failure diagnosis code. However, coders either require this diagnosis to be explicitly documented or they may query clinicians if they suspect this diagnosis; it is unknown how often the latter scenario occurs. The earlier VA sensitivity study shows that many more cases were detected using procedure codes. The relative underuse of the diagnosis codes is also borne out by the previous chart review PPV study of flagged cases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1062860612468482">12</xref></sup>; the authors found that although the presence of this diagnosis had a high PPV for an event (94%, including nonelective admissions), only 45% of true cases were flagged based on this criterion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1062860612468482">12</xref></sup> (Of all cases, 58% were flagged based on a procedure code alone, and 12% were flagged based on a diagnosis code alone. Equivalent numbers from a similar non-VA study were 45% and 22%, respectively.)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1062860612468482">11</xref></sup> Hence there is a need to determine whether adding new codes, especially diagnostic codes, could help identify events.</p>
<p>Although certain individual codes seem to have good face validity as candidate codes for addition to the existing PSI algorithm to improve identification of true events, few provided much value. Those that occurred relatively frequently (~30% of FNs) had LRs in the 2.5 to 3.1 range (ie, 518.5 or 93.90) at most. Although all these would increase identification of true events (ie, sensitivity), the relatively low positive LRs suggest that this would occur at the expense of identifying many false-positive events, thereby decreasing specificity and PPV. Conversely, a few individual codes or combinations of codes (ie, 799.1, and 518.5 plus 93.90) had LRs greater than 5 but occurred in less than 5% of the entire sample and in at most 10% of FNs, suggesting that the benefit of adding these to the algorithm would be minimal.</p>
<p>Through PSI user feedback, AHRQ investigators have identified a problem with some of the current diagnostic codes related to respiratory complications and proposed modifications to the <italic>ICD-9-CM</italic> Coordination and Maintenance Committee that have recently been approved (P. Romano, MD, e-mail communication, March 11, 2011). A recent non-VA study also has highlighted the potential ambiguity and coder confusion associated with the use of these codes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1062860612468482">21</xref></sup> For example, acute respiratory failure, if occurring postoperatively, may be coded as 518.81 but also may be “indexed” to the less specific 518.5 code (pulmonary insufficiency following trauma and surgery). Therefore, new fifth digit codes have been added to 518.5 to distinguish postoperative acute respiratory failure from less serious postoperative respiratory complications; existing acute respiratory failure codes 518.81 and 518.84 have been modified such that these codes will explicitly exclude complications occurring following surgery or trauma. The impact of these changes on identification of events remains to be seen but should help improve identification of true PRF events.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1062860612468482">
<title>Study Strengths</title>
<p>As noted, this is the first study in any setting (that the authors are aware of) to examine in detail reasons for missed cases and potential ways to improve this indicator. In addition, study clinicians independently rereviewed all cases suspicious for an acute respiratory failure event that were not intubated and agreed 100% on additional FN cases. Furthermore, the authors’ method of case selection was designed to maximize the yield of finding FNs because they were essentially looking for a “needle in a haystack” (the national VA-observed rate of PRF for the study period was 14.2 per 1000 surgical discharges at risk). The 27% to 30% FN proportion suggests that the authors were successful in identifying a high-risk group and that similar methods may be applied to other PSIs. In fact, these results are similar to a recently conducted study using comparable methods to identify missed cases of another publicly reported surgical PSI, postoperative wound dehiscence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1062860612468482">10</xref></sup> In that study, the authors also found a significant portion of FNs (32% to 43% depending on the clinical definition used). Likewise, they found that relevant procedures were frequently undercoded and concluded that coder training, as well as adding more specific diagnostic codes, would have the most impact on improving true event identification.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1062860612468482">10</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1062860612468482">
<title>Study Limitations</title>
<p>Although the authors previously reported on PPV of the PSI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1062860612468482">12</xref></sup> and report on NPV herein, combining these samples to calculate sensitivity or specificity would not be meaningful because only a limited pool of high-risk cases were abstracted that were not flagged by the PSI algorithm in the current study. Identifying and abstracting an adequately representative sample of suitable size to enable a valid assessment of sensitivity and specificity would vastly exceed available time and manpower resources. Nevertheless, this analysis still reveals some important lessons with respect to how to improve identification of the PSI.</p>
<p>Also, as noted in prior PPV studies by the authors and others, although the PSI is intended to identify events representing potential quality of care problems, it is difficult to draw any conclusions as to the number of preventable cases from a retrospective chart review.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1062860612468482">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1062860612468482">12</xref></sup> A detailed review of this issue is outside the scope of the current study. It is not known how applicable these findings are to the non-VA setting, given that a surprising number of the patients were missing intubation/ventilation codes. The authors would expect this to occur less frequently in a health care setting more dependent on reimbursements. (A similar study is being conducted by AHRQ investigators in the non-VA setting [P. Romano, MD, oral communication, December 10, 2009].) The study does not have sufficient numbers to examine facility-level variation in coding practices.</p>
<p>Finally, although the study findings and conclusions are based on the <italic>ICD-9-CM</italic> system, <italic>International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification</italic>, which is supposed to be implemented in the United States starting in late 2014, contains similar codes, and equivalent diagnostic coding changes have been made in this system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1062860612468482">21</xref></sup> Furthermore, most of the missed cases were related to missing procedure codes, which would not be affected by the coding system used.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1062860612468482">
<title>Summary</title>
<p>Among cases at high risk for PRF, existing PSI algorithms frequently missed true events. Although the authors found that coding errors were relatively infrequent in their prior work identifying true positives,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1062860612468482">12</xref></sup> in the current study, coding errors were the most frequent cause of missed cases. Certain individual <italic>ICD-9-CM</italic> codes or code combinations had higher LRs for capturing true events, but these occurred in only a small portion of cases and are unlikely to significantly improve the sensitivity of the algorithm without compromising specificity. Coder training to improve coding of postoperative intubation/mechanical ventilation would have the greatest impact on identification of events. Education also is needed regarding appropriate noninvasive ventilation coding because the analysis revealed some confusion by coders with regard to how to apply these codes. Improved provider documentation of postoperative acute respiratory events and perhaps increased querying of providers by coders with respect to clarification of diagnoses also may help. All these methods will facilitate local quality improvement efforts as well as ensure fair comparisons across facilities with respect to PRF rates.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Despite the high PPV of the PRF PSI algorithm, the relatively high proportion of FNs suggests that publicly reported rates should be interpreted with caution. Lower rates at a given hospital may reflect undercoding of events as opposed to better provision of care by that hospital. The impact of pending <italic>ICD-9-CM</italic> diagnostic modifications on event identification also will require further study.</p>
