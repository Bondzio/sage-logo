<abstract>
<p>To assess the awareness and acceptability of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening in noncompliant Singaporeans and to determine if their barriers can be overcome by education. A questionnaire developed from thematic analysis of open-ended interviews with 72 subjects was administered to 580 residents in a local high-rise housing estate. Participants aware of CRC screening were assessed for barriers and acceptability of CRC screening. All participants were subsequently educated about CRC screening and reassessed for barriers and acceptance. Those keen for fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) were offered FOBT kits and followed up. CRC screening awareness was poor. Having no symptoms was the most common barrier. More barriers to FOBT than to colonoscopy were reduced with education. After education, acceptability toward FOBT increased but rejection rates rose even higher. FOBT is probably Singapore’s most acceptable screening modality. Education is limited by barriers, which need to be overcome by alternative measures.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>With an average of 1455 cases reported per annum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1010539511399119">1</xref></sup> and 580 deaths per year,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1010539511399119">2</xref></sup> colorectal cancer (CRC) accounts for significant mortality and is the most common cancer among men and women in Singapore. Early detection with prompt intervention is currently the most effective method of reducing CRC-related mortality given that the disease runs a protracted course, with lesions typically progressing from premalignant to malignant over a prolonged period, and the 5-year survival rate decreasing from 80% to 95% in stage I to less than 7% in stage IV disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1010539511399119">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Unfortunately, stage I disease suffers from a paucity of symptoms and the majority (71.5%) of lesions are only detected after local invasion or distant metastasis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1010539511399119">4</xref></sup> Screening is currently the only means of circumventing this problem, and many different modalities exist, with fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) and colonoscopy being the mainstays in Singapore. The effectiveness of FOBT in reducing CRC associated mortality has been substantiated by several large-scale randomized control trials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1010539511399119">5</xref></sup> On the other hand, colonoscopy, although endowed with higher sensitivity and specificity rates and proven to improve diagnostic rates of premalignant and malignant lesions,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1010539511399119">6</xref></sup> suffers from a lack of evidence with regards to its ability as a screening tool<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1010539511399119">7</xref></sup> to reduce CRC-associated mortality.</p>
<p>The superiority of either colonoscopy or FOBT is currently the subject of much debate,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1010539511399119">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1010539511399119"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1010539511399119">7</xref></sup> and it is thus perhaps more prudent to suggest that local circumstances, especially the relative acceptability of one over the other, should dictate which modality be preferentially instituted in any community. In Singapore, although both FOBT and colonoscopy are currently available, screening remains largely opportunistic and no concerted effort has been made to encourage the local population to undergo regular screening (only 3.8% of the target population undergoes FOBT at the correct frequency and only 11.2% have ever had a colonoscopy).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1010539511399119">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>There is currently a lack of studies that attempt to discern which modality is more acceptable to the Singaporean population or the barriers that prevent the initiation and maintenance of regular screening. Our study thus seeks to determine, among the underscreened population, the awareness of CRC screening, the acceptability of CRC screening by either colonoscopy or FOBT, the barriers to screening for each modality, and the effectiveness of education in overcoming these barriers and increasing acceptance.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1010539511399119" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>We conducted a community-based cross-sectional study of persons living within a residential estate in central Singapore. The estate consists mainly of public high-rise Housing Development Board apartments, which constitute 85.1% of all housing units in Singapore.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1010539511399119">9</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="section3-1010539511399119">
<title>Study Population</title>
<p>We randomly selected 2804 out of 5078 household units (HHU) and conducted door-to-door interviews on eligible subjects. If an eligible subject was unavailable at the time of interview, a separate visit was arranged. If all eligible members of a HHU were not contactable on 3 separate occasions (over at least 1 weekend), the HHU was replaced with another randomly selected one.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1010539511399119">
<title>Eligibility Criteria</title>
<p>As we aimed to survey the local underscreened population, the eligibility criteria for our study were as follows: participants had to be (1) either Singaporean or Permanent Resident, (2) aged 50 years or older, and (3) non-concordant with CRC screening frequency as stipulated in the Ministry of Health clinical practice guidelines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1010539511399119">10</xref></sup> Participants with a history of cancer or a previous colectomy were excluded, as they were more likely to have a greater general awareness of CRC and CRC screening.</p>

<title>Survey Procedures</title>
<sec id="section6-1010539511399119">
<title>Questionnaire development</title>
<p>We used an exploratory sequential design mixed methods approach to assess the awareness, perceived barriers and acceptance of participants to CRC screening.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1010539511399119">11</xref></sup> In the first (qualitative) phase of this study, we explored awareness of and common barriers to CRC screening by means of in-depth interviews using a semistructured open-ended interview guide with 3 probing questions administered to 72 purposively sampled individuals who fulfilled the above eligibility criteria. Interviews were recorded verbatim and transcribed into English if necessary.</p>
<p>We then performed thematic analysis to explore key findings (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1010539511399119">Table 1</xref>). Based on these results and literature reviews of previous studies on common barriers to CRC screening,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1010539511399119">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1010539511399119"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1010539511399119"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1010539511399119"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1010539511399119"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1010539511399119"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1010539511399119">18</xref></sup> a questionnaire was developed for the second (quantitative) phase (available on request). This questionnaire was translated into the other 3 main languages of our multiethnic country (ie, Malay, Chinese, and Tamil) to minimize translation errors and variation during interviews.</p>

<title>Questionnaire Administration</title>
<sec id="section8-1010539511399119">
<title>Assessing knowledge</title>
<p>To assess participants’ awareness of CRC screening, we asked (1) whether they were aware of any CRC screening modalities; (2) if yes, which specific modalities of screening (ie, FOBT or colonoscopy) they were aware of; (3) what was the appropriate age to begin screening; and (4) what was the correct frequency of screening for the modality they named. We defined awareness of CRC screening as participants answering question (1) positively and being able to answer question (2) correctly (ie, name or describe at least one specific modality of CRC screening without prompting by interviewers).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1010539511399119">
<title>Assessing barriers and stage of adoption</title>
<p>To explore the reasons behind participants’ abstinence from screening, common barriers derived from thematic analysis, including 10 common to both modalities, 1 specific to FOBT (fecal aversion) and 3 specific to colonoscopy (discomfort, embarrassment, and fear of complications arising from screening) were featured in the questionnaire. Acceptance of each screening modality was assessed by means of the precaution adoption process model (PAPM),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1010539511399119">19</xref></sup> of which only the first 6 of its 7 stages were relevant to our study. Participants initially aware of CRC screening were assessed for PAPM stage and barriers both before and after educational intervention. Barriers were not assessed in subjects initially unaware of CRC screening (ie, PAPM stage 1) before education, because it was not possible to perceive a barrier to action without having heard of that action before. Assessment of barriers and stage of adoption was repeated for all subjects after a standardized educational package, to determine changes in barrier prevalence and PAPM stage brought about by this intervention.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1010539511399119">
<title>Educational Intervention</title>
<p>We developed a face-to-face standardized educational package (see the <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1010539511399119">appendix</xref>) using public educational materials adapted to the local context from the Singapore Health Promotion Board and Singapore Cancer Society (SCS). Topics covered in our educational package included the epidemiology of CRC in Singapore, the rationale behind Ministry of Health CRC screening recommendations (eg, early detection reduces mortality and morbidity) and details of CRC screening procedures (ie, recommended frequency and details on performance of FOBT and colonoscopy) and the estimated cost. This package was also translated into the other 3 languages.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1010539511399119">
<title>Fecal Occult Blood Testing</title>
<p>Participants who responded positively to FOBT (ie, PAPM stage 5 [decided to go for it] and stage 6 [have gone for it and will do so in the future]) were offered a pair of free immunohistochemical FOBT (i-FOBT) kits (OC Auto-Micro 80, PolymedCo Inc, Cortlandt Manor, NY) Participants who accepted were taught the procedure in greater detail using SCS brochures with photographic instructions. Participants sealed their used i-FOBT kit in a resealable bag and posted it to SCS in a prepaid preaddressed envelope for analysis. The deadline for submission of i-FOBT kits was 5 months after the survey.</p>
<p>A summary flowchart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1010539511399119">Figure 1</xref>) shows the conduct of the study. Ethics approval was obtained from the National University of Singapore Institutional Review Board and participants’ informed consent was obtained.</p>

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Data collected was entered directly into SPSS, Version 16.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL), with 3 rounds of independent data cleaning to maximize data fidelity. We used χ<sup>2</sup> analysis to determine the sociodemographic factors associated with awareness of CRC screening modalities, the effects of having a primary care doctor on FOBT awareness, as well as the barriers associated with failure to submit samples after receipt of i-FOBT kits. McNemar’s test was used to analyze the difference in acceptability of FOBT and colonoscopy and the barriers resulting in this difference, as well as the change in barriers of each screening modality before and after education. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine the predictors of CRC screening awareness and those barriers associated with failure to submit FOBT samples after the receipt of i-FOBT kits. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS, and statistical significance was set at <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05 and 95% confidence intervals were reported.</p>

<title>Sociodemographic Characteristics</title>
<p>Of the 2084 randomly selected HHU, 655 residents were eligible, with 580 (88.5%) eventual participants and 75 (11.5%) refusals. A total of 247 (42.6%) of the participants were younger than 60 years, and males comprised 42.1% of the study population. Those of Chinese ethnicity accounted for 87.5% of the study population. Overall, 421 (72.5%) of the participants were married; 311 (53.6%) lived in Housing Development Board apartments with 3 rooms or less; 361 (62.2%) had an education level that was equivalent to 6 years of formal education or less; and 368 (63.4%) visited a regular primary care doctor.</p>

<sec id="section15-1010539511399119">
<title>Knowledge of CRC Screening</title>
<p>Awareness of CRC screening in our study population was generally low: Only 117 out of 580 (20.2%) of subjects were aware of at least one screening modality and merely 4.5% (26 out of 580) were aware of the correct age to start screening. Only 12 out of 68 (17.6%) of those aware of FOBT as a screening modality and four out of 89 (4.5%) of those aware of colonoscopy knew the correct frequency at which to perform it.</p>
<p>On bivariate analysis, older age, male gender, non-Chinese ethnicity, and low educational levels were associated with low awareness of CRC screening (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1010539511399119">Table 2</xref>). On multivariate analysis, independent predictors of low awareness included male gender (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 0.35 [0.22-0.57], <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), non-Chinese ethnicity (adjusted OR = 0.25 [0.10-0.63], <italic>P</italic> = .004), and low educational levels (6 years of education or less; adjusted OR = 0.40 [0.25-0.62], <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>A lack of awareness of CRC screening is highly prevalent in our study population. After education, participants were more receptive to FOBT than colonoscopy. Education was also more effective in overcoming barriers for FOBT, especially with regards to financial and knowledge barriers, although barriers could not be completely removed for either modality. The top barriers remaining after education included the misconception that a lack of bowel-related symptoms obviates the need for screening, inconvenience, a fatalistic attitude and a fear of diagnosis. Of note, the latter 2 barriers were also resistant to change with education. Our offer of free i-FOBT kits to participants who had responded positively to FOBT after education was moderately successful with nearly half eventually submitting at least one sample.</p>
<p>The profound lack of awareness of CRC screening and its modalities among the underscreened (79.8%) is probably the main reason for the exceedingly low screening rates in Singapore. This suggests that current means of promoting CRC awareness may be inadequate and that concerted and proactive efforts need to be made to increase the local awareness of CRC screening. Non-Chinese, males and those with low education levels were most unaware of screening and we suggest that educational efforts be emphasized on these particular groups.</p>
<p>The education session administered was able to improve FOBT acceptance from 1.7% to 33.0%, suggesting that future education programs on a larger scale may achieve similar success rates. However, alongside this increment in acceptance was an even greater increase in rejection (3.1% to 51.0%), reflecting the limitations of a brief educative process in driving home key messages about screening and the limited effect that educational intervention exerts on barriers to FOBT. This group of subjects may be too resistant to CRC screening for a population-based program such as ours and may need a more personalized approach such as personalized patient education by their own primary care physicians.</p>
<p>Among the barriers to FOBT, “no symptoms” and “inconvenience” are the barriers most prevalent yet susceptible to change with education, hence emphasis on the need to undergo screening despite having no bowel-related symptoms and on the fact that FOBT can be self-administered may be effective in overcoming them. We also recommend that primary care physicians be recruited to actively promote and disseminate CRC screening information as supported by our results, other studies citing physician recommendation as a major factor in determining whether a patient undergoes screening<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1010539511399119">7</xref></sup> and the fact that the majority of our study population (63.4%) had a regular primary care physician.</p>
<p>A previous randomized controlled trial demonstrated the effectiveness of a decision aid comprising of a video on screening and a brochure tailored to participants’ readiness to change in increasing adoption.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1010539511399119">20</xref></sup> Computer-based interactive sessions have also been demonstrated to improve cancer screening rates more than noninteractive video or brochure-based educative methods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1010539511399119">21</xref></sup> and may be considered in our local setting.</p>
<p>Auxiliary measures to supplement a strong educational program could include mailing kits to subjects to reduce inconvenience and the adoption of regular reminder systems, both of which have shown to improve screening rates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1010539511399119">7</xref></sup> The mailing of kits directly to participants, especially, is likely to have a positive impact on screening rates, as our results show that participants who cited “lack of reminders” as a barrier were more likely to submit at least one FOBT sample when directly offered the test kit than those who did not. This strongly suggests that this barrier is likely to be easily overcome with direct distribution of FOBT kits to eligible subjects.</p>
<p>The greatest challenges in improving FOBT acceptance rates are the highly prevalent education-resistant barriers, namely “fear of diagnosis” and “fatalistic attitude,” which are especially prevalent among the Chinese and represent deeply entrenched sociocultural attitudes that are extremely resistant to change. In the case of “fear of diagnosis,” our results demonstrate that even with the elimination of inconvenience by means of direct distribution of FOBT kits, a fear of diagnosis was still a major barrier that determined who eventually underwent screening. This suggests that although protocols may be streamlined and screening actively promoted, uptake rates may plateau without the correction of this misconception. Evidence of effective methods to overcome these social barriers is available but nevertheless scant. A study by Sung et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1010539511399119">12</xref></sup> has shown the feasibility of using lay health advisors from existing community networks to allay the fears surrounding a diagnosis of cancer. Several studies have also shown success in overcoming cancer fatalism using culturally orientated faith-based interventions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1010539511399119">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1010539511399119"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1010539511399119">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>There are several limitations to this study. As the interviews were conducted by a group of 40 community health project team members, questionnaire administration could have resulted in inter-interviewer variability. However, we attempted to minimize this by standardizing our questioning and education. The presence of a control group for whom there would be no educational intervention would theoretically have been ideal to evaluate the susceptibility of participants’ barriers and PAPM stage to change pre- and postintervention. However, this was not feasible because asking the same questions to the same participant twice on one occasion ten minutes apart would be extremely awkward for both participant and interviewer. Participants’ replies on their receptiveness to screening could have been subject to a social desirability bias, but this was explored by determining the number of participants who ultimately submitted stool samples for testing.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this study reveals a great lack of awareness of CRC screening in the underscreened population and the value of an education program to overcome this deficit. FOBT appears to be the modality of choice for CRC screening as our results indicate marked preference of FOBT over colonoscopy among the general population. However, receptivity of FOBT after educational intervention remained low, highlighting the role of persistent barriers to FOBT as obstacles to FOBT uptake and the need to develop effective barrier-specific solutions to achieve optimal screening rates.</p>
