<abstract>
<p>Washington State has some of the highest percentages of school immunization exemptions in the country. We compared school immunization records in a rural school district in Pierce County, Washington, to immunization records in the state immunization information system (IIS) and parent-held records. Correcting school immunization records resulted in an increase in the number of students classified as fully immunized from 1,189 to 1,564 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001). We conducted school-based immunization clinics that increased the number of fully immunized students to 1,624 (<italic>p</italic> = .013). Immunized students with certificates of exemption on file suggest exemptions of convenience. Strategies to improve school immunization services include assigning IIS access to school administrative staff and educating school staff and parents on the importance of immunization.</p>

<body>
<p>Washington State has some of the highest percentages of school-aged children exempted from immunizations in the country. During the 2009-2010 school year, 5.7% of kindergarten students in Washington State were exempted from immunizations (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1059840512446069">CDC], 2011b</xref>). The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1059840512446069">CDC (2011a)</xref> estimated that between 2007 and 2008, 62.6% of children ages 19 to 35 months in Pierce County, Washington, were fully vaccinated, well below the Healthy People 2020 objective of 80% (U.S. Department of Health and Humans Services [DHHS], <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1059840512446069">2012</xref>). Data from Pierce County school districts for the 2010-2011 school year showed that 5.4% of children in kindergarten and 4.74% of kindergarten through Grade 12 students (K-12) were exempted from immunizations, with higher exemptions in rural districts than urban school districts (Tacoma-Pierce County Health Department [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1059840512446069">TPCHD], 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Several factors contribute to high exemption rates. Parental misconceptions or lack of knowledge about immunizations and concerns about vaccine safety increase the likelihood of immunization exemption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1059840512446069">Gust et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1059840512446069">Kennedy, Brown, &amp; Gust, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1059840512446069">Salmon et al., 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1059840512446069">Salmon et al. (2004</xref>) found that misperceptions about vaccine safety and efficacy, susceptibility and severity of vaccine preventable diseases, and negative beliefs and attitudes about vaccines held by school staff without formal health care training increased the likelihood that students would be exempted from immunizations.</p>
<p>Administrative factors can also play a role in immunization coverage. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1059840512446069">Rota et al. (2001</xref>) found that the percentage of children exempted from immunizations is inversely proportional to the complexity of obtaining an exemption. Prior to the 2011-2012 school year, obtaining a philosophical immunization exemption in Washington State required only a parent’s signature on a form available at the schools. Under these circumstances, obtaining a convenience exemption is easier than complying with school immunization laws (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1059840512446069">Calandrillo, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1059840512446069">Rota et al., 2001</xref>; Washington State Department of Health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1059840512446069">DOH], 2011a</xref>).</p>
<p>The purposes of this study were to assess the immunization coverage of students in a rural school district in Pierce County, assess the completeness of immunization records in the district, assess the effectiveness of strategies to improve school immunization record keeping, and assess the effectiveness of school-based immunization clinics at increasing immunization coverage. The principle investigators of this study were immunization nurse specialists from the Pierce County Infant Immunization Initiative (I3), a partnership between the Tacoma-Pierce County Health Department, MultiCare Health System, and Franciscan Health System, and supported by a grant from the Group Health Foundation.</p>
<sec id="section1-1059840512446069" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methodology</title>
<p>We selected a geographically large, rural school district in Pierce County with low immunization coverage and high percentages of immunization exemptions. This study was conducted in two phases: a review of immunization records and school-based immunization clinics. Baseline data were collected on February 18, 2010, from school records. Postintervention data for the two phases were collected on May 3 and May 27, 2010. We collected only aggregate data at each point of data collection and therefore could not evaluate longitudinal changes for individual students. We used Pearson χ<sup>2</sup> to statistically evaluate changes in immunization status.</p>
<sec id="section2-1059840512446069">
<title>Review of Immunization Records</title>
<p>We reviewed the school immunization records of children attending elementary, middle, and high schools in the district and classified each student’s immunization status according to the definitions in the Washington Administrative Code (DOH, 2009b):</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>
<bold>Complete</bold>: Received all required immunizations by Washington State with a signed certificate of immunization status (CIS) on file at the school.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<bold>Conditional</bold>: Has not received one or more required vaccines. Students may attend class for 30 days under a conditional status. At the end of the 30-day conditional period, state law requires schools to exclude from attendance students that have not received the required vaccines or are not making satisfactory progress toward completely immunized status.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<bold>Exempt</bold>: Exempted for medical, philosophical, or religious reasons, must have a certificate of exemption (COE) signed by a parent on file at the school.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<bold>Out of compliance</bold>: A child who does not meet the requirements of completely immunized, conditional, or exempt status. Washington State law requires schools to exclude out of compliance students from attendance.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>We also identified students who had not received hepatitis A and human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines, which are recommended by the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practice (ACIP) but not required by Washington State (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1059840512446069">CDC, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1059840512446069">DOH, 2009b</xref>).</p>
<p>We compared students’ school immunization records to their records in the Washington State Immunization Information System (IIS). Parents of students who were exempted from immunizations, admitted under conditional status, or were out of compliance were contacted by telephone by the I3 nurses or the school nurse who requested immunization records held by the parents, offered information about immunizations, and informed the parents of school-based immunization clinics that were conducted during the second phase of this study. We provided records of vaccine doses missing from students’ school immunization records to school administrative staff who corrected the school immunization records.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1059840512446069">
<title>School-Based Immunization Clinics</title>
<p>We conducted school-based immunization clinics in May 2010, offering all vaccines required by Washington State law for school entry as well as ACIP-recommended hepatitis A and HPV vaccines. We mailed customized packets to parents of students who were not completely immunized, which included information about required vaccines and ACIP-recommended vaccines, vaccine information statements (VIS), dates of school-based immunization clinics, and immunization consent forms. Parents were also notified of the immunization clinics by telephone. Immunization clinics were held both during and after school hours. Parents were invited to attend immunization clinics but were not required to attend.</p>

<sec id="section4-1059840512446069">
<title>Results</title>
<p>At baseline, the proportion of completely immunized students in the five schools in the district ranged from 7.8% to 82.2%. Out of a total of 2,052 students in the district, 1,189 (57.9%) were fully immunized (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1059840512446069">Table 1</xref>). The largest proportion of students whose records did not reflect completely immunized status was out of compliance (24.8%). By reconciling the school immunization records with IIS and parent-held immunization records, the proportion of students classified as completely immunized increased from 57.9% to 76.2% (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001). The proportion of students who were classified as out of compliance decreased from 24.8% of the total to 13.6%, immunization exemptions decreased from 10.5% to 7.9% (<italic>p</italic> = .005), and the proportion of students attending class under conditional status decreased from 6.8% to 2.2%. An additional 60 students achieved completely immunized status during our school-based immunization clinics, increasing the percentage of fully immunized students from 76.2% to 79.4% (<italic>p</italic> = .013).</p>

<p>We found several documentation requirements in the school immunization records that were frequently associated with failure to capture all of the vaccine antigens students had received and resulted in students being categorized as out of compliance. These included the requirement to document individual antigens in combination vaccines; for example, documenting receipt of each component of a measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine. Some students that had received pertussis-containing vaccines were documented as having received only diphtheria and tetanus toxoids. Receipt of the varicella component of combination vaccines or history of chickenpox infection was also not documented in some records. These errors were more common when the source of data was a printed record from a provider’s office than when a CIS generated by the IIS was used as the data source.</p>

<sec id="section5-1059840512446069">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Immunization coverage for students in this district was underrepresented in the schools’ records. While the increase in the percentage of completely immunized students from our school-based immunization clinics reached statistical significance, reconciling the schools’ immunization records with IIS and parent-held records had the greatest impact on the immunization status of students in the district. In our study, school administrative staff made student immunization records available to the I3 nurses who then reviewed those records. As part of a program to improve immunization coverage in Cincinnati, school health clerks conducted biannual audits of immunization records to identify students whose immunization status was not in compliance with state immunization laws (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1059840512446069">Toole &amp; Perry, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>In Washington State, school nurses may assign access to the IIS to school staff who are responsible for verifying and documenting students’ immunizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1059840512446069">DOH, 2011b</xref>). School staff may then retrieve students’ immunization records from the IIS and print CISs, which can then be signed by parents and placed on file. The administrative staff at the schools in this district reported that they had not been granted access to the IIS. We believe that assigning access to the IIS to school staff would improve the completeness of school immunization records and reduce the workload of school nurses.</p>
<p>Inadequate school nurse staffing can jeopardize school health programs, including immunizations. With support from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), the National Association of School Nurses (NASN) recommends a minimum ratio of one school nurse for every 750 students in the general population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1059840512446069">AAP Council on School Health, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1059840512446069">NASN, 2010</xref>). The Washington State Nursing Care Quality Assurance Commission and Office of Superintendent of Public <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1059840512446069">Instruction (2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1059840512446069">2006</xref>) recommend a ratio of one school nurse for every 1,500 students. In 2010, Washington State had an average student-to-school nurse ratio of 2,031 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1059840512446069">NASN, 2011</xref>). At our baseline data collection, there were 2,052 students in the district with one school nurse for all of the schools in the district.</p>
<p>The proportion of students in Pierce County exempted from immunizations varies between school districts. School nurses from districts with high immunization coverage and low exemption rates report receiving support to enforce state immunization laws from district superintendents and school principals (V. H. Gobeske, personal communication, January 24, 2012). In a survey of schools in four states, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1059840512446069">Salmon et al. (2005</xref>) found that immunization policies and procedures varied between schools, some of which were not in compliance with state immunization laws. Over 15% of the respondents in states that do not permit philosophical immunization exemptions reported accepting philosophical exemptions in their schools.</p>
<p>Because of the failure to record individual antigens in combination vaccines, we recommended changing the data entry fields in the schools’ immunization database to allow single entry for combination vaccines rather than requiring multiple entries for individual antigens. In 2008, the Washington State DOH revised the CIS form, removing the COE from the reverse side of the form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1059840512446069">DOH, 2009a</xref>). We received anecdotal reports that parents had been directed by school staff to sign an exemption form when a child’s immunization records were unavailable at the time of school registration. We recommended relocating the blank COE forms to less convenient locations on school premises to discourage school staff from directing parents to sign a COE rather than complete a CIS.</p>
<p>Most parents were receptive to information provided by the school nurse and immunization nurse specialists and were grateful for the school-based immunization clinics. A number of parents reported that they were unaware that their children needed vaccines. Some parents of students with COEs on file and parents of students classified as out of compliance had not submitted records that documented the student as completely immunized. School administrative staff were also receptive to the I3 nurses’ interventions and instruction regarding herd immunity and the risks of vaccine-preventable illnesses. With the goal of protecting children from disease, staff members were motivated to identify strategies to improve immunization coverage in the district. As the front line of enforcement of school immunization laws, school administrative staff are critical to improving compliance.</p>
<sec id="section6-1059840512446069">
<title>Strategies to Improve Immunization Coverage</title>
<p>School nurses play an integral role in achieving and maintaining high coverage of childhood immunizations. Educating parents, students, teachers, and school administrative staff about school immunization laws and the benefits of vaccines is a key strategy in improving compliance with state immunization laws (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1059840512446069">Grace, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1059840512446069">Kinne &amp; Bobo, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1059840512446069">Salmon et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Both parents and school administrative staff may be misinformed about vaccine safety and the value of vaccines in protecting the health of students and the health of their communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1059840512446069">Salmon et al. 2004</xref>). We found that parents were receptive to and appreciated personalized communication regarding required immunizations from the school nurse and immunization nurses. In a survey of school personnel in San Diego County, respondents reported that personalized communication with parents was one of their most effective strategies to improving compliance with state immunization laws (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1059840512446069">Linton et al., 2003</xref>). Salmon et al. recommended that parents’ primary contact for vaccine information should be school nurses and other health care professionals.</p>
<p>Although we cannot account for the disparity in immunization rates between rural districts and urban districts in Pierce County, several factors can contribute to low immunization rates. Barriers to immunization include lack of a medical home, clinic hours that conflict with a parent's work schedule, lack of transportation, and the cost of immunization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1059840512446069">Toole &amp; Perry, 2004</xref>). School-based immunization clinics improve access to immunizations for students whose parents may be unable to take time off from work to obtain immunizations (Toole &amp; Perry). Vaccines for Children (VFC) is a federal program that provides immunizations free of charge to persons under 19 years of age who meet eligibility requirements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1059840512446069">CDC, 2011c</xref>). In addition to the federal program, Washington State makes vaccines available to persons under 19 years of age who do not meet the VFC requirements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1059840512446069">DOH, 2011c</xref>). School nurses can assess students' access to immunizations and refer them to appropriate community resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1059840512446069">AAP Council on School Health, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1059840512446069">Grace, 2006</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section7-1059840512446069">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>A large proportion of immunizations received by students in the district were not captured in the schools’ immunization database. Reconciling the schools’ immunization database with IIS and parent-held immunization records resulted in significant improvement in the proportion of students documented as fully immunized. Although Washington State law permits school nurses to delegate access to the IIS to school staff, none of the staff at the schools in this district had been granted access to the system. School staff may use the IIS to generate CISs which can be signed by parents and placed in students’ records, reducing the number of errors of the types that we found. Although we did not collect data on the reasons for exemptions, data collected from the district at the end of the 2010-2011 school year indicated that 93% of immunization exemptions were for philosophical reasons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1059840512446069">TPCHD, 2011</xref>). Reports of school staff directing parents to complete COEs rather than submit immunization records, the ease with which philosophical exemptions could be obtained in Washington State, and the observation that reconciling the schools’ immunization records with IIS and parent-held immunization records resulted in a significant decrease in the number of exemption suggest that a substantial proportion of philosophical exemptions are convenience exemptions. These findings were used to successfully support a revision of immunization requirements in Washington State in 2011. Beginning July 2011, parents who wish to exempt their children from immunization for philosophical reasons are required to have a COE signed by a health care professional, documenting receipt of information on the benefits and risks of vaccines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1059840512446069">DOH, 2011a</xref>).</p>
<p>The percentage of immunization exemptions in this school district remains greater than that for Pierce County and Washington State even after our district-wide interventions. This suggests that other factors such as vaccine hesitancy and broader access issues may still be a factor for many parents. Further study is warranted to assess the nature of these factors; however, our work in this district suggests that providing training to school administrative staff and ensuring access to IIS and educating parents and school staff on the importance of immunizations can result in a substantial decrease in the number of philosophical exemptions to immunizations required for school entry.</p>
