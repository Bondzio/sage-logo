<abstract>
<p>The aim of this retrospective cross-sectional study was to assess vascular repair modalities and function in type IV ring finger replantations. Thirty-seven of 43 patients with complete ring avulsion amputations were replanted. After resection of the damaged arterial segments under microscopic magnification the arterial flow pattern was evaluated. The type of repair was chosen according to the adequacy of arterial flow and the defect between the vessels. The methods of bridging the arterial defect consisted of digital artery transfer from adjacent digit in 21 fingers, vein graft interposition in six fingers and end to end anastomosis in ten fingers. Thirty-one of the 37 fingers survived. The failures were due to four arterial and two venous insufficiencies. In our opinion, radical resection of damaged zones of vessels is important to evaluate the proximal flow pattern and decide which treatment modality is necessary for healthy vascular anastomosis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Despite the advances in microsurgical operations, replantation of totally amputated ring avulsion injuries is still a difficult problem owing to the extensive damage of vessels, nerves and skin. Many authors state that replantation of totally amputated ring avulsions is often unsuccessful because of the long segment of vascular damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753193411423877">Beris et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1753193411423877">Nissenbaum, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1753193411423877">Urbaniak et al., 1981</xref>). Furthermore, the extent of tissue damage is often difficult to assess, and suboptimal debridement and resection of the lacerated arteries are prone to lead to failure. Digital arteries are usually damaged at multiple levels and stretched vessels carry a high risk of intimal damage even though they may seem intact externally. The extent of the injury precludes direct repair of vessels after debridement. The use of long vein grafts to bridge the gap is the preferred option for many hand surgeons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753193411423877">Akyurek et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1753193411423877">Foucher, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1753193411423877">Ozerkan et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1753193411423877">Ozkan et al., 2006</xref>). Another option is transfer of the ulnar digital artery or vein from the middle finger to the ring finger, which simplifies the revascularization process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193411423877">Adani et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1753193411423877">Castagnetti et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1753193411423877">Martin et al., 1990</xref>). The aim of this study is to assess the vascular treatment modalities and report the functional results in complete ring avulsion amputations.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>This study includes 37 patients with complete ring avulsion amputations that were replanted between 1994 and 2006. The less severe forms of ring avulsion injuries other than total amputations were not included in this study. The mean age of patients was 29.7 years (range, 15 to 51 years). There were 31 male and 6 female patients. All patients were classified according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1753193411423877">Kay’s (1989)</xref> classification system modified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193411423877">Adani and colleagues (2003)</xref>. All amputations were class IV injuries, and were subdivided into class IVi (degloving injuries with intact flexor tendons), class IVp (amputation proximal to the insertion of the flexor superficialis tendon) and class IVd (amputation distal to the flexor superficialis tendon. According to this system, our patient group consisted of 32 class IVd, three class IVp and two class IVi injuries (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1753193411423877">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Replantation was performed under axillary block anaesthesia in all cases. A zigzag or a midlateral incision was made on the amputated finger. If needed, the skin incision was extended into the digital pulp at the level of the nail base (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753193411423877">Figure 1</xref>). Before attachment of the amputated finger to the stump with k-wires, the digital arteries, dorsal veins and nerves were examined and prepared for reconstruction under an operating microscope. The next step contained dissection and debridement of the proximal stumps. Extensive debridement of damaged parts of the vessels was performed beyond the level of microscopic signs of vascular injury. The method of bridging gaps of the arteries consisted of: 1) digital artery transfer from adjacent digit; 2) vein graft: superficial veins harvested from the forearm were used to reconstruct the defects; 3) end to end anastomosis of the digital vessels. Types of ring injury and the choice of artery reconstruction were recorded to identify factors influencing the success rate of the operations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1753193411423877">Table 1</xref>). A Doppler ultrasound examination was performed in 20 patients (ten artery transfer, six end to end repair and four vein graft) to detect the patency of the arteries. Twenty-six of the 31 patients were evaluated over a post-operative follow-up period of 12 to 132 months (mean, 61 months).</p>

<p>Finger motion was expressed in terms of total active movement of the metacarpophalangeal and interphalangeal joints of the involved finger. Sensibility was evaluated by the static two point discrimination and Semmes Weinstein monofilament tests. Grip strength measured using a set of computerized dynamometers (E-LINK Evaluation &amp; Exercise Systems, Version 6 Software, Biometrics Ltd, Gwent, UK). Final lengths of the replanted digits were measured radiographically and compared with normal sides. Cold intolerance was assessed using a single question concerning sensation while washing in cold water. Symptoms were divided into none, mild, moderate and severe. All assessments were performed by an independent surgeon. Postoperative results were compared to the uninjured hand and the paired <italic>t</italic>-test was used to evaluate the statistical significance of differences. The single nerve repair group was compared with the double nerve repair group using the <italic>t</italic>-test for independent samples. A p value of &lt; 0.01 was considered as significant.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Thirty-one of 37 finger replantations survived. In ten patients, an end to end arterial anastomosis was performed. In 21 cases, arterial transfer from the adjacent finger (ulnar digital artery of the middle finger) was used. In remaining six patients, vein graft interposition harvested from forearm was used for arterial repair. Early arterial insufficiency was observed in four cases in which arterial transfer was performed due to long segment vasospasm without thrombosis. Despite all efforts to overcome this problem, only one of them was salvaged, and the other three fingers were lost. In the ten cases in which end to end arterial repair was possible, vascular thrombosis was observed in two cases; one failed and the other survived after artery transfer as a second operation. The last group consisted of six cases of replantation with vein grafting; thrombosis of the proximal arterial anastomosis was found in one case that survived after thrombus removal and vascular re-anastomosis. This finger was viable at the late post-operative period, although control Doppler ultrasound imaging revealed total occlusion of the graft. Severe atrophy of the soft tissues and marked limitation of proximal interphalangeal joint motion was evident, precluding function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753193411423877">Figure 2</xref>). In the rest of the cases examined by Doppler, arterial patency was evident without any atrophy of soft tissues.</p>

</fig>
<p>Primary end to end vein anastomosis was performed in 32 cases, of which venous insufficiency occurred in three on the second post-replantation day, caused by thrombus formation at proximal anastomosis site. One was successfully salvaged using two new venous grafts for reconstruction of two superficial veins and the other two failed despite all efforts. Three cases required vein transposition from dorsal surface of adjacent finger. Another two amputations required primary vein graft interposition for venous repair.</p>
<p>Both digital nerves were repaired in 23 of the 37 cases. In the remaining 14 cases, only one digital nerve was repaired owing to the avulsion injury of the nerves (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1753193411423877">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>Mean total active motion of replanted fingers was 172 (SD 25.1) degrees (range, 115 to 205). Mean grip strength was 33.5 (SD 10) kg (range, 10 to 51) on the injured hand, compared with 39.6 (SD 9.6) kg (range, 15 to 57) on the uninjured side. The difference was found to be statistically significant (p = 0.004). Mean final lengths of replanted digits were 7.9 (SD 0.6) cm (range, 6.8 to 9.1) compared with the uninjured sides which were 9.1 (SD 0.6) cm (range, 7.8 to 10.2). The difference was significant (p = 0.000). Mean static two point discrimination was 9.4 (SD 2.9) mm (range, 6 to 15). The mean two point discrimination of the single nerve repair group was 9.5 (SD 3.3) mm (range, 5 to 15) compared with 9.3 (SD 2.8) mm (range, 4 to 15) on the double nerve repair group. The difference was not found to be statistically significant (p = 0.9). Semmes Weinstein monofilament testing revealed that 11 patients had normal sensibility, 12 patients had diminished light touch, two patients had diminished protective sensation and one patient had lost protective sensation of the injured finger. Cold intolerance was present in 12 of the 26 patients. Seven patients described moderate and five patients described mild discomfort during daily activities.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Replantation of ring avulsion amputations is a technically demanding procedure often requiring the use of a vein graft or artery transfer owing to the extensive segmental injury of the digital vessels. Long segment vessel injuries and occult intimal lesions increase the probability of thrombosis, leading to vascular occlusion and replant failure. The main problem related to this injury is difficulty of estimating true extent of vascular trauma, which significantly lowers the success rate when insufficient debridement of lacerated vessels was performed. The importance of avoiding arterial repair at the damaged segment has been recommended by several authors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193411423877">Adani et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753193411423877">Akyurek et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1753193411423877">Hyza et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1753193411423877">Ozkan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1753193411423877">Van der Horst et al., 1989</xref>), stating that vascular repair should always be performed at the level of normal-appearing vessels to increase the success rate of replantation. There are several techniques to bridge the vascular defect in ring avulsion amputations. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193411423877">Adani (1995)</xref> recommended artery transfer from the adjacent finger. This technique has been used in thumb replantations and recommended in the management of ring avulsion injuries. When compared with vein grafting, direct artery transfer enables a shorter operating time and decreases the number of anastomoses. Their series of ten type IV ring avulsion amputations, out of which seven were replanted with artery transfer, reported only one failure that ended up with amputation. In 22 of our 37 cases, artery transfer for vascularization of injured finger was performed. In four of them, arterial insufficiency due to vasospasm was detected at the early post-operative period. Re-exploration revealed long segment arterial spasm in these cases, without any detected thrombosis at the site of anastomosis. Despite all attempts to salvage the fingers, only one case survived after re-anastomosis; three of the four cases ended up with amputation. This finding showed us that long segment arterial spasm has an important role in the prognosis of avulsed fingers when arterial transfer is performed. Arterial spasm may be related to long segment dissection of the transferred digital artery. Failure to recognize the extension of the intimal damage up to the common digital artery may also have a role, because the avulsed digital artery and the transferred artery share the same common digital artery. The reported major drawbacks of this technique are the sacrifice of a major artery and cold intolerance of the donor finger, although we have not detected cold intolerance in any of donor fingers.</p>
<p>Another common technique involves interposition of vein grafts to bridge the gaps for reconstruction of vascular defects in ring avulsion amputations. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1753193411423877">Kay et al. (1989)</xref> reported a series of 27 type IV ring amputations, of which 16 fingers were replanted. Vein grafts for arterial repair were used in seven cases. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1753193411423877">Van der Horst et al. (1989)</xref> successfully used vein grafting in seven out of nine cases with type IV ring amputations. In the two fingers not vein grafted, the result was unsuccessful, ending up with re-amputation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1753193411423877">Hyza et al. (2007)</xref> reported a prospective series of six cases with type IV ring amputations replanted by radical resection of the vessels located at the zone of contusion and primary repair using vein grafts, proclaiming a successful end result in all cases in a period of 5 years. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753193411423877">Akyurek et al. (2002)</xref> reported seven cases with type IV ring amputations replanted by radical resection and vein grafting. Six of seven cases achieved a successful replantation whereas late arterial failure was observed in two of them, 28 and 30 days after surgery. One of the cases was salvaged by reoperation. In our series only six cases were repaired using vein grafts. Of them, we observed one failure at the proximal anastomosis site that required revision, resulting in late arterial failure. Experimental studies show that extent of arterial injury reaches up 4 cm from the rupture site both proximally and distally when examined under electron microscope. The surgical microscope can identify lacerations only in the first 0.8 cm segment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1753193411423877">Mitchell et al., 1985</xref>). Additionally it was found that veins tended to avulse more easily than arteries because of their thinner walls. The two unsuccessful results out of ten end to end digital artery anastomosis in our series may be attributed to inability to judge the real extent of intimal damage resulting in thrombosis. In the light of our experience, we have formed an algorithm for reconstruction of type IV ring amputations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1753193411423877">Figure 3</xref>). Studies in the literature report survival rates of these replantations varying from 64 to 100% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1753193411423877">Brooks et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1753193411423877">Hyza et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1753193411423877">Karaoguz and Alp, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1753193411423877">Kay et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1753193411423877">Tsai et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1753193411423877">Urbaniak et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1753193411423877">Van der Horst et al., 1989</xref>). In our series, one of the largest series in the literature, an 85% success rate was achieved, which is similar to the previous reports. Poor functional results were observed in three patients. The first case was complicated by late arterial failure, and although the finger survived, severe soft tissue atrophy and inadequate sensation greatly restricted the dexterity of the digit. The second case was a type IVp injury, where the amputation level was proximal to the osseous insertion of flexor digitorum superficialis on volar aspect of middle phalanx (FDS insertion), which ended up with restriction of range of motion at the interphalangeal joints. The last case was a 51-year-old patient who refused to attend the routine physiotherapy programme. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753193411423877">Akyurek et al. (2002)</xref> also reported two late arterial failures in their series consisting of seven total ring amputations, which gave poor results. This study also showed that satisfactory protective sensation can be achieved in ring amputations after a successful repair. Interestingly we observed no significant difference in the quality of sensation between the one-nerve and two-nerve repaired fingers, indicating that restoration of a single functioning nerve can supply the protective sensation of the injured digit. Statistical analysis also revealed that there was a difference of grip strength between the injured hands and the non-injured hands.</p>

<p>This study has shown that both vein graft interposition technique and digital artery transfer from the neighbouring finger in reconstruction of arteries seems to be good options with similar results. We strongly advocate a thorough debridement of all injured segments of vessels and performing one of the two techniques described above to span the defects and achieve a successful result.</p>
