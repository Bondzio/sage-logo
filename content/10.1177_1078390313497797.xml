<p>In the past 20 years, the value of mentoring relationships has received increasing attention across professions and employment settings. Indeed, it has been suggested that mentoring is as important to adult development as parenting is to childhood development. Mentorship has been defined in a variety of ways, but some key aspects are captured in this definition by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1078390313497797">Suzanne Faure (n.d.)</xref>: “Mentoring is a supportive learning relationship between a caring individual who shares knowledge, experience and wisdom with another individual who is ready and willing to benefit from this exchange, to enrich their professional journey.” This definition captures what I consider some key aspects of mentoring: sharing of experience and wisdom, the creation of a supportive learning environment, and the suggestion that both parties are enriched by their shared commitment to the advancement of their profession.</p>
<p>Many APNA members are involved in mentoring efforts in their work or academic settings. Mentorship by senior research faculty is well established as a process to develop new nurse researchers, and nurses in administrative leadership roles are often assigned professional mentors. However, few of us may have given much thought about why mentorship is an important concern for our organization. I would like to discuss three reasons why I believe that mentoring activities are an important organizational focus.</p>
<p>First, psychiatric mental health nurses need a source of nurturing relationships that can counteract the tendency of nurses to “eat their young.” Sadly, the nursing literature documents widespread prevalence of such behaviors as intimidation, scapegoating, undermining, and even bullying among nurses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1078390313497797">Bally, 2007</xref>). Such unsupportive work environments in psychiatric mental health nursing can certainly lead to outcomes that are undesirable for our workforce, such as high turnover and loss of nursing talent to other areas. But the effect of this failure to support and nurture fellow nurses extends beyond the nursing staff and affects patient care. It is difficult for nursing novices to learn a compassionate and accepting approach to patients from experienced nurses who model uncivil and un-collegial behavior. It is equally challenging to do the hard work of confronting and attempting to alleviate human suffering in an environment where one is not supported. My hope is that newer psychiatric mental health nurses will find APNA to be a place where they can share the expertise, the pride, and passion for our discipline, and the professional collegiality demonstrated by experienced APNA members. We must strengthen our own networks of mutual support if we are to be effective advocates and providers of care for those dealing with problems caused by mental illness and addictions.</p>
<p>As well as contributing to the development of more supportive workplaces that provide quality care, mentoring can better prepare nursing colleagues to deal effectively with the larger systems that affect our professional lives. Many of the frustrations I see expressed on Member Bridge that relate to psychiatric nursing’s place in the wider health care arena, such as inadequate representation on interdisciplinary policymaking bodies or government publications that fail to acknowledge our contributions, stem from insufficient development of leadership capacity in nursing. If we do not want the next generation of psychiatric nurses to inherit the same problems, we must invest in our profession by focusing attention on younger nurses who can be groomed for interdisciplinary leadership in the future.</p>
<p>Last, mentoring offers personal benefits to mentors. It offers the opportunity for psychiatric mental health nurse experts to show their gratitude to their own mentors and to the profession that has provided them with such rewarding life’s work by insuring that their hard-earned wisdom continues to benefit nurses and patients. The influence of great leaders in nursing, such as Hildegarde Peplau, lives on through the contributions of their mentees. Being a mentor can also provide the satisfaction of knowing that the future is in good hands. As faculty in a graduate psychiatric mental health nursing program, I am fortunate to meet new and amazing nursing talent each year and to see alumni of my program open up new frontiers for advanced psychiatric nursing practice.</p>
<p>In recognition of the importance of mentoring to strengthen our profession, APNA is using a variety of strategies to support it. Members of the Administrative Council, whose goals include mutual mentorship, developed a webinar on <italic>Fundamentals of Mentoring</italic> in the e-Learning Center that is offered free to all members. Student recipients of APNA Janssen scholarships work with a mentor who helps engage them in projects focused on professional issues in psychiatric mental health nursing. Given the large surplus of qualified candidates for Board or Nominating Committee positions this year, members of the APNA Board have made a commitment to mentor applicants who were not selected for the ballot. We are contacting these individuals to discuss how we can support their continued involvement in APNA and help them build their leadership portfolio. Our most broad-based mentoring initiative is Mentor Match, an online program to match prospective mentors and mentees based on shared interests and preferred modes of communication. The more prospective mentors and mentees enroll, the more likely that users will be able to find a great mentoring match. Please consider signing up!</p>
<p>In addition to these structured supports, many mentoring relationships are formed in the course of carrying out APNA’s regular organizational activities. Newer members are continually being mentored to develop their leadership abilities through serving with experienced leaders on chapter boards or conference committees. Projects undertaken by our councils or related task forces also offer opportunities for mentoring as experienced and emerging leaders work together on issues of mutual interest.</p>
<p>APNA mentoring relationships can also be formed serendipitously. Daryl Sharp, one of psychiatric nursing’s foremost experts on smoking cessation and co-chair of APNA’s Tobacco Dependence Council, shared a story with me of a connection she made with DNP student Rhonda Schwindt while waiting for the airport shuttle to APNA’s 2011 conference in Anaheim. A discussion of their professional passions sparked Ms. (now Dr.) Schwindt’s interest in tobacco cessation and she eventually decided to make this the focus of her DNP capstone project. Dr. Sharp served as advisor on her project and member of her DNP capstone committee, and they have since coauthored a journal article (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1078390313497797">Schwindt &amp; Sharp, in press</xref>). Drs. Sharp and Schwindt have other projects planned, and their partnership promises to continue to make valuable contributions to the nursing literature for years to come. This wonderful example of the benefit of mentoring is not unusual in APNA—I am sure many of you have similar stories, and I would love to hear them!</p>
<p>In the interest of furthering the development of a culture of mentoring in APNA, I would like to suggest some steps each of us can take to facilitate those nurturing professional connections.</p>
<p>If you are new to psychiatric mental health nursing or seeking to further develop your career goals:</p>
<list id="list1-1078390313497797" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Introduce yourself, either in person or online, to someone who is an expert in an area you are interested in or whose contributions to APNA you admire. Ask them about their career path and if they have any advice about how to develop your own interests.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Get involved in your chapter or a council that is focused on an issue of interest. Indicate your willingness to help on projects led by more experienced members, and ask questions that will help you learn how to take leadership in council or chapter activities.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Sign up on Mentor Match to find a mentor!</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>If you are an experienced clinician, researcher, or leader:</p>
<list id="list2-1078390313497797" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Identify “hidden treasures” in the APNA membership who are engaged in council or chapter activities or posting on Member Bridge. Help them identify their strengths and suggest ways in which their contribution would be valuable. Do a “warm handoff” to another experienced member who shares their passion.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>When a leadership opportunity arises, do not automatically recommend “the usual suspects.”Identify an emerging leader who might appreciate the chance to be involved and connect them with an experienced leader to coach or work with them so they will be successful.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Sign up on Mentor Match to find a mentee!</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>As indicated by the suggestions above, mentoring does not always have to involve a long-term or intensive commitment. Sometimes even brief supportive interactions with people whose professional stature we respect can have a significant impact on our career trajectory. Each of us can be a mentor as defined by Massachusetts politician John C. Crosby: “Mentoring is a brain to pick, an ear to listen, and a push in the right direction.”</p>
