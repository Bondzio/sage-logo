<title>Theft</title>

<title>Cable for resale as scrap: Guidance</title>
<p>As a result of the rise in the global price of copper there has been a marked increase in the theft of copper cable readily accessible from public locations as part of the infrastructure on which the public rely. The following two cases serve to illustrate the Appeal Court’s response.</p>
<p>
<bold>Railway signalling wire.</bold> When engineers on the East Coast mainline were seeking to make good loss of cable stolen in the early hours they became aware of further damage and removal of cable, the thieves being still at the scene. Following deployment of police dogs and a helicopter M. and K. were detained and M. was found to have been responsible for the initial theft, having sold the metal to a scrap dealer meantime. There had been a spate of such offending affecting that part of the rail network. Both men were in their mid-twenties, long-term unemployed, with significant criminal records and histories of drug/alcohol dependency. The sentencing judge noted that they had decided to steal cable for either drink or drugs, though the value of the cable was under £100 and would only have served that purpose for a couple of days. Neither of them had apparently given any thought to the major inconvenience to many people that their actions would inevitably cause. M.’s pre-sentence report had recommended a community order with requirements of supervision, unpaid work and a programme, noting a high risk of re-offending that would increase if he were to resume drinking to excess. He was assessed to demonstrate insight into the consequences of his behaviour and had expressed his regret. </p>
<p> On their appeal against three years’ imprisonment following guilty pleas to theft and damage, the Court of Appeal noted that the Sentencing Guidelines for theft were of only limited help because cases of this nature ‘do not sit easily within any of the guidelines because of a combination of unusual circumstances: the value of the goods and the gain to the thieves is relatively small, whereas the cost to the railway company is disproportionately large and the disruption to the travelling public is enormous’. Having regard to culpability and harm, ‘it is difficult to see how these offenders were other than reckless as to the harm that would be caused in removing cable of this kind’. As regards the loss suffered by the direct victim, this was in the region of £75,000 and that did not include the unquantifiable financial losses caused to the stranded passengers, as well as the enormous inconvenience:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Quite apart from any deterrent value a sentence might have on the offenders themselves and others minded to commit this kind of offence and quite apart from the necessary punitive value of such a sentence, Network Rail, the travelling public and other victims of their offending are entitled to a measure of protection from them in the future. Furthermore, the appellants need to learn to abstain from drugs and excessive alcohol.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>However, the appropriate sentence for the two appellants after trial, given their appalling records of offences including thefts of metals, should have been at least three years’ imprisonment rather than the 54 months considered by the judge to be appropriate. Accordingly, sentence was varied to 24 months to reflect their pleas. R v MITCHELL and KELHAM [2012] 1 Cr App R(S) 68.</p>
<p>
<bold>Telecom cable. </bold>
<italic>Mitchell and Kelham</italic> was subsequently applied in R v BIRCH, DAVIES and TYRELL (April 2012, not reported at time of writing), a case involving three men who were intercepted in possession of a large amount of copper cabling, the property of British Telecom and valued at nearly £10,000 and cut into fifty 15-foot lengths, together with heavy-duty specialized cable-cutting tools. Purporting to be out late at night ‘lamping’, they had dug up and removed telecommunications cable for sale as scrap, causing significant disruption to the phone system and public in that area, affecting around 800 lines. The harm had included not only the expense of replacement with associated engineering labour cost but also the financial loss to businesses reliant on card payment transactions. All three offenders had prior convictions but their antecedents were not considered of particular relevance to the assessment of seriousness in this case. Their pre-sentence reports indicated: B. was aged 23, father of two infant children, unemployed, struggling financially, his father having ill-health and thus reliant on his son for support. D, aged 37 and father of four children was struggling financially to run a low-earning business, he and his wife experiencing depression. T., aged 51 and living on benefits, was drug-dependant with a methadone script and also resorting to heroin and crack cocaine. He was considered suitable for a community order with a drug rehabilitation requirement.</p>
<p> On their appeal against thirty months’ imprisonment following guilty pleas to theft, the Court of Appeal noted that the sentencing judge had adopted a starting point of 45 months prior to awarding full discount for plea, higher than the starting point suggested in <italic>Mitchell and Kelham</italic>, but identified that the present case was aggravated by involving a gang operation, using two vehicles and specialist equipment. Having regard too to the prevalence of this kind of offending and ‘the appalling consequences for the public’, their sentences had not been manifestly excessive and their appeals were dismissed.</p>

<title>‘Professional’ shop theft</title>
<p>Having been caught stealing high value perfume from a store and on bail pending prosecution, K. aged 28 stole a similar item in another town. Following imposition of a community order in respect of the initial theft she returned to the same store less than three weeks later where she had committed the second theft and stole more perfume, being caught through CCTV surveillance. Her record disclosed that she had been an habitual shoplifter from age 14 who now targeted high value goods for resale, offending over a wide geographical area. She had not heeded the opportunities provided through a sequence of non-custodial orders featuring various forms of intervention.</p>
<p> On K.’s appeal against 12 months’ immediate imprisonment following guilty plea to theft it was argued on her behalf that a notional 18 month custodial term (if she had been convicted after trial) was disproportionate and that not enough mitigatory regard had been given to her unfortunate background, featuring early losses through bereavement, parental conflict and disrupted schooling, or to her role as a single mother with two young and dependent children. The Court of Appeal did not doubt that her problematic upbringing had contributed to ‘making her the person she is’ but observed that ‘she is now a grown woman’ who had ‘had more than ample opportunity to make her own choices’ in life. Notwithstanding ‘inevitable pressures, she has elected to choose a path of repeated crime’. The sentencing judge had rightly concluded that she was a professional thief and courts could not ‘go on passing yet further community orders in the hope that (she) will understand that it is time to stop’. ‘There comes a time when one simply has to pass an immediate sentence of imprisonment’ and in this case ‘it should probably have some a little earlier’. Her children were being cared for by their maternal grandmother, as they had been in the past, and the Court had no doubt that they were being well looked after. While the impact of custodial sentencing on children is a factor to consider, especially in cases ‘on the cusp of custody’, this case demanded a custodial sentence and was well-merited. Accordingly, sentence was upheld. </p>

<title>Shop theft: Using child as ploy</title>
<p>Observing R. to be leaving a supermarket with a trolley full of goods, value over £650, without apparent intention to pay and accompanied by an infant aged six months sitting in the trolley’s baby seat, shop staff intervened to ask her if she needed any assistance, an offer she declined. When followed to the car park and challenged she took the baby in her arms and plunged onto the bonnet of a vehicle that was pulling away with the infant underneath her, causing the child’s head to strike the car, thereafter throwing herself to the ground and rolling around so that the child’s head connected more than once with the floor. When police officers intervened R. struggled violently. Though not previously convicted, R. had been cautioned for shoplifting on an earlier occasion, also involving use of one of her children as a distraction or decoy, leaving the child at the shop in a bid to escape being caught. The sentencing judge observed that she had sought to steal on a large scale and when caught had put her baby in harm’s way, as she had done before.</p>
<p> On R’s appeal against six months’ suspended imprisonment following guilty plea to theft, with a further six months imposed for child cruelty, totalling 12 months suspended for 18 months with a supervision requirement it was argued on her behalf that her offending had not crossed the custodial threshold and also that she had not been accorded appropriate mitigatory credit for her responsibilities as a mother of three young children whom she otherwise cared for very well. The Court of Appeal was not persuaded by the first argument, given the aggravating factors of determined high value theft and R.’s use of the child as a ploy to deter those who sought to detain her. However, in the circumstances the Court was persuaded to reduce the custodial term for theft to three months. As regards the child cruelty offence it had been a matter of good fortune rather than good management that her baby had not suffered significant injury. She had not appeared to give that risk any thought. That element of her sentence had been well-justified. Accordingly, sentence was varied to nine months. </p>

<title>Mental disorder</title>
<p>Though the following judgments are in no way precedents, these cases serve to illustrate further the Appeal Court’s stance, particularly in resolving tensions between immediate custodial outcomes and potentially more constructive approaches when dealing with mentally disordered offenders.</p>
<sec id="section6-0264550512458634">
<title>Autistic vulnerability in custody</title>
<p>Having seized a woman at a railway station and unsuccessfully demanded money from her, W., then aged 20, had incurred a 12 month suspended custodial sentence with supervision and activity requirements from the Crown Court for attempted robbery. Around three months later he approached a woman at a bus stop, following her when she sought to avoid him, next striking her on the arm so that she dropped her mobile phone which he picked up and ran off with. On pleading guilty to theft and common assault he was returned to the Crown Court where he incurred three months consecutive for each offence, also having eight months of his suspended term activated, making 14 months in aggregate. His criminal record comprised a reprimand and a caution for assaults at age 15 and 18, together with a conditional discharge for assault committed after the attempted robbery but imposed prior to his suspended sentence order (SSO). The pre-sentence report writer now drew attention to a psychiatric report that had been available to the judge making the SSO that had drawn attention to W.’s autism (Asperger’s Syndrome), involving deficits in cognitive functioning, information processing and social interaction. The PSR expressed concern about his vulnerability and anticipated difficulty with coping in custody and proposed a further SSO. However, the judge considered that it would make a mockery of the SSO if it was not activated, given the short space of time it had been in place when W. had re-offended. </p>
<p> On W.’s appeal against sentence he was granted bail by the single judge pending consideration by the full Appeal Court, in light of information that he was indeed coping badly in custody. The full Court had the benefit of reading the earlier psychiatric report that had anticipated that if placed in an environment where he felt unsafe W.’s mental health would deteriorate and he would become non-compliant with medication, as indeed had proved the case. He had failed to understand the prison regime, had been exploited by other prisoners and had displayed bizarre behaviour. However, the Court had the benefit of a fresh report from the prison mental health support unit that their intervention had helped him to achieve significant improvement. In addition the psychiatrist who had written the initial report had supplied an addendum indicating that she and her team were now working with W. since he was granted bail, to enable him to readjust to life in the community. The Court of Appeal considered this intervention to be crucial for W.’s future because he needed to understand that if he continued to offend by intimidating women he would end up in prison despite his mental health problems. In light of the almost certain aggravation to his fragile mental state that return to prison now would trigger, the Court opted to take the exceptional step of quashing his sentence, reinstating his earlier SSO, with its operational period extended by one month, and imposing a further SSO for the new offences. [Note: the Court’s judgment did not throw explicit light on any causative connection between W.’s autism and his pattern of offending.]</p>

<title>Personality disordered and autistic arsonist</title>
<p>Police officers called to L.’s home late at night because of a report that she was going to set herself on fire, and found her sitting with a cigarette lighter and a pile of clothing. She confirmed that she had intended to set fire to the clothing but she was now wanting to go to bed. After she had been checked by a paramedic the police departed, only to be notified shortly afterwards that she had texted ‘goodbye’. On returning they found she had started a fire causing modest damage that would cost £700 to rectify. Following her arrest the police custody sergeant considered that a caution would be appropriate, a judgment the Court of Appeal found difficult to follow, but L. refused this offer, stating that she had mental health problems requiring hospital treatment. As a consequence she was charged and remanded in custody, in due course incurring an extended sentence of four years duration – a custodial term of 12 months with a licence period of 36 months – for arson. By the time her appeal against sentence was considered, L. had been released but had been recalled to prison within a few weeks, thereafter being transferred to a secure psychiatric unit under MHA 1983 s47. Subsequent assessments had established clinical consensus that L. suffered an emotionally unstable personality disorder (PD) with ‘borderline’ and ‘impulsive’ features, and also an autistic spectrum disorder, Asperger’s Syndrome, combining to interfere markedly with her social functioning and causing her to behave in ways distressing to herself and to others, with resort to aggression, assault, fire-raising and self-harming. Her psychiatrist reported that if her pre-existing and long-standing disorder had been apparent earlier this could have significantly affected the Crown Court’s sentencing decision. She would not be able to access or respond to treatment in prison, whereas she was benefiting from the structured and boundaried setting offered in the secure unit and her disorder warranted her detention in hospital. </p>
<p> In light of this evidence the Appeal Court readily concluded that L.’s prison sentence should be quashed and replaced with a s37 hospital order aimed at facilitating her rehabilitation. Having regard to psychiatric advice that a s41 restriction order would not add any public protective value to what could be achieved by an appropriate after-care package on discharge, the Court opted not to add a restriction direction. Further, the Court took careful account of the fact that L. wished to proceed with her appeal, notwithstanding the appreciation that she might remain detained in hospital beyond the point when she would otherwise be entitled to discharge as a transferred prisoner under s47, something the Court considered a clear indication of her insight into her condition and her improved functioning under hospital care. </p>

<title>Psychotic illness with drug misuse: custody upheld</title>
<p>Police officers called to a reported late night disturbance in the vicinity of F.’s home found him outside in the street, armed with a knife and exchanging abusive threats with another man. A third man who had sought to intervene to calm matters prior to the police’s arrival had been confronted aggressively by F. who had kicked him when he tripped and fell to the ground. F. informed the police that his windows had been damaged, prompting him to go outside to investigate. The sentencing judge was informed that F. had reacted in an out-of-control manner to what he had perceived to be a threat of violence when disinhibited after taking drugs. Reports indicated that F. had a long history of psychotic symptoms coupled with a criminal record that included two offences of robbery when armed with a weapon (a knife and a sword) and a s20 wounding, also involving a knife. Following the current offending episode he had twice been referred for psychiatric assessment, on the second occasion being detained under MHA 1983 s3 with a diagnosis of a paranoid schizophrenic illness, in light of his history of paranoid delusional beliefs. He also had a lengthy history of substance misuse, including resort to crack cocaine and amphetamines. A consultant psychiatrist advised that ‘the psychotic symptoms may have worked as contributing factors or may be just incidental and not have contributed at all to his offending’. The PSR author considered that F.’s drug misuse as opposed to mental ill-health was a predominant factor in his reckless conduct, poor self-management and difficulty in controlling his emotions and temper. Another psychiatrist advised that if F. was sent to prison and his mental health were to deteriorate in custody he could be managed on the health care wing and be re-referred for forensic services advice. The judge concluded that F. was fit to undergo a custodial sentence. </p>
<p> On F.’s appeal against 22 months’ imprisonment, comprising 18 months for possession of a bladed article and a further four months for assault by beating, following guilty pleas, the Appeal Court acknowledged that his current offending, viewed in the context of his criminal recode, warranted a substantial custodial sentence. Though F. argued that the term had been excessive, in light of his psychiatric problems, the Court was assured that he would continue to receive requisite medication whilst detained in prison and concluded that imprisonment in this instance was neither wrong in principle nor manifestly excessive. However, given that the assault had been committed as part of what was essentially the same incident the sentence for that offence should have been concurrent, not consecutive, and accordingly his aggregate term was adjusted to 18 months.</p>

<title>Personality disorder and commitment to change</title>
<p>On encountering by chance his first victim who was stumbling home heavily intoxicated, E. attacked him, rendering him unconscious, taking the opportunity to rob him of personal possessions. Having been bailed following arrest, he waited outside the home of his second victim until he returned, securing an invitation inside where he attacked him by punching him repeatedly before stabbing him with scissors and leaving with some of his belongings. His motive in both instances had been his wish to hurt both men in the mistaken belief that they were sex offenders. On surrendering himself to the police he acknowledged wanting to hurt both victims, resorting to robbing them as a secondary development, and stated that he needed help. His prior convictions included ABH assault and wounding with intent, attracting 33 months’ imprisonment around two years before the current offending. Reports to the Crown Court disclosed E.’s chaotic mode of life, his addictive propensity for alcohol, opiate and cannabis misuse and his mental health problems, including self-harming ideation. A psychiatrist reported that he was well-motivated to change and suitable for intervention initiatives that could reduce risk and were already beginning to show results.</p>
<p>On E.’s appeal against an indeterminate sentence of imprisonment for public protection (with a minimum term of 42 months) for two counts of robbery following guilty pleas, it was argued on his behalf not that the finding of dangerousness had been wrong but that an extended determinate sentence would have been the proper means of securing public protection. An updated psychiatric report identified that he fulfilled the criteria for a diagnosis of emotionally unstable personality disorder but that continuing participation in ongoing psychological work on his problems, particularly his substance misuse and personality vulnerabilities, was proving valuable. He was currently clinically stable and was achieving progress in gaining insight and developing coping strategies largely through his own efforts. He was already participating in a prison-based drug therapeutic community programme and had applied for onward admission to the democratic therapeutic unit at HMP Grendon.</p>
<p> In the view of the Court of Appeal, the issue at stake was whether an extended sentence could be considered adequate in managing E.’s risk. Though he had evidenced positive commitment and had not presented any recent problems in custody, he continued to pose a very high risk, particularly in light of the PD diagnosis, and the psychiatric report, while encouraging, was vague as to successful outcome. It remained to be determined whether E. would be deemed suitable for or gain admission to Grendon. As the Court could not be sufficiently confident that the ambit of an extended sentence would serve to reduce risk, the IPP was upheld, though the Court sought not to discourage E., reminding him that he still had goals to achieve, with the prospect of satisfying the Parole Board that he could be managed in the community at the end of his minimum custodial period.</p>

<title>Extreme pornography</title>
<p>Possession of extreme pornographic images became an offence in January 2009 when the relevant provision (s63) of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 was implemented, with a maximum sentence of two years’ imprisonment. The following two judgments illustrate the approach of the Court of Appeal where sentencers do not have the benefit of a specific Sentencing Guideline in determining their approach.</p>
<p>In R v OLIVER [2011] EWCA Crim 3114 O., aged in his early fifties and of previous positive good character, was found to have three stills and eight moving images explicitly portraying an adult having sex with an animal, downloaded onto his home computer. He had aroused police suspicion because of his involvement in an internet chatroom in which he had fantasized about men having sex with his wife. He had downloaded the bestial images prior to this being criminalized and he had not later re-accessed them, though he had retained these and in May 2009 he had applied a ‘Team Viewer’ programme that enabled others to access remotely the contents of his computer. As he was then still pursuing a career in the prison service, serving at a governor grade, he had voluntarily exposed himself to the danger of blackmail on account of the nature of those images. His arrest, prosecution and conviction, with associated publicity, had caused him extreme embarrassment and shame, in addition to loss of his employment. The pre-sentence report had referred to the additional hardship to which a custodial sentence would expose him, given his occupational background.</p>
<p> On O.’s appeal against six months’ imprisonment following guilty plea the Court of Appeal noted the starting point and range identified in the relevant sentencing guideline for ‘Level 5’ images of children, offending of that kind carrying a maximum term of five years’ imprisonment. In the Court’s view:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>The public would be surprised if the seriousness of possession of adult images should be equated with those which involve images of children. The need to protect children from those who make such images enables the court to pass sentences which have a deterrent effect … We conclude that on principle there is no narrow comparison to be made between images of children and those of adults.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Given that the images in O.’s case had been downloaded before they became unlawful and had not been subsequently accessed, the Court considered that in the absence of aggravating factors the custody threshold test would not be met. However, the Court agreed that the later download of software that made these images available to others constituted an aggravating factor that served to meet the test. Having regard to O.’s prior exemplary character and the high price he had paid through shame and ridicule, a three month term was appropriate following contested trial and accordingly O.’s sentence was reduced to two months. </p>
<p>In R v LEWIS (May 2012, not reported at time of writing) police recovered 44 still images and 19 moving images of a woman engaged in sexual activities with horses and dogs from L.’s computer. Aged in his early forties, university educated but prematurely retired on health grounds, he had incurred 12 months’ imprisonment in 2007 for causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity, meeting a child following sexual grooming and making/possessing indecent images of children. Noting L.’s claim that he had not looked again at the images after his initial viewing nor had he used them for sexual gratification but also his expressed wish to understand better the reasons for his behaviour, the PSR writer anticipated that a custodial sentence would not be of sufficient length to afford him the opportunity to undertake a prison-based sex offender programme and so recommended a community order with a programme requirement. In mitigation the judge was informed that L.’s wife was reliant on his assistance with her health problems. In passing sentence the judge had regard to sentencing guidelines relating to possession of child pornography, observing that L.’s offences were of a ‘similar kind’, involving a large number of ‘Level 5’ images of an extreme bestial nature. (Those guidelines would indicate a sentencing range from 26 weeks to 24 months for a first time offender following contested trial.)</p>
<p>On L.’s appeal against 12 months’ immediate imprisonment following guilty pleas to two counts of possessing extreme pornography it was argued on his behalf that the Crown Court had been wrong to treat his case as analogous to a child image case, relying on the <italic>Oliver</italic> judgment. Referring to the relevant extract from <italic>Oliver</italic> (quoted above) the Court of Appeal observed that though there is no ‘narrow comparison’, this is not to say that there is no comparison whatsoever between the two classes of offence. Where sentencers have no direct guideline to rely on they may properly consider analogous guidance. What is important is that such an exercise should not result in a sentence that is manifestly excessive or wrong in principle for the offence being dealt with. In this instance the judge had not treated L.’s offending as identical to possession of child pornography. She had also been entitled to regard L.’s 2007 conviction as ‘broadly analogous and as a seriously aggravating factor’. Further, the Appeal Court rejected the appellant’s submission that in the absence of any evidence of coercion exercised upon the human adult participants in extreme pornographic images it can fairly be assumed that they are consensually engaged in that activity, either for financial gain or for sexual satisfaction. ‘The judge was entitled to refer to the fact that the women involved are often trafficked or forced into their involvement.’ The sentence was upheld.</p>

<title>Child pornography: Exceptional focus on rehabilitation</title>
<p>A thief who had broken into G.’s parked car and stolen a laptop handed the hard drive to the police, having noticed stored files featuring child pornography and on investigation it was apparent that G. had downloaded 535 still and moving indecent images of children, predominantly pre-pubescent boys but some only babies and toddlers, extending to ‘level 5’. A psychosexual report by a consultant psychologist, submitted to the Crown Court, recorded that G., now aged in his late 20s, had experienced an extremely dysfunctional family upbringing, having been conceived as a consequence of rape, witnessing and suffering much violence and abuse at the hands of his father and other relatives that had caused him to spend much of his childhood in hospital. The abuse had extended to sexual exploitation at age four to six. He had been bullied relentlessly at school. His father held contemptuous views of women whom he regarded as objects for sexual exploitation. G. was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, with other indicators of obsessive compulsive disorder, bi-polar disorder and depression. The consultant advised that his resort to child pornography enabled him to view and re-enact his own abuse in childhood and he swung from the pursuit of adrenalin highs, accessing legal internet pornography, to depressive despair that involved resort to illegal porn and suicidal ideation. The report considered that imprisonment would prove disastrous, exposing G. to further sexual abuse as another prisoner’s ‘bitch’, and recommended that G. should undertake psychosexual therapy, available only privately, rather than a standard cognitive-behavioural sex offender programme that was likely to prove of little or no benefit to him.</p>
<p>The PSR writer recorded that G. was able to identify with the child victims of pornographic exploitation, had expressed relief that his offending had been discovered, was remorseful and was determined to address his issues and to achieve change, to the extent that when the counselling he had been receiving had been curtailed through funding cutbacks he had ensured continuation of support by funding treatment of a private basis. The reporter further noted that G. had earlier supported himself through college by holding down two jobs, achieving a distinction in heath and social care, going on to establish a charitable support scheme for young carers that had gained him an award from the Prince’s Trust. He was assessed as posing a medium risk of harm that could be reduced if his access to the internet and computers was restricted and he undertook work addressing his offending behaviour. Imprisonment could exacerbate his mental health problems but participation on a sex offender treatment programme, accessed as part of a three year community order could provide him with strategies to manage high risk situations.</p>
<p>In passing sentence totalling ten months’ immediate imprisonment, following G.’s guilty pleas to possessing indecent images, the judge had sought to emphasize that those who possess and keep pictures of this nature and on such a scale must expect to lose their liberty; it is only by such sentences that others can be deterred from such conduct.</p>
<p>In considering G.’s appeal the Court of Appeal observed that the real question posed was not whether the level of sentence had been manifestly excessive but whether it had been wrong in principle. Though the images, extending to anal rape, were ‘utterly abhorrent’ and the judge had been right to emphasize the importance of deterrence, there are exceptional cases where the public interest does not lie in immediate custody, principally ‘where the prospects of rehabilitation outside prison are such that, having regard to the interests of the public as well as the interests of the individual defendant, the prospects of rehabilitation and preventing further offending are greater if there is no immediate custodial sentence’. If that was not the case in this instance ‘it would be hard to imagine what such a case would look like’. G. was the victim of a family background not of his making. There was an obvious and direct causative connection between that background and his psychosexual functioning that led to this course of offending. Further, G. had very strong personal mitigation, in that unlike many victims of abuse he had taken considerable steps to overcome his background and to try to rid himself of ‘the psychological shackles’ of his abuse, seeking help at considerable personal financial cost and devoting his life to charitable enterprise. Though the report writers differed in their views to some extent they shared the view that this was an exceptional case justifying a recommendation against custody. The Court thus concluded that the judge had been wrong and that this was one of the rare instances where a different course was justified. A three year community order as recommended in the PSR was substituted.</p>

<title>Chatroom exploitation: Reflecting youth and immaturity</title>
<p>Between the ages of 15 and 17 W. had made contact via Internet chatrooms with around 100 under-age girls around the world, persuading them to remove their clothes and expose their genitals for him on camera, in one instance enticing two girls to do so together, and in other instances getting girls to masturbate for him. He had recorded them on his hard drive, though for personal gratification and there was no evidence that the images had been shared with or accessed by anyone else. On one occasion W. had masturbated in the view of a girl he was linked with and in another instance he had inserted a calculator in his anus, though this had not been visible to the girl concerned. The girls he had exploited appeared to have been aged 15 and had agreed to participate in this way, though he had been aware that they were under-age. None had complained, the offending coming to light when police officers seized his computer as a result of intelligence received. Aged 19 at point of sentence, W. had no prior convictions or cautions and he had made early, full admissions. He claimed to have been very naïve and immature at the time of offending; his employer considered him a keen and excellent worker; his girlfriend was wholly supportive of him. The PSR writer proposed a sentence that would enable him to benefit from extensive community intervention to address what was assessed to be his high risk to children. The sentencing judge considered the storage of the images to be a ‘disturbing feature’ of the case and observed that though there was no evidence that any of the girls had suffered any physical, emotional or mental ill-effect, it might well be that any child involved could be adversely affected by the later realization of how she had been depicted for another’s gratification. </p>
<p>On W.’s appeal against an aggregate of 14 months’ immediate detention following guilty pleas to possessing indecent images of children, inciting a child to engage in sexual activity and engaging in sexual activity in a child’s presence, the Court of Appeal observed that in light of the convergence of aggravating features of his case, not least the sheer number of girls affected, the period over which he had offended and the potential for psychological harm, the Crown Court had been entitled to depart from the relevant sentencing guidelines to impose a custodial sentence. However, while W. had in a sense been persistently predatory, these were non-contact offences, ostensibly consensual and without use of coercion, where the age gap between offender and child had been at maximum approximately two years. Though the judge had correctly had the protection of vulnerable young girls in mind, he had failed to give sufficient weight to W.’s age when he committed these offences (when the offender is aged under-18 the Guidelines indicate that a different approach is required), the lapse of time between arrest and sentence and his increased maturity in that period. In light of W.’s age and immaturity when he offended his sentence should have been suspended. Accordingly, the appeal was allowed and a suspended sentence totalling eight months for a 24 month operational period was substituted, with a supervision requirement to facilitate intervention to reduce risk. A tandem sexual offences prevention order for 10 years was left unaffected.</p>

<title>New Guideline: Dispelling myths</title>
<p>On 27 February 2012 the Sentencing Council’s new <italic>Definitive Guideline on Drug Offences </italic>came into effect, though not with retrospective effect. In the view of the Solicitor General, this guidance has been misunderstood and misapplied, using the avenue of Attorney General’s reference of to the Court of Appeal on grounds of undue leniency to challenge two instances of sentencing since introduction date as an opportunity to ‘dispel a few myths’. The principal ‘myth’ the Law Officers had in mind is the apparently widespread belief that the Council intended to lower the level of sentences for drug offences generally.</p>
<p>Content to nail that unjustified presumption, the Appeal Court drew attention to one of its recent judgments, <italic>Boakye and Others</italic> [2012] EWCA Crim 838, in which the Vice-President of the Court had stated:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>In producing the new guideline, the Sentencing Council expressly made clear that in most respects, although it adopts a modified and clarified method of reasoning, it is expected to produce sentences broadly in line with existing practice. The Council, however, anticipated that its approach would result in reductions in sentence for a certain sub-class of courier (commonly, if inaccurately, known as ‘mules’). The sub-class in question is the group of disadvantaged defendants, particularly those from an under-developed country, who have been exploited by serious drugs criminals and persuaded to carry drugs often for very small reward. We agree that for such defendants the new guideline will often result in a shorter sentence, and on many occasions a significantly shorter sentence.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Briefly summarizing the core of the Guideline, the Court reminded sentencers that the Guideline sets out a series of eight steps for the sentencing process, not all of which will be necessary in every case but which should be followed sequentially. Step one is the determination of the offence category, to which there are two aspects: culpability and harm. Culpability is demonstrated by the offender’s role. Harm, or rather the potential for harm, is measured by the weight or quantity of the drug concerned.</p>
<p>As regards the offender’s role and how best to categorize that, the Court noted: </p>
<disp-quote>
<p>The Council has not reallocated offenders into different categories. The essential nature of a drugs hierarchy remains the same even if the terminology has changed. The terminology of the hierarchy has varied over the years, for example there was a time when some judges divided offenders according to military ranks: generals, lieutenants and foot soldiers. The Council has chosen the categories of ‘leading’, ‘significant’ and ‘lesser’ roles. This is not a change in substance.… It will be a rare sentencing exercise in which every person in the chain of command in a drugs enterprise is before the court. Almost inevitably there will be people lower down or higher up in the chain absent from the dock. The fact that there may be a financier or someone senior to an organiser who remains at large does not mean that the organiser has not played a ‘leading’ role. It may, on the particular facts, put the organiser somewhere in the middle of the ‘leading role’ range, but not in another range all together.… The categories do not provide some kind of straightjacket into which every case must be squeezed. Few… offenders will match exactly the categories provided. One… offender may straddle a number of categories. There may be more than one offence involved in which the offender has played different roles.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Having determined the offender’s role and the category of harm, at step two the judge should ‘use the corresponding starting point to reach a sentence within the category ranges which follow. The starting point applies to all offenders irrespective of plea or previous convictions. The judge should then factor in any aggravating or mitigating features and adjust the sentence within the range.’ Though ‘weight or quantity of the drug remains at the heart of the sentencing process’, the Guideline requires a change of approach. ‘Under the previous regime, sentencing ranges for drugs offences were based on the weight of the drug at 100% purity. Under the new Guideline, the purity of the drug does not become relevant until step two, when low purity or high purity of the drug may be a mitigating or aggravating factor.’</p>
<p>Having detected no dramatic shift in the Council’s proposed level of sentencing for drug trafficking offences, other than in respect of ‘mules’, the Court turned to the cases under reference, both involving importation, of which one may prove helpfully illustrative. When the truck driven by V., a Dutch lorry driver without prior convictions, was searched by Customs officers a large consignment of Class B drugs was detected hidden within his legitimate load: 240 kilos of methylethylcathinone (commonly known as 4-MEC), nearly four kilos of cannabis and a smaller quantity of amphetamine. In reviewing his sentence following guilty pleas comprising 42 months for importing 4-MEC with 18 months apiece concurrent for the lesser quantities, the Court noted that 4-MEC, a controlled drug that is still relatively unfamiliar to our courts, is a synthetically produced stimulant, akin in its psychoactive effect to khat. It is commercially available to purchase in bulk from China and the Ukraine. Though not the same as mephedrone, it produces similar but weaker effects. This consignment tested at 100 per cent purity and was estimated to have a wholesale value of between £960,000 and £1.4m, with a street value in the region of £2.4m to £3.2m. This was thus a massive importation initiative, indicative of a highly professional commercial operation, in which V. played a significant and trusted role in the chain of supply. In mitigation, this was an isolated incident and he was of previous good character, being also the sole carer of an elderly relative until his arrest. His role had been that of driver/courier, not organizer, and he had been a late replacement for the intended driver. Noting that the Crown Court judge had been encouraged by the prosecution as well as the defence to assume that the new guideline required more lenient sentences for this type of offence, the Court considered that V.’s offending merited at least eight years before credit for plea and substituted a term of six years’ imprisonment.</p>

<title>Class B supply: Substantial mitigation</title>
<p>As part of an undercover operation targeting drug dealing in Darlington, police officers visited an address where B. was willing to sell them small quantities (‘wraps’) of amphetamine. She sometimes made phone calls and sent texts to facilitate this retail supply. On one occasion she arranged to meet an undercover officer near the probation office to pass him a wrap before keeping her appointment there. Following her arrest it was apparent that she had acted in this way because her then partner had been immobilized following serious injury, and she had stood in for him and acted on his behalf. It was accepted by the prosecution that she played an operational but not a management or organizational role. She claimed that she had been unaware that her contribution would count as drugs supply. Though she had a few prior convictions attracting conditional discharges, these were neither relevant nor recent, none featuring drug offences. Reporting that B. was now no longer with her partner and was sole carer of two of her children, aged 12 and 15, the PSR writer assessed her to pose a low risk of reconviction, recommended a community order with a single requirement of supervision. She had recently been prescribed medication for depression.</p>
<p>On B.’s appeal against seven months’ months immediate imprisonment, following guilty pleas to seven counts of Class B drugs supply, the Appeal Court acknowledged that the sentencing judge had been right to identify that she had played a willing and significant role, supplying the drug on several occasions over a four week period, motivated by financial gain, at least for others, and despite her responsibility as a mother. However, was a custodial sentence appropriate, given that any such sentence would be of short duration and there was ‘powerful personal mitigation’? She had acted as a go-between while her partner was immobilized and her children would face a difficult period in her absence. The judge had failed to give adequate weight to her maternal responsibilities and the Court concluded that the sentence had been manifestly excessive, substituting a community order as proposed in the PSR. </p>
