<abstract>
<p>Waste and recycling systems are complex and far-reaching, but its mechanisms are poorly understood by the public, in some cases government organizations and even the waste management sector itself. The lack of empirical data makes it challenging to assess the environmental impact of trash collection, removal and disposal. This is especially the case for the global movement of electronic wastes. Senseable City Lab’s Trash Track project tackles this scarcity of data by following the trajectories of individual objects. The project presents a methodology involving active location sensors that were placed on end-of-life products donated by volunteers in the Seattle, Washington area. These tags sent location messages chronicling their journey, some over the course of a month or more. In this paper, the authors focus on the analysis of traces acquired from 146 items of electronic waste, estimating evaluating the environmental impact, including the travel distances and end-of-life treatments for the products. Combining this information with impact evaluation from the US Environmental Protection Agency’s Waste Reduction Model (WARM) allows for the creation of environmental impact profiles for individual pieces of trash.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Trash is a part of every person’s life, but the environmental impact of an individual end-of-life product is typically unknown. Consumers seem to be unaware of the fate of their end-of-life products, or at least unaware of the end-of-life options for their products. As waste generation increases in the United States and worldwide, it becomes more important than ever to understand the impact of trash.</p>
<p>Total municipal solid waste generation has more than doubled in the United States in the last 50 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0734242X12469822">US EPA, 2008</xref>). Despite increasing public awareness of environmental issues, recycling rates are still below expectations. According to the Container Recycling Institute, recycling rates for aluminium cans and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles have steadily declined since the early 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0734242X12469822">Container Recycling Institute, 2008</xref>). Other products have similar end-of-life treatment rates. Only roughly 10% of cell phones are reclaimed, despite the prevalence of store location drop-offs, manufacturer take-backs, and charity donation opportunities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0734242X12469822">US EPA, 2008</xref>). The impact of increasing trash production can be estimated with aggregate data, but the real impact of a single piece of trash, from the hands of a consumer to its end-of-life fate, is typically unknowable.</p>
<p>This paper presents the application of a novel tracking methodology for individual waste items for assessing the environmental impact of electronic waste collection and transportation. The data used in this paper was collected during the Trash Track project in 2009, the first large-scale application of active location tracking technology for municipal solid waste, deployed in the larger Seattle area in collaboration with a large group of volunteers, including 100 households and 500 individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0734242X12469822">Senseable City Lab, 2009</xref>). The overall purpose of the project is finding out what happens to trash and recyclables after their collection, mapping where it goes, and finally evaluating the implications of where it goes. The paper further reflects on the methodological advantages and drawbacks of the Trash Track approach for investigating global e-waste chains. The authors followed a wide variety of individual items of household refuse through the waste and recycling system, including, among others, food containers, packaging materials, and old electronic devices.</p>
<p>In a previous analysis of the overall data set, the items classified as electronic and household hazardous waste (HHW) stood out – they reported the longest traces, visited more intermediate facilities and involved a variety of transportation modes. The results indicated that in such cases transportation might substantially diminish the overall benefits of recycling, calling for further investigation from a transportation and collection perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0734242X12469822">Offenhuber et al., 2012</xref>). This paper takes a closer look at the subset of electronic waste and household hazardous items.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0734242X12469822">
<title>Definitions and significance of electronic waste</title>
<p>A number of different definitions for electronic waste (e-waste), or waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) exist, all of them encompassing ‘various forms of electric and electronic equipment that have ceased to be of any value to their owners’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0734242X12469822">Widmer et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>There are many reasons why the treatment of e-waste is more complex compared to other discarded materials. An electronic device consists of many different materials and components, some of which may be hazardous for human health and the environment, therefore requiring special treatment. Other components have inherent value as secondary raw materials and can be profitably reclaimed. At the same time, the recycling process of electronic devices is often costly and requires qualified labour. Finally, the volume generated by households is comparatively low, albeit constantly rising. All of these factors make a uniform centralized collection and treatment impracticable. Despite the small amount of e-waste within the municipal solid waste stream, its environmental impact is still significant. ‘E-waste contains more than 1000 different substances, many of which are toxic, such as lead, mercury, arsenic, cadmium, selenium, hexavalent chromium, and flame retardants that create dioxins emissions when burned. About 70 % of the heavy metals (mercury and cadmium) in US landfills come from electronic waste. Consumer electronics make up 40 % of the lead in landfills.’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0734242X12469822">Widmer et al., 2005</xref>)</p>
<p>Addressing these factors, a variety of different models have been developed for collecting the electronic waste (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0734242X12469822">Kahhat et al., 2008</xref>). However, the comparison between those models is hampered by a lack of empirical data about the actual movement of the materials. Our analysis will therefore focus on this area of most uncertainty, the collection and transportation stage.</p>
<p>Tracking waste can help to uncover the actual dynamics and topology of waste streams, which are not represented in existing data sources. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) usually do not report any transportation-related statistics in their annual municipal solid waste reports. Occasionally available collection statistics of individual facilities or geographic units may give an idea about the processed volumes, but in order to understand how these facilities are connected, individual items have to be followed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0734242X12469822">
<title>Background and literature</title>
<p>There is a broad consensus that the lack of empirical data is among the major challenges the whole waste management sector faces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0734242X12469822">Kreith and Tchobanoglous, 2002</xref>). This lack is aggravated especially in the United States by the range of different policies and regulations on the federal state level resulting in a lack of even and predictable enforcement regulations and standards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0734242X12469822">Kreith and Tchobanoglous, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The European Union’s WEEE directive represents a comprehensive policy approach including obligatory monitoring and reporting mechanisms for all kinds of electronic waste (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0734242X12469822">European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, 2003</xref>). Nevertheless, a lack of empirical data persists, and the European Commission has consequently adopted a recast of the WEEE directive, improving monitoring and making enforcement more stringent (Directives 2012/18/EU and 2012/19/EU).</p>
<p>A main policy approach for managing the end-of life stage of electronics is extended producer responsibility, extending the responsibility of a producer or retailer for a consumer product to its end-of life stage, thus embodying the polluter pays principle. The strategy combines a variety of different measures, including both voluntary and mandatory instruments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0734242X12469822">OECD, 2001</xref>). Product take-back systems, either voluntary or mandatory, are a central component of these strategies. In its mandatory form, take-back systems are often financed by a mandatory advanced recycling fee at purchase. Voluntary systems rely on certification programmes and negotiated agreements with individual producers and retailers.</p>
<p>From an economic standpoint, e-waste transport is a significant factor – it is estimated to account for 80% of the total costs of its recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0734242X12469822">Kang and Schoenung, 2005</xref>). In a material flow analysis of the WEEE system in Switzerland by R. Hischier et al., the authors found that also the overall environmental impact of processing electronic waste is dominated by transportation activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0734242X12469822">Hischier et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0734242X12469822" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methodology: technologies for tracking waste</title>
<p>The waste items were tracked using self-reporting location sensors in conjunction with the mobile communication network for reporting their location back at regular intervals. The approach allows for the comparison of the destinations, trajectories and transportation modes associated with different collection and processing mechanisms. Beyond measuring distances, the active location tracking approach is also useful for evaluating compliance on both the side of the user and service provider. From the recorded data, the authors derived information about collection mechanisms and transportation modes and augmented this data with environmental impact information from the literature.</p>
<p>Before making the decision to use self-reporting sensors for tracking waste, several alternatives were considered. The first option was visual tracking by a group of volunteers. This involves the coordinated search for objects from known source that are identifiable either by their appearance or through attached machine-readable labels. As an example, an incident in 1992 of a container filled with 29 000 bathtub rubber toys that fell from a cargo ship into the North Pacific Ocean has been the trigger for a long-term tracking project aimed at understanding the ocean currents. Since that time, a large community of volunteers helped spotting toys that washed ashore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0734242X12469822">Ebbesmeyer et al., 2007</xref>). However, applying such an approach is difficult due to the sheer volume and limited accessibility of most waste streams.</p>
<p>A second option would be passive tracking using self-identifying tags, typically using radio frequency identification technology (RFID). The RFID tags can be detected at close range using a reading device, are cheap and used extensively across different sectors including logistics, retail and production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0734242X12469822">Zhekun et al., 2004</xref>). The use of this technology in waste management has been evaluated and is currently gaining popularity, since it makes it possible to keep track of the waste generator, the physical properties of the discarded material and a chronicle of events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0734242X12469822">Binder et al., 2008</xref>). Implemented at scale, this could help making waste management more efficient and accountable.</p>
<p>For our purposes, the main drawback of this approach is the pervasive infrastructure that is required for the detection of the tags, which is not available at this point. A second general drawback is that even if such a reading infrastructure would be put in place, the detection could be easily avoided due to the limited detection range. The potential contamination and resulting environmental hazards from the composition of the tags is a last issue that may require further investigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0734242X12469822">Wäger et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The active location sensing approach was initially discussed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0734242X12469822">Lee and Thomas (2004)</xref>, who envisioned the use of VHF radio transmission for reporting back locations. Such an approach would still require physical proximity (small VHF transmitters have typically a range up to 35 miles) for detection, ruling out the possibility of global tracking. The Trash Track project addresses this restriction by using tags that use the mobile phone network for reporting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0734242X12469822">Boustani et al., 2011</xref>), making it possible for the tags to report back autonomously from almost any global location where this communication infrastructure is available; therefore accounting for the widest range of end-of-life scenarios and destinations. The used tags are based on Qualcomm’s inGeo System (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.qualcomm.com/solutions/location/ingeo">http://www.qualcomm.com/solutions/location/ingeo</ext-link>) and use both the network infrastructure and the global positioning system (GPS) for localization. The advantage of combining both systems is a faster acquisition of the more accurate GPS location and the more robust localization through the network, if the GPS fails to acquire a location fix.</p>

<title>Tagging and data collection</title>
<p>The researchers visited each participating household, and attached the sensors – devices slightly larger than a matchbox – to 15 to 20 items of household waste prepared by the volunteers according to a prioritized wish list prepared in advance. The physical tagging process came with a number of challenges. First, the attachment had to be strong enough to prevent the accidental or deliberate separation of the tracker from the object. At the same time, the appearance and weight of the waste item should remain unchanged, to ensure that the tagged object is treated just like an untagged one, for example during manual sorting in a material recovery facility. Furthermore, the trackers had to be protected against liquids and other physical forces present in the waste stream (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0734242X12469822">Figure 1</xref>). Finally, it had to be such that signal reception was not obstructed or inhibited in the process, for example by placing the tracker inside metal objects. These conflicting goals were achieved by casting a protective shell on location out of rigid epoxy foam, which would protect the tag from forces and liquids, while also providing for a secure attachment to the object. After 6 months of operation, a dataset of over 2000 spatiotemporal traces was acquired, of which a total number of 1152 could be used for further analysis.</p>

<title>Calculating the environmental impact of waste removal</title>
<p>The environmental impact of the discarded products can be broken up into two categories; the energy and emissions associated with transporting the products to their final destination, and the energy and emissions associated with the end-of-life treatments of the products. The information recorded during the study provides information about both of these impact sources. Tracking data can provide an accurate estimate of the distance traveled, which can be combined with average transportation data to yield an estimate of transportation consumption. In many cases, tracking data can lead us to the end-of-life treatment of a particular product. The final known position of an end-of-life product may correspond to an end-of-life facility, such as a landfill, recycling centre, or specialty remanufacturing plant. The end-of-life processing of the product will determine its environmental impact. Analysing the product type in conjunction with the facility type yields the most likely end-of-life processing, and thus provides an estimate of the end-of-life energy and environmental impact of the waste product.</p>
<p>However, measures of the environmental impact of product end-of-life are difficult to calculate. Accurately attributing all activities to an individual item can be difficult in both the transportation and disposal phases. Both of these phases suffer from inaccurate estimates of impact due to a lack of data. While the EPA WaRM model provides estimates for the transportation impact of end-of-life goods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0734242X12469822">US EPA and OAR, 2006</xref>), similar to McKinnon’s work, the impact factors are derived from those for basic freight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0734242X12469822">McKinnon, 2007</xref>). While these input-based measures can provide good estimates of overall fleet impact factors, waste transportation may not be well represented by this work. Because of the inhomogeneous nature of waste streams, vehicles may operate at lower than average capacity factor, and in many collection models the vehicles’ idle time is higher than typical, leading current transportation impact factors to underestimate the impact of hauling waste. In the realm of e-waste, the effects of end-of-life processing have not been well measured, as they are in the case of more mature recycling industries. For example, in the case of batteries, a wide variety of technologies have been proposed for their recycling with many in current use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0734242X12469822">Bernardes et al., 2004</xref>), but few of these processes have been characterized as a whole. Individual components have been characterized by the developing companies, for example, a simplified LCA provided by Umicore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0734242X12469822">Tytgat, 2011</xref>) suggests that using recycled LiCoO<sub>2</sub> could save about 70% of the energy of virgin material, but this number focuses only on the differences in energy of the smelting processes for new and recovered metals, ignoring disassembly, mechanical processing, slag disposal, and more. The EPA WaRM model also uses assumptions to achieve calculability that is optimistic. The model is based on materials – it considers closed-loop recycling, in which recovered materials save energy by offsetting new material production. The impacts of the actual recovery process are considered very simply. Between high estimates of the usefulness of the recovered material and low estimates of the required processing energy, the impact of recycling is overestimated. These concerns are particularly applicable to electronic waste, where recycled materials are rarely substituted for new, and multiple disassembly and mechanical and chemical processing stages may be necessary to recover the materials. For products that are not recycled, but remanufactured, even more limited data is available. Company-sponsored studies on laser jet print cartridges have even suggested that remanufacturing of cartridges may have a negative environmental impact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0734242X12469822">Four Elements Consulting, LLC, 2008</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0734242X12469822">
<title>Important variables</title>
<p>The transportation distance for the tracked e-waste items is directly represented in the location reports acquired from the devices. Based on the reporting cycles of 3, 4 and 6 h, the acquired traces have a low temporal resolution. Consequently, the reported traces are a linear approximation and shorter than the actual trajectories. Inaccurate GPS locations can potentially lead to longer traces, therefore such erroneous reports had to be filtered out beforehand.</p>
<p>Information about the waste type, the physical properties of the item as well as the location and time of tagging were recorded on location during the deployment.</p>
<p>An estimation of the general fate could include special disposal, regular recycling, or landfilling, as well as the disposal mechanism for a specific e-waste item based on the analysis of its destination and the facilities the item visited. Information about the nature of the destinations has been acquired from additional datasets including a geographic database of waste processing, storing and transporting facilities maintained by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0734242X12469822">US EPA (2009)</xref>, business directories, and services such as Google Places API (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/">https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/</ext-link>).</p>
<p>Based on the appropriateness of the treatment options available at the destination of an item and the waste stream, it is possible to draw in many cases conclusions about the compliance on the side of the service provider or the user. For example, it is possible to verify whether an item that passed through a waste-processing facility ended up in an appropriate place, or whether a universal waste item was discarded by the volunteer in the appropriate waste stream.</p>
<p>The estimation of the environmental impact of transportation in terms of consumed energy is based on the determination of the transportation mode and the weight of the individual product. The impact factors of a specific mode of transportation were used from literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0734242X12469822">Davis et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0734242X12469822">McKinnon, 2007</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0734242X12469822">
<title>Limitations of the dataset</title>
<p>The main limitation of the collected data are incomplete traces terminating before the item reaches its destination. This can have various reasons: the destruction of the sensor inside the waste stream due to treatment process or physical forces, the obstruction of the communication channel due to the item buried deeply underneath other material, stowed away inside a ship hull or located in a geographic region without reception from mobile networks. For the same reason, reception on the ocean beyond the immediate coastal region was unavailable.</p>
<p>The operation of the tags is also bound to certain geographic limits due to the available type network service. In the case of the technology that was used, [in our case, mobile networks compatible with the code division multiple access standard the recorded traces were constrained to the territory of the United States and the immediate border regions of Canada and Mexico. While a number of reports were received from harbor facilities, it was not possible to document transcontinental waste exports.</p>
<p>Variances in network and GPS reception also led to big differences in location accuracy, ranging from a few meters to several hundred meters, if only one cell-tower was reachable for the device. Such extreme cases led to location artifacts that had to be removed from the data set.</p>
<p>Limited battery life was another constraint: in our experiment, the batteries in the devices typically lasted between 3 and 6 months with reporting intervals of 3 to 6 h.</p>
<p>The limited sample size is a second limitation to the statistical significance of the results. While the deployment of hundreds of sensors requires a significant amount of financial and labor resources, such a sample size is still too small to account for the large variety of processes that may occur during the end-of-life stage of a product and yield statistically robust results for each of possible outcomes.</p>
<p>Finally, also compliance of volunteers was a potentially limiting factor. In some cases volunteers tried to reclaim the trackers from the waste stream or did not throw them away in the first place.</p>
<p>Many of these cases could be detected by careful individual inspection of the recorded traces. After removing devices that failed to report valid traces with more than two reports of reasonable accuracy and after removing traces where volunteer mistakes could be suspected, a total of 1152 traces were useable for further analysis, including 146 items of electronic waste and batteries .</p>

<p>The subset of 146 electronic waste items including batteries was composed as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0734242X12469822">Table 1</xref>. The dominant transportation mode for the vast majority of items was by truck, with fewer items transported by rail, air and ship (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0734242X12469822">Table 2</xref>). The recorded trajectories reported distances between 0.09 km and 6152 km (mean = 532 km, SD = 1289 km). The longest trace was reported by a printer cartridge transported by rail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0734242X12469822">Figure 3</xref>). As mentioned in the limitations section, the sensors did not capture shipping overseas due to lack of network reception beyond the coastal regions. The accuracy of the location reports varied, depending on whether a GPS signal could be received or only the less accurate localization through cell tower triangulation was available. In most cases the localization was accurate enough to identify individual facilities.</p>

<title>Destinations and compliance</title>
<p>The destination facility is characterized in broad categories including landfill, recycling facility, and special treatment facility, such as a cellphone recycling plant. In some cases, the last report would be sent from a transportation facility, which was subsequently labelled as in transit. Often the last report was sent en route from the road, in which case the destination was classified as unknown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0734242X12469822">Figure 4</xref> left). Within most electronic waste categories, special treatment facilities make up for a significant proportion of the destinations. The researchers also estimated the appropriateness of the treatment options offered at an identified destination facility for the tracked material. The appropriateness was coded as a binary value, judging it as appropriate if the destination facility is officially designated for processing the specific material; this does not imply a statement whether the process is the most desirable from, for example, an environmental standpoint. The majority of items that reported traces were processed in appropriate facilities; only computers and NiCd batteries stand out for their comparatively poor performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0734242X12469822">Figure 4</xref> right).</p>

<p>A second aspect of interest to us was the collection mechanism. While information was recorded from the volunteers about how they would discard the materials, this information alone was not reliable enough for deriving the collection mechanism. In the resulting data, the collection mechanism was estimated based on the nature of the first visited facility, as well as the overall trajectory of the item before this first visit. A shopping mall or a retail store would indicate a take-back programme; a postal facility, a mail-back programme, and a facility incorporated into the municipal curbside collection system would be designated as municipal. The results indicate that mail-back programmes are especially popular for cell-phones and printer cartridges, while larger items such as computers, cathode ray tube (CRT)-monitors and other electronic items were preferably dropped off at local e-waste recycling companies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0734242X12469822">Figure 5</xref>). Municipal collection was mainly used for batteries (also recommended by the City of Seattle) and printer cartridges.</p>

<title>Distance and transportation energy</title>
<p>The material categories of printer cartridges, cellphones, lithium-ion batteries included the longest traces recorded in the experiment. The surprisingly short traces of most tracked CRT monitors and computers may be attributed to the fact that these types are either dismantled locally (in which case the embedded tracker is destroyed) or shipped abroad (in which case the tracker is beyond signal reach). The data supports both scenarios – some items reported from local recycling facilities, computer components reported from harbour facilities in Seattle, Portland, OR and Vancouver, Canada.</p>
<p>However, the longer distances of the categories mentioned above do not necessarily translate to a higher environmental impact per item, as these items have very little weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0734242X12469822">Figure 7</xref>). Whereas TV sets weigh 14–30 kg, all collected traces longer than 1000 km were reported from items weighing less than 200 g, such as printer cartridges or cell-phones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0734242X12469822">Figure 7</xref>).</p>

<p>As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0734242X12469822">Figure 8</xref>, the two traces with the highest environmental impact were a CRT-based TV and a desktop computer (8.2 and 5.97 MJ), both reporting relatively short trajectories of 240 km leading from downtown Seattle to a recycling facility in Portland, OR.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0734242X12469822-fig8.tif"/></fig>
<p>Another factor is the fuel efficiency of the transportation mode (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0734242X12469822">Table 3</xref>). This can be illustrated by two trajectories from printer-cartridges that ended up in the same facility in Mexicali, Mexico. The cartridges were discarded in different locations of downtown Seattle and collected by two different commercial recyclers, who used different modes of transportation. One item was carried by truck along the shortest route via California, totaling a recorded distance of 2020 km. The other cartridge was transported by rail via Chicago over a total distance of 6150 km. However, the cartridge transported by train generated overall only a quarter of the transportation energy associated with the first trace, namely 0.12 versus 0.4 MJ for the transportation by truck (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0734242X12469822">Figure 9</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Active location tracking is a viable way of investigating the end-of-life paths of electronic waste. Shedding light on the transportation aspect characterized by a lack of empirical data. Compared to other waste streams, tracking works well for e-waste, as the stream is less hostile to sensitive electronics. Some inherent limitations have to be addressed – first of all the small sample size requires highly focused deployments to lead to statistically meaningful results. Combination of different datasets, including facility databases or real-time vessel schedules is beneficial for increasing the semantic value of the recording data.</p>
<p>The recorded data shows a multifaceted view on the collection and transportation of waste and recyclates. The potential environmental impact of transportation should not be disregarded as insignificant a-priori, since the recorded trajectories cover long distances and involve multiple modes such as trucking, train or airflight. Any estimation of recycling benefits requires therefore also considerations of the impact of the collection mechanism, the size and weight of the item, the used modes of transportation and the locations of specialized treatment facilities.</p>
<p>In terms of e-waste, within the limitation of our experiment staying constrained to the US it was surprising to see the long traces produced by some materials, including printer cartridges, batteries and cell phones. It has to be noted though that all items that traveled beyond 1000 km had a weight not exceeding 200 grams. Consequently, the environmental impact of their transport is moderate. The data set also demonstrated the importance of the transportation mode over distance.</p>
<p>In terms of future work, the real challenge is definitely the global tracking of electronic waste. This would require small devices that consume almost no energy while inactive, batteries powerful enough to survive more than six months with at least two reports per day, and software that would be able to adjust the behavior based on the region and available network signal to provide a more efficient use of available power resources. All of these features are available independently, but no available sensor is currently optimized for all of these requirements. Nevertheless, the authors foresee active waste tracking an important instrument for improving accountability of service providers while improving the efficiency of reverse logistics.</p>
