<abstract>
<p>In this article, I examine the bodily changes that soldiers undergo in an intensive counter-terrorism military training course. I argue that military draftees develop control and violent capabilities through Violent Reflexive Bodily Practices (VRBPs), a concept I introduce here. VRBPs, which form the core of training in this elite military unit, are simultaneously recursive, reflexive and reconstructive: they are expressed by the soldier’s body and inflicted upon his body, by using them more violence is created, and their aim is not breaking the body apart, but rebuilding it into a new entity. VRBPs are concrete body techniques that are not discussed through a broad theoretical or cultural approach but as a material and concrete experience that reconstructs individuals’ bodies. This article shows how ‘techniques of the body’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1466138112448026">Mauss, 1973</xref>) can be changed in a short period and reveals possible dynamics of habitually instilled capabilities.</p>

<p>Shachar was my first interviewee. He was a childhood friend who became a key informant. I knew Shachar did his military service in a special counter-terrorism unit of the Israeli military (IDF). As an Israeli woman, I, too had done compulsory military service, but Shachar revealed a new world to me. After I completed my doctoral thesis on the training process of this unit, I decided to share it with some of my informants. Shachar also read it and responded. The following conversation started on the phone, when Shachar called me very agitated:<disp-quote>
<p>Shachar: To think that the roots of aggression are embedded in me. The smells [of the sweat], it all came back, it all roused, it’s not me, I didn’t go through this, it can’t be that this is what I had to go through, now do you get it? That this is what I went through? It was hard, hard. It’s hard to read about it, it was so hard for me, really difficult, I was scared, it really frightened me to think that this is what I went through.</p>
<p>Author: Do you feel now, in hindsight, that you would want to serve there?</p>
<p>Shachar: I don’t know. It’s very frightening. Of course tomorrow I’ll say – yes. It scares me that this is what I went through, that this is what it did to my soul. It frightens me to think about the aggression, that it’s really a part of me. That if my son does something I might smack him – and if not him, then maybe my wife. But I am not a violent person, I’m gentle, you know me! But maybe I am violent, if I went through something like this. [I think that] the beast lives in me, it’s quiet, it’s drowsy, the beast is drowsy. If I once thought that it didn’t exist, it exists and it’s asleep and it’s very, very quiet and all you have to do is wake it up. And it’s possible to say, it’s really self-righteous to say, that it’s gone and doesn’t exist but that’s not true, the beast is drowsy.</p></disp-quote>Shachar never actually smacked his son or his wife. But when he reads sections of my interview with him and my theoretical analysis of his unit’s training process, he recalls his experiences in the military. Once again he physically feels the changes brought about by his military training and fears that the aggression he learned has stayed with him even after his release from his service. Shachar feels that the bodily and emotional changes resulting from only a month and a half of military training are still embedded within him, even after his discharge. Shachar’s thoughts on what he experienced and its impact on his life after his discharge were similar to those of many others I met during my research.</p>
<p>In this article I discuss the training process of soldiers who serve in a special counter-terrorism unit in the IDF. Specifically, I examine the bodily changes of participants in the ‘LoTar’ course (Lochama Ba’Terror, fighting against terror). I argue the soldiers develop the capacity for violence and control that is embedded in their bodies to the point such that the violence becomes ‘second nature’. These changes are produced by means of Violent Reflexive Bodily Practices (VRBPs). VRBPs are violent practices that are expressed by the soldier’s body and are inflicted upon his body. The violence of these practices is both a means and an end of the training process. Furthermore, I argue that these practices are recursive and reconstructive. That is, by using them, the army creates more violence. The aim of the practices is not breaking the body apart, but rebuilding it into a new entity. My research shows how ‘techniques of the body’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1466138112448026">Mauss, 1973</xref>) can be changed in a short period and reveals possible dynamics of habitually instilled capabilities.</p>
<sec id="sec1-1466138112448026"><title>Violent Reflexive Bodily Practices (VRBPs)</title>
<p>The use of violence in the military is particularly widespread during the training period. Various studies discuss the use of violence in military training as a means of developing a disciplined soldier and strengthening the military’s control over him (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1466138112448026">Bourne, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1466138112448026">Cockerham, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1466138112448026">Eisenhart, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1466138112448026">Lande, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1466138112448026">Sasson-Levy, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1466138112448026">Winslow, 1999</xref>). Violence in training is also used to intensify bonding between the members of the unit in light of the mutual suffering they undergo (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1466138112448026">Cockerham, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1466138112448026">Sion, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1466138112448026">Winslow, 1999</xref>). That is, these studies express how violence is executed on soldiers during their training in order to achieve something else, such as discipline or unit cohesiveness. However, in the context of this elite unit, violence is not only a means, but also a goal and a result of this training. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1466138112448026">Bourke (1999)</xref> suggests, all extreme training programs have a similar process: individuals need to be broken in order to be rebuilt as an efficient soldier-fighter. Using brutal methods, the military attempts to bring about the acquired intentions and reflexes needed for the soldier to become militarized and more aggressive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1466138112448026">Bourke, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Violence also plays an important role in other physical trainings, such as sports and martial arts (e.g. Bar-On <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1466138112448026">Cohen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1466138112448026">Messner, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1466138112448026">Spencer, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1466138112448026">Wacquant, 2004</xref>). In these fields, Bar-On <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1466138112448026">Cohen (2009)</xref> (following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1466138112448026">Kapferer, 1997</xref>) argues that ‘violence plays a recursive role; it is the cause that sets the exercise into motion, but it is also necessary for its solution’ (p. 177). Moreover, violence helps to create the desired physique as well, as Bar-On Cohen explains: ‘the bodies of the participants create eruptive violence and mold it to change the course of that violence to become something else’ (2009: 154). However, the subjects of my study learned violent capabilities through subjection to violence, which taught their bodies to inflict similar violent practices on others. Thus, the bodily practices used on the body teach the body to produce similar violent practices by itself. In other words, violent practices are not only recursive but also reflexive.</p>
<p>The concept of Reflexive Body Techniques (RBTs) expresses this idea. Drawing on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1466138112448026">Mauss’s (1973)</xref> concept of body techniques, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1466138112448026">Crossley (2005: 9)</xref> introduces the concept of reflexive body techniques (RBTs) and defines them as ‘those body techniques whose primary purpose is to work back upon the body, so as to modify, maintain or thematize it in some way’. In other words, RBTs are techniques of and on the body that are used to affect the body itself.</p>
<p>In his fieldwork on MMA (mixed martial arts) fighters training, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1466138112448026">Spencer (2009)</xref> describes specific RBTs he terms ‘body callusing’. These are RBTs that work by subjecting the body to violence. He explains:<disp-quote>
<p>Unlike professional golfers, for example, professional MMA fighters’ bodies are subject to immense levels of pain and must inflict a level of pain almost unrivalled in sport. As such, fighters must be subject to a process I call <italic>body callusing</italic>, whereby the fighter takes his/her body as a site of action and aggressively seeks […] to harden the body and turn it into a weapon. (p. 127)</p></disp-quote>Moreover, Spencer shows how body techniques contribute to the production of a particular MMA fighter habitus ‘as a lived-through structure-in-process that is continually subject to change through the learning of additional body techniques and the working on the body in and through reflexive body techniques’ (p. 120). RBTs have a role in constructing a body capable of both giving and taking pain, an aspect that is necessary for participation in that practice.</p>
<p>This idea is reflected in the training of soldiers in the LoTar unit, where the violence used on the soldiers is meant to produce bodies with even more brutal capacities. The continual use of violence on the soldiers alters the immediate bodily responses with which they arrived at the military, such as fainting and falling, fear, and other physical and emotional sensations of reluctance to commit violence. As violent practices are used against the soldiers, the soldiers themselves learn to inflict pain on others during their training. Violence induces bodies to employ violence themselves in an immediate and constant manner. To refer to the multiple means and results folded in the use of violence, in this article, I would like to introduce the concept of Violent Reflexive Body Practices (VRBPs). VRBPs point not only to the reflexivity of body practices but also to the recursive fashion of violence in that process. VRBPs are the means and the end of the training process of the soldiers. By using these violent practices the body itself changes and becomes violent. Moreover, I argue that the violent practices do not only break the soldier’s body and change it, they also rebuild it and reconstruct it physically and emotionally, such that internal control becomes part of the violent capabilities. In other words, soldiers not only gain physical control over their bodies (as Spencer and Bar-On describe), but their bodies become honed and become weapons, and they also gain control over their instinctive, reflexive physical and emotional responses. Through VRBPs, the soldiers actually overcome their innate responses to violence and produce new responses instead.</p>
<p>In sum, VRBPs produce a new body with new capabilities for violence and control; they connect body and emotion, action and reaction in the new soldier’s body. Hence, VRBPs are simultaneously reflexive, recursive, and constructive. They work on the body through the body; by using violence they create more violence that assists in reconstructing new bodily capabilities of violence and control that are embedded in the soldier’s body.</p>

<sec id="sec2-1466138112448026"><title>Research methods</title>
<p>The article is based on research conducted among soldiers who served in a special counter-terrorism unit<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1466138112448026">1</xref></sup> in the Israeli military (IDF) between 1987 and 1996.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1466138112448026">2</xref></sup> I conducted in-depth interviews with 18 soldiers from the unit in 2001 and 2002, about five to 10 years after they were discharged from the military. The oldest soldier was drafted into the unit in 1987, and the youngest in 1993. I reached the interviewees by means of the snowball method. The initial interviewees were friends and close acquaintances who agreed to share their experiences with me. After they were interviewed, they referred me to others who served in their unit.</p>
<p>The interviews were completely open-ended: at the start of each meeting I asked: ‘Tell me about your military service from the day you were drafted up until your discharge.’ From that point on, the stories flowed, and at times I slowed them down and asked about specific issues which I felt were essential to understanding their stories. Each interview lasted about two hours. Interestingly, soldiers devoted a large amount of time of the interview to describing the training period relative to the overall military service description. In particular, the soldiers gave a very detailed description of what took place during the LoTar course, devoting up to a third of the interview to this course alone. The LoTar course lasts only a month and a half, a small part of a training process that lasts from eight months to a year, and a tiny part of the three years of full military service. These findings led me to carefully examine what took place in this course and to examine its influence on the soldiers’ narrative of their military service and on the bodily changes that became embedded during that period.</p>
<p>In that sense this study was conducted anthropologically, where the researcher goes to the field and produces knowledge through the engagements with informants rather than by having a preliminary theory at hand. The field, in this case, is not an example or a case to strengthen or weaken a pre-existing theory (e.g. the grounded theory approach), but is instead a venue for an inquiry, of evolving unexpected problems one should pose on, question and try to conceptualize in a generative manner, and at the same time without subordinating them to any totalizing coherent theory. In this regard, while I was getting into the field I did not know what would be found and what would be significant, even though I knew a lot about the IDF and about the interviewers’ service.</p>
<p>Like most Israeli women, I served in the military and thus was familiar with the field from the beginning. In addition, I knew some of the soldiers personally and was familiar with their career paths. However, even as an ‘insider’ in relation to this field I was mostly surprised by their descriptions of the training process, and especially with the LoTar training experiences and the intensive violence that took place during that period. My interest in violence became the center of the analysis of the research due to the soldiers’ stories and not as a strategic priority. Only after I conducted the first two interviews did I decide to focus my study on the LoTar course. After I developed my research thesis, I asked some of the informants to read it and offer their comments. I documented their responses, which contributed considerably to the development of my research analysis.</p>
<p>In the following pages, I will show how, through VRBPs, the soldiers first overcome fear, and then inhere body control that is inextricable from their violent capabilities. I will then describe how the soldiers learn to absorb and perform violence, and how a new body that expresses these capabilities emerges at the end of this training process.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1466138112448026"><title>Bodily control: Overcoming fear</title>
<p>The capability to control fear as part of a new desired action of the soldier is usually discussed as part of the literature on ‘emotional control’. The importance of emotional control and its relevance within the military framework has been explained as either an individual trait enabling soldiers’ emotional stability in and after battles (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1466138112448026">Grossman, 1995</xref>), or as part of the process of becoming a masculine body and a fighting male (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1466138112448026">Ben-Ari, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1466138112448026">Sasson-Levy, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1466138112448026">Sion, 1997</xref>). However, these approaches do not explain the connection between emotional control and violence<italic>.</italic></p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1466138112448026">Ben-Ari (1998)</xref>, in this regard, suggests emotional control is a necessary condition for the soldier to display the violence he was taught during his training, especially when the external situation might harm the soldier’s ability to maintain internal arousal, resulting in damage to the soldier’s ability to produce the required response at the ‘moment of truth’. Similarly, from a broader perspective on violence and emotions, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1466138112448026">Collins (2008)</xref> argues that emotions are preliminary to the violent act, that is, there is a contingency between certain emotions (e.g. anger, fear) and the execution of violence. Hence, rather than observing emotions (e.g. pain, anger, pleasure) as an aftermath of a violent act or a stressful situation (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1466138112448026">Das, 1995</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1466138112448026">Katz, 1999</xref>, respectively)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1466138112448026">3</xref></sup> emotional control becomes a means or a condition for producing violence.</p>
<p>I argue that emotions are not ‘merely’ a factor providing motivation for violence to happen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1466138112448026">Rosaldo, 2004 [1989]</xref>), or a situational factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1466138112448026">Collins, 2008</xref>), but part of the bodily practice that must occur to produce the action of violence. Emotions are a bodily technique that creates conditions for the actions that ensue.</p>
<p>Moreover, Collins argues that <italic>fear</italic>, in particular, must be overcome to enable practices of violence to happen:<disp-quote>
<p>Violent situations are shaped by an emotional field of tension and fear. […] No matter how motivated someone may be, if the situation does not unfold so that confrontational tension/fear is overcome, violence will not proceed. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1466138112448026">Collins, 2008</xref>: 19–20)</p></disp-quote>To put it another way, an inextricable connection exists between control and violence; the ability to control fear is a preliminary condition to proceeding with violence. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1466138112448026">Collins (2008)</xref> as well as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1466138112448026">Katz (1999)</xref>, Rosaldo (2004 [1989]), and others discuss these emotions in a deterministic manner, where they refer to the conditions of an external situation rather than to the actor as the one who provides them. For Collins, in particular, the connection between emotions and violence is part of situational analysis of violence, marking the certain conditions that need to take place before violence happens. In my study, emotional control, and body control more comprehensively, appear as part of an active bodily training and in the end of the course as part of the soldier’s bodily embedded capabilities. That is to say, violence and control can be learned and not only ‘evolved’ from a particular situation.</p>
<p>Body control is thus part of the process of becoming a warrior, part of the ‘profession’, and gained through its training program. In that sense it does remind us of other professional trainings that have been discussed in light of the concept of <italic>emotion work</italic>. Emotion work is defined as the emotional control that subjects required to actively express in order to present the suitable professional behavior (see especially <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1466138112448026">Hochschild, 1983</xref>; and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1466138112448026">Bolton and Boyd, 2003</xref>, on airline cabin crews, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1466138112448026">Mears and Finlay, 2005</xref>, on fashion models, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1466138112448026">Orzechowicz, 2008</xref>, on actors as privileged emotion managers). However, in these studies it seems that as more emphasis is given to the power of the individual in the process of obtaining and performing emotions, the emotional change is less deep and less permanent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1466138112448026">Bolton and Boyd, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1466138112448026">Garot, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1466138112448026">Lewis, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1466138112448026">Mears and Finlay, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1466138112448026">Orzechowicz, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1466138112448026">Williams, 2003</xref>). Emotional changes are described in terms of an individual’s ability to juggle between different ‘emotion work dependent upon situation demands’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1466138112448026">Bolton and Boyd, 2003</xref>), or as the managing of ‘feelings onstage’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1466138112448026">Orzechowicz, 2008</xref>), thus not necessarily continuing this emotion work afterwards. That is, in terms of the depth of the emotional change, these studies express a temporal emotional presentation; their actors can adopt and remove different emotions for different needs. In what follows we will see that the soldiers’ body control (which consists of both emotional and physical abilities) is not dependent upon specific situations and limited in place and time, but rather part of an inherent bodily capability.</p>
<p>The trainings in the LoTar course are saturated with violence. Soldiers are subjected to violence all day, especially when ‘krav maga’ (close combat) training takes place, wherein the soldiers perform violent practices.<disp-quote>
<p>And all day you are like that: Terrorist! Back, forth! Run there, six on six, run there! Everyone to the wall! A hundred push-ups! Fifty stomach crunches! Boom, boom! All the time hitting and hitting. You do the push-ups and get hit. People are fainting. The instructor is hitting all the time. When you do practice, you are still afraid, you stand in a row, hands on your head, and the instructor comes and hits you in the stomach, in the face. You see your friends; you see them fall like cards. You know that you are next. You know that in a second you will see all black and faint. (Danny)</p></disp-quote>During the beginning of the course soldiers describe feelings of fear and helplessness that overshadow their entire experience. The fear stems primarily from their apprehension of the violence employed against them. As Shay described:<disp-quote>
<p>I wake up in the morning and I feel afraid. It’s a permanent fear. You always feel fear; you are always under stress and feel frightened and threatened. The threat, the highest threat is from the krav maga. There everyone is afraid. There you are just terrified.</p></disp-quote>Shachar describes physical symptoms that accompanied his mental fear:<disp-quote>
<p>And then the hard part of the day starts: the close combat. For a month and a half, two months, everyday at five to five I would get diarrhoea. Terrible diarrhoea. Why? Only from fear. I remember myself, I would tremble …</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>And the soldiers had no relief from the fear at night. Danny describes the sensation of having emotionally reached rock bottom, at the end of a day of training.<disp-quote>
<p>I remember one time, my friend and I, we were in the tent, one bed right next to the other, lying in a fetal position, and we both said, we have to always remember this moment. Because there’s nothing less than this, like there’s nothing lower than this, there’s nothing worse than this or more depressing. You’re sitting and you’re helpless, you know that in another ten minutes you’re going to get the beating of your life and pass out, and pass out about ten times over the next two hours, and you’re afraid. We said that we can’t forget these moments, we said we can’t, we just can’t! Anything else that happens in life won’t compare to this and we can’t forget that we got to this point. It’s like we reached the top of a mountain, you always have to remember that you were there. More precisely, to be so far down that you can never get any lower, and if you ever are so low again you won’t feel sorry for yourself because you’ve already been lower.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>However, throughout the course the soldiers learn to overcome sensations of fear. They learn to control the physical and emotional unwanted arousal and hence to acquire the violent capabilities they need. Shachar describes how his friends, who joined the unit earlier than him and thus had been already participating in the course before him, had started to express control over these fearful reactions:<disp-quote>
<p>I remember that the first thing they teach you at the beginning, is that when someone kicks you, you need to do ‘hoo’ – to blow out the air. When I got there, I didn’t know how to do the ‘blow out’. I remember myself for a couple of times lying on the floor, groaning on the floor, unable to breathe. Finished. Crushed. I remember the sultriness, as if it were happening now. And slowly, slowly they teach you how to be beaten. I remember my friends, when the instructor came and hit them in their stomach, or kicked them in the stomach, or in their legs, or slapped their faces – they were not afraid. They were standing still.</p></disp-quote>That is, during the course, the soldiers start to immunize themselves from fear. They gain control over their fear, over their immediate reaction of fear and reluctance to face violence. Bodily control cannot be divided from the overall training, and is achieved through VRBPs used in the entire training period. However, particular exercises are devoted to strengthening this capability in the course. In <italic>locking in</italic> exercises, or <italic>hina’alut</italic>, the soldier needs to focus fiercely on the target, and to control any other feelings, thoughts, bodily reactions that might disturb his expected action, to exclude everything else in order to achieve his goal. As Amit describes:<disp-quote>
<p>You learn a certain behavior; how to act. The basis is <italic>locking in</italic> [on the target]. There is a target and you have to get to it at the other end of the room. There is an exercise of <italic>hina’alut</italic> that is called ‘easy passage’. The whole crew stands together in the middle of the room, there’s someone behind them, they’re blocking the way, and you get hit. You have to get to the person in back, that’s essentially the base. You have to focus on the target. It doesn’t matter what happens, you have to pass through them and get to him […] You have to get to the target. It doesn’t matter what happens on the way.</p></disp-quote>Similarly, Shachar shows how the locking in exercises in the course are connected to the ability to act forcefully in the soldiers’ missions later on in the service:<disp-quote>
<p>And then <italic>locking in</italic> exercises start. What are <italic>locking in</italic> exercises? It is as if there were an event with a terrorist, 100 meters away from you. And even if there are 100 people in the way to get there, you don’t care. You will come and you will push everyone, and you won’t close your eyes for a second, and you will always have control over your weapon, and it doesn’t matter how much and how you get beaten, you will get to the target in a minimum time. The contrary will be that you will be deterred. That you’ll stop and be afraid to do that. And to be <italic>locked in</italic> it means you get into anyone who is on your way – ‘boom’ – and nothing else matters to you.</p></disp-quote>The soldier’s ability to control his fear and the apprehension from violence is the stage preceding his ability to express the violence. The soldier who manages to exercise a high degree of control successfully manages to single-mindedly pursue his mission, ignoring all distractions, and reaches his target. A soldier who cannot control his body will not be able to control external disturbances that might rattle his determination on the path to his target, and he will not then be able to use the violence necessary to get to his ‘target’.</p>
<p>The soldier’s ability to maintain bodily control, both physical and emotional,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1466138112448026">4</xref></sup> is an essential part of his new bodily capabilities. As we will see next, this capability is not separate from the capability to absorb and inflict violence. It is actually a condition primary to expressing the needed violence. Hence violence and control are crucially connected, both in the training process and in the resultant bodily changes and capabilities.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1466138112448026"><title>Violence at work: Absorbing and attacking</title>
<p>Soldiers learn the capacity for violence in two main phases: <italic>sfiga</italic> and <italic>tekifa</italic>, or absorbing and attacking. In the <italic>sfiga</italic> training the soldiers learn to ‘absorb the blows’ and to remain standing when being hit. If soldiers recoil from the blows they get hit even more. As a result, the violent punishments cause them to refrain from behaviors that invite more violence. Eli explains it in the following description:<disp-quote>
<p>Eli: You’re also not allowed to break down too early, if the instructor comes and hits you and you immediately start to whine, then he will beat you for at least 15 minutes. So when he comes and hits you, you can’t move.</p>
<p>Author: You’re not supposed to respond?</p>
<p>Eli: No. If you respond, he hits you even harder. And this is from the beginning of the basic training. This is what they’re training you for: if they hit you, you don’t double over and beg for mercy, you just stand and don’t move.</p>
<p>Author: And it works? Can you really respond like that? [by standing still while being hit by the instructor]</p>
<p>Eli: Not to move? Sure. Look, I’ll keep coming back every time to the example of <italic>an animal</italic>. It’s like a dog. You come, you hit the dog every time he pees in the living room, and then he’ll learn not to pee in the living room. That’s how it is here too. In the beginning they hit you and you bend over. And then they hit you even more because you’re bending over, so you learn not to bend. They’re training you.</p></disp-quote>The intensiveness of the violence inflicted on the soldiers increases over time. However, the soldiers’ ability to absorb this pain strengthens accordingly:<disp-quote>
<p>And from light flicks it increases and increases. And sometimes they hit us in the face, in the head, in all kinds of areas … And overtime it was harder to break us, since it really didn’t matter to or trouble us. (Eli)</p></disp-quote>Thus, the soldiers became inured to the pain. They even became able to alter their primal responses to the attacks. Shachar describes how his body, which fell and fainted from the blows at the beginning of his training, learned after a while to remain stoic while under attack and also to attack back:<disp-quote>
<p>Now, I don’t know if you ever got a ringing slap or a punch in the face, but when you get punched in the face, the only sensation is total blackness in the eyes. Everything they show you in the movies is bullshit. The minute you get punched in the right spot you’re supposed to fall. You’re supposed to faint, and if you’re not hit hard enough your eyes are just supposed to go black […] and suddenly you learn that you can stand. Even if you get punched in the face, and all you can see is black or, you can’t see anything, you’re still standing! Standing! And a normal person would have fainted. And suddenly you learn that if you get punched in the face, you won’t flinch, you will raise up your hands and attack him back. And that is Krav Maga.</p></disp-quote>After a soldier’s body can remain stable in face of the violence directed against him, he learns to use this violence himself. In what is called <italic>tekifa</italic> training, the soldier learns to attack back and to fight his friends very forcefully. At the end of each week soldiers were gathered together into the same room and were required not only to express an ability to ignore the physical obstacles, but also to express the use of violence. This training is called ‘the battles’. The soldiers are expected to fight each other with as much strength as they can muster, to hit their friends and use the violent practices they learned during the week in these battles. Alon describes these battles:<disp-quote>
<p>Every Thursday there are battles. What are battles? The group enters; there is a mattress, a square mattress. The crew stands around the mattress, the instructor stands in the middle and brings in two guys, they put on flak jackets, helmets, some kind of protection, and they come in. The minute he says ‘battle’, from your perspective that’s the enemy! This is the enemy! You get in there with as much strength as you have! You’ve got all the strategies you learned, or didn’t learn, kicking, punching, hitting everything in sight; you’ve got to overwhelm your enemy. Even after he falls, you’re allowed to keep on hitting him, until the instructor stops you. Actually, you have to keep on hitting him until the instructor stops you, that’s the definition.</p></disp-quote>In these battles, if the soldier does not hit as he was taught to do, and does not use the expected amount of force/violence, he will receive a humiliating and violent response from the instructor. Avner describes this situation:<disp-quote>
<p>You learn a certain type of kick. And then the instructor comes, you’re practicing and kicking and he tells you, that’s not good and demonstrates the kick on you, how it should be done, how much it hurts if it’s done right. You do something wrong, the instructor can grab you by the nose or the cheek, stick his finger in your mouth and drag you across the whole room and humiliate you, everybody is standing around watching, to humiliate you, to drag you, to make you into nothing, to kick you. For anything, if you’re not standing right, for example, you always have to stand and defend yourself. If you’re not standing right, boom, you get kicked in the face.</p></disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1466138112448026"><title>The new body: Reconstructing violence and control</title>
<p>By the end of this training course the soldiers acquire new bodily capabilities; at first, they stop their rejection to violence and control the fear and afterwards start to attack in a way that is described as natural and immediate. As Shachar describes his body at the end of the LoTar course:<disp-quote>
<p>This is the added value of the terror course. You know to control a weapon; you know not to be afraid. I personally, until now [until today], I think that if anyone will come at me, when I was at the Scouts in the twelfth grade at high school, the first thing I would do is run. Now the first thing that I would do is not be afraid. I would slap him on the face or punch him, I will simply not be afraid to get into a fight. As if I have total self-confidence, in my body, in my strength. You understand that you could be a ‘great killer’. Incredible […] at the end of the course you understand that you are a special warrior. A warrior that can simply beat nearly any person.</p></disp-quote>As explained earlier, this entire training period lasts one and a half months; the new bodily capabilities are taught within only a short period. Notwithstanding this, by means of VRBP we see the possibility to mark a bodily change that will produce a very forceful and immediate reaction in a short period of training. As Avner summarizes:<disp-quote>
<p>So during the time we had there they couldn’t teach us the wonders of karate, or I don’t know what. So they just made us into some kind of animal, very aggressive, animalistic, and this is what’s called ‘locked in’ [on the target]. So that when you need something, you’re locked in on the target and you run and you break the wall and you go through the wall and get there. And this is what the LoTar training is really all about.</p></disp-quote>The sustainability of these capabilities as we have seen in Shachar’s reactions at the beginning of the article was discussed by the soldiers during our conversations. The soldiers have recalled what they felt during the training in various situations after their discharge from the military. Most soldiers did not express an active aggressive reaction, but only said that they felt its potential again, and the possibility of expressing it. As Eli describes:<disp-quote>
<p>Until today, you know, I find myself in a fight in the car or the street, and I see in front of myself someone really ‘big’, and even though I don’t have the fitness, my mind situation tells me that I can ‘eat’ him. I can bite him with my teeth and tear his ear.</p></disp-quote>Although Eli did not put this potential into action, in some situations his aggressive capabilities are aroused again. Gal also experienced a sense of aggression after his release, which he did not act upon:<disp-quote>
<p>I’m waiting in the car at the traffic light and a soldier who’s looking to hitch a ride asks me: ‘Where are you headed?’</p>
<p>So I tell him: ‘Here’, and point to the bench across the street.</p>
<p>And again he asks me: ‘Where?’</p>
<p>And I tell him: ‘Forget it, I’m not giving you a ride.’</p>
<p>So then he says: ‘What’s your problem, you want a fist in your face?’</p>
<p>And I feel the adrenaline kicking in, and I’m getting all worked up, and I tell him: ‘Please do’ (meaning the fist in my face), and I’m armed, maybe I won’t draw my gun but I’m not afraid.</p></disp-quote>Yehuda similarly reflects on his aggressive reactions:<disp-quote>
<p>I think that whether I like it or not, this period [the LoTar course] turned me into an aggressive person. Aggressive in my reactions and at the same time it caused me to hate any aggressiveness. I know this is a contradiction. Before, I was a person who didn’t like to fight, and today I love it even less. Nevertheless, I can find myself reacting in a way that a minute afterwards I would say was too aggressive. But somehow the aggressiveness has become part of your nature. […] it’s something in my reflexes. The aggressiveness has become an immediate response that you react with to anything, prior to your thinking about what you want to do and how you want to react.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>These examples raise questions about whether the bodily changes the soldiers inhered might even go beyond the limited time of the training and the military service. A complete exploration of this subject lies beyond the scope of this article. However, future researchers of VRBPs may wish to study how VRBPs affect ex-soldiers’ bodies, including their emotional control, whether permanently or for some period of time after their discharge.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1466138112448026"><title>Against representation</title>
<p>Bodily training in military and sports training is used to cause a new behavior to be available immediately, almost ‘automatically’. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1466138112448026">Holmes (1985)</xref> states, the conditioning ensures that while the soldiers are becoming exhausted they can still perform as they are expected to, because they are performing automatically. In contrast, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1466138112448026">Messner (1992)</xref> disputes the assumption that the performance is completely automatic. Even though the athletes in his research at times report a sense of automatic responses by their bodies, he claims these actions are still subjected to ‘critical reflection, moral deliberation, and chance’ (p. 67). As one of his informants described the way he ‘faked’ an animal behavior:<disp-quote>
<p>When people told me that I wasn’t an animal and didn’t have a killer instinct, it really hurt. So I faked it as best I could and it actually worked. I growled and swore and did all those many things, but my heart wasn’t there, because I kept thinking, knowing, that I was acting! But when my father played football, I knew he wasn’t acting – he was a killer, an animal, a man. And I wasn’t. (pp. 66–7)</p></disp-quote>Messner thus concludes that athletes are not ‘made’ through a Pavlovian system of reward and punishment. They are human beings, often incapable of doing the kind of ‘emotional management’ that is necessary to participate in competitive athletics. This question is also addressed in a way by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1466138112448026">Bourdieu (1977)</xref>, who claims that practices cannot be explained totally in mechanistic terms. There must be an act of internalization and of ‘imitation’ in order to acquire the new abilities. The <italic>habitus</italic> is a mediating structure between understanding the behavior as mechanistic and viewing it as an expression of a directed and free will.</p>
<p>However, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1466138112448026">Tarr (2008)</xref> argues, for Bourdieu, ‘bodily habits, once they become habitual cease to be conscious’ (p. 488). Analyzing his fieldwork on the Alexander Technique (AT), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1466138112448026">Tarr (2008)</xref> argues that the habitual practices activated in this training are cultivated through a reflective process: ‘In AT, however, conscious control is always desirable […]. It is not that activities do not eventually become habitual … but that there is a constant drive to have conscious awareness of them’ (p. 489). That is, ‘AT continues to require somatic modes of attention no matter how long one has been doing it’ (p. 489). Other studies also emphasize the use of cognitive schemes in the process of military socialization (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1466138112448026">Ben-Ari, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1466138112448026">Herbert, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Building on this discussion, I suggest moving beyond the distinction between conscious and automatic actions. The soldier’s behavior is not solely a result of getting an outside punishment or reward, but also a result of his gaining internal control during that process. Moreover, the new capabilities are a result of his inhering these reactions and producing violence actively by himself. I show that the soldiers embedded violent capabilities by means of VRBP no less than by the manner in which the process operates on them. The intensive violence used against them is part of their path to acquiring these abilities. In using the term ‘reflexive’ in a different sense than a conscious work of the self, but as a body working on the body (following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1466138112448026">Crossley, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1466138112448026">Spencer, 2009</xref>), I argue that these soldiers, trained by VRBPs, gained bodily control, learned to absorb pain, and then produced violence through an active involvement of their body.</p>
<p>Repetitive violent bodily practices are essential to instilling violent capabilities. Repetition seems to be central to learning physical techniques and training the body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1466138112448026">Mauss, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1466138112448026">Spencer, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1466138112448026">Wacquant, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1466138112448026">Spencer (2009)</xref>, for example, shows how through repetition, fighters learn new fighting techniques and how these techniques are ingrained in the body to the point that they are utilized pre-reflexively in a fight. Bodily transformation demands these reflexive and recursive practices: training the body through the body, the use of violence to create violence. The bodily change is achieved through repetition and the intensity of the action and not through a high level of consciousness. Moreover, the intensity of the VRBPs enables the military to change the habitual behaviors that the soldiers originally had and to instill them with new capabilities in a short period of time. Other literature on martial arts (Bar-On <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1466138112448026">Cohen, 2009</xref>; Spenser, 2009) and on the Alexander Technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1466138112448026">Tarr, 2008</xref>) emphasize that long-term training is needed in order to achieve control of the correct bodily technique. Yet through VRBPs unwanted physical and emotional reactions are cancelled and new bodily reactions are created within a very short period of time.</p>
<p>Hence, VRBPs involve practices that are at once and the same time recursive, reflexive and reconstructive. First, the body is changing through the work of the body on itself. That is, reflexive practices are not aimed at higher level of consciousness or self-reflexivity, but refer to the use of the body on the body. Second, in this process violence works in a recursive manner: violence is the means and the end of the training. Through subjection to violence the body learns to absorb pain and suppress fearful emotions, and later on to inflict pain on other bodies. Third, the use of VRBPs reshapes and builds a new body. The violent practices not only tear the body apart but also enable its reformation. VRBPs unite violence and control capabilities such that neither of them stays at a performative level, but both are embedded within the soldier’s body at the end of his training.</p>
<p>This article contributes to the broad literature interested in the concept of habitus (as termed by Mauss and developed by Bourdieu) and its implementation in various fields of research. Although acknowledging the importance of this concept, my findings vary from it in two main aspects that seem to be essential to Mauss’s and Bourdieu’s definition of habitus and in particular to techniques of the body. Mauss uses ‘habitus’ to explain historically, collectively embodied practices in particular society or culture. More specifically Mauss describes body techniques as ‘the social nature of the ‘‘<italic>habitus</italic>’” (p. 73); he argues that: ‘these ‘‘<italic>habits</italic>’’ do not just vary with individuals and their imitations, they vary especially between societies’ (p. 73). Thus Mauss’s interest was mainly to explain what is common and shared by society’s members, and how a scientist needs to generalize this action into a theory. In this regard, Mauss makes a distinction between ‘natural sciences’ and psychological-sociological studies. The former are interested in what he refers to as the <italic>concrete</italic> and the <italic>unknown</italic>, whereas the latter wishes to explain the <italic>abstract</italic> and the <italic>known.</italic> Anthropologists, he argues, move from what is concrete to the abstract; from the description to the theory.</p>
<p>Hence, Mauss asks why techniques of the body <italic>have become common</italic> in a particular society (how do we know how to swim; why do we all do it in a certain way). This does not mean that Mauss was not interested in change; on the contrary, Mauss initially noticed these practices and their common existence in moments of difference, when things were not the same and when new techniques emerged and replaced previous ones. However, his entire concept of the ‘techniques’ of the body draws from Plato’s explanation of the term ‘technique’ which is an action that is <italic>effective</italic> and <italic>traditional</italic>. Hence for Mauss, the sustainably of techniques (i.e. the known) was what was most important about them and what needed to be explained (i.e. theoretically). That is, Mauss was most interested in how ‘from society to society men know how to use their bodies’ (p. 75).</p>
<p>In this analysis, following Spencer, I emphasize the <italic>dynamics</italic> of bodily practices and bodily techniques that intensify the possible <italic>change</italic> and inducement of the body itself, and how these changes are achieved in a <italic>short period</italic> rather than in a traditional historical manner. In terms of the temporality and the dynamics of bodily practices, this study points to the possibility of marking deep bodily changes in a short period that remain beyond the limited time and space of the moment of training.</p>
<p>Moreover, if Mauss’s later scientific goal was to move from the <italic>concrete</italic> to the <italic>abstract</italic> and from the <italic>unknown</italic> to the <italic>known</italic>, this article emphasizes quite the opposite. Thus, this study moves back from the abstract to the concrete, from a theory of body and violence to concrete violent bodily practices. The goal of the article is not to provide another general theory, but to follow concrete eventuality of bodies, and the way these bodies are trained and gain new bodily capabilities through the very immediate and reflexive techniques of their own bodies. In that sense, at the analytical level, this article is in line with other studies on violence and body that write ‘against’ representation and against meaning (e.g. Bar-On <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1466138112448026">Cohen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1466138112448026">Kapferer, 1997</xref>, 2004). Similarly, my analysis is not centered on the question of what the training represents <italic>beyond</italic> itself in the entire culture, military culture, or Israeli culture. Nor do I ask how meanings of soldiering and masculinity are reproduced through this training practice. Rather, I ask how the body changes during the training period and what types of concrete practices and human actions are involved in this process, and how violence as a means and an end goal of this practice modifies, reconstructs and recreates the soldier’s body.</p>
