<abstract>
<p>Members of the bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) superfamily are expressed in the testis and epididymis and are believed to have different biological functions during testicular and epididymal development. Smad1 is one of the signal transducers of BMP signaling and binds to several proteins involved in ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS). Valosin-containing protein (p97/VCP) is required for the degradation of some UPS substrates. Although p97/VCP has been indicated in different cellular pathways, its association with BMP signaling in male reproductive system has not been elucidated. The aim of the present study was to investigate the cellular localization of Smad1, phospho-Smad1, and p97/VCP and the interaction of proteins in the postnatal rat testis and epididymis. Testicular and epididymal tissues from 5-, 15- and 60-day-old rats were examined by immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, Western blotting, and immunoprecipitation techniques. In 5-day-old rat testis, Smad1, phospho-Smad1, and p97/VCP were mainly expressed in gonocytes. In 15- and 60-day-old rat testis, proteins were overlapped in spermatogonia, Sertoli cells, and spermatocytes. Expression of proteins in the epithelial cells of epididymis was gradually increased from 5 to 15 days of age. Smad1 and phospho-Smad1 expressions showed uniformity in the different regions of epididymis, however p97/VCP immunoreactivity was higher only in caput epididymis compared to corpus and cauda epididymis in 15- and 60-day-old rat epididymis. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments further confirmed the Smad1-p97/VCP and p-Smad1-p97/VCP interactions. The overlap between Smad1 and p97/VCP expressions in the postnatal rat testis and epididymis suggests that p97/VCP may play important roles in mediating BMP signaling during spermatogenesis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily is recognized as one of the largest families of secreted multifunctional peptides exerting different biological effects on a large variety of cell types.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1933719111417886">1</xref>
</sup> The superfamily includes TGF-β isoforms, activins, inhibins, growth and differentiation factors (GDFs), and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1933719111417886">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1933719111417886">3</xref>
</sup> The TGF-β family members are involved in the regulation of hormone secretion, stimulation of extracellular matrix formation, the inhibition of proliferation of many cell types, bone formation, cell survival, and chemotaxis for inflammatory cells.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1933719111417886">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1933719111417886">3</xref>

</sup> In the testis, some of these TGF-β-related factors, for example, activins, inhibins, and BMPs, have been indicated to affect testicular functions including maintenance of spermatogenesis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1933719111417886">6</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1933719111417886"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1933719111417886">8</xref>
</sup> In relation to these findings, studies have indicated that the reproductive function of transgenic and knockout mice have been affected because the genes related to TGF-β families were manipulated.<sup>

</sup>
<sup>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1933719111417886">11</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The TGF-β signaling is a complex mechanism and is mediated by several steps involving dimerization and phosphorylation of receptors and intermediate molecules. One of the most important proteins that modulate TGF-β ligand activity is the Smad family proteins. There are 3 types of Smad proteins working in TGF-β signaling: receptor-activated Smads (R-Smads: Smad1, 5, 8), the common mediator Smad (Co-Smad: Smad4), and inhibitory Smads (I-Smads: Smad6 and 7). A signaling cascade is initiated upon binding of a ligand to cell surface receptors, when a stable heteromeric receptor complex is formed.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1933719111417886">12</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1933719111417886"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1933719111417886">14</xref>
</sup> Activated receptor complexes then induce phosphorylation of R-Smads, which form hetero-oligomeric complexes with Smad4. This complex then translocates to the nucleus and regulates transcriptional responses, together with DNA-binding cofactors.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1933719111417886">15</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Recent studies have shown the expression of Smad proteins in germ cells and somatic cells throughout fetal and postnatal mouse testis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1933719111417886">16</xref>
</sup> In the postnatal rat testis, Smad1 protein has been detected in spermatocytes and spermatids.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1933719111417886">17</xref>
</sup> Smad2 and Smad3 proteins were found to be expressed in the postnatal rat testis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1933719111417886">18</xref>
</sup> Smad5 and Smad8 proteins have only been demonstrated in the prepubertal mouse testis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1933719111417886">19</xref>
</sup> Smad7 protein in the seminiferous tubules<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1933719111417886">20</xref>
</sup> and Smad4 protein in Leydig cells of the rat testis<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1933719111417886">17</xref>
</sup> were also reported. From these studies, it seems that testicular expression of Smad proteins were studied. However, to our knowledge, expression of Smad proteins in rat epididymis have not been revealed.</p>
<p>In recent years, it has become evident that most intracellular proteins are degraded by the ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS) in a process requiring adenosine triphosphate (ATP). This pathway uses the ubiquitin protein as a marker for intracellular proteins destined for rapid proteolysis via a multi-subunit protease complex, the proteasome.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1933719111417886">21</xref>
</sup> Attachment of ubiquitin to a target protein, referred to as ubiquitination, is a complex ATP-dependent process carried out by the ubiquitin-activating enzymes (E1), the ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2), and ubiquitin ligase (E3).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1933719111417886">22</xref>
</sup> This pathway is also considered to be important for the degradation of Smads.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1933719111417886">23</xref>
</sup> Smad ubiquitin regulatory factor 1 (Smurf1), an E3 ubiquitin ligase, targets Smad1 and Smad5 for degradation. Smad ubiquitin regulatory factor 1 also interacts with Smad7 and induces Smad7 ubiquitination and translocation into the cytoplasm.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1933719111417886">24</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1933719111417886"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1933719111417886">26</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>p97/Valosin-containing protein (p97/VCP) transferred the ubiquitinylated proteins to proteasome for their degradation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1933719111417886">27</xref>
</sup> RNA interference (RNAi) of VCP caused an increase in polyubiquitinated cellular proteins, which indicated an impaired UPS function.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1933719111417886">28</xref>
</sup> The p97/VCP mediates UPS-dependent degradation of substrates, as shown previously for several proteins.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1933719111417886">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1933719111417886">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1933719111417886">30</xref>
</sup> However, it is not known whether p97/VCP might also facilitate the degradation of Smad proteins in rat testis and epididymis. In addition, p97/VCP has been indicated in several cellular pathways such as cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, DNA-damage response, endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation (ERAD), and autophagosome maturation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1933719111417886">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1933719111417886">32</xref>
</sup> However, its association with TGF-β signaling in male reproductive system has not been elucidated. Therefore, the aim of this study was to show the testicular and epididymal expressions of Smad1, phospho-Smad1 (p-Smad1), and p97/VCP and to determine the interactions between Smad1 and p97/VCP, and p-Smad1 and p97/VCP. Thus, we analyzed the expressions of p97/VCP, Smad1, and p-Smad1 in rat testis and epididymis during the postnatal development using immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, Western blotting, and co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) techniques.</p>

<title>Animals and Tissue Preparation</title>
<p>A total of 18 male Wistar albino rats at postnatal age of 5, 15, and 60 days (6 rats per group), that is, corresponding to infantile (5 days), prepubertal (15 days), and adult (60 days) periods were obtained from Gaziosmanpasa University Experimental Animal Research Laboratory. Rats were handled in the laboratory according to institutional guidelines as well as the Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Research Council and ethic raptor was approved from the local ethics committee (No: 2011 HADYEK-004). All rats were observed for several days to ascertain the health before sample collection. Pups were reared with their dams. They were kept in a temperature-controlled room (20°C-23°C), on a 12-hour light/dark cycle with food (commercial rat chow) and fresh water available ad libitum. Six rats of the same age were killed by administering an overdose of sodium pentobarbital (150 mg/kg, intraperitoneally [ip]) before removal of the testis and epididymis. Epididymis were dissected and subdivided into 3 anatomical regions as follows: caput (CT), corpus (CS), and cauda (CA) epididymis. One testis and epididymis from each animal were fixed in Bouin fluid for 12 hours immediately upon collection, then dehydrated and embedded in paraffin for immunohistochemistry. The contralateral testis and epididymal regions from each animal were frozen for protein analysis.</p>

<sec id="section4-1933719111417886">
<title>Immunohistochemical Analysis</title>
<p>Immunohistochemistry was performed according to the procedure described previously.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1933719111417886">33</xref>
</sup> Briefly, serial sections, 5 μm thick, were collected on poly-<sc>l</sc>-lysine-coated slides (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, Missouri) and incubated overnight at 56°C. Tissue sections were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated in a graded series of ethanol. Sections were then treated in a microwave oven in 10 mmol/L citrate buffer, pH 6.0, for 5 minutes twice and left to cool for 20 minutes. After 3 washes in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched by 3% hydrogen peroxide in PBS for 20 minutes and again washed 3 times in PBS. Sections were then incubated in a blocking serum (Ultra V Block, TP-060-HL; NeoMarker, Fremont, California) for 10 minutes in order to block nonspecific binding. Subsequently, sections were incubated for 1 hour at room temperature with mouse monoclonal p97/VCP (ab11433, 1: 500; Abcam, UK), rabbit polyclonal Smad1 (ab66737, 1: 200; Abcam), and rabbit polyclonal p-Smad1 (cat no: 06-702, 1: 100; Millipore, Temecula, California) in a humidified chamber. Sections were washed 3 times in PBS, incubated with biotinylated anti-mouse (BA-9200; 1:400 dilution; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, California), and biotinylated antirabbit (BA-1000; 1:400 dilution; Vector Laboratories) secondary antibodies for 45 minutes at room temperature. After 3 washes with PBS, the antigen–antibody complexes were detected using a streptavidin–peroxidase complex (TP-060-HL; LabVision, Fremont, California), for 15 minutes followed by 3 rinses with PBS. Bound peroxidase was developed with 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazol ([AEC] ScyTek Laboratories, Utah) chromogen and sections were counterstained with Mayer hematoxylin (ScyTek Laboratories) and mounted with Permount (Fisher Chemicals, Springfield, New Jersey) on glass slides. For controls, sections were treated with the appropriate isotype mouse immunoglobulin (IgG) or normal rabbit IgG depending on the primary antibody used, which was diluted to the same final protein concentration as the primary antibody. Photomicrographs were taken with a Leica microscope (Leica DM2500, Nussloch, Germany).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1933719111417886">
<title>Double Immunofluorescence</title>
<p>To identify the association of proteins, immunofluorescence was performed. Both the primary antibodies (rabbit anti-Smad1 and mouse anti-p97/VCP) were applied simultaneously and incubated overnight at 4°C. After rinsing in Tris-buffered saline (TBS), sections were subsequently incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:400 dilution, sc-2012; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc, California) and rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:500 dilution, sc-2092, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc, California) for 1 hour at room temperature. Thereafter, all sections were rinsed in PBS and stained with nuclear 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining (Invitrogen, Molecular Probes, D-1306, California). Fluorescence images were taken with a Nikon microscope (Nikon E600, Germany).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1933719111417886">
<title>The Evaluation of the Immunohistochemistry</title>
<p>The evaluation of the immunohistochemical labeling was performed using H-SCORE analyses as previously described.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1933719111417886">33</xref>
</sup> The intensities of p97/VCP, Smad1, and p-Smad1 immunoreactivities were semiquantitatively evaluated using the following intensity categories: 0 (no staining), 1+ (weak but detectable staining), 2+ (moderate or distinct staining), and 3+ (intense staining). For each tissue, an H-SCORE value was derived by calculating the sum of the percentages of cells that stained at each intensity category and multiplying that value by the weighted intensity of the staining, using the formula H-SCORE: ∑ Pi(i + l), where “i” represents the intensity scores and “Pi” is the corresponding percentage of the cells. In each slide, 5 randomly selected areas were evaluated under a light microscope (×40 objective), and the percentage of the cells for each intensity within these areas was determined at different times by 2 investigators who were not informed about the type and source of the tissues. The average score of both observers was used.</p>

<sec id="section7-1933719111417886">
<title>Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate–Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis and Western Blot Analyses</title>
<p>Total testicular and epididymal proteins were extracted using modified Radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (1% NP-40; 0.25% sodium deoxycholate; 150 mmol/L sodium chloride [NaCl]; 1 mmol/L EDTA; 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride [PMSF]; 1 mg/mL each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin; 1 mmol/L sodium vanadate [Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub>]; and 1 mmol/L sodium fluoride [NaF] in 50 mmol/L Tris-Cl, pH 7.4) and quantitated using the Bradford procedure (Bio-Rad, Hercules, California). Samples (45 µg) were separated by 5% sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad Laboratories). The membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T) for 1 hour to reduce nonspecific binding. Subsequently, the membrane was incubated for 1 hour with primary antibody against p97/VCP (ab11433; Abcam, 1:5000 in 5% nonfat dry milk), Smad1 (ab66737; Abcam; 1:500 in 5% nonfat dry milk), rabbit polyclonal p-Smad1 (cat no: 06-702, Millipore, 1:500, in 5% nonfat dry milk), and β-actin (sc-47778, C4; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc, 0.05 mg/mL in 5% nonfat dry milk). The membrane was washed with TBS-T for 1 hour and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) diluted in 5% nonfat dry milk in TBS-T. Bound secondary antibodies were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence substrate (GE Healthcare, Chalfont St. Giles, United Kingdom). Immunoblot bands for p97/VCP, Smad1, and β-actin were quantified using an Alpha DigiDoc 1000 gel documentation unit (Alpha Innotech Corporation, California). The optical density (OD) values for p97/VCP and Smad1 bands were divided by the OD values of cognate β-actin bands in order to normalize OD values for loading differences.</p>

Beads were washed 3 times with 1 mL ice-cold IP buffer; immune complexes were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in 25 μL of 3× SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and incubated for 10 minutes at 95°C. The IP samples were separated on a NuPAGE 4% to 12% Novex Bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen), blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (GE Healthcare). The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBS, pH 7.4, and containing 0.05% Tween 20 and incubated with primary antibodies decorated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies according to the instructions of the manufacturers.

<title>Immunohistochemical Localization of Smad1, phospho-Smad1, and p97/VCP in Rat Testis Throughout Postnatal Development</title>
<p>Evaluation of cellular expression of Smad1 and p-Smad1 in rat testis was done by immunohistochemistry. Analysis throughout postnatal development demonstrated that Smad1 and p-Smad1 are selectively located in spermatogonia, Sertoli cells, and spermatocytes, both of the fetal and adult type, at advanced stages of differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1933719111417886">Figure 1</xref>). Weak-to-moderate Smad1 and p-Smad1 immunostaining was observed in gonocytes in the lumen of the seminiferous tubules of the 5-day-old rat testis. Additionally, some interstitial cells and Sertoli cells showed Smad1 immunoreactivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1933719111417886">Figure 1A</xref>, B, and G). In the 15-day-old rat testis, Sertoli cells and spermatogonia were strongly immunopositive for Smad1 expression, whereas weak-to-moderate nuclear immunostaining in Sertoli cells and spermatogonia was observed for p-Smad1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1933719111417886">Figure 1H</xref>). Moreover, spermatocytes showed strong nuclear immunostaining for p-Smad1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1933719111417886">Figure 1H</xref>) but moderate-to-strong nuclear and cytoplasmic immunostaining for Smad1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1933719111417886">Figure 1C</xref>, D). In adult testis, Smad1 immunoreactivity was mainly localized in spermatogonia and Sertoli cells, however moderate-to-strong expression was seen in spermatocytes and interstitial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1933719111417886">Figure 1E</xref>, F). Interestingly, round and elongating spermatids did not appear to express Smad1 in adult testis.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>To our knowledge, we have shown for the first time the co-localization and interaction of Smad1 and p97/VCP in the postnatal rat testis and epididymis using immunocytochemistry, Western blotting, and co-IP techniques. The results of present study indicate that Smad1 and p97/VCP co-localize and interact in spermatogonia, Sertoli, and interstitial cells as well as spermatocytes.</p>
<p>There are a number of signaling molecules and multiple-signaling pathways in the regulation of the spermatogenesis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1933719111417886">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1933719111417886">35</xref>
</sup> A thorough understanding of the molecular mechanisms, particularly the signaling molecules and pathways, is essential for the regulation of spermatogenesis and has important implications in offering new therapeutic targets for male infertility. The Smad-signaling pathway has been implicated in the maintenance and pluripotency of human embryonic stem cells. In this context, previously, it has been reported that Smad1 protein and messenger RNA (mRNA) were detectable in germ cells as well as Sertoli cells of mouse and rat testis with various staining intensity.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1933719111417886">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1933719111417886">17</xref>
</sup> In accordance with these observations, our study also demonstrated Smad1 and p-Smad1 localization in gonocytes, spermatogonia, spermatocytes, Sertoli cells, and some interstitial cells in 5-, 15- and 60-day-old rat testis. However, round and elongated spermatids were found to be immunonegative for Smad1 and p-Smad1 protein in adult testis. Moreover, p-Smad1-positive immunostaining was mostly located in nucleus, but Smad1 immunostaining was detected both in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm indicating that activated Smad1 complex translocated to the nucleus upon phosphorylation in the postnatal developmental stages of rat testis and epididymis.</p>
<p>In the present study, Smad1, p-Smad1, and p97/VCP were also expressed in the basal and apical epithelial cells of epididymis. Several epididymal proteins such as beta defensins, CRISP1, SPAG11e, DEFB126, carbonyl reductase P34H, CD52, and GPR64 involved in the sperm maturation were identified.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1933719111417886">36</xref>

</sup> To our knowledge, there exists no information about the epididymal Smad1, p-Smad1, and p97/VCP expression in the postnatal rats. Smad1 and p-Smad1 were found to be expressed in all epididymal regions, but p97/VCP showed no uniform distribution and was highly expressed in CT epididymis. Epididymal expressions of Smad1, p-Smad1, and p97/VCP suggest that they might have important roles in the control of epididymal sperm maturation.</p>
<p>Recent studies have shown that a number of proteins interact with Smads to regulate TGF-β-BMP signaling. Some of these regulators can activate Smad signaling while others were identified as repressor of Smads such as Ski, Evi-1, and TGIF.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1933719111417886">40</xref>
</sup> It has been also indicated that TGF-β signaling was regulated by turnover of Smad proteins. Both Smurf1 and Smurf2 were identified as ubiquitin ligases for Smad ubiquitination and degradation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1933719111417886">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1933719111417886">42</xref>
</sup> Moreover, Smad1 was also shown as a proteasomal substrate and its degradation was induced by BMPs.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1933719111417886">43</xref>
</sup> From these studies, it is obvious that there are many identified interacting partners of Smad1. However, it is not known whether there is any other regulatory interacting protein that might control Smad1 protein expression in rat testis and epididymis.</p>
<p>In this study, we have provided evidence that Smad1 and p-Smad1 interacts with p97/VCP in the postnatal testis and epididymis, suggesting that this interaction might have important functions in the regulation of TGF-β-BMP signaling. Co-localization experiments in this study demonstrated that gonocytes, spermatogonia, spermatocytes, and Sertoli cells were expressed as Smad1 and p97/VCP in the postnatal rat testis. Most importantly, the interaction between Smad1 and p97/VCP was verified by co-IP. In order to clarify the biological significance of the interaction, the mechanism of Smad1–p97/VCP interaction will need to be investigated in the future.</p>
<p>The p97/VCP was initially shown as a chaperone protein working in UPS. It has been demonstrated that p97/VCP binds to ubiquitinated proteins and chaperons then to proteasome.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1933719111417886">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1933719111417886">44</xref>
</sup> It is also well known that p97/VCP participated in the degradation of several proteins such as nuclear factor κB inhibitor, IP3 receptors, α-T cell receptor, δ-CD3, caspases 3 and 7, p53, and cyclin B1.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1933719111417886">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1933719111417886">30</xref>
</sup> The expression of p97/VCP was detected in various tissues as well as in testis and epididymis (our unpublished data). Since this study has shown the interaction between Smad1 and p97/VCP, it is possible that Smad1 could be the newly identified substrate for p97/VCP, and ubiquitinated Smad1 might be transfered to proteasome via p97/VCP. Furthermore, the present study tested the specificity of Smad1-p97/VCP interaction. We suspected whether p97/VCP might interact with other Smads. We have preliminary data suggesting that Smad4 but not Smad2 might be a target substrate for p97/VCP (unpublished data).</p>
<p>In a recent study, authors reported that the Constitutively photomorphogenic 9 signalosome (COP9) signalosome interacts ATP-dependently with p97/VCP and controls the ubiquitination status of proteins bound to p97/VCP.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1933719111417886">31</xref>
</sup> Moreover, when the COP9 signalosome (CSN) was inactivated by knockdown of Jab1/CSN5, the amount of polyubiquitinated proteins bound to p97/VCP increased, indicating that the CSN is required for proper processing of substrate proteins bound to p97/VCP. However, according to their results, the substrate proteins were not determined. Although, in the present study, it is understood that Smad1 is one of the interacting protein for p97/VCP, future studies will clarify whether Jab1/CSN5 might control the ubiquitination status of Smad1 protein bound to p97/VCP in rat testis and epididymis.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Jab1/CSN was indicated as a regulator of TGF-β signaling by participitating in the degradation of Smad4 and Smad7 but not Smad1.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1933719111417886">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1933719111417886">46</xref>
</sup> It has been reported that ectopic expression of Jab1/CSN5 decreased the steady-state levels of endogenous Smad4 and induced its ubiquinylation, resulting in the inhibition of TGF-β-induced gene transcription.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1933719111417886">46</xref>
</sup> In contrast to this, Jab1/CSN5 was shown to enhance TGF-β1 signaling by binding to Smad7 and promoting its degradation in human carcinoma cells.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1933719111417886">45</xref>
</sup> It is possible that Jab1/CSN5 together with p97/VCP might regulate TGF-β signaling by modulating Smad protein expressions. This study provides a link between p97/VCP and BMP signaling, suggesting that Smad1 expression might be controlled with p97/VCP. Further studies will be required to clarify the physiological role of this interaction in developing rat testis and epididymis.</p>
<p>In conclusion, results of the present study showed the expression and interaction of Smad1 and p97/VCP in the postnatal rat testis and epididymis, suggesting p97/VCP might regulate BMP signaling. As in our study, the advances made in the signaling molecules and pathways would be helpful to a better understanding of the complex process of spermatogenesis, the etiology of male infertility.</p>
