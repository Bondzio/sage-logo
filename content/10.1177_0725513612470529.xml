<p>During South Africa’s transition I visited Bangladesh where, amongst others, I met the distinguished economist Rehman Sobhan, who had played a decisive role in that country’s struggle for independence. During an agreeable lunch in the Dhaka Club, Sobhan turned to me and said, ‘You’ll discover that the glow of victory will fade when the hard questions begin to be asked’. I protested that South Africa would be different. Both struggle and victory had come late in the decolonization day, the Cold War was over – besides, there was the towering figure of Nelson Mandela, whose fame had even reached Bangladesh. My host tut-tuttered, smiled confidently, and muttered something about the power of the international financial institutions. This number of <italic>Thesis Eleven</italic> suggests which one of us, Sobhan Rehman or myself, was correct in their thoughts about South Africa’s future … and, with its publication, comes my apology for ignoring that which should never be ignored, the voice of experience.</p>
<p>It is not untoward to devote an entire number of <italic>Thesis Eleven</italic> to South Africa. Not exclusively, but, perhaps, uniquely, the country has drawn to the fore social pathologies which have been contested and quarreled over like few in modern times. Indeed, all the great traditions of social theorizing, both critical and other, have been drawn to – or into – the question of South Africa: first, in the formation of the state, then into the decades-long conflict over apartheid, and now over the destiny of the ‘new’ South Africa as it is invariably still called. So, if <italic>Thesis Eleven</italic> is about encouraging the development of social theory, broadly defined, then this tryst between the journal and South Africa was bound to happen sooner than later.</p>
<p>But it is happening at (yet) another uncomfortable moment in the country’s tangled and tragic history. The killing of 34 miners by the police at the Marikana platinum mine, in the country’s mineral-rich north-west, in August, 2012, reminded social practitioners and social theorists alike of how fragile and how volatile the country is even after the much-celebrated victory over apartheid – or perhaps is that because of it.</p>
<p>But there is a wider lesson here. Instead of the country being held up to the world as an example of successful ‘transformation’, it might be well be regarded as a microcosm of a world unable – perhaps unwilling – to deal with old social pathologies like race, class, and nationalism or even newer ones like the environment, or gender relations, or a post-capitalist world.</p>
<p>However rich – and richly-argued – the essays in this collection of <italic>Thesis Eleven</italic> are, they offer only a peek under the covers of a country which is fecund with social problems and disparately in need of new ideas. Old ways of doing things have failed: in their place, ironically, new understandings and the proverbial ‘quick fix’ of neo-liberalism may have deepened the sense of alienation experienced by a majority of the country’s people. Moreover, and most worrying, the quick fix seem to have failed to produce a new generation that seems equipped to deal with its manifold problems.</p>
<p>The interview between John Higgins and the late Jakes Gerwel which anchors this number of <italic>Thesis Eleven</italic> is extraordinary and extraordinarily frank. A careful reading of it will suggest that social theorizing remains close to the surface of everyday discourse in contemporary South Africa. Gerwel returns several times to the issue of race and class – two issues that are discussed (in almost equal measure) in other contributions, too. Kirk Helliker and I, in a piece that looks both backwards and forwards, try to understand the complex interchanging between the race and the class debates in South Africa during the 1970s and 1980s and suggests how, after the fall of the Berlin Wall, South African Marxism lost its footing. Other pieces in this issue confirm that the issue of class has not gone away. Indeed, as Richard Pithouse argues, it is in the shack settlements of the poor – the local – where politics (including class politics) is most acute. This is a lesson not only for South Africa but, as Pithouse points out, for the world.</p>
<p>But race remains South Africa’s central burden, notwithstanding the pious undertakings – and understandings – that the new South Africa’s democracy would be a ‘non-racial, non-sexist one’. Gerhard Maré graphically explains why the issue of race continues to dog the life of South Africa and its citizens literally from the cradle to the grave. Deborah Posel uses the intersection of race (and riches) to discuss the African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL) and its former leader, the charismatic Julius Malema, who fuses race and class in both speech and action. Does he represent the future of a country where the unemployment rate amongst the young is estimated to run at 51 per cent and that, of every four jobless people, three are under the age of 35 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0725513612470529">Harper 2012</xref>)? And Cherryl Walker shows why the non-sexist promise of liberation rhetoric has been thwarted by the continuing practice of traditionalism, notwithstanding the country’s bold claim that it boasts the most ‘progressive constitution in the world’. Raphael de Kadt and Charles Simkins are interested in showing that, for all the ostensible change in the country's politics, its economy remains a rent-seeking one and why it is more reminiscent of its unhappy past than the prosperous and redistributive future promised by the neo-liberalism which claims to have charted the transition to democracy. Unsurprisingly, the potent cocktail of race, class - and sexism - has been brought together in the creative arts, which is the optic used to understand the country by the art historian Sandra Klopper.</p>
<p>Finally, in important ways South Africa’s present resembles its unhappy past – and this destiny, alas, seems to be the promise of its future. For all who work in social theory, this says something about our work – about the questions we ask, the answers we offer, and about the discourses that shape the everyday understandings of politics and society. If, even fleetingly, we thought we knew what would happen in South Africa, we certainly didn’t. As the country approaches its twentieth year of democratic rule, in 2014, we can only say for certain that it stands between anger and adolescence.</p>
<p>As the papers for this issue of <italic>Thesis Eleven</italic> were being assembled, Neville Alexander – one of the country’s leading critical thinkers – passed away. Alexander scorned what he called ‘honorifics’ – the titles and status symbols much loved by academics and politicians alike. But his commitment to the importance of everyday questioning – even revolution – was revealed in a life devoted to grassroots work, notwithstanding his doctorate on the dramatic work of the playwright Gerhardt Hauptman, which he took at the age of 25 at the University of Tübingen. ‘Intellectuals’, he wrote, ‘are not people who go to universities but are people who understand how society works and how to change it’. <italic>Thesis Eleven</italic> Number 115 is dedicated to his memory and to that of his friend and sometime sparring partner, Jakes Gerwel. Their lives and work reflect the true spirit both of this journal and Marx's famous call to arms.</p>
