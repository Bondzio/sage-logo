<abstract>
<p>The idea of using organ transplantation to solve quality-of-life issues was first introduced a century ago, with cornea transplants and thrusted before the world again in 1998, following a controversial hand transplant. Uterus transplantation (UTn) has been proposed as another quality-of-life transplant for the cure of permanent uterine factor infertility. In order to proceed in humans, a greater appreciation of the immunological mechanisms that underlie UTn is desirable. Allogeneic UTn (animal model) was first described by 2 studies in 1969. The first and only human UTn, performed in 2000, was an early attempt with limited use of animal model experiments prior to moving onto the human setting. Since then, work using rat, mouse, ovine, goat, and nonhuman primate models has demonstrated that the uterus is a very different but manageable organ immunologically compared to other transplanted organs. Therefore, specifically exploring immunological issues relating to UTn is a valuable and necessary part of the inevitable scientific process leading to successful human UTn.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>

<title>History of Uterine Transplantation</title>
<p>Women with absolute uterine factor infertility (AUFI) are considered as being “unconditionally infertile.” Causes are congenital, for example, Mullerian duct anomalies, or acquired (eg, a hysterectomy performed secondary to obstetric hemorrhage, myoma, endometrial or cervical malignancy, etc). Currently, it is estimated that even when restricted to women aged 15 to 34 years, there are around 7 million women in the United States, who have lost their uteri to benign causes or obstetric complications. Based on known fecundity rates, thousands of these women would therefore be potential candidates for uterine transplantation (UTn).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1933719111417887">1</xref>
</sup> For this large number of women, UTn has been proposed as a treatment of AUFI.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1933719111417887">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1933719111417887">3</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The majority of the research published in the 1960s through to the 1980s involved transplantation of the entire female genital tract rather than the uterus specifically. Furthermore, the transplantation process was autogeneic rather than allogeneic. In the 1980s and 1990s, the situation did not change greatly. The field of transplantation, following a much needed impetus based on recent scientific breakthroughs into the specific mechanisms behind the immunological response to “foreign” cells (infection, cancer, autoimmunity and transplantation), concentrated on lifesaving transplantation, for example, heart, kidney, and liver transplantation. Fertility research was dominated by developments in in vitro fertilization (IVF). Uterine transplantation research had reached a stalemate at that point of time.</p>
<p>However, all this changed in 2000, following the sole attempt (to date) of UTn in a human model. Just prior to this, related gynecological oncology work by UK and US teams had developed techniques to carry out an abdominal radical trachelectomy that directly led to reconsideration of human UTn.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1933719111417887">4</xref>
</sup> Subsequently, a team in Saudi Arabia transplanted a donor uterus into a 26-year-old female who had previously had a hysterectomy for postpartum hemorrhage. The uterine graft was from a 46-year-old female patient who was having a hysterectomy for benign ovarian disease.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1933719111417887">5</xref>
</sup> The graft was removed after 99 days due to thrombosis of the uterine vasculature, which caused subsequent necrosis of the transplanted uterus. Despite this, the actual event provided much needed impetus for research into UTn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1933719111417887">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Currently, the only options available to women with AUFI are gestational surrogacy, adoption, and lifetime infertility. However, these options may not always be appropriate for every woman because of emotional, ethical, religious, social, and legal issues.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1933719111417887">1</xref>
</sup> Uterine Transplantation can therefore be justified as another potential solution to the aforementioned quality-of-life pursuits. With continued advances in transplantation surgery, improved methods of controlling tissue rejection and advances in IVF technology, UTn can bring an end to AUFI by allowing a select group of women to become mothers.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1933719111417887">6</xref>
</sup> It is worthwhile to recall and note the parallels in the controversy surrounding the “standard-” assisted reproductive techniques when they were first introduced and UTn today.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1933719111417887">
<title>Immunology and UTn</title>
<p>The remaining questions in humans that need answering can be summarized as follows: (<italic>a</italic>) What are the immunological mechanisms involved in human UTn (rejection and tolerance patterns and type of posttransplant immunosuppression)? (<italic>b</italic>) Is short-term (1-2 years) graft survival possible following human allogeneic UTn? (<italic>c</italic>) Can pregnancy be established following allogeneic human UTn? Any of these questions can never be answered specifically in humans until an actual human UTn is again performed. However, an appreciation of the immunological mechanisms that underlie transplantation and subsequent immunosuppression is clearly helpful.</p>
<p>A successful fertility outcome can only be achieved if the de novo uterus is initially accepted by the recipient’s immune system and protected by administration of immunosuppressants. Once short-term (hyperacute or acute) rejection is avoided, the second stage of UTn can be set in motion. This comprises of embryo transfer and careful monitoring of fetal development within an “alien vessel,” maternal and fetal tolerance, effects of the selected immunosuppressants, and a cautious awareness of the potential risk of long-term (chronic) rejection.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the FIGO Committee for the Ethical Aspects of Human Reproduction and Women's Health published a report in 2008, erroneously concluding that UTn is currently considered ethically inappropriate in a human model.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1933719111417887">7</xref>
</sup> The key areas that were highlighted were a lack of significant and adequate research in appropriate large animal models and a lack of data on safety. However, their seriously flawed conclusion was based on considering UTn being indicated for women to experience child birth. This is a glaring misunderstanding as UTn is only proposed to treat AUFI otherwise not treatable by other methods, including adoption or surrogacy. In addition, since the time of this writing large animal normal-term deliveries have been reported after UTn, sufficient research has been completed.</p>
<p>However, it is our opinion that now that UTn surgical techniques have been addressed, mammalian immunology represents the key missing piece of the UTn “jigsaw puzzle.” By addressing this topic in large animal models, as well as focusing on safety issues as outlined above, a sound scientific and ethical foundation to allow UTn has been achieved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1933719111417887">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>Organ transplantation and the underlying process have fascinated mankind throughout history. The idea of removing a part of an individual’s body and grafting it onto a completely different entity transgresses beyond the scientific realm and into the philosophical and religious spheres. In the BC era, the Sushruta Samhita, a Sanskrit redaction text that contains all major concepts of ayurvedic medicine, has an innovative passage describing methods used by Sushruta to transplant a skin autograft during a nasal reconstruction. In the Far East, ca 500 <sc>bc</sc>, a legend describes how the first official Chinese physician, Bian Que used anesthesia to perform a double heart transplantation in order to achieve balance between spirit and will in 2 men.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1933719111417887">8</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In the modern era, the first successful human transplant was performed by Dr Eduard Zirm in Moravia, a province of Czech Republic, at the beginning of the 20th century, who transplanted a cornea. In the early 1900s, the French surgeon Alexis Carrel was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine for furthering the field of transplantation by developing successful and creative vascular anastomotic techniques. </p>
<p>Kidney and heart transplants represent 2 important milestones in solid-organ transplantation. In 1954, Dr Joseph Murray performed the first successful solid-organ transplant, where a kidney was transferred between genetically identical twins, a process which inevitably removed the threat of rejection. Thirteen years later, in Cape Town, Professor Christiaan Barnard transplanted a heart from a brain-dead 24-year-old donor into Mr Louis Washkansky who died 18 days later, having been diagnosed with pneumonia. This possibly gave an early insight into the unique immune suppression requirements of each type of organ transplantation.</p>
<p>The idea of using organs to solve quality-of-life issues was first introduced to the general public in 1998 following a controversial hand transplant. This case highlighted the important issue of psychologically assessing the recipient as would be required in UTn. The patient, a convicted con man, failed to follow the postoperative drug and physiotherapy program and as a result the donated hand was rejected. This year, the first facial transplant was successfully performed, confirming that quality-of-life issues can be successfully treated through organ transplantation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1933719111417887">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Rejection</title>
<p>Rejection can be defined as destruction of the donor graft by the host’s immune response activated against the graft’s alloantigens because of a difference in the genetic makeup of the 2 individuals. As outlined in a recent extensive review article by Nankivell and Alexander in the <italic>New England Journal of Medicine</italic>, rejection is classified according to (<italic>a</italic>) the time (posttransplant) when rejection occurs: hyperacute (minutes), acute (days to weeks), late acute (after 3 months), or chronic (months to years); (<italic>b</italic>) the histological changes (cellular–interstitial, vascular, antibody–endothelial); (<italic>c</italic>) physiological function; and (<italic>d</italic>) adaptive or innate immune system response.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1933719111417887">9</xref>
</sup> Pregnancy in solid-organ transplant recipients has not changed this generally observed pattern and timing of rejection.</p>
<p>Hyperacute rejection occurs almost immediately after the donor graft is perfused within the recipient’s body. It is a perioperative complication, where the diagnosis is clinical with macroscopic evidence revealing the extent and speed of rejection. Microscopically, host antibodies, activated by the complement cascade, attack the human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) expressed on the graft endothelium. Uterine transplantation hyperacute rejection would be expected to have the same natural history and diagnosis as seen in other transplanted organs.</p>
<p>Acute rejection usually begins 1 week after transplantation but can occur months to years after transplantation, with the risk highest in the first 3 months. It is caused by a (HLA) mismatch, a risk factor which is impossible to completely remove as <italic>HLA</italic> genes are found in all cells of the body. The HLA system is present in the human uterus, endometrium, and fetal trophoblast. Its role has been described throughout human pregnancy. Acute rejection episodes are either antibody-mediated or, more commonly, due to T-cell activation. If the response to the episode is prompt, graft failure will rarely occur. Antibody-mediated acute rejection is triggered by the membrane-attack complex (C5b-C9), which causes localized endothelial necrosis and apoptosis and therefore, a rapid graft dysfunction due to inflammation. In a kidney allograft, histopathology usually reveals microthrombi, with hemorrhage and arterial wall necrosis and infarction.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1933719111417887">10</xref>
</sup> T-cell-mediated rejection, as described by Issa et al in their review, is initiated when donor alloantigens are presented to the recipient T-cells by both the recipient (indirect) and donor (direct) APCs (dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells),<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1933719111417887">11</xref>
</sup> which bind to the antigens at the graft site and subsequently migrate to the lymph organs in order to locate the T-cells.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1933719111417887">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1933719111417887">13</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Three T cell subtypes have been extensively described in literature: CD4+ T-cells (T-helper cells, Th1, Th2, and Th17), CD8+ T cells (T-killer cells), and regulatory T (Treg)-cells.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1933719111417887">14</xref>
</sup> With regard to their roles, CD4+ cells initiate both a humoral response via cytokines interleukin 4, interleukin 5, and interleukin 13, and a CD8+-lead cellular response via interferon-γ and interleukin 2.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1933719111417887">15</xref>
</sup> T-cell function has been described in everything from early implantation to inflammatory preterm labor. Animal model UTn could again potentially be a useful adjunct to ongoing studies.</p>
<p>Chronic rejection occurs months to years after transplantation because of an accumulation of various assaults by the host immune system over time. These assaults are mediated by host antibodies and lymphocytes which manage to eventually wear down the immunosuppression administered to the patient. Of course, long-term chronic rejection will not be an issue for UTn recipients. Uterine transplantation is envisaged as a temporary graft that will be removed after Cesarean birth or a period of infertility despite UTn.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1933719111417887">
<title>Future challenges</title>
<p>Tremendous advances have been made in the field of solid-organ transplantation, which has led to greater benefit and increased survival in patients with pathologies that were once deemed terminal. Quality-of-life issues depend greatly on the magnitude of the immunosuppressant “burden,” mainly the type, dose, frequency of intake, time period during which they must be taken, and the potential side-effects. Relevant to our research and to obstetrics and gynecology as a whole, effects of immunosuppressants on fertility and fetal outcomes are also of great interest. However, these issues have had to be balanced against the risk of graft rejection, which can occur at any time if the immunosuppressant regime is altered. Therefore, research has attempted to decrease the immunosuppressant burden to a level that will not result in rejection, yet improve the patient’s quality of life. Common approaches have included avoidance of steroids and reduced exposure to calcineurin inhibitors.</p>
<p>Theoretically, UTn in animal models could be used to further characterize immune-related diseases such as recurrent pregnancy loss or immunologic PIH. In these models, an intact gravid uterus would be transplanted into a recipient. Or more likely, a pregnancy would be established after UTn into a recipient with a known disease propensity and studied for induced changes. In this way, UTn could isolate maternal versus fetal factors in a particular disease state. </p>
<p>Unfortunately pregnant transplant recipients cannot wait for long-term results to clearly demonstrate superiority of one regimen over the other. This is especially a problem regarding pregnancy outcomes among transplant patients. Regardless of whether the pregnant transplant recipient has a kidney, heart, lung, or uterus, it will be impossible to ensure safety to mother and fetus if the goal is a healthy child that matures to a healthy adult.</p>

<title>Milestones in Uterine Transplant Immunology</title>
<p>The process of rejection in allogeneic UTn was first described by 2 studies<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1933719111417887">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1933719111417887">17</xref>
</sup> in 1969. UTn was performed in dogs in both of these studies. These 2 studies as well as 2 further sets of experiments<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1933719111417887">18</xref>
</sup>
<sup>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1933719111417887">19</xref>
</sup> carried out a year later looked at the use of azathioprine and cortisone to mediate graft rejection (in dogs). Rejection occurred in all 4 cases, both with vascular <sup>

</sup> and with avascular UTn.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1933719111417887">19</xref>
</sup> Endometrium was the primary layer to fail. Classic rejection signs were described that is hemorrhage, patchy necrosis, intravascular thrombosis, and features of inflammation: edema, erythema, and increased temperature reported on the fourth posttransplant day.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1933719111417887">18</xref>
</sup> In 1971, Scott et al also reported allogeneic UTn in a nonhuman primate. The grafts were received following subtotal hysterectomy and full rejection was reported on day 14 posttransplant.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1933719111417887">20</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Confino et al described an early attempt of allogeneic UTn in a rabbit model in 1986. The graft was transplanted in an avascular manner, with both the endometrial and myometrial layers surviving for 4 weeks on cyclosporine (the only immunosuppressant administered).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1933719111417887">21</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The biggest milestone in UTn was the first human UTn in 2000, which we have detailed earlier. Because of limited use of animal model experiments prior to the human setting, important anatomical, technical, and immunological factors were not tested, leading to the conclusion that the attempt may have been premature. With regard to immunosuppressants, they were administered preoperatively: cyclosporine A, 6 hours prior to surgery; intraoperatively: prednisolone (to maintain uterine perfusion); and postoperatively: conventional cyclosporine A, azathioprine, prednisolone, and a boost by antithymocyte globulin. CD+4/CD+8 ratio in blood and Doppler of uterine blood flow were the only techniques employed to monitor possible rejection patterns. Despite initial successful immunosuppression,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1933719111417887">5</xref>
</sup> the vascular anastomosis of the transplanted graft failed and the UTn infarcted, surviving for only 99 days.</p>
<p>It was this attempt that resulted in a sudden explosion of animal studies looking at UTn. Brannstrom’s group has performed a set of highly useful experiments using the murine model. In 2006, an allogeneic UTn demonstrated signs of rejection from day 2 to day 5; minimal inflammatory changes were seen from day 5; and massive inflammation was seen from day 10 to day 15. By day 28, the graft was fully rejected with massive necrosis and fibrosis visualized. Microscopically, the density of CD3+ T-cells was increased in the grafted uterus from day 2 in the myometrium and from day 5 in the endometrium.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1933719111417887">22</xref>
</sup> Groth et al<sup>

The morphological and histological signs of graft rejection were not reduced, suggesting that if long-term graft survival is to be achieved, either cyclosporine A should be administered at higher doses or it should be used in combination with other immunosuppressive agents.<sup>

<p>Brannstrom’s work demonstrated that exploring immunological issues specific to UTn is more valuable than simply relying on evidence from renal, liver, and cardiac transplants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1933719111417887">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1933719111417887"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1933719111417887">24</xref></sup> This is for 2 reasons. First, each specific types of transplanted organ will affect the rejection process differently. Results reported by El-Akouri et al that correspond to severe acute rejection are similar to those of cardiac allografts at days 8 to 15, suggesting an immunological similarity between the heart and the uterus.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1933719111417887">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1933719111417887">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1933719111417887">26</xref>
</sup> On the other hand, murine models of liver and kidney transplants revealed spontaneous acceptance.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1933719111417887">25</xref>
</sup> Therefore, rejection mechanisms as shown by markers in the blood of recipients  are different depending on the type  of tissue/organ involved. Second, endometrial and myometrial layers differ significantly during the rejection process. The endometrium is rejected much more rapidly than the myometrium, demonstrated by timing of lymphocyte infiltration, which occurs earlier in the endometrium.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1933719111417887">19</xref>
</sup>
<sup>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1933719111417887">22</xref>
</sup> This can be explained by the “Dr Jekyll/Mr Hyde” role played by the endometrium: it defends the uterus from various pathogens while simultaneously offering immunological tolerance to semen and the early embryo/fetus. Therefore, the uterus is a very different organ immunologically when compared to other transplant organs.</p>
<p>Rat, porcine, and ovine models have also been used sporadically in UTn.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1933719111417887">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1933719111417887"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1933719111417887"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1933719111417887">30</xref>
</sup> All 3 models used a combination of 3 different immunosuppressants: cyclosporine A, tacrolimus, and steroid, administered at various posttransplant intervals. This particular drug regime slowed down the inflammation process and even began to successfully treat the acute rejection episodes, thus increasing the survival of the uterine grafts (0.2-11.8 months in the porcine model<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1933719111417887">29</xref>
</sup>).</p>
<p>Most UTn data have been reported using nonprimate models. Such preliminary models suggest that immunosuppression should be achievable in human UTn.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1933719111417887">27</xref>
</sup> Fageeh et al reported successful immunosuppression of the first human UTn until the eventual graft failure on the 99th posttransplant day. Success was defined as organ survival and response to exogenous hormonal stimulation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1933719111417887">5</xref>
</sup> With regard to the latter, in order to build up the atrophic endometrium, estrogen and progesterone were administered for the first 3 months. The graft was thought to be functional as a result of 2 withdrawal bleeds occurring shortly after hormonal therapy had been stopped. Certainly compared to other “firsts” reported throughout organ transplantation history, this was far better as the donor and recipient survived.</p>
<p>Longer-term nonhuman primate UTn survival has also been reported with successful immunosuppression. Using rhesus macaques, 3 uterine allograft transplants were performed. Two animals expired post uterus transplant, but the third transplant was successfully accomplished and maintained for approximately 1 year.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1933719111417887">31</xref>
</sup> These primate data were also important for demonstrating that acute rejection could be treated with commonly available immunosuppressants that are compatible with human pregnancy. Specifically, immunosuppression of the primate uterus was maintained with cyclosporine targeting serum levels (target cyclosporine trough was 150 ng/mL) typically found in other successful human solid-organ transplantations. The diagnosis of acute rejection was made based on clinical grounds (ie, watery vaginal discharge), confirmed by sonogram (edematous UTn graft) and managed based on clinical human transplant medicine protocols that is steroids, cyclosporine dose adjustment, and adding other agents such as tacrolimus. These results were important in confirming the potential for robust survival of the human uterus graft under a variety of situations.<sup>

<title>Potential Effects of UTn on Pregnancy</title>
<p>Theoretically, the risk of graft rejection is lowered during pregnancy because pregnancy itself is thought to be inducing a transient “physiological” state of immunosuppression within the host’s body. Chaouat et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1933719111417887">33</xref>
</sup> described a variation in both the population and activity of immune cells during pregnancy, suggesting an existence of protective wall of effector T-lymphocytes, Tregs, and uterine-specific natural killer (NK) cells which all induce tolerance of the allogeneic fetus.<sup>

</sup> Nevertheless, the rejection rate varies in comparison to the nonpregnant population. With regard to kidney allografts, rejection rates in pregnant are similar to rejection rates in non-pregnant patients,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1933719111417887">37</xref>
</sup> whereas in cases of liver transplantation, reports state a higher rejection rate at the same interval after transplantation in the pregnant patient. For instance, an average of 10% of pregnant recipients suffered rejections at 39 months after transplant versus 3% in a comparable nonpregnant population, approximately 3 years after transplantation.<sup>

<title>Immunosuppressing the Uterine Graft</title>
<p>Similarly to other solid-organ transplants, the most pronounced effect of the graft on the fetus will be indirect, that is via the immunosuppressants that must be administered to the recipient. The idea of using immunosuppressive drugs to curb rejection was first suggested by Sir Peter Brian Medawar while he was working for the National Institute for Medical Research. He made significant inroads in the 1940s in understanding the mechanism behind rejection. Today, immunosuppressants are routinely used after transplantation to minimize the risk of rejection. However, long-term use has its drawbacks, mainly the risk of recurrent infections and neoplastic disease, as well as necessary close and meticulous medical care.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1933719111417887">40</xref>
</sup> Uterine transplantation would be short term that is 1 to 2 years, thus avoiding this risk. Once the uterus and immunosuppressants are removed, any associated neoplasm risk should theoretically return to baseline. Many transplant-related lymphomas are known to regress after removal of the graft. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, care is taken with the type, dose, and monitoring of immunosuppressants prescribed as they can cross the human placental barrier and enter the fetal circulation, possibly affecting the immune system of the fetus.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1933719111417887">41</xref>
</sup> Medications used to suppress immunologic activity include glucocorticoids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and the antifolate medication (methotrexate). In addition, cytokine modulators (cyclosporine: CsA), purine-related medication (analogues: azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine; purine synthesis inhibitor: mycophenolate mofetil), alkylating agents (cyclophosphamide and chlorambucil), biologic response modifiers (tumor necrosis factor [TNF] antagonists), and intravenous immunoglobulin are used.<sup>

<p>Immunosuppression during pregnancy has to be altered slightly to suit the Th1/Th2 shift that can occur secondary to progesterone and estrogen increase during pregnancy.<sup>

</sup> The higher concentration of sex steroids shifts the balance toward humoral rather than cell-mediated immunity. In view of the fact that during pregnancy, endogenous pathogens pose a higher risk than exogenous pathogens, this shift causes a possible increased risk to certain pathogens during pregnancy.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1933719111417887">44</xref>
</sup> High levels of estrogens suppress Th1 cytokines (interleukin 2 and interferon-γ) and stimulate Th2-mediated immunologic humoral responses (interleukin 3, 4, 5, and 13) at the maternal–fetal interface, including antibody production.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1933719111417887">45</xref>

<p>With respect to the recipient of an UTn, immunosuppression would only be a potential risk to her general health as long as the graft is within her pelvis. The plan is that the transplanted uterus will be surgically removed after the patient has completed 1 pregnancy, thus removing the need for immunosuppressants.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we must acknowledge that long-term data on allograft loss, maternal survival after pregnancy (due to an increased risk of viral diseases and neoplasm secondary to immunosuppressants<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1933719111417887">54</xref>
</sup>), and offspring outcomes of transplant recipients are rather limited. Despite several reports indicating no increase in congenital anomalies among the offspring of recipients,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1933719111417887">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1933719111417887">54</xref>
</sup> long-term outcomes focusing on physical and mental development and immunological and oncological pathologies later in life in these offspring are necessary.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1933719111417887">39</xref>
</sup> Unfortunately, currently, only one study has compared pregnancy outcomes in a single group of women before and after transplantation. It concluded that despite an initial increased risk of preeclampsia, growth restriction, preterm birth, and the risk of miscarriage, the odds of these 4 outcomes were all statistically similar pre- and posttransplantation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1933719111417887">56</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Finally, deciding on the correct type of immunosuppressant also depends on the effect of that immunosuppressant on the fertility hormones (estrogen and progesterone) which are required to sustain and “nourish” a pregnancy. Groth et al published the first study assessing reproductive health in animals exposed to immunosuppressive drugs (CsA) in utero. It also investigated the effect of CsA on pregnancy and fetal development.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1933719111417887">57</xref>
</sup> Their results demonstrated that direct maternal and in utero exposure to high doses of CsA reduced implantation rates, fetal survival, and adolescent growth but did not affect offspring fertility. This negative correlation was dose dependent, with higher doses exhibiting a more pronounced negative effect. The reduced implantation rates have been reported in previous similar experiments involving murine models,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1933719111417887">58</xref>
</sup>
<sup>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1933719111417887">58</xref>
</sup> suggesting that CsA can affect the endometrium or decidua in a negative way. In fact there is evidence which reveals a possible link between CsA and suboptimal ovarian function, as a result of hindrance to sex steroid secretion at the time of ovulation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1933719111417887">60</xref>
</sup>
<sup>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1933719111417887">60</xref>
</sup> This in turn leads to issues with conception which tend to occur at the time of ovulation. The endometrial layer depends on the sex steroids for its maintenance and if their secretion is impaired, the lining is also dysfunctional. Conception as a result is impaired, an effect even more pronounced as a result of the negative role CsA plays in both T-cell and NK cell activation.<sup>

<p>Interestingly, when organ transplantation is performed after long-term organ failure and is deemed successful, it results in the restoration of normal endocrine function.<sup>

<p>The Brannstrom group has described 5 examples (3 murine and 2 rat models) of successful pregnancy post-UTn. The first example in 2002 consisted of a syngeneic transplantation of the right uterine horn and cervix, with the native uterus remaining in situ and subsequent successful fertility following blastocyst transfer and implantation in a single mouse model. Fetal weights were similar to that of fetuses in the native uterus and controls.<sup>

<p>We cautiously predict that from the immunological point of view, the risks to mother and fetus will be no different to those faced by renal, hepatic, or cardiac transplant patients undergoing pregnancy. The patient must be considered as high risk from the beginning of the pregnancy.

The care pathway would be very similar to any pregnant patient with a transplanted organ.<sup>

</sup> Because of the effects of immunosuppressants on the maternal immune system, viral serology for cytomegalovirus as well as microbiological cultures of vaginal smears should be repeated monthly. Levels of immunosuppressive drugs in the blood should be monitored, thus permitting adjustments of drug dose relative to graft function and physiological changes of pregnancy. Ultrasonography should be performed as is usual practice: at 12 weeks to assess fetal parameters and at 20 weeks for fetal morphology. During the third trimester, scanning with echo Doppler velocimetry should be performed every 2 weeks until 36 weeks to assess fetal growth and reveal cases of intrauterine growth retardation. Doppler assessment of the vascular anastomosis may be helpful if not interesting. Visual inspection of the transplanted cervix would of course likely provide clinical clues of the graft’s condition. Both vaginal delivery and a Cesarean section would be possible for delivery. However, as the uterus will be removed following delivery, and in order to create a controlled environment during the labor process, a Cesarean section would be more advisable.</p>

<title>Tolerance modulation</title>
<p>The induction of immunological tolerance to a transplanted graft offers a novel potential solution to inhibiting immune-mediated graft rejection. Tolerance is defined as the specific and permanent absence of an attack or response by the immune system to a foreign antigen, which in our case is represented by the uterine graft antigen, without immunosuppression.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1933719111417887">71</xref>
</sup> It can be classified as either natural which occurs via either a central (in the thymus and bone marrow) or a peripheral (circulating mature T- and B-cells) pathway or acquired. The ultimate clinical goal would be for the patient to “acquire” tolerance, both in the nonpregnant and pregnant state, as natural tolerance cannot deal with foreign antigens. This would mean an almost complete allo-unresponsiveness to donor cells and therefore a diminished use of immunosuppressants and negligible damage to the uterine graft as a result of both the preclinical and clinical rejection process. Thus, it is important to differentiate between the role of immunosuppressants and tolerance modulation in the graft acceptance process. The level of an immunosuppressant administered to a patient can indeed portray the state of clinical tolerance, yet the drug does not provide tolerance induction in general. In certain cases, immunosuppressants can diminish the overall tolerance effect, for example, calcineurin inhibitors which downgrade the action of all T cells, including (Tregs).<sup>

<p>Boosting the role of Tregs may offer a “tolerance” pathway in a nonpregnant patient. Natural Tregs are a subset of CD4+ cells known for their ability to induce peripheral tolerance and are also known as CD4 + CD25 + FOXP3 cells.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1933719111417887">73</xref>
</sup> Tregs are developed either naturally from the thymus as a separate lineage or similarly to other suppressive T-cell subsets like Th3 or CD8+ suppressor cells are induced peripherally under certain regulatory conditions.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1933719111417887">71</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1933719111417887">73</xref>
</sup> It is the latter type of Treg which may be able to downregulate a posttransplant rejection response. The idea behind this process would involve in vitro isolation of Tregs specific to the uterine graft alloantigen prior to transplantation. Following Treg number expansion, these de novo cells would be transferred into the patient’s peripheral circulation, with the aim to induce immunomodulatory graft tolerance, minimal rejection, and a decrease (or even disappearance) of immunosuppressive medication. Protocols under good manufacturing practice conditions have already been created,<sup>

</sup> with phase I clinical trials in allogeneic bone marrow transplantation looking at this particular issue.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1933719111417887">76</xref>
</sup> Apart from their therapeutic potential, Tregs could be used as an immunomonitoring tool for identifying those patients at a higher risk of graft failure<sup>

</sup> and also for ensuring that the dose of regular immunosuppressant is appropriate.</p>
<p>Focusing on the pregnant patient, we can see how an evolutionary model of acquired tolerance has developed. A local and specific immunological model is evident whereby a semiallogeneic fetus and placenta “persist” for 9 months. A protective mechanism acts to “counteract” maternal T-cells specific for paternally inherited (fetal) histocompatibility antigens. This immunomodulatory effect is very much restricted to opposing the immune response to her fetus and (if known to the patient) her autoimmune states (patients do report an improvement in autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis) and not the general maternal immune system which is still required to protect against pathogens.<sup>

</sup>
<sup>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1933719111417887">79</xref>
</sup> Agents responsible include Tregs, NK cells, and less well understood mechanisms, such as CD95L and leukemia-inhibiting factor. Treg expansion during pregnancy (they makeup a third of all CD4+ cells in the pregnant uterus) has been clearly demonstrated in both allogeneic and syngeneic pregnancies, suggesting that paternal alloantigens are not the primary cause for this rise.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1933719111417887">35</xref>
</sup> Sasaki et al confirmed the link between the establishment of a healthy fetus and normal Treg levels at the maternal–fetal interface by demonstrating a much smaller proportion of decidual Tregs following miscarriage, as opposed to elective abortions.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1933719111417887">35</xref>
</sup>
<sup>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1933719111417887">80</xref>
</sup> It is thought that this particular inherent model of localized (uterine) tolerance may be responsible for a decreased rejection pattern on the graft during pregnancy,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1933719111417887">24</xref>
</sup> which necessitates further research into immunomodulatory techniques using the aforementioned agents, similar to the ‘Treg’ ideas described above.</p>

<title>Immunosuppression</title>
<p>Future animal models should try to clarify the type and dose of immunosuppressant that would be ideal for prevention of uterine rejection. This choice must also prove to be of value from the safety aspect, with minimal harm affecting the mother but in particular to the growth and well-being of the fetus. Small studies can also investigate whether combinations of different immunosuppressants (cyclosporine, tacrolimus, and steroids) carry greater clinical benefit. Finally, the results of such targeted research should be pooled together to create a protocol that outlines a clear methodological structure for the induction of allotolerance and more importantly, leads to long-term (ie, 9 months) survival of the allotransplanted uterus.</p>
<p>It is correct to be vigilant of potential harmful side-effects associated with immunosuppressants. However, one must also be aware of continued pharmaceutical developments, especially with regard to the large number of successful pregnancies in transplant recipients and a decrease in the immunosuppressants’ toxic effects. Furthermore, the field of immunomodulation continues to develop and could lead to the ultimate goal, a posttransplant world involving no regular immunosuppression medication. Tregs and their impact on tolerance have already been described. Immunotolerance can also be induced after a single treatment course; for example, T10B9, a monoclonal antibody directed against the alpha–beta heterodimer of the T-lymphocyte receptor complex, has been used successfully to treat acute cellular rejection in renal transplantation and as an immunosuppression induction agent in heart and simultaneous kidney–pancreas transplantation.<sup>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Uterine transplantation is a relatively novel potential addition to the ever-expanding field of solid-organ transplantation. As opposed to renal, liver, and heart transplants, UTn offers a solution to a ‘quality-of-life’ issue that is AUFI.</p>
<p>Real progress has been made in overcoming several major obstacles to UTn, such as understanding the immunology behind UTn. By not treating UTn as an exclusive concept in the field of organ transplantation, and therefore applying novel research strategies derived from the field of immunology in general, we can help the idea of a successful human uterine transplant gather necessary momentum.</p>
