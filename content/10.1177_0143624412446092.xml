<abstract>
<p>A novel control algorithm, named H-L control, for a direct expansion air conditioning system was previously developed, so that an improved indoor humidity control was achieved at a higher energy efficiency. However, a variable speed compressor was used, leading to a high cost of implementation for the control algorithm. This technical note reports on an experimental study, where two parallel connected single speed compressors were used to replace an expensive variable speed compressor to implement the novel control algorithm. Experimental results demonstrated that similar control performance may be achieved when using two single speed compressors, thus lowering the cost of implementation.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0143624412446092" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>In buildings, controlling indoor humidity at an appropriate level is important since this directly affects building occupants’ thermal comfort, indoor air quality and the operating efficiency of building air conditioning (A/C) installations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0143624412446092">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0143624412446092">2</xref></sup> Direct expansion (DX) A/C systems have been widely applied in small to medium size buildings offering many advantages, such as simple configuration, high energy efficiency and low cost to own and maintain. For example, in the US, according to the Department of Energy, packaged rooftop DX A/C system consumed approximately 60% of the total amount of cooling energy used.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0143624412446092">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, most DX A/C systems are equipped with a single speed compressor and supply fan, based on on–off cycling to maintain only the indoor dry-bulb temperature, whereas the humidity in the space is not directly controlled. Air dehumidification is usually only a by-product of an air cooling process. When a pre-set indoor air temperature in a thermostat is reached, the compressor in an on–off controlled DX A/C system is stopped, and the dehumidification is also stopped. In a hot and humid climate like Hong Kong, the requirement for removing moisture from the air can often be more demanding than removing sensible load. Therefore, indoor humidity may remain at a high level in the space served by an on–off controlled DX A/C System.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the use of variable speed supply fans and compressors in A/C systems for simultaneously controlling indoor air temperature and humidity has been extensively investigated. Experimental results suggested that simultaneously varying the speeds of both the compressor and supply fan in a DX A/C system can help accurately control the indoor humidity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0143624412446092">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0143624412446092">5</xref></sup> However, the associated control systems and hardware are both complicated and costly.</p>
<p>New control algorithms aiming at reducing both the complexity level of hardware and cost of implementation have been developed. Xu et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0143624412446092">6</xref></sup> proposed a novel control algorithm, the H-L control, for a DX A/C system to replace the well-known on–off control. It enabled both the compressor and the supply air fan in a DX A/C system to operate at high speeds when an indoor air dry bulb temperature setting is not satisfied and at low speeds otherwise. Experimental results have demonstrated that the use of the H-L control would result in an improved indoor humidity level and a higher energy efficiency. However, a variable speed compressor was used so that the cost of implementation was high, which was not necessary as only two compressor speeds were utilized.</p>
<p>Therefore, two parallel connected single speed compressors were used to replace an expensive variable speed compressor to realize the H-L control. This was implemented by operating simultaneously the two compressors, together with running a supply air fan at a high speed when the indoor air dry-bulb temperature setting is not satisfied, and operating only one of the two compressors, together with running the fan at a low speed otherwise. Such an implementation was therefore referred as a dual-single (D-S) control. Extensive experiments have been carried out to evaluate the performance of the D-S control and the experimental results are presented in this note. The measured results suggested that similar to the H-L control, the use of D-S control could also result in a better performance in terms of an improved indoor humidity level and a higher energy efficiency, when compared to the use of the traditional on–off control. However, the initial cost of implementing the D-S control was lower than the H-L control.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0143624412446092"><title>Experimental rig and procedure</title>
<p>A fully instrumented experimental rig was set up to test the performance of the D-S control. It mainly consisted of a DX A/C unit and two simulated space, one indoor and the other outdoor, respectively. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0143624412446092">Figure 1(a)</xref> shows the schematics of the experimental rig.
<fig id="fig1-0143624412446092" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Details of the experimental rig and D-S control algorithm. (a) The schematics of the experimental rig, (b) Details of the D-S control algorithm.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0143624412446092-fig1.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>The evaporator of the DX A/C unit was placed in the simulated indoor space to work as an air cooling and dehumidifying coil. All the other major components of the DX A/C unit were placed in the simulated outdoor space. Air states in the indoor space were jointly controlled by the DX A/C unit and a sensible heat and moisture load generating unit (LGU). Air states in the outdoor space were controlled by a separate air conditioning system.</p>
<p>There were two sets of air dry and wet bulb temperature sensors located in the inlet and outlet of the indoor cooling and dehumidifying coil respectively, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0143624412446092">Figure 1(a)</xref>. Four temperature sensors were located at the inlets and outlets of both compressors and the electronic expansion valve (EEV). The temperature sensors were of platinum resistance temperature device (RTD) type with a pre-calibrated accuracy of ±0.1℃. The suction and discharge pressures of the compressors were monitored by pressure sensors with accuracy of ±0.3%. The flow rate of the return air was measured by an anemometer with a measuring accuracy of ±1% of full scale reading. The electrical powers input to compressors were measured by a power meter with accuracy of ±1%.</p>
<p>The rated capacity of the two single speed compressors was each at 3.5 kW. Since they were parallel connected, they were actually subjected to the same pressure difference between suction and discharge. Therefore, when switching from single-to-dual compressor operation, the suction and discharge pressure difference for the running compressor could prevent the other compressor from successful starting. Hence, a patent technology by Tian et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0143624412446092">7</xref></sup> for assisting the start of two compressors in parallel connection was adopted in the D-S control algorithm.</p>
<p>Experiments were carried out at three sets of simulated climates, dry (Set A), mild (Set B) and humid (Set C), respectively. At each condition, three tests were carried out. For all tests, a temperature dead-band of ±0.2℃ was used. A constant condenser cooling air-flow rate was maintained, with a fixed condenser cooling air inlet temperature at 35℃.</p>
<p>In Test 1, indoor dry bulb temperature setting was at 25.5℃ and the DX A/C unit was under D-S control. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0143624412446092">Figure 1(b)</xref>, when the measured indoor air dry-bulb temperature, <italic>T<sub>d</sub></italic>, was above the upper dead-band (25.5+0.2℃), both compressors were operated and the supply fan was operated at a high speed. When <italic>T<sub>d</sub></italic> was below the lower dead-band (25.5–0.2℃), only one compressor was operated and the supply fan was operated at a low speed. When <italic>T<sub>d</sub></italic> was within the dead-band, no change to the operating status of the compressors and the fan was necessary. Furthermore, the two compressors were alternatively operated at single-periods, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0143624412446092">Figure 1(b)</xref>. This would help to ensure a similar share in the total operating duration for both compressors and to maintain a balanced lubricating oil level between the two compressors.</p>
<p>In Test 2, indoor air dry bulb temperature was also set at 25.5℃, but the DX A/C unit was under the traditional on–off control, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0143624412446092">Figure 1(b)</xref>. During an ‘off’ period, both compressors were shut down and the supply fan was operated at a low speed. A 90 s time delay for compressor start-up was incorporated for safety reason.</p>
<p>In Test 3, the DX A/C unit was also under the traditional on–off control, but the indoor air dry-bulb temperature setting was reduced from 25.5 to 23.5℃. This was to re-assemble that at a high indoor air humidity, indoor air dry-bulb temperature setting may be lower to reduce the adverse effects to occupants caused by high humidity. However, this would increase the space cooling load due to an increased indoor–outdoor air temperature difference.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0143624412446092"><title>Experimental results and discussions</title>
<p>Extensive experiments have been carried out under the above three sets of experimental conditions. However, only the experimental results under a simulated humid climate (Set C) are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0143624412446092">Figure 2</xref>, as an example, since these are representative for the performance of the D-S control algorithm developed.
<fig id="fig2-0143624412446092" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Measured indoor air dry bulb temperature and relative humidity at a simulated humid climate.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0143624412446092-fig2.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0143624412446092">Figure 2</xref>, it can be seen that the fluctuation range of indoor air temperature under the D-S control was smaller than that under on–off control, but with more fluctuation cycles. In Test C1, due to the continuous supply of cooling capacity from the DX A/C unit under D-S control, the fluctuation range of indoor air temperature was limited to 0.75℃. However, in Test C2, since no cooling was provided by the DX A/C unit during an ‘off’ period, indoor air temperature could rapidly increase. Furthermore, the 90 seconds time delay actually prolonged the ‘off’ period. Hence, the range of temperature fluctuation was increased to 1.5℃. In Test C3, this was further increased to 2℃ at a lower indoor air temperature setting. Furthermore, the fluctuation range of indoor relative humidity (RH) under D-S control in Test C1 was also the smallest, at ∼3%, while those under on–off control were at ∼10% in Test C2 and ∼15% in Test C3, respectively. In addition, the averaged indoor RH at 68% in Test C1 was also lower than those in Test C2 and Test C3, at 74% and 76%, respectively.</p>
<p>The energy performance of the experimental DX A/C unit under D-S control, in terms of coefficient of performance (COP), was also evaluated. The measured overall mean COP under D-S control for Set C was around 4.3, which was higher than that under the on–off control, at around 3.4, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0143624412446092">Figure 3</xref>. Since the operation status of the compressors and the supply fan during a dual period under D-S control were identical to those during an ‘on’ period under on–off control, the improvement in overall mean COP under D-S control was mainly due to a higher COP at 5.5 during a single period, which increased the overall mean COP. When the DX A/C unit was operated at a single period under the same cooling load condition, the evaporating temperature would be higher than that during a dual period, leading to a higher COP of the DX A/C unit. Furthermore, the duration at which the DX A/C unit operated in dual periods was much shorter than that in ‘on’ periods under the same cooling load condition. It should be mentioned that there was no cooling capacity provided during an ‘off’ period. However, the power consumption of supply fan during the ‘off’ period was taken into account when calculating the mean COP for a complete on–off cycle.
<fig id="fig3-0143624412446092" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Measured COP at a simulated humid climate. COP: coefficient of performance.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0143624412446092-fig3.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>Using two parallel connected single speed compressors to implement the novel control algorithm would not only result in a better performance in terms of an improved indoor humidity level and higher energy efficiency when compared to the use of traditional on–off control, but also an reduced initial cost of implementation when compared to that using a variable speed compressor. For example, the market price for a 3HP variable frequency compressor is on average at HK$ 3300, and a variable speed driver would cost HK$ 3500. On the other hand, the price of two 1.5 HP single speed compressors is HK$ 1750 × 2 = 3500, with a home-made D-S control panel at HK$ 500. The price for the control panel could be further reduced if it is mass produced commercially. Therefore, the cost of two single speed compressors and their associated control could be 40% lower than that of a commercially available variable frequency compressor at an identical output cooling capacity.</p>
<p>The experimental results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0143624412446092">Figure 2</xref> are similar to those previously achieved when using the H-L control.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0143624412446092">6</xref></sup> This suggested that the novel control algorithm, which was proven effective when using a variable speed compressor, can also be implemented by using two parallel connected single speed compressors at a lower cost.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0143624412446092" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The experimental work presented in this note has proved that using two parallel connected single speed compressors to implement the novel H-L control algorithm is operational, so that the cost of implementation can be reduced. However, further work should be conducted, with particular respect to capacity ratio between the two single compressors under different load conditions, which would directly impact the operational performance and energy efficiency. More future experimental work under different combination of sensible and latent load would provide a deeper insight of implementing this D-S control algorithm.</p>
