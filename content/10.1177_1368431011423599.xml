<abstract>
<p>The practical failure to understand in conflicts, where participants routinely challenge each other’s attribution of meaning, undermines the key assumption of the Weberian interpretive project: that the subject acts meaningfully. This article revisits Weber’s concept of meaning as an object of understanding for a social scientist. Ascertaining the empirical fact of subjective attribution, as Weber advised, may not be sufficient when it comes to understanding action whose meaning is disputed. The article uses the example of E.P. Thompson’s interpretation of eighteenth-century English food riots to show that the disputed empirical meaning is a product of rational understanding, which Weber would classify as dogmatic meaning. The social scientist fails to understand what the critic claims to: a failure to act meaningfully in cultural terms. Furthermore, because the subject acts meaningfully without fail, we close off the option of explaining conflict as a rational disagreement.</p>

<body>
<p>The meaningful character of action is beyond dispute, at any rate among social scientists. To act meaningfully is to be able to say, when questioned, ‘This is what I am doing’, dispelling a possible misconception that one might be doing something else entirely: ‘I was not patronizing you, I was just trying to help.’ Neither patronizing nor helping could be accomplished without the attribution of the relevant meaning. By contrast, if I were to trip and sprain my ankle, this would not amount to action in the Weberian sense, unless I am feigning injury or deliberately self-harming. Insofar as people attach meaning to their actions, i.e. in Weber’s terms simply act, their actions represent an object of understanding for fellow actors as well as for social scientists.</p>
<p>While the meaningfulness of action is beyond dispute, its meaning is frequently disputed by other actors. Dispelling misconceptions regarding what one is doing is not always easy: an attempt to help can still be interpreted as patronizing despite heartfelt protestations to the contrary. Take, for example, an ongoing debate over the practice of veiling among Muslim women. The subject of action may insist that the wearing of the headscarf or the full veil is more than just an act of religious observance; it is a form of personal self-expression, a way of affirming a distinctive cultural identity, a mode of conducting herself with dignity appropriate to her gender or an attempt to assert her freedom as a citizen. The opponents of the veil, however, often remain unreceptive to such claims even after the social scientists have done their best to bring the subjective meaning of veiling in all its subtlety and complexity to the full light of public knowledge. While an average social scientist is well equipped to understand the meaning of the action, understanding often presents a practical problem for actors. Moreover, unlike the social scientists, who always recover a meaningful action, ordinary observers claim to understand the meaning failure on the part of the subject.</p>
<p>The meaningful character of purposeful action is routinely undermined in conflicts where participants challenge each other’s attribution of meaning. In this article, I shall examine the implications of such disputes for the concept of meaningful action underpinning the Weberian interpretive project. It is my contention that the project falls short when it comes to understanding action whose meaning is disputed by other actors. Understanding, as recommended by the founding father of interpretive sociology, puts an end to a dispute when the social scientist recovers the subjective claim to meaning. For the actors, at that point, understanding is barely begun. Nor can we help them resolve their difficulties, because, unlike them, we attribute the problem in disputes to understanding, rather than see it as an issue of meaning.</p>
<p>Never has it been harder to dispute a meaning claim than in contemporary struggles for recognition. Here, if some analyses are to be believed, meaning attribution is constitutive not just of the action, but of the very subjectivity of the actor. Meaning production has come to be regarded as an essential freedom. Thus, some new social movement theorists argued that in post-industrial society, where oppression takes symbolic forms, actors regain their freedom by ‘reappropriating’ the meaning of their actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1368431011423599">Melucci, 1996</xref>: 109). By casting off the shackles of externally imposed meanings, one emerges as a new type of individual, a truly emancipated subject with a capital S (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1368431011423599">Touraine, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1368431011423599">Dubet and Thaler, 2004</xref>). In a similar vein, other scholars have argued that participants in contemporary recognition struggles, e.g. Muslim women in Western societies, are capable of ‘resignifying’ the meaning of cultural practices such as veiling, investing them with new meaning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1368431011423599">Benhabib, 2002</xref>: 117). At the other end of the cultural spectrum, shopping for the latest pair of designer shoes has been resignified by some third-wave feminists as an ‘empowering’ act (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1368431011423599">McRobbie, 2009</xref>: 49). Whether she opts for covering up or putting on display, in either case the modern woman appears to be in charge of the meaning of her actions. As one satirical publication summed up the trend, ‘women … are now empowered by virtually everything a typical woman does’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1368431011423599">1</xref>
</sup> Not just in Weber’s epistemology, but in some political arguments too, the subject (especially the true authentic subject) simply cannot fail to act meaningfully.</p>
<p>While there is no shortage of meaning, understanding is still in short supply. Even in recognition struggles where meaning is claimed almost by right, the critic is still prepared to question whether the subject is doing X rather than Y, performing their own resignification. To understand what participants are doing in disputes, I shall argue, we need to make room for meaning failure of the kind that critic alleges, in the interpretive project of social sciences.</p>
<p>I begin by taking a closer look of Weber’s interpretive project and the alternatives he considered. He examines different types of meaning before settling for one which was to become the object of sociological understanding. Next, I examine why the interpretative project focusing on subjective attribution fails when the object of understanding is action engaged in conflict. E.P. Thompson’s analysis of eighteenth-century English food riots provides an illustration. The subsequent section discusses the limitations of the Weberian reconstructive project comparing it to the rational understanding practised by ordinary actors. Finally, I examine how the assumption of meaningfulness restricts our options when it comes to explaining what is happening in disagreements where both sides seemingly experience difficulties understanding what the other is doing.</p>
<sec id="section1-1368431011423599">
<title>An interpretive project for an empirical science of action</title>
<p>What does understanding involve for a social scientist? Weber answers this question by delineating the object of sociological understanding from meanings uncovered by alternative projects. Let me consider each of these in turn.</p>
<p>One of these projects is understanding underpinning daily social interactions. When an officer in charge of a patrol (to use Weber’s example) receives an order from his superior, he understands instantly in most cases what the subject is doing. Weber calls this mode of understanding direct observational understanding (<italic>aktuelles_Verstehen</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1368431011423599">Weber, 1968</xref>: 8, 58n). For most practical purposes observational understanding would be quite sufficient. Occasionally, however, the observer may experience difficulties reading the meaning of the action. In which case, like the officer in charge of the patrol receiving an ambiguously drawn-up command, the observer might try to fathom the motive behind the action to understand what the subject is doing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1368431011423599">Weber, 1975</xref>: 154). The task of the social scientist is not dissimilar to that of the confused observer: it too is focused on the motive of the actor. What distinguishes the sociological project from ordinary understanding is its explanatory intent. The social scientist understands what the subject is doing by identifying ‘a complex of subjective meaning which seems to the actor himself or to the observer an adequate ground for the conduct in question’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1368431011423599">Weber, 1968</xref>: 11). For the social scientist, to understand the meaning is to explain the occurrence of the action. The object of explanatory sociological understanding (<italic>erklärendes Verstehen</italic>) is subjectively meaningful rational action whose genesis can be traced to intent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1368431011423599">Weber, 1968</xref>: 8, 58n; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1368431011423599">Weber, 1975</xref>: 127).</p>
<p>To a social scientist, the subjective meaning has the status of an empirical fact, in contrast to meaning, which is the object of conceptual inquiry, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1368431011423599">Weber (1977</xref>: 112) refers to as ‘dogmatics of meaning’. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1368431011423599">Weber (1968</xref>: 4) takes great care to distinguish the empirical project of social sciences from the so-called ‘dogmatic disciplines’, which include ‘jurisprudence, logic, ethics, and esthetics’ among others. The latter are not concerned with empirical meaning, i.e. the fact of subjective meaning attribution, but ‘seek to ascertain the “true” and “valid” meanings associated with the objects of their investigation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1368431011423599">Weber, 1968</xref>: 4). Thus, a legal scholar deduces the correct meaning of a paragraph of law logically from a set of conceptual relations, a dogmatic system of meaning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1368431011423599">Weber, 1977</xref>: 113). The object of such an inquiry is to establish ‘juristic truth’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1368431011423599">Weber, 1977</xref>: 128). The meaning the interpreter is after is not the idea in the mind of the actor responsible for the conduct in question, but the ‘ideal meaning’ embodied in the code of law (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1368431011423599">Weber, 1977</xref>: 141). Legal and other dogmatics of meaning deal with a different order of facts: facts of conceptual nature. These, unlike empirical facts of subjective meaning attribution, can be established definitely, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1368431011423599">Weber (1977</xref>: 113).</p>
<p>Given the empirical status of meaning, the interpretive project of social sciences is no different in essential respects from the interpretation of natural phenomena. In either case, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1368431011423599">Weber (1968</xref>: 5), the certainty with which the scholar assigns meaning has a rational basis. Unlike some of his contemporaries, Weber does not attach specific significance to understanding as a method uniquely appropriate to social sciences dealing with meaning. He takes issue with those who maintain that only by empathetic imaginative reliving of another person’s experience can we gain access to subjective meaning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1368431011423599">Weber, 1975</xref>: 154–69). Empathy, according to its advocates, allows the interpreter to impute meaning with certainty unthinkable in observational understanding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1368431011423599">Weber, 1975</xref>: 160). To the certainty attainable through imaginative experience, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1368431011423599">Weber (1968</xref>: 5) opposes the rational certainty of understanding which involves generation and verification of hypotheses regarding the meaning. We can understand without imaginatively participating in another person’s experience, however far removed those are from our own. While empathetic understanding renders simply a different experience, knowledge is obtained by objectifying subjective experience turning it into the content of a testable proposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1368431011423599">Weber, 1975</xref>: 159, 162, 166). Unfortunately, certainty is not attainable in social sciences. For various reasons that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1368431011423599">Weber (1968</xref>: 9–10) lists, the meaning of the actual action ‘must remain only a peculiarly plausible hypothesis’. What is subject to verification in social sciences is the ‘pure type’ of the actual meaning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1368431011423599">Weber, 1968</xref>: 4, 10–11). Interpretation strives for theoretical adequacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1368431011423599">Weber, 1968</xref>: 11).</p>
<p>Meaning is not exclusively bound up with motive in Weber’s epistemology. It is also a matter of significance in cultural terms. As much as we are interested in causal explanation in social sciences, we cannot ‘reduce phenomena to causal equivalences’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1368431011423599">Weber, 1975</xref>: 104). Even imputation of motive in the empirical science of action involves attribution of ‘causal significance’ to it by a social scientist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1368431011423599">Weber, 1949c</xref>: 135). The same motive which has the significance of a cause for a social scientist can also be an ‘object of valuation (<italic>Bewertung</italic>)’ for the same interpreter as a person of certain political, religious or moral convictions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1368431011423599">Weber, 1949c</xref>: 143). Evaluation is another mode of understanding Weber is keen to distinguish from the empirical project of social sciences. Especially since causal inquiry is embedded in the cultural realm where all phenomena have meaning to us to the extent that we can relate them to our values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1368431011423599">Weber, 1975</xref>: 108). The value we impute to a phenomenon cannot be derived from the circumstances of its causation, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1368431011423599">Weber (1975</xref>: 108) insists. Unless the value is the cause: only the empirical fact of value-rational action is empirically self-evident. By contrast, any external attribution of value should be excluded from the empirical interpretive project, barring the ascription of causal significance to a motive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1368431011423599">Weber, 1949a</xref>: 11). The making of ‘value judgements’ constitutes an entirely different project of understanding – <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1368431011423599">Weber (1949c</xref>: 143, 146) calls it ‘explicit evaluation’, distinguishing it further from ‘value analysis’, which is, essentially, a dogmatic inquiry into values embodied in an object.</p>
<p>To recap, in social sciences we understand by uncovering causal relations of a certain kind: a subjectively meaningful action. Weber distinguishes the interpretive project of social sciences from regular observational understanding (of the kind that enables social interactions), from dogmatic inquiry which deduces meaning from conceptual relations and empathetic imitation of another person’s experience, and, finally, from attribution of significance from a value standpoint.</p>
<p>In reality, the distinctions are not as clear-cut. As I shall argue below, the idea in the actor’s mind, which makes the action meaningful to a social scientist, is often a product of relations of significance, in the same way the object of dogmatic inquiry is. To use <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1368431011423599">Weber’s (1977</xref>: 108) example, a person tipping his hat to greet an acquaintance is regulating his conduct by conceptual relations. What he is doing is as much a conceptual fact as it is an empirical idea. Weber uses the example in his polemic with Stammler to make a point of utmost importance to him: the tipping of the hat (i.e. the fact of meaningful action) cannot be deduced from a conceptual scheme to which it is related. As he puts it, it is not the ‘conventional rule of greeting’ that tips the hat, but the subject’s intention to do so (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1368431011423599">Weber, 1977</xref>: 108). The cause is in the mind, not in the conceptual scheme: causality in the empirical realm of meaningful action must not be conflated with validity within a system of dogmatic meaning. Whether or not the idea in the actor’s mind ‘measures up’ in conceptual terms is irrelevant to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1368431011423599">Weber’s (1977</xref>: 111) interpretive project. As I shall argue, the dogmatic element in the empirical meaning presents certain problems for Weber’s project. It runs into difficulties when validity in conceptual terms becomes an issue for the observer. Focusing on subjective attribution, we may end up asserting the fact of meaningful action, where on closer analysis there can be none.</p>

<title>The moral economy of the eighteenth-century English crowd: understanding meaning failure</title>
<p>The subject may fail to act meaningfully. To illustrate the problem with Weber’s interpretive project, I shall now turn to an empirical case of disputed meaning, which became an object of understanding for a prominent social scientist.</p>
<p>In the early 1970s, a renowned British historian E.P. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1368431011423599">Thompson (1991</xref>) took to task a conservative school of historiography of popular protest for their failure to follow Weber’s prescription to understand.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1368431011423599">2</xref>
</sup> At the heart of the controversy were eighteenth-century English food riots. The latter were a fairly common occurrence in England of that period. Whenever bad harvests or downturns in trade sent the food prices soaring, popular discontent would often spill over into a riot with crowds of urban poor plundering granaries and attacking corn-dealers. Conservative historians were for the most part content to plot the instances of such outbreaks of popular discontent onto the graphs of harvest yields and fluctuating grain prices. It was this kind of explanation that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1368431011423599">Weber (1975</xref>: 128–9) had contested earlier, arguing that the strictest possible empirical-statistical generalization could not bring us any closer to understanding the meaning of action. Statistical patterns seemingly confirmed the initial interpretation of the riots as ‘rebellions of the belly’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1368431011423599">Thompson, 1991</xref>: 186). As a Marxist historian, Thompson was bound to be critical of explanation which denied the working men and women in the eighteenth-century English crowd a sense of agency and capacity for concerted reasoned action. As someone who embraced the principles of interpretive sociology, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1368431011423599">Thompson (1991</xref>: 87) was puzzled by the ‘abbreviated’ version of ‘economic man’, on which the quantitative approach relied. In the ‘spasmodic view’ of popular history, as he aptly called it, the actions of participants were stripped of any cultural meaning, with which a social anthropologist credit the actions of an average Trobriand islander (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1368431011423599">Thompson, 1991</xref>: 185). While the inhabitants of the South Pacific are known for their capacity for meaningful action, the eighteenth-century English collier simply ‘claps his hand spasmodically upon his stomach, and responds to elementary economic stimuli’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1368431011423599">Thompson, 1991</xref>: 187).</p>
<p>Determined to put the English collier on an equal footing with the Melanesian man, Thompson embarks on an interpretive project. Searching the historical evidence for indices of subjective attribution, as Weber recommended, he unveils a ‘pattern of behaviour of which a Trobriand islander need not have been ashamed’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1368431011423599">Thompson, 1991</xref>: 252). Far from being driven by hunger, the forcible seizures of grain, he shows, were informed by an understanding that had deep cultural roots. In the Elizabethan reign, when harvests failed, magistrates would attend the markets inspecting supplies, ordering extra quantities of grain to be brought in to keep the prices low, and on rare occasion were also known to exercise their power to set the price on a bushel of grain, all as part of ‘emergency measures’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1368431011423599">Thompson, 1991</xref>: 224–5). The understanding that in times of dearth prices of grain ‘ought to be regulated’ to provide for the needs of the poor in the community was part and parcel of a wider set of economic practices and associated expectations which formed the ‘moral economy of the English crowd’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1368431011423599">Thompson, 1991</xref>: 229, 188). It was the sense of entitlement denied rather than an acute distress at the prospect of imminent starvation that drove the poor to plunder. By the eighteenth century, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1368431011423599">Thompson (1991</xref>: 227) explains, the authorities had all but abandoned those emergency measures, which prompted the poor to take the law into their own hands. Indeed, the central action of the riotous crowd bore a certain similarity to the emergency measures of old: as they moved from the market place to the mills and from there on to the farms, the men and women in the crowd were not just seizing stock, they were forcing the farmers and corn-dealers to sell it at the price they deemed to be fair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1368431011423599">Thompson, 1991</xref>: 228). In this, they believed, they were ‘supported by the wider consensus of the community’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1368431011423599">Thompson, 1991</xref>: 188).</p>
<p>However, just as they were putting their faith in the ‘popular consensus’ over moral economy, the ‘paternalist model’ of economic relations was giving way to an emergent consensus over political economy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1368431011423599">Thompson, 1991</xref>: 188, 193, 203). Throughout the eighteenth century a new thinking was gradually gaining ground: that moral imperatives had no place in the market. The ascending moral truth was the promise of prosperity for all to be gained by entrusting ourselves to the laws of the market. Even in the heyday of moral economy, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1368431011423599">Thompson (1991</xref>: 200) notes, the paternalist ideal was not always borne out by the economic practice. By the eighteenth century, however, it came under sustained attack from the champions and practitioners of the new model. The mood was changing. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1368431011423599">Thompson (1991</xref>: 201) points out, four years prior to the publication of Adam Smith’s seminal work expounding the principles of the new economic thinking, legislation against forestalling had already been repealed, dealing another blow to the paternalist model. With the best minds of the nation extolling the virtues of the self-regulating market, appeals to moral economy by the common men and women in the English crowd sounded increasingly more out of date, dismissed by the more articulate champions of political economy as being on a par with prejudice and superstition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1368431011423599">Thompson, 1991</xref>: 203). The authority of tradition was no match for the truths of the new economic science. Throughout the eighteenth century, the moral economy was dying a ‘long-drawn-out-death’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1368431011423599">Thompson, 1991</xref>: 253). Indeed, it is the very decline of the paternalist economic ideal with its notion of reciprocal moral obligations that prompted the English colliers’ desperate, if doomed, efforts to save it from complete extinction.</p>
<p>The English collier has hard time living up to the model of the Trobriand islander of Malinowski’s anthropology. When the former is ‘setting the price’ of grain through direct action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1368431011423599">Thompson, 1991</xref>: 224), the community is split down the middle between the guardians of moral economy and practitioners of the free market. His actions form part of a conflict within the culture. The object of understanding for a social scientist is also the object of contention for other members of the community. It is this disputed meaning that Thompson renders visible following Weber’s prescription to understand. Focusing on subjective attribution, he uncovers meaning which is a matter of significance in cultural terms, a meaning which can be deduced logically from a set of cultural categories: the practice of moral economy. This is the intended (stroke) dogmatic meaning. It happens to be the meaning that some within the community have hard time understanding, insisting that the collective subject – the English collier and his fellow participants – are doing something else: disturbing public peace, committing crimes against property, etc. Thompson brushes aside the fact of disagreement. It has no bearing upon his interpretive project. The actions of participants in the riots are meaningful anyway by virtue of subjective attribution. When Thompson imports the model of Trobriand islanders whose actions are imbued with cultural meaning to the eighteenth-century England at the time of the riots, he does not consider it to be less applicable in that context simply because consensus was patchy with moral economy in crisis. The small matter of disagreement does not affect the English collier's ability to act meaningfully in Thompson’s account. Participating in a cargo cult and setting the price through direct action in a food riot are meaningful in exactly the same way, if his analysis is correct.</p>
<p>It is not hard to see why the English collier may have failed to act meaningfully on that occasion. If the Trobriand islander model applies (i.e. if the English collier is a cultural being), then his ability to set the price must have been impaired in the absence of broader cultural consensus over moral economy. When he is enforcing the emergency measures interpreting his own actions in terms of cultural categories that constitute moral economy, he knows (or suspects) that something is not quite right with moral economy. The Trobriand islander engaging in Kula exchange has no problems of this kind: the latter is supported by wider consensus within the community which is lacking in eighteenth-century England. Like the Melanesian man, the English collier attempts to act meaningfully in the strong sense, with moral economy providing a standard by which his actions are to be measured. The social scientist, on the other hand, recovers meaning in the weak sense: an action constituted by the fact of subjective attribution of meaning. The Weberian subject cannot fail to act meaningfully whether or not validity happens to be an issue for the observer who disputes the adequacy of subjective attribution alleging meaning failure in dogmatic terms.</p>

<title>Disputed meaning and the limits of reconstructive hermeneutics</title>
<p>The fact that the meaning of action is commonly disputed is of no relevance to the Weberian interpretive project. Others may question whether the subject is setting a fair price or committing common robbery, but the social scientist simply recovers subjective meaning which constitutes the object of contention. Layers of external interpretations are peeled away to reveal a subjectively meaningful action. The social scientist succeeds where ordinary actors often fail. But as I shall argue, our understanding is limited in an important respect. We have no difficulties of the kind that the ordinary interpreter experiences, but on the other hand, we cannot understand what they claim to: the lack of understanding.</p>
<p>The social scientist assumes a meaningful object of understanding. In Weber, action is meaningful insofar as it is interpretable. This is what I called earlier meaningful in the weak sense. The interpretive project of sociology resembles in some respect that of reconstructive hermeneutics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1368431011423599">Gadamer, 1975</xref>: 147). In both cases the problem is conceived as lack of transparency the meaning never being in questio,n; it is understanding which presents a problem. Hermeneutics is a paradoxical undertaking: understanding is a special effort occasioned by a perceived failure of regular understanding to grasp the meaning. The regular understanding is considered problematic due to the cultural (historical) distance separating the interpreter from the text. The meaning eludes the regular reader because the text is dislocated so to speak, taken out of its original cultural (historical, social) context; it is, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1368431011423599">Gadamer’s (1977</xref>: 25) word, ‘atopon’, i.e. out of place. The interpreter faces the problem of reconstructing the original context one way or another to get to the authentic meaning, which layers of subsequent interpretations may have made obscure. In Weber’s case, the project does not start with an admission of failure of regular understanding, but it goes without saying that we cannot rely on routine self-evident interpretations of the action’s meaning when establishing the empirical fact of meaningful action. Sociological understanding may also involve the bridging of cultural distance when, for example, the interpreter coming from a different value perspective might not see the intended meaning clearly until he or she relates it to the subject’s value context. As Thompson’s analysis of the eighteenth-century food riots shows, transparency can be an issue in sociological understanding with the significance of action for the subject eluding the observer unless, as in classical hermeneutics, the latter makes an effort to reconstruct the subject’s perspective complete with the cultural context.</p>
<p>The social scientist understands hermeneutically what other observers fail to understand rationally. An average observer does not assume the object of understanding to be meaningful. On the contrary, they are prepared to dispute what the other is doing imputing meaning failure to the subject of action. They are in effect resignifying: ‘You are not doing X, you are doing Y.’ Transparency is not a problem for them in the majority of cases. The problem is the subject’s failure to live up to the cultural standards by which they hold the action accountable. They detect a failure to act meaningfully in the strong sense, raising the issue of adequacy of attribution. Participants in conflict rarely doubt their ability to understand what the other is doing. What, to a third party, may seem like a failure to understand turns out on closer examination to contain a claim to better understanding: the understanding of meaning failure. Participants in a dispute understand differently from a social scientist. The practical project of understanding – though the word ‘project’ fits loosely in this case, with no special interpretive effort involved – bears closer resemblance to dogmatics of meaning than to reconstructive hermeneutics. The social scientist is content to establish the fact of subjective attribution of meaning. Leaving aside the causal significance of such attribution for the sociological observer, the latter understands ultimately in terms of the subject’s own understanding of their actions, i.e. hermeneutically. Participants in conflict, on the other hand, understand rationally: making sense of the other’s actions in terms of the cultural categories they expect the subject to apply. The failure or success of rational understanding is beyond the grasp of reconstructive hermeneutics. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1368431011423599">Gadamer (1975</xref>: 158–9) observes, it is when we fail to agree on the subject matter that understanding tends to be reoriented to subjective meaning which we can agree upon.</p>
<p>If we are to understand the lack of understanding, we need to make room for problematic attribution of meaning in our concept of meaningful action. Weber himself shows the way when he departs from the reconstructive project to embrace criticism of subjective attribution in the limited case of purpose-rational action. The latter can turn out to be less meaningful than it claims as a result of the social scientist’s interpretive efforts. Someone who, in their own understanding, is using the most effective means to bring about certain ends can be shown to be mistaken. The subject’s judgement concerning the relevance of means to the ends and of the projected ends to the likely outcomes of action is subject to what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1368431011423599">Weber (1949b</xref>: 53) calls ‘technical criticism’. The term ‘technical’ serves to differentiate this form of criticism from criticism of another kind, which he emphatically excludes from the sociological project: the making of value judgements. In the sphere of instrumental action, the social scientist and the ordinary observer understand more or less similarly: from a standpoint that transcends cultural boundaries. The social scientist holds no critical advantage in this respect over the ordinary observer: a lay critic with comparable level of expertise and access to data can likewise persuade the rational subject to improve their understanding of what it is they are doing. The critic, who may or may not be a social scientist, can dispute the adequacy of meaning attribution with the subject because both understand rationally measuring the action by the cultural standard of efficiency. Insofar as instrumental action is open to rational criticism, the subject acts meaningfully in the strong sense – in the same sense in which the facticity of action is disputed by participants in conflict. When it comes to purpose-rational action, the social scientist, by Weber’s admission, can understand rationally what the subject or the critics may have failed to.</p>
<p>By contrast, value-rational action does not leave much room for improvement of understanding. Where value commitments are concerned, the subject, according to Weber, acts meaningfully in the weak sense. Subjective attribution of meaning is virtually exempt from criticism, even though observers may dispute the adequacy of attribution. This is best illustrated by the anarcho-syndicalist of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1368431011423599">Weber’s (1948a</xref>: 120–1) discussion of the ethic of ultimate ends.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1368431011423599">3</xref>
</sup> Presented with the overwhelming evidence of disastrous effects of his actions on the plight of the working classes whose cause he professes to champion, the anarcho-syndicalist is unlikely to be impressed with such criticism, content in the knowledge that his efforts have set an example for others, his only responsibility being to the values he holds dear. Weber’s observations sum up a certain brand of radical politics exempt from rational criticism, which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1368431011423599">Popper (1963</xref>: 483) later designated the ‘utopian attitude’, explaining its propensity to violence by the unquestionable commitment to ultimate ends. But the attitude is also typical of value-rational action, which is exempt from rational criticism. An outcome-oriented purpose-rational action requires a critical attitude from the subject who is ready to amend their initial understanding of what it is they are doing. By contrast, no critical attitude is expected of value-oriented actors, whose rationality is manifested in the strength of their commitments to the values in question rather than in the quality of their judgements regarding the exemplary nature of their actions. It has been pointed out since that problematic attribution can emerge as an issue for value-rational action. Most notably, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1368431011423599">Habermas (1984</xref>) extended critical attitude to value-rational action, arguing that the validity of value judgements is routinely subject to criticism.</p>
<p>What recommends reconstructive project to a social scientist is its higher success rate compared with rational understanding, which only seems to prolong disputes indefinitely as both sides claim superior understanding of what the other is doing. As if anticipating problems that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1368431011423599">Habermas (1984</xref>) would later wrestle with in his theory of communicative reason, Weber opts for meaningfulness, regardless of the critic’s take on subjective attribution. Ultimately, he is not prepared to compromise the subject’s capacity to act meaningfully for the uncertain outcomes of rational criticism that subjective attribution often gives rise to. Though he makes room for the subject’s lack of understanding (i.e. problematic attribution of meaning) in the case of purpose-rational action, the action remains meaningful whether or not the critic has a point, by virtue of subjective attribution. Even on those occasions when it falls short of instrumental rationality standards, the subject is still doing what they claim to be doing. The problem with the reconstructive project is that it renders meaningful in the weak sense what, for some observers, and potentially for the subject, lacks meaning in the strong sense. The critic claims to understand what is beyond the grasp of our interpretive project: the failure of meaningful action. The critic may well be wrong, but, whatever the case, the social scientist lacks the means to assess the adequacy of their understanding. We abandon the project at the point when our understanding could hardly be more relevant for the actors. Moreover, when explaining the apparent failure of practical understanding in conflicts, we make no room for wrong attribution such as participants allege.</p>

<sec id="section4-1368431011423599">
<title>Meaningful action and rational disagreement</title>
<p>The critic’s claim to better understanding does not impress the social scientist. When disagreements arise, we tend to see them as a problem of understanding, not as an issue of meaning. Despite the meaning of action being contested in practice, the subjects continue to act meaningfully in our explanations. The critic’s claim regarding wrong attribution is dismissed as cultural misunderstanding due to value differences or a strategic framing effort in a symbolic power struggle. These are the two options we presently entertain when it comes to explaining disagreement. In either case, as I shall argue, relying on subjective attribution to identify meaningful action has the adverse effect of denying rationality to disagreement.</p>
<p>Like the eighteenth-century English colliers, participants in disputes invoke broader popular consensus when questioning the subject’s claim to meaning. The problem with consensus is that it hardly ever obtains. And it certainly does not obtain at the time when the claims are being made. Confronted with competing interpretations of what the subject is doing, the social scientist can choose to overlook the reference to missing consensus and declare action to be meaningful as it claims to be when engaged in conflict. This is the path that E.P. Thompson followed in his analysis of the eighteenth-century food riots. Alternatively, the social scientist might dismiss the references to consensus as misguided or disingenuous and, instead of giving credence to participants’ appeals to moral economy, might look for unacknowledged motives, e.g. the economic and social interests underpinning such appeals. Whether we rely on the subject’s own understanding of what it is they are doing (e.g. setting the price) or locate the true meaning in structural relations of power, in either case the subject acts meaningfully in our explanations. The problem lies with the other’s understanding. In the first case, we have essentially a value conflict: both sides are able to act meaningfully in the strong sense which cannot be understood by the opponent subscribing to a different set of values. From the standpoint of emergent consensus over political economy, the setting of the price does not make sense. In the second case, disagreement is a symbolic (power) struggle where a fiction of consensus has to be maintained if either side is to be able to defend its interests. Understanding is out of the question except for the recognition of the power motive behind the claim to meaning in the strong sense. When consensus does not obtain, we fragment it or declare it a fiction to keep the action meaningful in its absence.</p>
<p>Whichever option we choose, in neither case can disagreement be resolved rationally: by validating meaning claims the way Habermas envisaged. Value conflicts, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1368431011423599">Weber (1948b</xref>: 147, 146), are ‘irreconcilable’: how can a devout Catholic and a Freemason arguing about forms of church and state ‘ever be brought to evaluate these subjects alike’? Value commitments being a matter of faith rather than rational choice, only a prophet or a saviour can settle such a dispute (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1368431011423599">Weber, 1948b</xref>: 153). Short of converting the other to one’s own standpoint, neither side can be reasonably expected to revise its meaning claims admitting to a prior lack of understanding. Likewise, in symbolic (power) struggles where meaning claims serve competing interests, there is little prospect of reaching agreement rationally by criticizing the opponent’s claims to meaning. But here at least the semblance of rationality is preserved as both sides raise validity claims aiming to reach the public rather than the opponent. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1368431011423599">Bourdieu (1991</xref>: 170) sums up the nature of the interaction, relations of power appear ‘in the misrecognizable form of relations of meaning’. Without the third parties such as the public taking meaning claims at their face value, participants’ efforts to invest reality with their preferred meaning would go to waste. According to social movement scholars who generally favour this explanation, ‘symbolic struggles’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1368431011423599">Gamson, 1988</xref>: 219) are won or lost, not on the strength of the meaning claim, but on account of the framing strategy: how well the chosen interpretive frames resonate in a particular context of opportunities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1368431011423599">Ferree, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1368431011423599">Koopmans, 2004</xref>). Beneath the appearance of rational disagreement the analyst discerns a calculated strategic attempt to mobilize symbolic resources to dislodge a competing interpretation of the action.</p>
<p>Committed to the notion of meaningful action, we disregard the third possibility, namely that disagreement could be a product of rational understanding within the same system of categories, which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1368431011423599">Habermas (1984</xref>: 82) calls the ‘lifeworld’. With consensus fragmented or a fiction, neither in value conflicts nor in symbolic struggle could wrong attribution be a genuine issue for participants. When it comes to explaining disagreement the choice is currently between the apparent meaning and the unacknowledged motive, between trusting the subject to act meaningfully in the strong cultural sense and distrusting any claims to meaning invoking shared categories of understanding to turn out to be right. The option of meaning failure, or problematic attribution is not presently available. No one can be wrong about the meaning in values conflicts, which makes them effectively irreconcilable. In symbolic struggles, where at least a fiction of consensus is maintained, no action can be meaningful the way it claims to be. Wrong attribution is simply a weak framing strategy open to criticism in terms of its effectiveness, like any instrumental action. In either case, it is the critic’s understanding which is impaired, not the subject’s meaning. But what if consensus is neither fragmented nor a fiction, what if both the subject and the critic apply the same categories to make sense of each other’s action, validating each other’s claims to meaning in terms of those categories, the way <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1368431011423599">Habermas (1984</xref>: 75) describes? In this case, a failure to understand is a failure to validate a meaning claim. It could be indicative of wrong attribution on the subject’s part, but with both sides imputing meaning failure to the other, it could also be a sign of a problem with the categories impairing validation.</p>
<p>If both sides understand rationally within the same system of categories, how does one explain persistent disagreement? Successful criticism of the subject’s claim to meaning would indeed testify to the sharing of the lifeworld. And so would unproblematic validation of meaning claims. But when both impute meaning failure to each other, it may be tempting to dismiss such disagreements as not entirely rational. This is what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1368431011423599">Habermas (1984</xref>: 288, 295) effectively does when he introduces the concept of ‘communicative action’. Having defined communicative reason broadly as validation of meaning claims in terms of shared categories, he casts doubt on the rationality of everyday communication. With the ordinary use of communication, the sharing of the categories is not enough to ensure agreement or guarantee its rationality. Communication is routinely distorted by power motives, or strategic orientation of participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1368431011423599">Habermas, 1984</xref>: 332). The rational potential of the language can only be fully realized in communicative action which, in addition to raising criticizable validity claims, is also specifically ‘oriented to reaching understanding’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1368431011423599">Habermas, 1984</xref>: 286). Any disagreement, however intractable, can be settled with relative ease, according to Habermas, once participants have adopted a communicative orientation to reaching understanding. Thus, having acknowledged that wrong attribution may be an issue in communication, Habermas then shifts the problem away from the claimed meaning to the underlying power motive. In the ideal realm of communicative action, validation of meaning claims should not present a problem. In real-life disputes where participants have difficulties validating their claims to meaning (understanding), it is not the wrong attribution but essentially the wrong attitude which impairs understanding. Despite making room for problematic attribution in terms of shared categories of understanding, Habermas is not prepared to grant that adequacy of attribution could be an issue in imperfect real-life disagreements.</p>
<p>There is a way to explain persistent disagreement without questioning its rationality, i.e. participants’ commitment to shared categories. When neither side seems capable of persuading the other of being wrong about the meaning, we cannot discount the fact that they keep on trying. Disagreement seems rational to them as it is: instead of adjusting their attitude to reach understanding, they reaffirm their commitment to shared categories by continuing to insist on the fact of wrong attribution. In Habermas’s theory of communicative action, it is ultimately the recognition of the other’s subjectivity that makes meaning claims amenable to adjustment. But to participants in real-life disputes the categories are more important than the other’s subjectivity, judging by their reluctance to explore more pragmatic means of dispute resolution in the face of the opponent’s stubborn failure to understand. Habermas underestimates the problems the categories themselves may present for participants validating their claims, even in the absence of the power motive. Consider again Weberian value conflicts. What ought to puzzle us about them is the fact of the dispute itself: why would a devout Catholic and a Freemason feel compelled to discuss matters on which they know they disagree? What occasions a dispute like this is not the difference in values, but the fact that the difference does not yet make sense to participants. In sixteenth-century Reformation struggles, both sides were preaching ‘true faith’ to each other, if by rather unconventional means, while quoting profusely from the same source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1368431011423599">Zemon Davies, 1973</xref>). The categories both sides employed to deny meaning to each other’s actions were shared to a substantial degree. As in the case of moral economy in eighteenth-century England, popular consensus was not completely fragmented into incompatible value spheres: what we observe is the crisis within the value system occasioning a dispute. The opponents could neither agree on a single interpretation of ‘true faith’ nor agree to disagree admitting to differences of values.</p>
<p>It was <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1368431011423599">MacIntyre (1988</xref>) who offered this diagnosis of the problem. When trying to explain why some validity claims are interminably criticizable, he does not, like Habermas, cite strategic orientation as the source of the difficulties, although, he acknowledges, it does come into play. Instead, he locates the problem squarely with the categories participants invoke in such disputes. Moral and political disagreements within the public sphere of modern liberal societies tend to be resolved pragmatically, he argues, rather than rationally through validation of meaning claims in terms of shared categories. Most of the time, we have to rely on institutionalized procedures of ‘non-rational persuasion’, such as majority vote and bargaining, to settle differences of interpretations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1368431011423599">MacIntyre, 1988</xref>: 338–44). Meanwhile, a dispute regarding the right interpretation in terms of shared categories goes on, albeit turning increasingly into a rhetorical contest where assertions and counter-assertions take the place of rational arguments. The source of our difficulties, according to MacIntyre, is the contradictions within the system of categories accumulated over time. Will, justice, reason, virtue, efficiency, and other categories routinely invoked in contemporary political and moral debates do not constitute parts of a coherent system, but emerged at various points in time in the course of the evolution of the classical Aristotelian framework. Concepts belonging to later periods made their way into the system without being properly reconciled with their predecessors weakening the unity of the original framework. Whereas Habermas stresses the shared nature of the lifeworld (in contrast to Weber’s plurality of standpoints), MacIntyre points out that consensus obtains incompletely, impairing understanding for participants in contemporary moral and political disputes.</p>
<p>Within an evolving system of categories, it is not just understanding that occasionally presents a problem: it can also be hard to act meaningfully in the strong sense. The subject’s failure to understand what they are doing in terms of categories that constitute a stable internally consistent system is easily enough exposed. Consider Weber’s purpose-rational action: technical criticism is less likely to be met with incomprehension and a competing claim than any other kind of resignification. Weber presumably recommends technical criticism in the expectation that it can actually convince the subject to improve their own understanding of the action or, failing that, exposes the deficiency of the critic’s understanding. In the case of successful criticism, the subject’s initial failure to act meaningfully in the strong sense can be attributed to learning, i.e. the incomplete mastery of categories. For instance, a recent convert to the Christian faith determined to act like a believer is bound to have limited grasp of what being a true Christian involves in any specific situation. Like the purpose-rational actor, he or she is only making a judgement within a set of cultural categories. Like others who observe the actions, the subject too is the interpreter. Far from knowing what they are doing, the learning subject can misinterpret the meaning. But with the system of categories itself in the state of change, both the subject and the critic find themselves in the learning situation. For a while the status of action in terms of meaning may remain uncertain. No one can be entirely sure of what it is they are doing in the strong dogmatic sense. Thus, in the sixteenth-century Reformation conflicts, we cannot trust either side’s interpretation of their actions. Given the state of the categories, both can only be acting hypothetically claiming to be doing X rather than Y.</p>

<sec id="section5-1368431011423599">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>How do we understand action whose meaning is being disputed? According to Weber, like any other action which is interpretable in principle, that is to say meaningful: by imputing the motive (intention, purpose) to the act. In this article, I have taken issue with the concept of meaningful action underpinning Weber’s interpretive project. This action is indisputably meaningful in (what I call) the weak sense, i.e. by virtue of its intentionality, or subjective attribution of meaning. On the other hand, there is plenty of room for disagreement over interpretation, as the meaning can only be known hypothetically. Weber’s interpretive project is indifferent to the interpretation proffered by the critic who disputes subjective attribution, not least because the meaning being disputed is meaning in the strong sense, i.e. meaning as significance in terms of shared cultural categories, a product of rational understanding. Thus, in the eighteenth-century English food riots, as E.P. Thompson’s analysis makes amply clear, participants had difficulty being understood to be setting the price. This does not prevent Thompson from arguing that this is precisely what participants were doing, on the basis of this being the meaning attributed by the actors, as can be gleaned from the documentary evidence. One might disagree with his interpretation of the actions, but even if he was wrong about the meaning, he certainly stayed true to the Weberian interpretive project, focusing on the idea in the actors’ minds to tentatively establish the empirical fact of action X.</p>
<p>Rational understanding, unlike the reconstructive project of social science, I have argued, leaves room for meaning failure on the subject’s part. Weber, in his methodological writings, states unequivocally that the meaning, which is the object of sociological understanding, is neither right nor wrong. Its status is factual, the meaning being the purported cause of action. On the other hand, valid meaning is the object of understanding in the so-called dogmatic disciplines where he includes jurisprudence and aesthetics among others. This meaning is metaphysically rather than physically real, according to Weber. The interpreter deduces the meaning logically from a set of legal, aesthetical or other collectively held categories. The evaluative mode of understanding too is a species of dogmatics of meaning. Thus, teleological evaluation of purpose-rational action, which Weber also refers to as technical criticism, can reveal deficiency in the subject’s understanding of the action. Here the meaning is significance in terms of categories, for the subject as well as for the critic. Likewise, in eighteenth-century English food riots, the idea in the actors’ minds reconstructed by the social scientist is related to a dogmatic system of meaning: the collectively held idea of moral economy. As a product of rational understanding by the subject applying cultural categories to his or her own actions, the empirical meaning is open to criticism in terms of validity. As with Weberian purpose-rational action, there is room for wrong attribution of meaning in the case of the setting of the price in line with moral economy.</p>
<p>Always a possibility with dogmatic meaning, wrong attribution is almost unavoidable when consensus over the principles of a collective practice no longer obtains. As Thompson shows, at the time of the food riots, the system of categories constituting the moral economy of the poor was in crisis. Far from inspiring universal approval, it had been under sustained attack for some time from the champions and practitioners of the new political economy. That would explain why the setting of the price took such a peculiar form: of the ‘emergency measures’, or direct action by the crowd. Despite their belief in the popular consensus over moral economy, the men and women in the crowd entertained no illusion about how much understanding their emergency measures were going to find among some sections of the community. True to the Weberian project, Thompson disregards the fact that the subjects claimed validity in terms of cultural categories which had themselves become problematic. As a Weberian subject, the English collier does not lose his ability to act in the strong dogmatic sense of setting the price even when the system of moral economy was in crisis. A more structurally inclined scholar in Thompson’s place might have chosen to ignore the dogmatic element in the meaning altogether, opting for the economic motive of some description, as did the spasmodic school of popular protest whose interpretation Thompson set out to challenge. Structural explanation tends to distrust claims to validity in dogmatic terms. But, like the Weberian subject, the subject of structural explanation acts meaningfully in conflict, albeit the meaning in this case is not the one which the opponent disputes. Either way, the social scientist discounts the critic’s claim to rational understanding of the subject’s failure to act meaningfully in the strong sense as irrelevant, whatever the state of the categories.</p>
<p>Even when the dogmatic system of meaning like moral economy appears to be in crisis, the adequacy of attribution does not emerge as an issue for the analyst despite participants disputing each other’s understanding. As I have argued, we tend to shift the problem away from meaning to understanding, attributing the difficulties of reaching understanding to cultural differences or underlying power motives. Thus, when either side alleges wrong attribution in terms of cultural categories (‘you are doing Y rather than X’, committing common robbery instead of setting the price), the critic cannot turn out to be right or expect to persuade the subject of their rightness. A dispute like this is more likely to be construed as a value conflict or symbolic (power) struggle than a case of rational disagreement, i.e. a failure to reach understanding in terms of shared categories. Neither model leaves much room for improvement of the subject’s understanding, in contrast to rational disagreement where the subject may fail to act meaningfully. I have argued that it is possible to disagree rationally while having difficulties coming to agreement, if the categories in terms of which both sides claim better understanding are themselves problematic. Ambiguities and inconsistencies to be found in any complex, evolving, open dogmatic system of meaning can impair understanding even for the most competent of the subjects. Add to this the incomplete mastery of categories, and disagreement is almost guaranteed. Pursuing understanding as Weber recommended it, i.e. disregarding the dogmatic element in the empirical meaning, we cannot possibly ascertain, even hypothetically, the empirical fact of rational disagreement.</p>
<p>To understand action whose meaning is being disputed, I have argued, we need to be able to understand it the way the critic does, i.e. in terms of the categories invoked in the dispute, making room for the meaning failure, i.e. a learning subject whose own understanding is fallible. Understanding which invariably recovers meaningful action, regardless of the implicit claim to validity which may turn out to be problematic, is deficient since it cannot identify the lack of understanding, neither on the subject’s part nor on the critic’s. We can neither confirm nor refute the critic’s claim regarding wrong attribution of meaning (contributing, possibly, to their learning), since there is no room for it in our concept of meaningful action.</p>
