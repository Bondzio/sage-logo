<abstract>
<p>In the provision of care to older clients, home support workers regularly confront, avert, and manage crises. Semistructured interviews were conducted to explore the nature, type, and management of crises from the perspective of home support workers (<italic>N</italic> = 118) of older persons in British Columbia, Canada. The delivery of home health care occurs within a context of unpredictability related to scheduling, time constraints, variability of client need, and changing work environments. These events are experienced by 91% of home support workers and range from a serious medical incident (e.g., fall, death) to an interpersonal dilemma (e.g., client refusal of service, argument between worker and family member). Home support workers use a variety of strategies to manage these incidents. The analysis of crises enables us to better understand how agency and care policies may be more responsive to circumstances that challenge care work in home health settings.</p>

<p>Home health care is an essential pillar of health care systems in many industrialized countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0733464811402198">Broese van Groenou, Glaser, Tomassini, &amp; Jacobs, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0733464811402198">Cangiano, Shutes, Spencer, &amp; Leeson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0733464811402198">Carrière, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0733464811402198">McClimont, Grove, &amp; Berry, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0733464811402198">National Association for Home Care and Hospice, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0733464811402198">Stone &amp; Dawson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0733464811402198">Tarricone &amp; Tsouros, 2008</xref>). Overall population aging, combined with a strong desire to “age in place,” creates an increased likelihood of need for home care services, both public and private (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0733464811402198">Australian Government Ministry of Health and Ageing, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0733464811402198">Cangiano et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0733464811402198">Carrière, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0733464811402198">National Association for Home Care and Hospice, 2008</xref>), including acute, chronic, and terminal care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0733464811402198">McAuley, Spector, &amp; van Nostrand, 2009</xref>). Home care work involves a wide variety of paid workers with different levels of training and qualifications. Most home care workers provide direct care or home support, which includes nonprofessional services in the form of personal assistance with daily activities, such as bathing, dressing, grooming, and light household tasks. These home support workers (HSWs) not only provide personal care but also invariably provide emotional or social care in the context of their work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0733464811402198">Black &amp; Rubinstein, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0733464811402198">Sims-Gould &amp; Martin-Matthews, 2010a</xref>). HSWs are often referred to as the “eyes and ears” of the home health system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0733464811402198">Cohen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0733464811402198">Stone &amp; Dawson, 2008</xref>) and provide frontline in-home services to older clients with complex and often changing health needs. These workers are variously referred to as home support workers, community health workers, home care workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0733464811402198">Department of Health, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0733464811402198">Mahmood &amp; Martin-Matthews, 2008</xref>), domiciliary workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0733464811402198">Doyle &amp; Timonen, 2007</xref>; Henwood, Lewis, Waddington, &amp; Nuffield Institute for Health, 1998), and direct care workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0733464811402198">Stone &amp; Dawson, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Poor pay, inconsistent hours, limited opportunities for advancement, and a lack of benefits are critical to understanding the challenges reported by workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0733464811402198">Denton, Zeytinoglu, Davies, &amp; Hunter, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0733464811402198">Fleming &amp; Taylor, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0733464811402198">Martin-Matthews &amp; Sims-Gould, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0733464811402198">Sharman, McLaren, Cohen, &amp; Ostry, 2008</xref>). Researchers have referred to working conditions that include “managing crises” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0733464811402198">Lilly, 2008</xref>), characterized by little guidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0733464811402198">Aronson &amp; Neysmith, 1996</xref>) and abusive situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0733464811402198">Neysmith &amp; Aronson, 1997</xref>). However, there is limited understanding about what constitutes a crisis for HSWs who deliver care in the private homes of older adults, often with limited supervision and support.</p>
<p>Drawing on research on the dynamics of family caregiving, we know that care fluctuates in response to changing circumstances such as health, personal networks, and availability of services. Family caregivers observe that there are events or crises that occur within the context of caregiving that require extra time, energy, and resources in addition to their “regular” caregiving responsibilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0733464811402198">Adams, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0733464811402198">Sims-Gould, Martin-Matthews, &amp; Gignac, 2008</xref>). Episodic crises in caregiving are considered significant events that precipitate decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0733464811402198">Taylor, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0733464811402198">Taylor &amp; Donnelly, 2006</xref>), events that precede help seeking from professionals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0733464811402198">Adams, 2006</xref>), or simply, as changing conditions of caregiving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0733464811402198">Usita, Hall, &amp; Davis, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>In our previous work on crises and family caregivers we found that crisis episodes could be classified on two dimensions, enduring (chronic) or temporally bounded (acute) and predictable versus unpredictable (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0733464811402198">Table 1</xref>). For example, with respect to health-related crises, knee surgery is classified as temporally bounded and predictable, where a depression diagnosis is enduring and unpredictable. Similarly, in non–health-related crises, selling a family home could be classified as temporally bounded and predictable, where a divorce is enduring and unpredictable. This classification provided a template for improvements in understanding family caregiving and the experience of episodic crises.</p>

<p>Although there has been little if any work done specifically using the language of crisis episodes in home care services, there has been recent attention to adverse events (AEs) in home care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0733464811402198">Johnson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0733464811402198">Lang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0733464811402198">Madigan &amp; Tullai-McGuinness, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0733464811402198">Masotti, Green, &amp; McColl, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0733464811402198">Masotti, Green, Shortt, Hunter, &amp; Szala-Meneok, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0733464811402198">Masotti, McColl, &amp; Green, 2010</xref>). Adverse events are defined differently depending on the health care setting. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0733464811402198">Masotti and colleagues (2007)</xref> define adverse events in home care settings as “events or occurrences which become apparent during the delivery of home care services and which have a negative or potentially negative impact on: patient care, patient outcomes, family or support care, and resources utilization” (p. 63). The limited literature on AE in home care largely focuses on specific adverse drug events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0733464811402198">Ahrens, Feldman, &amp; Frey, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0733464811402198">Forster, Murff, Peterson, Gandhi, &amp; Bates, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0733464811402198">Gray, Mahoney, &amp; Blough, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0733464811402198">Madigan, Schott, &amp; Matthews, 2001</xref>), events that require rehospitalization such as falls and wound infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0733464811402198">Johnson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0733464811402198">Madigan et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0733464811402198">Madigan &amp; Tullai-McGuinness, 2004</xref>) and operational failures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0733464811402198">Bruno &amp; Ahrens, 2005</xref>). In a recent scoping review <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0733464811402198">Masotti et al. (2010)</xref> asserted that though understanding adverse events in home care is an extremely important health policy issue, very little is known about what constitutes an AE or how AEs are managed. Most of this work focuses on the culpability of health care management or health care systems, with little focus on the subjective experience of workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0733464811402198">Baker et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0733464811402198">Johnson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0733464811402198">Madigan &amp; Tullai-McGuinness, 2004</xref>). This article extends existing research by focusing on workers’ experiences of these occurrences and builds on our work about crises in the area of family caregiving.</p>
<p>With a focus on the delivery and receipt of home support services, the primary objective of this analysis was to study the nature of crises experienced by HSWs. Recognizing the importance of understanding not only the nature of crises but also what workers do in response to them, our second objective was to examine how HSWs respond to and manage crises in their work.</p>

<title>Design and Study Sample</title>
<p>This article is based on a larger study aimed at understanding the key issues in the delivery and receipt of home support services from the perspective of HSWs, older clients, and family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0733464811402198">Byrne, Frazee, Sims-Gould, &amp; Martin-Matthews, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0733464811402198">Martin-Matthews &amp; Sims-Gould, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0733464811402198">Sims-Gould &amp; Martin-Matthews, 2010a</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0733464811402198">b</xref>).

<title>Recruitment and Participants</title>
<p>Upon receipt of approval from the University of British Columbia Behavioural Research Ethics Board, data were collected from March 2007 to October 2007 in the Lower Mainland of British Columbia. Selection of participants was limited to HSWs able to complete an interview in English, employed by home care agencies, who provided primarily “nonprofessional” services (e.g., nonmedical services) to clients older than 65 years of age. Two methods of recruitment were used. First, three home care agencies were purposively selected to represent the spectrum of contracted agencies (two private and one not for profit) serving a mixture of both urban and rural clients. However, this method resulted in very low response rates, 3% to 11% depending on the agency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0733464811402198">Sims-Gould &amp; Martin-Matthews, 2010a</xref>). As a result of our low agency response rates, a second recruitment strategy was used. Participants were randomly selected from a list of workers represented by the British Columbia Government Employees Union (BCGEU local 403). Workers were contacted by the union, provided with a brief description of the study, and asked for their consent to be contacted by our team. The response rate through the union recruitment proved to be better at 52%, consistent with other studies involving home support workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0733464811402198">Sims-Gould &amp; Martin-Matthews, 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0733464811402198">Stone &amp; Dawson, 2008</xref>).

<title>Interviews</title>
<p>Interviews were scheduled with interested home support workers at a time and location convenient for them. Face-to-face, in-depth, semistructured interviews were conducted with HSWs by trained research assistants. The interviews, approximately 60 to 90 min in length, were audiorecorded and transcribed verbatim by a transcription agency. Participants were asked about their perceptions of home support work with older adult clients, using the following questions: “In your work with clients, have you ever had to deal with a sudden or unpredictable event or crisis? If yes, please describe” and “What did you do?” Interview transcripts were organized and analyzed using the qualitative analysis software program NVivo 8.</p>

<p>Guided by the analysis techniques outlined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0733464811402198">Richards and Morse (2007)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0733464811402198">Richards (2009)</xref>, topic and analytical coding, team analysis meetings, and memo writing facilitated the development of categories of crises and strategies engaged in by workers. Our analysis team consisted of postdoctoral fellows, undergraduate students, and the principal investigator of this study. Qualitative analysis training was provided by the postdoctoral fellows. CB conducted the majority of the coding, working in concert with JSG, KB, and AMM through the sharing of analytical memos and through analysis meetings. Weekly meetings were held to discuss coding definitions and to work through discrepancies in codes identified by various team members. Based on our initial topic coding, we focused the categorizations on understanding the type, direction, temporality, predictability, and preventability of the crises reported. Categories of management strategies were also identified. After each category was defined and we had worked through multiple examples of crises reported in the transcripts, all of the transcripts were coded by two research assistants (CB and JN) using the categorizations developed by the team.</p>

<title>Findings</title>
<sec id="section9-0733464811402198">
<title>Type, Direction, Temporality, Predictability, and Preventability of Crises</title>
<p>Of the 118 HSWs interviewed, 91% experienced a crisis in providing care. Workers described 145 instances of crises, including events that happened “to” them and events that happened “to” clients. The nature of crises in home support is best understood through a consideration of type (i.e., bodily, environmental, relational, organizational), direction (crisis happened “to” worker and/or to client), and temporality (i.e., sudden or enduring in duration). The nature of crises is influenced by two key contextual elements, that is, predictability and preventability of the crisis.</p>
<sec id="section10-0733464811402198">
<title>Type of crises</title>
<p>The types of crises identified included physical, environmental, relational, and organizational. The most commonly identified type of crises were bodily incidents (e.g., falls, asthma attack, drug reaction, heart attack ), typically involving a worsening of the biomedical health status of the client or the worker. Two HSWs described bodily crises encountered at work:
<disp-quote>
<p>I had one man who . . . didn’t take the medication. He was just a single man and he was living in this little house. And he didn’t answer his door, and I know he never goes anywhere. So, there was this table in the middle of the lawn, I drag it over to his bedroom window, I could see his tummy just going up and down. . . . He wasn’t taking his medication, so his—and his eyes are wide open. I guess he kind of goes into a, I don’t know, coma thing, or whatever. (Mia, 22 years as a HSW)</p>
<p>Usually it’s a fall, you know, you go in there and the client can’t get to the door. If the door’s open, they’ve fallen. (Heidi, 17 years as a HSW)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Crises classified as environmental involved situations where some form of external circumstance created an unsafe or unhealthy living or working space. Workers’ described crises involving hazardous situations such as cluttered spaces, inadequate equipment, pest infestations, and dangerous pets. Safety issues that were associated with identification of a crisis included weather, social factors, ergonomics, coresidents, animals, and inadequate equipment or furniture. Environmental crises typically involved unsafe or unhealthy places to provide work and provide care.</p>
<p>Although the majority of crises episodes reported were bodily, many were of a relational nature and consisted of a wide range of events in the lives of both the worker and the older client. Relational crises were characterized as interactions between the HSW, client, and/or client’s family and, in most instances, affected the HSWs feelings, awareness, and motivation in the course of their work. For instance, workers spoke about abusive situations as crises:
<disp-quote>
<p>The daughter [of a home support client] kept screaming, “You’re an inexperienced caregiver.” She just was screaming at me. “God, you’re inexperienced. You’re not listening to me.” I never said a word. (Charlotte, 1.5 years as a HSW)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Physical and verbal abuse often involved frustrated or cognitively impaired clients lashing out, hitting, or verbalizing their discomfort to workers. One worker observed:
<disp-quote>
<p>I had one Alzheimer’s and she was fine and then all of a sudden she did this sort of stare and then she got up and she screamed to beat the band. And then the next thing she picks up the table and she throws it at you. (Pearl, 20 years as a HSW)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The conflicts described by participants in our study occurred between workers and clients and/or family members, workers and their agency personnel, clients and the home care agency, and among family members. For instance, one HSW described how she ended up “in the middle” of a conflict between a brother (home care client) and sister who lived together and the distress this caused for her while trying to provide care for a client.</p>
<p>Organizational crises were related to home support agency rules, policies, and operations. Crises related to disagreements about the care plan, the organizational tool that directs services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0733464811402198">Sims-Gould &amp; Martin-Matthews, 2010a</xref>) were frequently discussed by workers. For instance:
<disp-quote>
<p>In the house . . . they ask to do something else instead of, you know, the client. Like I had a palliative client and she is dying. And her daughter said that, “We do all her personal care. You don’t need to do it. Would you clean my kitchen and would you clean my fridge,” like that, you know. So with family members, it’s hard to you know, identify our job. (Tiffany, 7 years as a HSW)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In most cases, the events described by workers reflected a combination of types of crises. Although each “type” was clearly identified by participants, in many instances the situations described by workers were multifaceted in that they overlapped and intersected. For instance, relational types of crises that involved conflict were often discussed as stemming from organizational issues related to tasks not included on the care plan and varying expectations (by clients and by family members) as to the service HSWs were meant to provide. In the following quote, Rosie was constrained by the care plan, and the result was a negative interaction between the worker and client.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Sometimes the client gets irritated or angry, and, they just want you to do something that they want to be done, like, the way they want it to be done. But sometimes you can’t, and then you have to explain to them but they get very upset. And then they ask you to go out. (Rosie, 6 weeks as a HSW)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Katie discussed a client whom she helped to get into the bathtub, but who was then unable to get out, despite her assistance:
<disp-quote>
<p>I had to phone 9-1-1 and they had to come and they had to help her get up . . . She didn’t speak any English . . . she was just too afraid to try to get back up . . . It was an issue her not speaking because then if she had spoke English I could have told her, you know, “Are you sure? I don’t think—” you know, maybe explain, “Maybe this isn’t such a good idea,” but the person at the door, who I guess knew her, sort of just told me that’s what to do. I’m, like, “Okay.” I didn’t know this lady at all so they told me to help her with the bath. So I figured, “Okay, this is what people are doing,” and once she was in there, she just could not physically get herself back up.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This situation demonstrated the intersection of bodily, environmental, and relational factors in shaping crisis events in that the crisis itself involved the bodily task of bathing, which was complicated by the unavailability of a safe bathing environment and an inability to communicate because of a language barrier.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0733464811402198">
<title>Directionality of crises</title>
<p>An important aspect of crises is the distinction between those that happen “to” a worker versus crises that happen “to” an older client. The first example (below) highlights a bodily crisis that “happened to” a worker while the next example shows a bodily and medical crisis that “happened to” the older client.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I got her out, got her dressed, and then she started hitting me with her cane. (Julie, 18 years as a HSW)</p>
<p>Recently I came into the home to give a lady lunch, and she had had a heart attack just as I came in the door . . . and I knew it was a heart attack. (Melissa, 13 years as a HSW)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In their depictions of relational types of crises, workers described events that happened to both worker and client, highlighting the intersecting nature of crises in care work. Desiree explained how the death of a client was something that happened to the client but constituted a crisis for her.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I think she took a couple of teaspoons of food and then I—she had a tremor in her hand and I was vacuuming around her bed. And all of a sudden I looked over and I noticed her hand wasn’t shaking so I turned off the vacuum and she was slowly going . . . it was quite a shock to me.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0733464811402198">
<title>Temporality of crises</title>
<p>Most crises were described in terms of abrupt onset or immediate in their temporality, such that workers “walked in” to situations and/or they occurred suddenly while they were in a client’s home. However, in some instances crises were described to be ongoing or enduring, such that workers continually faced negative circumstances over time as they worked with a particular client and/or their family. This was particularly salient in descriptions of events that contained conflict and abuse, a finding that is consistent with findings in our earlier research on crises and family caregiving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0733464811402198">Sims-Gould et al., 2008</xref>). For example, Greta described an abusive crisis situation wherein a client lives with her family who often fight and argue. This was an ongoing concern for Greta, who was frightened for the safety of her client because of erratic behavior from his grandson:
<disp-quote>
<p>If you go there sometimes, the family they arguing, they’re fighting . . . sometime you go there, they’re fighting. . . . All my client, they nice . . . but the family are not . . . because the—the grandson is there live with the grandpa. And my client was there.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The type, directionality, and temporality of crises encountered by workers in their day-to-day work provided a sense of the added complexity that these events contribute to the care provided.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0733464811402198">
<title>Predictability and preventability</title>
<p>Not only did workers respond to crises that were unpredictable, their regular or “normal” working conditions were characterized by irregularity, uncertainty, and unpredictability. Thus, HSWs provided care within a context shaped by unpredictability related to scheduling and a range of client conditions, personalities, and situations encountered on a daily basis. For instance, unpredictability of the workplace is heightened due to several aspects of scheduling common to home support, such as “windows of availability” (with workers being “on call”), split shifts, casual work, last-minute cancellations, and workers not showing up for their shifts. These aspects of the job meant that there was frequent, if not daily, uncertainty inherent in workers’ schedules. Although this type of unpredictability did not constitute a crisis for workers per se, it did create stress in the work environment and shaped experiences of crises.</p>
<p>The realities of working in a client’s home environment, as compared to a standard workplace, also created unpredictability for workers.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I mean you deal with this and you always expect the unexpected and you are never disappointed. I had one little old gentleman they sent me to, it was a one time only replacement and I was there for bath assist and so I knock on his door. He opens it up and he’s naked except for a shower cap and he says, “I’m ready for my shower.” (Laura, 16 years as a HSW)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In addition to the uncertainty of the schedule, and the impact of consistently having new clients, workers discussed unpredictability related to the nature of the clientele, in terms of differing medical, bodily, and psychological conditions and circumstances. This was particularly the case for persons with dementia or who were palliative because extra time was needed to provide care in a meaningful way and circumstances changed quickly and required flexibility or adaptability. Many workers noted the “guess work” required to understand a situation.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The other time I came to a client . . . she’d always had asthma. But she was obviously having problems. And she looked quite distressed. And she also was taking pain medication. So I thought maybe she’d taken too much of her pain medication . . . and she was—obviously had trouble breathing. (Kristen, 11 years as a HSW)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although the unpredictable nature of the labor of care served as a backdrop for the work, workers also discussed how crises were often inevitable for clients with precarious and declining health. For example, workers noted that they almost “expected” a fall and subsequent injury with those clients with extreme mobility issues. In one case, a client had a very vicious dog, and the worker “knew” that it was a matter of time before they were bitten (indeed they were). Our analysis of worker descriptions of crises included a consideration of the preventability of such crises (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0733464811402198">Table 3</xref>). Crises that were enduring and related to conflict were potentially preventable, that is, in situations where the worker was coping with clients and families who continually had expectations outside of the care plan, were categorized as preventable because the agency had the capacity to respond. There were varying levels of preventability inherent to the crises reported by workers and some crises could be partially or entirely preventable. Conversations about predictability were often related to workers’ assessment of preventability. They spoke about the inevitability of injury for some clients but also revealed the steps that could be taken to avoid injuries.</p>

<title>Management of Adverse Events</title>
<p>Workers engaged in the following strategies in response to the various types of crises encountered: (a) following agency protocol, (b) bending or breaking the rules, and (c) working to avert crises. In response to most crises, workers followed agency protocol either by phoning 911 (calling an ambulance, fire, or police) and/or placing a call to their agency. In some cases, this was done even when the client did not want a phone call placed.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>She said no, don’t phone the ambulance! But I said well you know I have to. I said if you were my mother I’d phone an ambulance right now. So I did. (Harriet, 15 years as a HSW, client who had trouble breathing)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although there was some indecision, workers did what “they were trained to do.”</p>
<p>Workers also spoke at length about breaking or bending agency protocol in response to crises. In other analyses of these data, we found that this “adapting” or bending rules is a method by which workers personalize care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0733464811402198">Sims-Gould &amp; Martin-Matthews, 2010a</xref>). Although workers are aware of procedures, they indicated that the procedure is often not the appropriate or intuitive response to a situation. Workers rationalized the bending of rules by indicating that it was what their clients wanted and/or it was the more appropriate action.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Yes, technically what I should have done was . . . called my supervisor and they should have called the fire brigade. But some of us don’t work like that . . . so I just phoned the fire brigade and then I called my supervisor and said, “I had to call the fire brigade.” (Holly, 18 years as a HSW, client who slipped in the bath)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Workers also described their role in preventing these types of incidents. Preventing or averting a crisis meant taking action to make sure that it does not happen in the first place. Sometimes this meant going against agency policies, as when workers identified potential safety risks and addressed them (such as changing a light bulb, which is against agency rules but ensures a safer environment for clients).</p>
<p>Averting crises, however, was not always about going against agency policies—many workers considered it just what they “do.” They spent a lot of time with clients and, therefore, could take action to avoid safety or health/medical problems. Melinda described how she used her intimate knowledge to identify a change in behavior and ultimately averted a potential crisis.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I phoned the supervisor and I told her, about him [the client’s husband]. He kind of seemed extra tired, and extra—like he would fall asleep. He was sleeping most of the time. (Melinda, 6 months as a HSW, notices changes in the spousal caregiver)</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study examined the nature and management of crises from the perspective of HSWs providing care to older clients. Findings indicated that crises were (a) relatively common and occurred within the context of an already unpredictable work environment, (b) most often bodily or physical incidents, and (c) often multifaceted.</p>
<p>Crises happened to workers, to clients, and, in some cases, were interactional. Unlike definitions of AE that focus mostly on incidents or events precipitated or “done” by the worker and experienced by the client, our findings show that crises can be experienced by both worker and client at the same time or in succession.</p>
<p>Like our previous work on crises in family caregiving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0733464811402198">Sims-Gould et al., 2008</xref>), crises in the delivery of home care also ranged in their temporality. In home care some crises were immediate with a clear start and end point (temporally bounded) and others were longer in duration (enduring or chronic). Examining the temporality of crises underscores the complexity of delivering care in the community. Workers may see a client only once but may also work with a client for years. This variation in exposure and familiarity likely translates into how a worker defines and experiences crises. In our previous work with family caregivers, we noted that over time family members developed experience and tolerance; what was once a crisis, if experienced again, was often no longer a crisis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0733464811402198">Sims-Gould et al., 2008</xref>). This may also translate into the home care environment. Workers likely develop skill, especially when working with the same client over an extended period of time, which changes their definition of what constitutes a crisis and in their ability to respond. There is indeed an argument to be made for worker consistency over time.</p>
<p>Crises required workers to think and act quickly and often require the mobilization of additional resources (e.g. family members, agency, emergency medical services). Crises involved extra time, problem-solving skills, and/or energy to manage them. Management of crises requires an understanding of complex risk issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0733464811402198">Taylor, 2006</xref>). This means attending to the immediate needs of clients while also balancing their autonomy and personal wishes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0733464811402198">Adams, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Workers discussed the strategies that they use to address crisis episodes. Most often workers followed agency policy and procedure by either calling the agency or emergency medical services. In some instances they broke or bent the rules by not following agency protocol. This typically happened when the outlined response was perceived by the worker to be inconsistent with the immediate needs of the client. Further research will be needed to explore the implications for workers of “breaking the rules.” For instance, does this create stress for the worker who potentially puts her job at risk by making a decision in contradiction with the prescribed response?</p>
<p>Workers highlighted their role in averting or avoiding crises through preventative strategies. Within community nursing practice, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0733464811402198">Adams (2001)</xref> notes that the identification of risk happens within their monitoring activities. Research has shown the preventative benefits of home care in terms of the cost saving aspects associated with reduced hospitalizations, pressure on professional health care provider time, and demand for space in long-term care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0733464811402198">Hollander, Chappell, Prince, &amp; Shapiro, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0733464811402198">Hollander et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0733464811402198">Landi et al., 1999</xref>). The preventative aspects of home care are far beyond cost saving. Workers who “know” their clients discussed at length being able to “catch” crises before they happen. This proactivity is not measured in the AE literature but offers another side to the care equation. A more comprehensive approach to understanding the incidence of crises or AE in home care will help administrators balance potential risks. For example, if a client is known to be at greater risk of falling, efforts to reduce the likelihood of a crisis (or AE) would involve managing such risk by having a consistent set of workers caring for the client. This would enable workers to build rapport and knowledge of the clients’ situation and monitor any subtle changes in condition that further the risk.</p>
<p>There are a number of implications for practice and policy based on this research. Home support workers are key agents in identifying and responding to crises in community based health care. They are indeed the “eyes and ears” of the system and have a clear understanding of what poses a safety issue for clients and for themselves. Agencies must recognize that unpredictable events or crises occur in addition to the unpredictable work environment. This means that workers require the ability to exercise discretion and flexibility in their work. They need to know who to call and when to bring in extra support. Workers also need to be equipped with appropriate crisis training in particular in a climate of shorter visits and increasing client acuity and caseloads (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0733464811402198">Child, Clay, Warrington, &amp; Das, 2008</xref>, as one example of a guideline and training guide for responding to crises in home health care). Although bodily crises were the most common type identified by workers in our study, our findings suggest that future training programs should also include modules on how to identify, report, and manage the environmental, relational, organizational, and multifaceted crises that they encounter. Finally, training efforts will be in vain without the implementation of appropriate agency policies. Agency policies require mechanisms in place to address each type of crisis to ensure worker and client safety, security and well-being, and, ultimately, quality in home health care.</p>

<title>Limitations and Future Research</title>
<p>There is one main limitation to this research. In our pilot work, we found that the word “crisis” was not always clear to participants in our study; thus, we added the phrase, “unpredictable events,” to the question. In doing so, we cannot be entirely certain whether respondents were referring to a “crisis” or an “unpredictable event.” For instance, some of the responses may simply reflect an unpredictable event but not one that would be characterized as a “crisis” as such from the worker’s perspective. However, in depicting crises, workers described events or situations that were outside of their “normal” work. Future studies may want to determine whether, from the worker perspective, there is a difference between unpredictable events and crises in home support. It would be useful to first ask about unpredictable events, the “beyond what is normal,” and then probe to determine whether or not it actually was experienced as “crisis” by the worker. It would also be helpful to further investigate workers’ roles in crisis prevention. Future work that focuses on clients receiving home support would further advance our understanding of what constitutes a crisis. In particular it would be important to determine whether the situations that constitute a crisis for workers are also crises for clients and their family members and vice versa. It would also be helpful to understand how clients and families perceive and react to the strategies that workers use to manage adverse events. For example, when workers “bend the rules,” do clients and their families recognize this? Exploring these questions would help inform a broader understanding of the types and timing of emergent services required in home-based health care.</p>
