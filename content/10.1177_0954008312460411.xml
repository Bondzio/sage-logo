<abstract>
<p>The 3-aminophenoxyphthalonitrile (3-APN) was used as a comonomer and coreactive curing agent to modify the 2,2-bis[4-(3,4)-dicyanophenoxyphenyl] (BAPh) resin by blending technology. First, the 3-APN/BAPh matrices were characterized using differential scanning calorimetry, dynamic rheological analysis and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The curing and rheological behaviors of the blends and prepolymers of 3-APN/BAPh matrix were studied. The results revealed that the blends and prepolymers exhibited the polymerization reaction controlled by the 3-APN content and had large processing window with low melt viscosity. The TGA data revealed that the 3-APN/BAPh matrix copolymers showed excellent thermal and thermal-oxidative stabilities. Moreover, the continuous glass fiber (GF)-reinforced 3-APN/BAPh (GF/3-APN/BAPh) composite laminates were manufactured and the mechanical and thermal properties were studied. The GF/3-APN/BAPh composite laminates exhibited flexural strength (500–766 MPa) and flexural modulus (21–27 GPa) by maintaining high thermal performances. In addition, scanning electron microscopy was utilized to investigate the fracture surfaces of the GF/3-APN/BAPh composite laminates, which had the effective interfacial interaction between the GFs and the matrix. Herein, the 3-APN/BAPh matrix can be a good candidate matrix for high-performance polymeric materials and the advanced laminate can be used in a high-temperature environment.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Phthalonitriles, as a type of thermosetting resin, have received increasing attention both from academia and industry. During the 1970s,<sup>

</sup> at the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL), Keller’s groups have made considerable research on these high-temperature resistant phthalonitrile resins due to their higher moisture resistance, outstanding thermal stability, better flame resistance and superior mechanical properties.<sup>

</sup> These performance characteristics make phthalonitriles good matrix candidates for advanced polymeric composites in marine, aerospace and electronic fields.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954008312460411">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954008312460411">16</xref>
</sup> Although the phthalonitriles as the thermally stable laminating resins offer many significant advantages compared with the conventional thermosetting resins, there are some processing difficulties restraining the development of high-temperature phthalonitrile polymers.</p>
<p>It should be pointed out that the high cure temperature and narrow processing windows had made restriction effect on their processability.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954008312460411">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954008312460411">18</xref>
</sup> For instance, the neat curing of these phthalonitrile-based monomers was carried out very slowly even at the comparatively high temperatures and their curing processes even needed several days to obtain the full-cured phthalonitrile polymers.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0954008312460411">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0954008312460411">20</xref>
</sup> Therefore, tremendous interests have been focused on the utility of various curing additives that initiated the curing process and shortened the curing time of phthalonitrile resins. It was found that a small amount of phenols, organic amines and organic acids could promote the curing reaction of the phthalonitriles.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954008312460411">5</xref>
</sup> Following this, few studies described a series of aromatic amine curing additives such as bis[4-(3-aminophenoxy)phenyl]sulfone (<italic>m</italic>-BAPS), bis[4-(4-aminophenoxy)phenyl]-sulfone (<italic>p</italic>-BAPS), 1,3-bis(3-amino phenoxy)benzene (<italic>m</italic>-APB) and 1,4-bis(4-aminophenoxy)benzene (<italic>p</italic>-APB).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954008312460411">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954008312460411">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0954008312460411">21</xref>
</sup> The sulfone-containing diamines (<italic>p</italic>-BAPS and<italic> m</italic>-BAPS) exhibit lower volatility and slower reactivity compared with the <italic>m</italic>-APB curing agent. However, the addition of these diamines with comparatively low volatility at high temperatures also has an influence on the thermal properties of the phthalonitrile–amine composites. More importantly, the addition volume or quality of aromatic amine curing additives was limited to optimize the performance of the phthalonitriles. Therefore, selecting the proper curing agent is the subject of extensive investigations.</p>
<p>In this article, the phthalonitrile-containing amine (3-aminophenoxyphthalonitrile (3-APN)) was used as a novel curing agent in the polymerization process of the classical phthalonitrile resin, 2,2-bis[4-(3,4)-dicyanophenoxyphenyl] (BAPh). Moreover, the formation of the 3-APN/BAPh blends, prepolymers and copolymers is a simple route to modify the polymer properties because the 3-APN also was used as comonomer with reactive cyano groups exhibiting self-catalyzed curing behaviors. Moreover, the 3-APN is comparatively highly reactive without volatilizing at high curing reaction temperature, which can have a great tendency to enhance the processability and maintain thermal properties of the 3-APN/BAPh system. The primary objective of our work is focused on the fabrication of glass fiber (GF)-reinforced 3-APN/BAPh (GF/3-APN/BAPh) composite laminates when the 3-APN/BAPh system was used as the advanced matrix. The processing parameters of the 3-APN/BAPh matrix were investigated including prepolymer/prepreg production characterization, curing behaviors and rheological behaviors. Finally, the mechanical and thermal properties and fracture morphology of the composite laminates were also evaluated together.</p>

<title>Preparation of 3-APN/BAPh matrix blends, prepolymers and copolymers</title>
<p>The 3-APN monomer was mixed with the BAPh monomer. The mixture was directly stirred to achieve a homogenous blend at room temperature and the 3-APN/BAPh matrix blends were obtained. The 3-APN/BAPh matrix blends were formulated with 100/0, 90/10, 70/30, 50/50, 30/70, 10/90 and 0/100 weight ratios of the 3-APN and BAPh, respectively. Then, the 3-APN/BAPh matrix blends were incubated in the air-circulation oven at 150°C for 1 h. Meanwhile, the 50/50 3-APN/BAPh matrix blend was also thermally treated at 150°C for 1, 2 and 4 h, respectively.</p>
<p>The preparation of 3-APN/BAPh matrix prepolymers was as follows: the BAPh monomer was taken and heated in a three-neck round bottle flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer at a stirring speed of 300 r/min to obtain a dark melt. Then, the 3-APN monomer was added into the melt. After stirring vigorously for about 30 min at about 200°C, the obtained blackish green homogeneous melt was cooled. The 3-APN/BAPh matrix prepolymers were obtained for the prepreg production. Moreover, the 3-APN/BAPh matrix prepolymers were pulverized for viscosity studies to examine the processing parameters.</p>
<p>In addition, the above-mentioned 3-APN/BAPh matrix prepolymers were heated for another 5–10 min until a dark green melt was appeared, which were poured into a preheated polytetrafluoroethylene mold and the cavity dimensions 65 × 15 × 5 mm<sup>3</sup>. Then, the gelled samples were thermally cured in an air-circulation oven; the detailed curing procedures were 200°C for 2 h; 220°C for 2 h; 250°C for 4 h and 280°C for 4 h. The 3-APN/BAPh matrix copolymers were obtained and pulverized for thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) studies.</p>

<title>Fabrication of GF/3-APN/BAPh composite laminates</title>
<p>The GF/3-APN/BAPh composite laminates were prepared as follows: the above-mentioned 100/0, 70/30, 50/50 and 30/70 3-APN/BAPh matrix prepolymers were dissolved in DMF. The reaction mixture was stirred during heating at 160°C. After maintaining this temperature for 1 h, the resultant solution was cooled to room temperature and the impregnating solution was obtained. Then, the glass fabrics (the size of the fabrics was 20 × 20 cm<sup>2</sup> and 20 layers of glass fabrics were needed) were impregnated with different solutions of 3-APN/BAPh matrix prepolymers. The obtained preimpregnated fabrics were vacuum-dried after the solvent had evaporated with a temperature of 180°C for 15 min, which were placed in the hot press machine to manufacture the composite laminates. The 20 plies of prepregs were cured between two steel plates, which were used to ensure a smooth surface of the final cured GF/3-APN/BAPh composite laminates. Then, the GF/3-APN/BAPh composite laminates were fabricated by a hand lay-up method, and the manufacturing process used was as follows at a pressure of 15 MPa: 200°C for 2 h; 220°C for 2 h; 250°C for 4 h and 280°C for 4 h. The schematic fabrication of GF/3-APN/BAPh composite laminates was shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954008312460411">Figure 1</xref>.

<title>Curing behaviors of 3-APN/BAPh matrix blends</title>
<p>To define the curing parameters of manufacturing processes, the curing behaviors of the 3-APN/BAPh matrix blends are studied by DSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954008312460411">Figure 2</xref>) and the data are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0954008312460411">Table 1</xref>. The neat 3-APN and BAPh monomers each exhibited a single characteristic melting transition. Then, the 3-APN/BAPh matrix blends had two endothermic transitions (<italic>T</italic>
<sub>melt1</sub> and <italic>T</italic>
<sub>melt2</sub>) except for the 50/50 3-APN/BAPh matrix blend. It can be seen that the matrix system is miscible in the amorphous phase. The melt temperature and the degree of miscibility were determined from one predominate type of the blend. Additionally, only the 50/50 3-APN/BAPh matrix blend exhibited one melting peak, which might be attributed to no phase separation. Meanwhile, each of the curves displayed an exothermic peak (<italic>T</italic>
<sub>top</sub>) except for the 0/100 3-APN/BAPh matrix blend. The maximum curing peaks of the 100/0, 90/10, 70/30, 50/50, 30/70 and 10/90 3-APN/BAPh matrix blends were 247.3, 244.6, 243.7, 240.4, 242.3 and 240.9°C, respectively. The enthalpy (Δ<italic>H</italic>
<sub>curing</sub>) of reaction increased with the increase in the 3-APN content (53.7, 131.1, 190.1, 212.9, 216.3 and 261.3 J/g, respectively). These results suggested that the curing reaction of the BAPh monomer can occur with the addition of 3-APN monomer and the reactivity of the cure reaction increased as the 3-APN content increased. It is associated with the fact that the 3-APN monomer exhibits the self-catalyzed curing behaviors with the use of the amino groups and nitrile groups. More importantly, the melting temperature and the rate of the polymerization reaction of the matrix blends 3-APN can be easily controlled by the 3-APN content. Therefore, the matrix blends have a desirable combination of unusual properties such as low melting temperature, low curing temperature and comparatively large processing windows by blending technology. Particularly, the 50/50 3-APN/BAPh matrix blend has only one melting peak and the larger processing window of 85°C, which are important for actual application as a potential matrix.</p>

<p>Following heat treatment, the cure behavior of the matrix blends is also a key factor in the prediction of processing temperature, which was performed by DSC analysis. The thermally curing behaviors of the 3-APN/BAPh matrix blends acquired after heating at 150°C for 1 h are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954008312460411">Figure 3</xref> and the main data are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0954008312460411">Table 2</xref>. The enthalpy of the heat-treated 100/0, 90/10, 70/30, 50/50, 30/70 and 10/90 3-APN/BAPh matrix blends were 137.9, 199.7, 207.3, 166.3, 96.7 and 65.6 J/g, respectively. Compared with the DSC data shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0954008312460411">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0954008312460411">2</xref>, the melting peak and enthalpy of the heat-treated blends demonstrated a similar characteristic with respect to temperature as that of the untreated blends. The existence of self-catalyzed 3-APN monomer, which promoted the reactivity of the blends during heat treatment, hindered the curing reaction of the 3-APN/BAPh matrix blends at comparatively higher temperature when the blends were reheated in the DSC. The observations indicate that a change in miscibility and some phase separation have occurred when the blends were left at 150°C for 1 h. Meanwhile, the higher curing temperatures reflected a change in the reactivity of the phthalonitrile blends. Herein, more experimental work is needed to verify this proposal.</p>

<p>The reaction of the 50/50 3-APN/BAPh matrix blend prepared at 150°C for 1, 2 and 4 h was studied by DSC analysis. The DSC curves are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954008312460411">Figure 4</xref> and the data are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0954008312460411">Table 3</xref>. The heat-treated samples (at 150°C for 1 and 2 h) exhibited one endothermic transition centered at 155.7 and 155.1°C, which are attributed to the melting of the 3-APN/BAPh matrix blend. After heating at 150°C for 4 h, the sample exhibited the melting peak (at 191.5°C), which indicated that the peak melting temperature was dependent on the heat-treatment time. In addition, the exothermic transitions of the heat-treated samples (at 150°C for 1 and 2 h) peaked in the range of 228–236°C, which are attributed to the reaction of BAPh monomer with the 3-APN coreactive curing additive. The enthalpy of cure for the samples (at 150°C for 1 and 2 h) was 166.3 and 143.0 J/g, respectively. Thus, the sample heated at 150°C for 4 h had no significant curing peak, which revealed that a rapid curing reaction had occurred between 3-ANP and BAPh during the heat treatment. The curing peak shifted to lower temperature and the enthalpy of reaction decreased as the heat-treatment time increased, which indicated that the reactivity of the 3-APN/BAPh matrix blend could be controlled with different heat treatments. The results showed the thermally curing property evolution when the polymerization reaction of the blends was progressed, which was important to define the curing parameters of the curing processes.</p>

<title>Rheological behaviors of 3-APN/BAPh matrix prepolymers</title>

</sup> The complex viscosity of 3-APN/BAPh matrix prepolymers was determined as a function of temperature from 150 to 275°C. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954008312460411">Figure 5</xref>, the initial melt viscosities are low, ranging between 0.01 and 1 Pa s, and the initial responses of the matrix prepolymers are similar to that of the Newtonian fluid in terms of the Newtonian behavior. As the temperature increases, the complex viscosity of the 100/0, 90/10, 70/30, 50/50, 30/70 and 10/90 3-APN/BAPh matrix prepolymers displayed a rapid increase on melting at 250, 215, 211, 218, 220 and 222°C, respectively, which were consistent with the DSC results. As the complex viscosity increased, the corresponding curing reaction of the 3-APN/BAPh was progressing. This behavior, indicative of the gelation of the matrix prepolymer from a Newtonian fluid to a rubbery state, revealed that polymerization of the matrix prepolymers was progressing. Then, the data showed that the rate of the polymerization reaction is related to the blend composition.</p>

<p>It is well known that a desirable prepolymer for thermosetting resins was important to the fabrication for the prepreg. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954008312460411">Figure 6</xref> shows complex viscosity change versus time for the 50/50 3-APN/BAPh matrix prepolymer at several different temperatures. The 50/50 3-APN/BAPh matrix prepolymer investigated at 160, 180 and 200°C exhibited an abrupt increase in viscosity at 118, 39 and 11 min, respectively. At higher temperature, the viscosity increased at a faster rate. Based on these data, high temperature has a great tendency to accelerate polymerization reaction of the matrix prepolymer. For comparison, isothermal viscosity measurements were recorded on the 3-APN/BAPh matrix prepolymers at 200°C as a function of time. As depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954008312460411">Figure 7</xref>, a complex melt viscosity of around 0.01–0.1 Pa·s was observed for all the matrix prepolymers at 200°C, initially. These low melt viscosities may prove useful for the processability and good wetting of fibers. Then, all the matrix prepolymers exhibited a dramatic increase in viscosity when heated at 200°C. Obviously, complex viscosity of the 100/0, 90/10, 70/30, 50/50, 30/70 and 10/90 3-APN/BAPh matrix prepolymers increased to 500 Pa·s in about 2, 44, 39, 37, 26 and 17 min, respectively. It is understood that the complex viscosity changes accompanying the gel time is in consistent with the start of cross-linking network formation. Therefore, these data revealed that the matrix prepolymer has the desirable processing temperature for producing prepregs. The above results showed that the curing temperature or the varying concentration of the 3-APN/BAPh matrix can control the polymerization of the matrix. Therefore, several important processing parameters including value of viscosity, gel time, processing temperature and the effects of the 3-APN content were evaluated to manufacture the GF/3-APN/BAPh composite laminates.</p>

<title>Thermal behaviors of 3-APN/BAPh matrix copolymers and GF/3-APN/BAPh composite laminates</title>
<p>Thermal properties are very important for the polymer matrix and polymeric composite material. To investigate the effect of the 3-APN content on the thermal properties of the 3-APN/BAPh matrix copolymers, the thermal and thermal-oxidative stabilities were evaluated by TGA in nitrogen and air atmosphere, respectively. TGA curves of the 3-APN/BAPh matrix copolymers are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954008312460411">Figures 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954008312460411">9</xref>.

<sub>5%</sub> of the matrix copolymers is somewhat higher in nitrogen atmosphere when compared with air atmosphere. Moreover, the chair yield in a nitrogen atmosphere was increased significantly compared with the retention of weight in air. These observations indicated that the 3-APN/BAPh matrix copolymers exhibited excellent thermal stability and comparatively low thermal-oxidative stability. It was associated with different degradation mechanisms corresponding to thermal stability and thermal-oxidative stability. Then, this has been driven by the fact that the cyano groups of the phthalonitrile react to form triazine, phthalocyanine and other heterocyclic ring structures.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0954008312460411">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0954008312460411">26</xref>
</sup> More importantly, it was reported that the formation of heterocyclic cross-linked structures promoted high thermal-oxidative stability.<sup>

</sup> Due to the fact that the surface effectively retards the heat transfer from the surface to the inside of the network, the char yield is higher than the retention of weight. Herein, it can be said with certainty that the matrix copolymers exhibit outstanding thermal and thermal-oxidative stability, which is attributed to the heterogeneity of the cross-linking formation and the high char yield (or retention of weight). It also was found that the 50/50 3-APN/BAPh matrix copolymers exhibited higher thermal and thermal-oxidative stabilities compared with other matrix copolymers and the neat 3-APN polymer. Therefore, the 50/50 3-APN/BAPh matrix copolymers achieved comparatively excellent thermal stabilities, which was consistent with the DSC results that the good compatibility of the matrix with suitable weight ration may be easier to form flame retardant networks.<sup>

Then, Fourier transformation infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was also used to offer some insight into the polymerization reaction of the 3-APN/BAPh matrix blends. The FTIR data revealed that the characteristic absorption peak of the nitrile band (2231 cm<sup>−1</sup>) decreased and the amino groups (3445 and 3364 cm<sup>−1</sup>) absorption almost disappeared. It was consistent with a typical feature of curing reaction of phthalonitrile polymers including the neat 3-APN polymer.<sup>

<p>In addition, in order to better understand thermal and thermal-oxidative properties of the 3-APN/BAPh matrix copolymers, the thermal and thermal-oxidative stabilities of the GF/3-APN/BAPh composite laminates were investigated by TGA analysis.

After the flexural tests, SEM micrographs were performed on fractured surface of the 50/50 GF/3-APN/BAPh composite laminate. At a lower magnification shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-0954008312460411">Figure 15</xref>(a) and (b), there are some GFs attached by the 3-APN/BAPh matrix to become a bunch of GF-like bars, indicating a good degree of adhesion. At higher magnification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-0954008312460411">Figure 15</xref>(c)), the surfaces of GF were covered by the matrix and the surface appears rougher compared with that of the untreated GF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-0954008312460411">Figure 15</xref>(d)). Moreover, a significant difference in fracture morphology can be observed, which demonstrated that a good adhesion was achieved by manufacturing process and the GF/3-APN/BAPh composite laminates had the effective interfacial interaction between  the GFs and the matrix.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>A series of 3-APN/BAPh matrix blends, prepolymers and copolymers were prepared and characterized by DSC, dynamic rheological analysis and TGA. The DSC and viscosity measurements showed that the 3-APN/BAPh matrix blends exhibited large processing windows accompanying lower melting peaks. More importantly, the 3-APN can be used as a commoner and coreactive curing additive in the polymerization reaction of the BAPh monomer. The curing, rheological and thermal behaviors of the 3-APN/BAPh matrix were easily controlled by the 3-APN content and the favorable ratio of the 3-APN/BAPh system was 50/50. Moreover, the continuous GF/3-APN/BAPh composite laminates were successfully prepared and showed high flexural strength (500–637 MPa) and flexural modulus (21–27 GPa). In addition, the cured 3-APN/BAPh copolymers and GF/3-APN/BAPh laminates exhibited excellent thermal and thermal-oxidative stabilities. Therefore, the 3-APN/BAPh matrix can be a good candidate matrix for high-performance polymeric materials and the advanced laminate can be used in a high temperature environment.</p>
