<p>The Global Health Promotion Department has been launched by <italic>HPP</italic> to promote practical linkages between global health education practice and research. The new Global Health Promotion Department will include global health promotion articles, case studies, symposia reports, commentaries, interviews with global health leaders, and other forms of interprofessional communication that highlight wide-ranging discussions designed to bridge research and practice. As one of the components of this new department on global health promotion, the coeditors will be interviewing various leaders in global health promotion. The following interview was conducted with Dr. Omar Khan, MD, MHS, FAAHP.</p>

<speech>
<speaker>HPP:</speaker>
<p>Dr. Khan, you coedited a book with Dr. Gregory Pappas on the tremendous growth of megacities (minimum of 10 million population) and its impact on global health. What led you and Dr. Pappas to develop the book <italic>Megacities and Global Health</italic> and how would you like to see the book being used by public health professionals?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Dr. Khan:</speaker>
<p>The book came about through our work with APHA. We increasingly saw that when elements of extreme urbanization overlap with health related issues, those issues become increasingly complex and require a significant amount of collaboration from all sectors of the society. Solutions require the active involvement of entities on a larger scale and a much higher level of integration. There is nothing “magic” about a megacity of over 10 million compared to larger cities with a population of under 10 million. Through various studies on megacities and authors who collaborated with us by writing book chapters or case studies on these cities around the globe, we found that integration and coordination is absolutely essential for the city to meet the health, economic, social, and other needs of such large populations, in using a “hub” coordinated model or a completely decentralized model with regional leadership and coordination throughout the city. An example in the United States is New York with its various boroughs and regional leadership structure, coordinated at the big-city level. Most newer megacities, especially those in the developing world, do not have such coordinated infrastructures as they often grew through unplanned migration from rural areas to large urban areas for employment, health, education, and social services, without thoughtful urban planning to provide the needed coordinated services to meet the population’s needs. Through the book, Dr. Pappas and I sought to explore key social determinants of urban health such as poverty, environmental degradation, primary care health services, emergency response, etc. We found very little published work on megacities and health, so we hope this book will generate much more study in this area.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>HPP:</speaker>
<p>Who should use this book and in what context do you hope it will be used?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Dr. Khan:</speaker>
<p>We hope that many people working in urban health and planning, global health, and general public health are finding this book thought provoking. We anticipate that this book will lead to further population health studies using the growing large urban environments to learn about the complexities of megacities and innovative solutions to address health problems in these environments. We expect that this will be a growing topic of study in public health schools as well as health promotion curricula as the role of disease prevention and health education expands in large urban areas around the world.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>HPP:</speaker>
<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) recently released a report of progress made after the first decade of the 15-year Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). What are your views of the progress that has been made over the past decade and where more resources are needed to address those goals?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Dr. Khan:</speaker>
<p>Although I have some concerns about the overall value of MDGs, I think they are useful for global prioritization. It is hard to envision the end of poverty, the end of hunger, universal education, child health, environmental sustainability, etc. These are, of course, wonderful ideas, but when we marry these ideas to time lines, resources, and metrics, it becomes difficult to see measurable progress as we get near the 2015 time line for the MDGs. One exception is the eradication goal of a disease such as polio with more focused efforts to reach those goals by a specific year.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>HPP:</speaker>
<p>You have been engaged in global health throughout your career. What do you think are the major challenges we face in improving health around the globe, particularly in the developing world? What would you say are three key global health challenges, and specifically, what is the role of global health promotion to address these challenges?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Dr. Khan:</speaker>
<p>If you had asked me this question 15 years ago, I probably would have listed the range of childhood vaccinable and diarrheal diseases that are and continue to be top public health priorities. However, with epidemiological evidence led by global health leaders like Sir Michael Marmot and the social determinants of health, we know of the major “root causes” of poor health, that is, in the realms of income, education, neighborhoods and environmental health, among other key determinants. If I had to pick the top three “causes of the causes,” they would be social justice, social justice, and social justice. As you know, this was APHA’s annual meeting theme last year, which would not likely have occurred 15 or 20 years ago. For many of my colleagues involved with health promotion, social justice is the “reason” why they are involved in prevention and health promotion. In a way, social justice could be considered the foundation of health promotion as compared to, say, the study of medicine. I would argue that those who have had a strong education in and work in health promotion are probably best prepared to address social justice issues in our society. Going beyond that, perhaps community organizers and those in the health promotion field who help organize communities are really the leaders who best address social justice for the benefit of public health.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>HPP:</speaker>
<p>Dr. Khan, you have spent much of your public health career involved in health professional development and training in preventive medicine and public health. What are some of the challenges we face in developing future preventive health and public health leaders in global health?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Dr. Khan:</speaker>
<p>I think there are two major challenges. One is philosophical and one is practical. A major asset we have is that preventive health and public health are the “right things to do” for our society as a whole. A challenge for us is that we often become more of “technicians”—and that often influences our mind-set. Instead, in my view, it should be our mind-set influencing our skill set. The common phrase is that if we are using a hammer (i.e., our skill set), everything tends to look like a nail. We need to think about and look at our entire “toolbox” for ideas and resources to address future global health problems. As it relates to professional education, traditional educational mind-sets are not going to solve our future, complex health problems. For example, when individuals pursue a career in medicine, most will currently not focus on population health. But when medical students and young professionals realize what is needed and what they could be doing, that is, prevention, they often realize that vaccinating children is one of the most important actions they can take to prevent and sustain health. We need to begin this mind-set change early on in grade school and high school. To use an analogy, health care providers such as physicians typically focus on medical care, but that is simply the sharp tip of a very long spear—the rest of it being public health. That’s the philosophical part of it. The practical part is relatively simple (not necessarily easy!). We need adequate funding to build our infrastructure and capacity to promote health through the use of interdisciplinary teams, including health educators. That will promote an appropriate emphasis on curative and preventive methodologies at the individual level and be guided by principles of population health. Internationally, we see this more in Europe and other countries than we have and currently see in the United States.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>HPP:</speaker>
<p>What are some policies and programs in the area of global health promotion that have proven to be successful? How have such programs been able to be sustained over time?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Dr. Khan:</speaker>
<p>We have enjoyed historic, global commitment to public health laws and policies. From the creation of the United Nations of which the WHO is a part, to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights—these are shared values agreed upon by essentially all nations. These have been implemented in a range of thematic areas by health promotion. UNICEF, for example, has utilized health promotion field-workers to advocate to families the value of getting their kids vaccinated against the major killers—diseases of childhood. Pakistan, which was already split into East and West after its independence from Great Britain in 1947, separated further in 1971, leading to creation of what is currently known as Bangladesh and Pakistan. At that point, the former country chose an aggressively pro-poor, pro–public health path. Bangladesh utilized health promotion and health education to greater effect than any South East Asian country and as a part of the larger strategy; this led to one of the most dramatic drops in fertility rate for a nation in modern history. Pakistan’s fertility rate, meanwhile, has risen since 1971, which probably reflects a generally low level of public health effort in the government and NGO sectors.</p>
</speech>
<p>Latin American countries have similarly used the concept of health educators and promotion specialists for a variety of maternal and child health issues. It is important to point out that health promotion is typically not a “one bug, one drug approach”—it really benefits the overall situation. If we get out there and educate mothers on breast-feeding and hygiene, all sorts of great side effects happen, such as improved health status in general.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>HPP:</speaker>
<p>Finally, Dr. Khan, what are some resources and tools that are available for health educators and health promotion specialists in global health, and what advice can you give to health educators who would like to work in the global health field?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Dr. Khan:</speaker>
<p>I would take a stepwise and thoughtful approach. Define what it is you want to know about. Look for connections and existing skills—what can you build on? What do you need to know to get where you want to be? In public health, which is composed perhaps equally of social and natural sciences, it is essential to be a student of history. Learn about the legacy of colonialism and of the impact this had on public health. Learn where the term <italic>missionary medicine</italic> came from and see if it really makes sense in a modern public health framework. Get ready to shed preconceived ideas once you start learning about all the work, the knowledge that our public health forebears have discussed. Always try to perfect the mousetrap, but don’t waste time reinventing the wheel.</p>
</speech>
<p>The second theme would be the Zen saying about the tree falling in the forest and whether it makes a sound. I’d argue that we are dropping trees all the time—that is, our innovative work—but it’s not making enough of a sound. Health promoters and the journal <italic>Health Promotion Practice</italic> need to provide the context for that sound so that future generations will hear it and learn about it.</p>
<p>Finally, I have come to realize a simple truth, which is that when work is enjoyable, it’s not work. So it is with learning: if it’s a story rather than a boring textbook, it’s going to be read, enjoyed, and acted upon. People who can do that often know the science in such depth that they have the ability to simplify it and explain it to the nonexpert. So along with doing great work, tell good stories and put them out there so that they can be passed on to future generations.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>HPP:</speaker>
<p>On behalf of <italic>HPP</italic> and the Global Health Department, thank you, Dr. Khan, for your time and your commitment to global health promotion.</p>
