<sec id="section1-0890334412449516">
<title>Background:</title>
<p>Promotion and protection of breastfeeding is a public health objective. In April 2009, health authorities in the Madrid region in central Spain signed a collaboration agreement with The United Nations Children’s Fund and created a breastfeeding committee.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0890334412449516">
<title>Objective:</title>
<p>To report the creation and implementation of a plan to promote and improve the quality of breastfeeding care in public hospitals in the region of Madrid, according to the Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) standards.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0890334412449516">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>The action plan included institutional commitment; creation of a breastfeeding committee in each hospital; outcome analyses, staff training, creation of educational materials; and dissemination of activities. The plan was adopted by the 19 non-BFHI-designated public maternity units in the Madrid region. Each hospital completed a modified version of the World Health Organization self-assessment questionnaire in 2009 (pre-intervention) and again in 2011.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0890334412449516">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Thirteen maternity units (68.4%) established a breastfeeding committee, and 32 months after implementation of the plan, the other 6 hospitals have created one. Nine training courses have been carried out to train professional experts on breastfeeding as trainers. The 271 trainers provided 18-hour breastfeeding courses for 1423 professionals. In 2009, there was only 1 BFHI-accredited hospital. Currently, 52.6% of the other 19 hospitals have some level of accreditation, and 2 are fully accredited.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0890334412449516">
<title>Conclusions:</title>
<p>An intervention to improve the quality of breastfeeding care based on an organized regional approach to the BFHI was useful for BFHI implementation.</p>

<title>Well Established</title>
<p>Implementing the Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) is complex, and in Spain, as in many other developed countries, there are few BFHI-designated hospitals. Support from health authorities can be important for centers to modify their practices.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0890334412449516">
<title>Newly Expressed</title>
<p>Few studies have described a strategy to promote breastfeeding on a regional level. This study analyzed a quality improvement intervention and determined that it was effective in a large municipal region in Madrid, Spain.</p>

<sec id="section8-0890334412449516">
<title>Background</title>
<p>Protection, promotion, and support of breastfeeding is a public health objective for the World Health Organization (WHO),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0890334412449516">1</xref></sup> and this is recognized in the United States<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0890334412449516">2</xref></sup> and Europe,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0890334412449516">3</xref></sup> including Spain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0890334412449516">4</xref></sup> Since the launch of the BFHI in 1991, numerous maternity units all over the world have been designated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0890334412449516">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0890334412449516"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0890334412449516">7</xref></sup> Application of BFHI practices in a hospital leads to a significant increase in the exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) rate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0890334412449516">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0890334412449516"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0890334412449516"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0890334412449516"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0890334412449516">12</xref></sup> In areas where promotion policies have been adopted according to BFHI recommendations, long-term breastfeeding rates have also improved—for example, in Sweden<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0890334412449516">7</xref></sup> and Belarus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0890334412449516">13</xref></sup> In a study with high-quality methodology, Kramer et al investigated the effect of implementation of the BFHI in Belarus, demonstrating not only an increase in breastfeeding rates but also a reduction in child morbidity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0890334412449516">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>A dose-response effect has been reported so that the higher the level of implementation of the BFHI, the better the results obtained. In a study of women who wanted to breastfeed for 2 months or more, 30% abandoned breastfeeding early in hospitals that did not comply with any of the Ten Steps, in comparison with 3% of women who discontinued breastfeeding early in hospitals that complied with at least 6 steps.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0890334412449516">14</xref></sup> At times, merely having a written breastfeeding policy increased the duration of breastfeeding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0890334412449516">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Currently, the European Commission in its Project on Promotion of Breastfeeding in Europe and the WHO/The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) in its Global Strategy for Infant and Young Child Feeding recognize the BFHI as the best practice model and recommend that health authorities promote its implementation and provide the necessary financial, human, and technical resources for training, assessment, and reassessment of accredited hospitals and encourage maternity units to attain BFHI designation or implement the Ten Steps.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0890334412449516">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0890334412449516">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, in Spain, 18 years since its inception, the BFHI has not been effectively implemented. Although 99% of births take place in hospitals, in 2009 fewer than 5% occurred in one of the 14 Spanish BFHI-designated hospitals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0890334412449516">16</xref></sup> As in several other European countries, initial breastfeeding rates after birth are high (84.2%),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0890334412449516">17</xref></sup> but the duration of breastfeeding does not meet recommendations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0890334412449516">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0890334412449516">18</xref></sup> In the last Spanish health survey in 2006, the rate of EBF was 68.4% at 6 weeks and 24.7% at 6 months.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0890334412449516">19</xref></sup> In 2009, health authorities from the region of Madrid opted to promote breastfeeding according to WHO and European Commission recommendations.</p>
<p>The region of Madrid is located in the center of Spain, and its capital, Madrid city, is also the capital of Spain. The region of Madrid has an estimated population of 6 386 724 inhabitants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0890334412449516">20</xref></sup> In the 2006 National Health Survey, EBF rates in Madrid were 71.1% at 6 weeks, 61.2% at 3 months, and 23.5% at 6 months.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0890334412449516">19</xref></sup> In 2009, 77 022 children were born in the Madrid region―64.7% of them in one of the 20 public maternity hospitals, of which only 1 was BFHI-designated.</p>
<p>This descriptive study discusses the strategy, activities, and preliminary results of this plan to promote breastfeeding in the region of Madrid.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0890334412449516" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>This is a descriptive study of the process of development and implementation of an intervention plan to improve the quality of breastfeeding care in the region of Madrid. On April 16, 2009, at the request of UNICEF and BFHI-Spain, the health authorities signed a collaboration agreement and created a regional breastfeeding committee comprising members of UNICEF/BFHI and representatives from various departments (hospitals, primary care, and quality assurance) from the Health Service of Madrid. While the committee carried out actions to promote breastfeeding both in hospitals and in health centers, this study discusses only the results of the plan’s application at the hospital level.</p>
<p>In 2009, at the start of the study, there were 20 public maternity units (and another 14 privately financed maternity units) in the region of Madrid. Only one public hospital was BFHI-designated. Currently, for a hospital to be accredited in Spain, it must meet all of the following requirements: (1) comply with each of the Ten Steps at a minimum rate of 80%, (2) have at least a 75% EBF rate from birth to discharge, and (3) comply with the International Code of Marketing of Breast-Milk Substitutes and subsequent World Health Assembly resolutions. In addition, according to the latest WHO update,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0890334412449516">21</xref></sup> since 2010 hospitals have been required to provide mother-friendly care during labor and also offer care and information to mothers who decide not to breastfeed.</p>
<p>Until March 2011, when a hospital started to implement BFHI practices, it could send a certificate of commitment to the BFHI Spanish office to be “registered for change” as a previous stage to full accreditation. Since March 2011, Spain implemented the staged accreditation system over 4 stages, known as <italic>4D</italic> (discovery, development, dissemination, designation). As part of this system, changes are recognized in a stepwise manner as they are achieved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0890334412449516">Figure 1</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0890334412449516">22</xref></sup> This study reports and assesses application of the plan in 19 non-BFHI-designated public maternity units in the region of Madrid.</p>

<p>This study was exempt from Institutional Review Board approval because it was designed to evaluate this public benefit program. The hospitals were simply reporting a breastfeeding rate, and survey procedures on hospitals and information obtained are recorded in such a manner that human subjects cannot be identified, directly or through identifiers linked to them.</p>
<sec id="section10-0890334412449516">
<title>Creation of the Action Plan</title>
<p>The regional breastfeeding committee developed an action plan with the aim of modifying practices according to the BFHI strategy and applying the quality improvement cycle Plan-Do-Check-Act. This involved respecting the informed decisions of mothers in relation to infant feeding, ensuring that mothers received the necessary professional support, and monitoring practices to attain increased breastfeeding rates. Initial lines of action were as follows: (1) institutional undertaking transferred to centers by means of quality aims to achieve, (2) having an organizational infrastructure in each center (designation of a breastfeeding coordinator and creation of a breastfeeding committee), (3) analysis of the initial situation, (4) training of professionals, (5) motivation of professionals by means of dissemination of posters and explanatory leaflets, and (6) dissemination of the activities.</p>
<p>The following were considered main outcome measures: (1) number of hospitals with a breastfeeding committee, (2) number of hospitals in compliance with each of the Ten Steps, and (3) number of hospitals that successfully obtained at least 1 accreditation stage.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0890334412449516">
<title>Carrying Out the Plan of Action</title>
<p>During the first year of the plan, the aim was for each hospital to have a breastfeeding committee. To unify the composition of these committees, an explanatory document was designed and disseminated on how to create a breastfeeding committee. In 2011, to guarantee its operation, the guidelines suggested that the committee must meet at least 3 times a year.</p>
<sec id="section12-0890334412449516">
<title>Pre-intervention data collection</title>
<p>To measure the initial situation in each hospital, a modified version of the WHO self-assessment questionnaire was used.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0890334412449516">23</xref></sup> The regional breastfeeding committee sent this questionnaire to breastfeeding coordinators in hospitals for completion. The questionnaire consists of 41 questions regarding compliance with the Ten Steps and the International Code of Marketing of Breast-Milk Substitutes. The survey did not include questions on mother-friendly labor and birthing practices and procedures, because in 2009 this was not yet a requisite for BFHI designation in Spain. In addition to completing the questionnaire, each maternity unit had to include EBF rates (in compliance with the WHO definition of EBF) for the entire hospital stay, obtained retrospectively or prospectively from a random sample of 50 medical records. The usual hospital stay for women after vaginal births is 2 days and for women after cesarean sections, 3 days.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0890334412449516">
<title>Training program</title>
<p>A breastfeeding training program was carried out for health professionals. This was a 2-phase program: first, training courses were carried out to train health professionals as trainers; in a second phase, these trainers carried out basic breastfeeding courses in their hospitals for other professionals. Staff who received the “train the trainer” education were clinicians (pediatricians, gynecologists, midwives, nurses, and assistants) selected by the managers of each center according to their breastfeeding knowledge and their ability to organize breastfeeding courses for other professionals in their own centers and in the region of Madrid.</p>
<p>“Train the trainer” courses were organized by the regional breastfeeding committee and were carried out by trainers from BFHI Spain. Courses comprised theory classes and clinical skills sessions with mothers. At the end of the course, all the necessary documentation was issued to future trainers to carry out 18-hour courses of practical classes and communication skills as recommended by the WHO. These courses took place in various hospitals in the region selected according to their geographic location and accessibility. In each course, there was a high percentage of health professionals from the hospital where it was held, but professionals from other hospitals and community health centers also took part. For phase 2 of the training, the newly educated trainers created multidisciplinary teams in their centers to carry out basic breastfeeding courses for the remaining professionals in their hospitals and community health facilities.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0890334412449516">
<title>Dissemination of the plan</title>
<p>To promote a breastfeeding culture, posters were designed to be distributed and displayed in hospitals and community health centers. In addition, a leaflet was created for professionals with practical information on how to effectively support breastfeeding. The health authorities organized annual meetings to publicize the action plan, its aims, and partial results; these meetings offered practical information on how to modify routines, and centers that had attained BFHI-designation talked about their experiences. These were attended by managers, heads of department and supervisors, and interested health personnel. Practical documentation and explanatory material have been made available on the intranet of the Health Service of Madrid and BFHI Spain Web site.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0890334412449516">22</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0890334412449516">
<title>Postintervention Data Collection</title>
<p>In 2011, 2 years after implementing the plan, the regional breastfeeding committee redistributed a self-assessment questionnaire that represented a slightly adapted version of the questionnaire from 2009. This second questionnaire comprised 67 questions because it included some references to mother-friendly care during labor. Hospitals had the option of collecting post-intervention EBF rates. Some hospitals provided data when requesting accreditation, which were collected and used for this analysis.</p>
<sec id="section16-0890334412449516">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Statistical analysis was performed with SAS 9.3. The hospital already accredited at the start of the plan was excluded for comparisons (n = 19). Differences in compliance with the Ten Steps between 2009 and 2011 were analyzed using the McNemar test for comparison of nonindependent proportions, with a level of statistical significance of <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05. Breastfeeding rates were also analyzed using mean and standard deviation or median and percentiles, according to the asymmetry of the distribution.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0890334412449516" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Results represent data collected during the first 32 months of the project, from creation of the regional breastfeeding committee in April 2009 through December 2011. All hospitals answered the pre- and post-intervention questionnaires, collected pre-intervention data during the first 2 weeks of July 2009, and filled out the second survey during the first half of June 2011.</p>
<sec id="section18-0890334412449516">
<title>Committees</title>
<p>In 2009, 13 of the 19 undesignated public maternity units in Madrid (68.4%) had a breastfeeding committee in place; by 2011, the other 6 maternity units had created a committee.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0890334412449516">
<title>Training</title>
<p>Nine breastfeeding training courses for trainers were carried out in 9 different hospitals. They were attended by professionals from various hospitals and health centers in the region, previously selected by their supervisors. These courses trained a total of 271 professionals (120 nurses, 58 midwives, 61 doctors, and 32 assistants); 71.8% worked in hospitals and 28.2% in community health centers. These trainers comprised multidisciplinary teams, which imparted 50 basic 18-hour breastfeeding courses in 11 different hospitals, training a total of 1423 professionals. Currently, basic courses remain underway in another 3 hospitals.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-0890334412449516">
<title>Compliance</title>
<p>The number of steps in place at many hospitals increased (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0890334412449516">Table 1</xref>). Step 5 (teaching mothers), step 7 (rooming in), and step 8 (feeding on demand) are those that had a higher rate of implementation and compliance initially. However, the number of maternity units that partially or fully comply with steps 1, 2, and 10 significantly increased. Compliance with the International Code of Marketing of Breast-Milk Substitutes did not improve, and compliance was present in 47.4% of the units in both surveys.</p>

<title>EBF Rates</title>
<p>In 2009, the median EBF throughout the entire hospital stay was 72% (25th percentile: 53%; 75th percentile: 82%). In 2011, 4 hospitals provided data revealing EBF rates that were 7.6% to 15% above their 2009 baseline levels.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Thirty-two months after the plan was implemented, in December 2011, 52.6% (10/19) of participating public maternity units in the region of Madrid had attained at least 1 of the 4 stages required for accreditation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0890334412449516">Figure 2</xref>). Two had attained full BFHI designation in 2011; both are tertiary hospitals, and one of them, with approximately 5000 births a year, is the largest maternity unit to achieve the award in Spain. Two BFHI-designated maternity units in 2 years can be viewed as a success if we consider the fact that in Spain there had only been 14 accredited maternity units in the last 18 years and since 2010 there are more requisites for designation. Although the plan was applied equally to all maternity units, some were more engaged than others, which we believe explains why some achieved a higher degree of accreditation.</p>
<p>These results are noteworthy because while the BFHI strategy is considered the best practice based on evidence for protection, promotion, and support for breastfeeding, it is still poorly implemented in many developed countries. In a European survey from 2002, there were only 3 out of 29 countries (Slovenia, Norway, and Sweden) where at least 75% of births occurred in BFHI hospitals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0890334412449516">24</xref></sup> The same survey, repeated in 2008 in 24 countries, revealed that only 12.2% of maternity units were accredited.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0890334412449516">16</xref></sup> Another survey in the United States revealed that the policies and practices of most US maternity units are not in accordance with international recommendations on breastfeeding and that only 3.6% of them complied with at least 9 of the Ten Steps.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0890334412449516">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>In a survey among 26 heads of department, supervisors, and breastfeeding coordinators in various Spanish hospitals (personal communication, unpublished), 73.1% declared there were few BFHI-designated hospitals possibly because of the difficulty in modifying routines and not knowing how to implement the changes. In addition, half of them stated that another cause was the lack of institutional support.</p>
<p>We have to consider not only these obstacles but also the experience of those who have overcome them if we want to design an effective strategy. Some hospitals have published their experience and highlight the importance of setting out simple, easy-to-achieve aims, such as setting up a multidisciplinary breastfeeding committee and winning over the support of the center’s management, drawing up a written breastfeeding policy, and carrying out training of personnel. Once these aims are attained, the remaining steps can be more easily implemented.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0890334412449516">10</xref></sup> Training personnel facilitates the suitable implementation of good practices, and this is an essential part of the BFHI.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0890334412449516">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0890334412449516">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>The strength of our plan may be that it seeks to overcome many of the obstacles for implementing the BFHI. First, we obtained the institutional support and undertaking of the regional health authorities so that maternity units had institutional support from the outset and promoting breastfeeding became a top priority. Simple milestones have been set, such as the creation of a breastfeeding committee in each center first and foremost. Furthermore, significant importance has been given to training professionals. This improved knowledge by professionals has led to starting to adopt evidence-based breastfeeding support practices in a multidisciplinary way. This has resulted in an increase in the number of hospitals that have implemented some steps (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0890334412449516">Table 1</xref>). The only requisite whose compliance has not improved is the adoption of the International Code of Marketing of Breast-Milk Substitutes; in approximately 50% of maternity units from the region of Madrid, infant formula is still accepted at little or no cost. This is one of the obstacles that the plan has not yet managed to overcome.</p>
<p>After implementing this plan, we have observed an increase in EBF rates throughout the entire hospital stay in the 4 hospitals that have provided pre- and post-intervention EBF rates and at least started the discovery phase. Currently, as part of the plan, we foresee collecting EBF data again in all hospitals to compare them with those obtained in 2009. Furthermore, the next aim of the plan is to improve the quality and validity of the collation of breastfeeding data (eg, by means of a standardized external review) and to perform prevalence studies.</p>
<p>A recent study stressed the importance of promoting cooperation and reflection among professionals and engaging with them at all levels, emotionally as well as cognitively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0890334412449516">27</xref></sup> This plan has designed explanatory posters and leaflets to motivate them and raise their awareness, since for changing practices, professionals must not only know how to implement changes but also want to.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section24-0890334412449516">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Limitations include the use of a self-completed questionnaire, which may have led to positive bias. Another methodological limitation is that EBF rates were obtained by each hospital and not by an external team, which may affect comparability of the results.</p>
<p>Another limitation is that the provision of post-intervention EBF data was not required. The hospitals that provided the post-intervention EBF rates have been probably more motivated to achieve BFHI designation, and their results may not be generalized to the other participating hospitals.</p>
<p>In 2012, the action plan is continuing. Breastfeeding courses have been planned in various hospitals to complete the training of professionals. The regional breastfeeding committee will collect information on the activities of the hospital committees and will encourage them to meet every 1 or 2 months. Next year, it is foreseen that hospitals will once again fill out the self-assessment survey and undergo new determinations of EBF rates. This will give rise to a new analysis of the situation and determine other activities of the plan, according to the quality improvement cycle.</p>

<sec id="section25-0890334412449516" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Our early results on changes in practice and improved EBF rates are optimistic indicators of the feasibility of a plan to improve the quality of breastfeeding care that has been successfully applied in the Madrid region of Spain. The strategic pillars were institutional undertaking, creation of multidisciplinary breastfeeding committees, periodic self-assessment of practices, and training of professionals. This experience may be useful to large regions in other nations as they work toward implementation of the BFHI.</p>
