<abstract>
<p>Atomoxetine is a cytochrome P4502D6 (CYP2D6) substrate. The reduced-activity <italic>CYP2D6*10</italic> allele is particularly prevalent in the Japanese population and may contribute to known ethnic differences in CYP2D6 metabolic capacity. The purpose of this study was to examine atomoxetine pharmacokinetics, safety, tolerability, and the effect of the <italic>CYP2D6*10/*10</italic> genotype after single-stepped dosing (10, 40, 90, or 120 mg) and at steady state (40 or 60 mg twice a day for 7 days) in 49 healthy Japanese adult men. Dose proportionality was shown and tolerability confirmed at all doses studied. Comparison of pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability between Japanese and US subjects showed no clinically meaningful ethnic differences. The <italic>CYP2D6*10/*10</italic> subjects had 2.1- to 2.2-fold and 1.8-fold higher area under the plasma concentration–time curve values relative to the CYP2D6*1/*1 and *1/*2 subjects and the CYP2D6*1/*10 and *2/*10 subjects, respectively. The adverse events reported by <italic>CYP2D6*10/*10</italic> subjects were indistinguishable from those of other Japanese participants. The higher mean exposure in <italic>CYP2D6*10/*10</italic> subjects is not expected to be clinically significant.</p>

<p>Atomoxetine hydrochloride—LY139603, (–)-N-methyl- γ-(2-methylphenoxy)benzenepropanamine hydrochloride (hereafter, atomoxetine)—is a nonstimulant medication for the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in children, adolescents, and adults. In Japan, it is currently approved for children and adolescents. The molecule is a highly specific inhibitor of the presynaptic norepinephrine transporter with little affinity for other neurotransmitter transporters or receptors,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0091270011398657">1</xref></sup> and it is predominantly metabolized by cytochrome P4502D6 (CYP2D6).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0091270011398657">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0091270011398657">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Like many of the CYP genes, CYP2D6 is polymorphic; thus, allelic variants resulting in altered protein expression or activity have significant effects on the disposition of drugs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0091270011398657">4</xref></sup> Some <italic>CYP2D6</italic> gene mutations and deletions are associated with defective CYP2D6 metabolism. The enzymatic activity of CYP2D6 is determined by genetic polymorphisms classically resulting in 2 major populations of individuals with either extensive or poor metabolic capabilities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0091270011398657">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0091270011398657">6</xref></sup> The majority of individuals are extensive metabolizers (EMs) and possess normal metabolic capacity for CYP2D6 substrates. For research purposes, the EM population is often subdivided into ultrarapid metabolizers, homozygous EMs, heterozygous EMs, and intermediate metabolizers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0091270011398657">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0091270011398657">7</xref></sup> About 7% of Caucasians and &lt; 1% of East Asians and Japanese possess 2 nonfunctional alleles and are poor metabolizers (PMs).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0091270011398657">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0091270011398657">11</xref></sup> CYP2D6 PMs have minimal or absent activity and thus, with atomoxetine administration, exhibit a 10-fold-higher area under the plasma concentration–time curve (AUC), a 5-fold-higher maximal plasma concentration (C<sub>max</sub>), and a longer half-life (t<sub>½</sub>) compared with EMs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0091270011398657">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>One CYP2D6 allele, classified as <italic>CYP2D6</italic>*<italic>10</italic>, is reported to be functional but to have decreased CYP2D6 catalytic activity, and it is found with higher frequency in Asian populations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0091270011398657">13</xref></sup> The prevalence of <italic>CYP2D6</italic>*<italic>10</italic> in the Japanese population is approximately 38% to 39% (with about 15% <italic>CYP2D6</italic>*<italic>10</italic>/*<italic>10</italic>), about 10-fold higher than that found in Caucasians.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0091270011398657">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0091270011398657">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0091270011398657">15</xref></sup> Therefore, a potential for ethnic difference between Caucasians and Japanese exists in the pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of CYP2D6 substrates because of the reduced catalytic activity and higher frequency of <italic>CYP2D6</italic>*<italic>10</italic>.</p>
<p>The clinical significance and genotype-phenotype relationship of many CYP2D6 alleles is not well established in the Japanese population so far.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0091270011398657">4</xref></sup> Otani et al reported that carriers of the <italic>CYP2D6</italic>*<italic>10</italic> allele showed decreased clearance of mexiletine in Japanese patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0091270011398657">16</xref></sup> Taguchi et al reported that the plasma concentration of metoprolol in Japanese patients with the <italic>CYP2D6</italic>*<italic>10/</italic>*<italic>10</italic> genotype was significantly higher than it was in patients in 2 other arms of their study: group 1 (<italic>CYP2D6</italic>*<italic>1/</italic>*<italic>1</italic> or *<italic>1/</italic>*<italic>2</italic>) and group 2 (<italic>CYP2D6</italic>*<italic>1/</italic>*<italic>10</italic> or *<italic>2/</italic>*<italic>10</italic>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0091270011398657">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>To date, some pharmacokinetic studies of atomoxetine in other Asian subjects and in vitro <italic>CYP2D6</italic>*<italic>10</italic> effect have been published. Cui et al reported that Chinese subjects with <italic>CYP2D6</italic>*<italic>10/</italic>*<italic>10</italic> appeared to have higher exposures of atomoxetine but were not a clearly distinct group when compared with other Chinese subjects and thus not expected to be clinically significant.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0091270011398657">18</xref></sup> Shen et al reported that <italic>CYP2D6</italic>*<italic>10</italic> reduced about 9% in vitro intrinsic clearance on atomoxetine 4-hydroxylation of that seen with <italic>CYP2D6</italic>*<italic>1</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0091270011398657">19</xref></sup> For the Japanese population, the pharmacokinetic, safety, and tolerability profiles of atomoxetine have not been published in healthy adults.</p>
<p>Some pharmacokinetic studies focusing on <italic>CYP2D6</italic>*<italic>10</italic> have been published with other drugs mentioned above, but information on clinical significance of <italic>CYP2D6</italic>*<italic>10</italic> is limited. The high prevalence of the <italic>CYP2D6</italic>*<italic>10</italic> genotype in the Japanese population may contribute to intersubject variability in exposure and thus possibly lead to differences in response to atomoxetine when compared to other populations. However, there have been scant reports comparing Japanese subjects with <italic>CYP2D6</italic>*<italic>10/</italic>*<italic>10</italic> with other ethnic groups. Therefore, it would be beneficial to better understand the genotype-phenotype relationship and the clinical significance for this CYP2D6 allele.</p>
<p>The present study was the first atomoxetine study conducted in healthy adults in Japan. The objectives were (1) to characterize the pharmacokinetics of single and multiple doses of atomoxetine; (2) to assess the safety and tolerability of atomoxetine; and (3) to evaluate the effect of the <italic>CYP2D6</italic>*<italic>10</italic>/*<italic>10</italic> genotype on atomoxetine pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability in healthy Japanese adults. An additional objective was to determine if there were any ethnic differences by comparing the results from this study with those from a similarly designed study of primarily Caucasian subjects conducted in the United States (hereafter, the US study).</p>

<title>Study Design</title>
<p>This study consisted of 2 parts—a single-dose escalation/crossover study (within subject) and a multidose parallel-group study—both of which were single blind, placebo controlled, and randomized. It was approved by the Ethical Review Board of the Osaka Pharmacology Research Clinic, Osaka, Japan, and conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All participants provided informed written consent before enrollment.</p>
<p>CYP2D6 EM and PM subjects, as determined by genotyping analyses, could be entered in this study. CYP2D6 genotyping was performed by Cogenics, Inc, Morrisville, North Carolina (formerly, PPGx, PPD Development, Inc). DNA from whole blood samples was isolated, purified, and analyzed for CYP2D6 genotype according to a validated polymerase chain reaction method. CYP2D6 genotype was evaluated by testing for the normal activity allele *<italic>2</italic>; the nonfunctional alleles *<italic>3</italic>, *<italic>4</italic>, *<italic>5</italic>, *<italic>6</italic>, *<italic>7</italic> and *<italic>8</italic>; the decreased activity allele *<italic>10</italic>; and gene duplication (*<italic>2XN</italic>). If subjects had any combination of 2 nonfunctional alleles, a PM was assigned; otherwise, an EM was assigned. For additional analyses, the EM group was divided into 3 subcategories: (1) homozygous EM (either 2 normal activity alleles or 1 normal activity allele and 1 reduced activity allele; eg, *<italic>1/</italic>*<italic>2</italic>, *<italic>1/</italic>*<italic>10</italic>); (2) heterozygous EM (1 nonfunctional allele and 1 normal activity allele; eg, *<italic>1/</italic>*<italic>5</italic>); and (3) intermediate metabolizer (either 2 reduced activity alleles or 1 reduced activity allele and 1 nonfunctional allele; eg, *<italic>10/</italic>*<italic>10</italic>, *<italic>5/</italic>*<italic>10</italic>). No ultrarapid metabolizer subjects (more than 2 copies of the normal activity allele; eg, *<italic>1/</italic>*<italic>1XN</italic>, *<italic>1/</italic>*<italic>2XN</italic>) or PM subjects were identified in this study. Additional analyses based on genotype were performed to compare specific genotypes—such as <italic>CYP2D6</italic>*<italic>10/</italic>*<italic>10</italic> vs <italic>CYP2D6</italic>*<italic>1</italic>/*<italic>1</italic> and *<italic>1/</italic>*<italic>2</italic> subjects, for example.</p>
<p>All volunteers were considered to be healthy on the basis of medical history, physical examination, electrocardiogram, chest radiograph, vital signs (blood pressure, pulse rate, and body temperature), and safety laboratory tests (blood chemistry, hematology, and urine analysis). All subjects were required not to take any medication that might interfere with the pharmacokinetics of atomoxetine.</p>
<p>In the single-dose part, subjects were randomly assigned to 5 sequence groups with the <italic>CYP2D6</italic>*<italic>10</italic>/*<italic>10</italic> genotype as a factor for stratification (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0091270011398657">Table I</xref>). Placebo doses were administered to all groups at period 1 and assigned to one group in each period to obtain baseline and placebo data. Each participant was administered single doses (10, 40, 90, and 120 mg) of atomoxetine and placebo twice, with an interval of at least 4 days between the doses. All subjects fasted for at least 8 hours before dosing and at least 1 hour after. The sponsor and principal investigator used the participants’ clinical signs and physiologic and clinical laboratory test results to determine whether to administer a higher dose after a given dose.</p>

<p>Any participant who participated in the single-dose part was not allowed to participate in the multiple-dose part. In the multiple-dose part, 6 subjects were assigned to the placebo group and 10 to each atomoxetine dose group (40 or 60 mg, twice-daily dosing). Subjects received 40 mg of atomoxetine (80 mg per day), 60 mg of atomoxetine (120 mg per day), or placebo—orally, twice a day, for up to 7 days (13 doses in total). The morning dose was administered after an overnight fast of at least 8 hours. The evening dose followed a 2-hour fast, and fasting continued for at least 1 hour after dosing. This was in accordance with the current recommended clinical dosage and administration regimen.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0091270011398657">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0091270011398657">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>Pharmacokinetic data from a related US study were used for ethnic comparison purposes. These studies were similar, apart from minor differences in the dose escalation scheme within subjects in the single-dose part and an additional dose level in the multiple-dose part in the Japanese study. The US study had no Asian subjects enrolled (81% Caucasian; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0091270011398657">Table II</xref>). In the single-dose part of the US study, subjects were randomly assigned to 6 sequence groups with EM/PM genotype as a factor. Each participant was administered single doses (10, 30, 60, 90, and 120 mg) of atomoxetine and placebo twice, with an interval of at least 4 days or 14 days between doses for EM and PM, respectively. In the multiple-dose part of the US study, 14 EM and 7 PM subjects who participated in the single-dose part were assigned to the atomoxetine group (40 mg, twice daily) or the placebo group. subjects received 40 mg of atomoxetine (80 mg per day) or placebo—orally, twice a day, for up to 7 days (13 doses in total).

<title>Pharmacokinetic Sampling</title>
<p>In the single-dose part of this study, blood samples were collected 1 hour before dosing, then postdose as follows: 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, 60, and 72 hours. Urine samples were collected after each dose up to 24 hours after administration. In the multiple-dose part, blood samples were collected 1 hour before the first dose and after the first dose as follows: 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, 144.5, 145, 145.5, 146, 148, 150, 152, and 156 hours.

<title>Bioanalytic Methodology</title>
<p>Plasma concentrations of atomoxetine, <italic>N</italic>-desmethylato-moxetine, and 4-hydroxyatomoxetine, as well as these analytes after treatment with a deconjugation reagent (β-glucuronidase, type B1; Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, Missouri), were determined with a validated liquid chromatography / atmospheric pressure chemical ionization / mass spectrometry / mass spectrometry (LC/APCI/MS/MS) method. The dynamic range for the assays was 1 to 800 ng/mL for <italic>N</italic>-desmethylatomoxetine and 4-hydroxyatomoxetine and 2.5 to 2000 ng/mL for atomoxetine. The intra- and interassay precision ranged from 0.42% to 6.20% for atomoxetine, 0.60% to 9.28% for 4-hydroxyatomoxetine, and 1.13% to 9.38% for <italic>N</italic>-desmethylatomoxetine. The intra- and interassay accuracy ranged from −7.60% to 2.40% for atomoxetine, −5.05% to 0.00% for 4-hydroxyatomoxetine, and −11.00% to 3.43% for <italic>N</italic>-desmethylatomoxetine. Urine samples were analyzed for 4-hydroxyatomoxetine, <italic>N</italic>-desmethylatomoxetine, and atomoxetine after treatment with a deconjugation reagent with the use of a validated LC/APCI/MS/MS method. The dynamic range for the assays was 250 to 75 000 ng/mL for 4-hydroxyatomoxetine, 1 to 300 ng/mL for <italic>N</italic>-desmethylatomoxetine, and 10 to 3000 ng/mL for atomoxetine.</p>
<p>Briefly, samples were buffered with dilute trifluoroacetic acid and extracted by solid-phase extraction on a styrene-divinylbenzene-phase cartridge. The analytes were eluted, dried under nitrogen, and reconstituted for analysis. Liquid chromatographic separation was conducted with a short gradient, with water as mobile phase A and with 5 mM of ammonium acetate, 0.03% trifluoroacetic acid, and 0.2% formic acid in acetonitrile:water (85:15) as mobile phase B. The analytic column used was a BrownLee C<sub>18</sub> (100 × 4.6 mm) with 5-µm particles (Perkin Elmer part, Norwalk, CT). Both <sup>2</sup>H<sub>7</sub>-atomoxetine and <sup>2</sup>H<sub>5</sub>-4-hydroxyatomoxetine were used as the internal standards. The LC/APCI/MS/MS analysis was conducted on either a Finnigan TSQ 700 or TSQ 7000 (Finnigan Corp., San Jose, California). All samples were analyzed at Taylor Technology Inc (Princeton, New Jersey).</p>

<title>Pharmacokinetic Analysis</title>
<p>Noncompartmental pharmacokinetic parameters for atomoxetine were derived in WinNonlin Professional Edition 3.1 (Pharsight Corp, Mountain View, California) according to actual sampling times. Pharmacokinetic parameters determined after single dose and at steady state included maximum plasma concentration (C<sub>max</sub> and C<sub>max,ss</sub>), time to maximum plasma concentration (T<sub>max</sub>), apparent clearance (CL/F and CL<sub>ss</sub>/F), apparent volume of distribution (V<sub>z</sub>/F), and terminal half-life (t<sub>½</sub>). Also calculated were areas under the plasma concentration–time curves from zero to infinity (AUC<sub>0-∞</sub>), during 1 dosing interval at steady state (AUC<sub>0-τ</sub>), and from time 0 to time t (AUC<sub>0-t</sub>), where t is the last point with a measurable concentration. Additional parameters determined at steady state included the average and minimum steady-state plasma concentration (C<sub>avg,ss</sub> and C<sub>min,ss</sub>); the accumulation ratio, defined as the ratio of dose-normalized AUC<sub>0-τ</sub>/AUC<sub>0-12,day1</sub>; and the fluctuation in plasma concentration over the dosing interval (flux), defined as (C<sub>max,ss</sub> − C<sub>min,ss</sub>)/C<sub>avg,ss</sub> × 100.</p>
<p>Urine data were used to calculate the amount of atomoxetine and its metabolites excreted in the urine for 24 hours following a single dose of atomoxetine.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0091270011398657">21</xref></sup></p>

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>The relationships between each variable (C<sub>max</sub>, AUC<sub>0-∞</sub>, and AUC<sub>0-τ</sub>) and weight-normalized dose were examined to evaluate dose proportionality based on a power model.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0091270011398657">22</xref></sup> The values of C<sub>max</sub> were obtained from the single doses and the first dosing in multiple doses, and the values of AUC<sub>0-∞</sub> and AUC<sub>0-τ</sub> were obtained from the single doses and the last dosing (steady state) in multiple doses, respectively. The Japan and US studies were separately analyzed and then combined to demonstrate dose proportionality and similarity of the relationship. For pharmacokinetic parameters, the comparison of genotypic groups was carried out with a mixed-effect analysis of variance on the log-transformed values. Vital signs were analyzed with a mixed-effect repeated measures linear regression model with dose and predose baseline observation as continuous independent variables, with time and dose × time as discrete independent variables, and with subject as a random effect.</p>

Five subjects were discontinued after dosing because of adverse events (3 subjects) and personal decision (2 subjects). The data from the subjects who received an atomoxetine dose were used for pharmacokinetic analyses: 22 subjects in the single-dose part and 20 subjects in the multiple-dose part (1 was discontinued after placebo dosing in the single-dose part). All data from the 49 subjects in this study were used for the safety analyses.</p>

<p>The ethnic comparison also evaluated the cumulative amounts of atomoxetine and metabolites excreted in urine over the first 24 hours following a single 90-mg dose of atomoxetine in the Japanese subjects and US EM subjects. The amount of unchanged atomoxetine excreted in urine was similar in the Japanese subjects and US EM subjects: 0.17% of dose (coefficient of variation [CV], 142.9%) and 0.17% of dose (CV, 73.8%), respectively. The total amounts of atomoxetine, 4-hydroxyatomoxetine, <italic>N</italic>-desmethylatomoxetine, and 4-hydroxyatomoxetine-<italic>O</italic>-glucuronide were 43.7% of dose (CV, 19.5%) and 60.4% of dose (CV, 26.6%), respectively. The main metabolite in both the Japanese subjects and the US EM subjects was 4-hydroxyatomoxetine-<italic>O</italic>-glucuronide: 41.8% of dose (CV, 20.7%) and 59.0% of dose (CV, 26.9%), respectively. The urine metabolite data exhibited relatively high variability with minor differences between groups; therefore, these groups appeared indistinguishable.</p>

The orthostatic pulse rate changes were dose related in both populations. However, orthostatic systolic blood pressure changes following single doses were significant after the administration of 10 mg of atomoxetine in the Japanese subjects, but they did not appear significant for US EM subjects until after the 30-mg dose. Also noted were differences in the mean orthostatic systolic blood pressure changes, which were slightly negative throughout the dose range for the Japanese subjects and slightly positive for the US EM subjects.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Forty-nine healthy Japanese men were administered at least 1 dose of the study drug, and 44 subjects completed this study. The pharmacokinetics of atomoxetine were well characterized in healthy Japanese subjects. Atomoxetine is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, and dose proportionality with respect to C<sub>max</sub> and AUC was demonstrated in Japanese subjects in the dose range of 10 to 120 mg. Steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters of atomoxetine were linear with respect to time. Overall, the pharmacokinetic profiles were similar between the Japanese and US subjects.</p>
<p>CYP2D6 is the primary enzyme responsible for the formation of 4-hydroxyatomoxetine, but when CYP2D6 is not present, a number of other isoforms of cytochrome P450 (including CYP2C19, CYP3A, CYP1A2, CYP2A6, and CYP2E1) are capable of forming 4-hydroxyatomoxetine at a substantially slower rate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0091270011398657">3</xref></sup> CYP2C19 is the primary enzyme responsible for the formation of <italic>N</italic>-desmethylato-moxetine.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0091270011398657">2</xref></sup> The primary oxidative metabolite of atomoxetine was 4-hydroxyatomoxetine, which was subsequently conjugated, forming 4-hydroxyatomoxetine-<italic>O</italic>-glucuronide.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0091270011398657">3</xref></sup> 4-Hydroxyatomoxetine is equipotent to atomoxetine as an inhibitor of the norepinephrine transporter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0091270011398657">12</xref></sup>; however, the plasma concentrations of 4-hydroxyatomoxetine were very low in both populations. Therefore, 4-hydroxyatomoxetine is considered to have little effect on clinical response. There were no significant ethnic differences in pharmacokinetics of atomoxetine, 4-hydroxyatomoxetine, and <italic>N</italic>-desmethylatomoxetine in Japanese subjects versus US EM subjects. Although 4-hydroxyatomoxetine circulates in the plasma at relatively low concentrations compared with atomoxetine, 4-hydroxyatomoxetine-<italic>O</italic>-glucuronide was the predominant metabolite observed in urine in both Japanese and US subjects. The urinary metabolite data further supported the conclusion of no significant ethnic differences in pharmacokinetics in Japanese subjects and US EM subjects.</p>
<p>The safety profiles of atomoxetine were similar in Japanese subjects and US EM subjects; no clinically meaningful differences in adverse event type, severity, or frequency were observed between the 2 study populations. Expected changes in pulse rate and blood pressure following atomoxetine dosing were similar in Japanese and US subjects. The orthostatic systolic blood pressure changes for subjects in these 2 studies suggest that the Japanese subjects may have had greater sensitivity to atomoxetine’s cardiovascular effects than did the US subjects. By inference then, the adverse events that often accompany postural hypotension (orthostatic hypotension) should be more common in Japanese subjects. However, this was not substantiated by the frequency of adverse events related to orthostatic hypotension (including dizziness) that occurred in the Japanese subjects compared with similar events in the US subjects. Additionally, electrocardiographic and laboratory test results appear to establish safety in both groups as well.</p>
<p>The effect of <italic>CYP2D6</italic>*<italic>10</italic>/*<italic>10</italic> on pharmacokinetics (C<sub>max</sub> and AUC) of atomoxetine in Japanese subjects was comparable to that observed in a Chinese study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0091270011398657">18</xref></sup> The <italic>CYP2D6</italic>*<italic>10</italic>/*<italic>10</italic> Chinese subjects had 2.2-fold-higher AUC and 1.5-fold-higher C<sub>max</sub> than did heterozygous <italic>CYP2D6</italic>*<italic>10</italic> and homozygous <italic>CYP2D6</italic>*<italic>1</italic> subjects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0091270011398657">18</xref></sup> The <italic>CYP2D6</italic>*<italic>10</italic>/*<italic>10</italic> Japanese subjects had 1.8- to 2.2-fold-higher AUC and 1.2- to 1.5-fold higher C<sub>max</sub> than did the <italic>CYP2D6</italic>*<italic>1</italic>/*<italic>1</italic> and *<italic>1/</italic>*<italic>2</italic> subjects and the <italic>CYP2D6</italic> *<italic>1/</italic>*<italic>10</italic> and *<italic>2/</italic>*<italic>10</italic> subjects. In Japanese subjects, despite the large overlap among the atomoxetine clearance values shown for the 3 groups (<italic>CYP2D6</italic>*<italic>1</italic>/*<italic>1</italic> and *<italic>1/</italic>*<italic>2</italic> subjects, *<italic>1/</italic>*<italic>10</italic> and *<italic>2/</italic>*<italic>10</italic> subjects, *<italic>10/</italic>*<italic>10</italic> subjects; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0091270011398657">Figure 4</xref>), the greatest effects on clearance resulted from having 2 <italic>CYP2D6</italic>*<italic>10</italic> alleles compared to the <italic>CYP2D6</italic>*<italic>1</italic>/*<italic>1</italic> and *<italic>1/</italic>*<italic>2</italic> genotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0091270011398657">Figure 4</xref>). This finding therefore suggests a gene-dose effect for the number of <italic>CYP2D6</italic>*<italic>10</italic> alleles and atomoxetine pharmacokinetics in Japanese subjects. Yin et al also reported that a gene-dose effect was present between the number of <italic>CYP2D6</italic>*<italic>10</italic> alleles versus loratadine clearance or its metabolic ratio.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0091270011398657">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>The lowest clearance value of <italic>CYP2D6</italic>* <italic>10</italic>/*<italic>10</italic> Japanese subjects was 10.1 L/hr, which was still about 1.8- and 4.1-fold higher than clearance values of a <italic>CYP2D6</italic>*<italic>5/</italic>*<italic>10</italic> Japanese subject and US PM subjects, respectively. The clearance values of <italic>CYP2D6</italic>* <italic>10</italic>/*<italic>10</italic> Japanese subjects were lower than those of the <italic>CYP2D6</italic>*<italic>1/</italic>*<italic>1</italic> and *<italic>1/</italic>*<italic>2</italic> subjects and <italic>CYP2D6</italic>*<italic>1/</italic>*<italic>10</italic> and *<italic>2/</italic>*<italic>10</italic> subjects yet were clearly distinguishable from PMs. The homozygous <italic>CYP2D6</italic>*<italic>10</italic> genotype would therefore not decrease atomoxetine clearance to the level of PMs.</p>
<p>The amount of atomoxetine excreted into the urine unchanged was higher in PM subjects compared to EM subjects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0091270011398657">3</xref></sup> Because of the nearly exclusive hydroxylation of atomoxetine by the CYP2D6 isozyme, the urinary ratio of atomoxetine to 4-hydroxyatomoxetine amounts following enzymatic hydrolysis could serve as a marker for CYP2D6 metabolic status. There was a clear delineation in urinary ratios of atomoxetine to 4-hydroxyatomoxetine between PM and EM subjects, resulting in an expected bimodal distribution of subjects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0091270011398657">Figure 6</xref>).</p>
<p>Two individuals (subjects A and B) in this study appeared to have lower metabolic activity similar to <italic>CYP2D6</italic>*<italic>10/</italic>*<italic>10</italic>, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0091270011398657">Figure 4</xref>. Their genotypes were <italic>CYP2D6</italic>*<italic>2/</italic>*<italic>5</italic> and <italic>CYP2D6</italic>*<italic>5/</italic>*<italic>10</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0091270011398657">Table II</xref>), and the lowest clearances in this study were obtained in these 2 subjects (5.8 L/hr and 5.4 L/hr, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0091270011398657">Figure 4</xref>). Nonetheless, the clearance values in these subjects were still comparable to the range of clearance values observed in the EM population in the US study and clearly higher than PMs.</p>
<p>Subjects A (<italic>CYP2D6</italic>*<italic>2</italic>/*<italic>5</italic>) and B (<italic>CYP2D6</italic>*<italic>5</italic>/*<italic>10</italic>) did not complete the single-dose part of this study, because of adverse events probably related to orthostatic hypotension. Subjects A was discontinued because of nausea and light-headedness (dizziness) after receiving a single dose of atomoxetine (90 mg). Subject B was discontinued because of a “feeling that blood left” (sensation of blood flow) after receiving a single dose of atomoxetine (40 mg). For the doses they did receive, their C<sub>max</sub> and AUC were the highest of all subjects at that dose, and their clearance was the lowest. Subject B’s C<sub>max</sub> and AUC and subject A’s C<sub>max</sub> were not the highest, because higher doses produced higher C<sub>max</sub> and AUC values in the subjects who completed the single-dose part. Subject A’s AUC was the highest value of all subjects in the single-dose part. Subject C (<italic>CYP2D6</italic>*<italic>2</italic>/*<italic>5</italic>) did not complete the multiple-dose part, because of involuntary urination (urinary incontinence) after receiving 4 days of atomoxetine at a dose of 60 mg twice a day. His day 1 (dose 1) C<sub>max</sub> was similar to that of all other subjects, whereas his AUC was the highest value of all subjects. However, the clearance values of subjects A and B were comparable to the minimum clearance value observed for other EM subjects with 1 nonfunctional allele (*<italic>3</italic>, *<italic>4</italic>, *<italic>5</italic>, and *<italic>6</italic>) in the US study. Clearance of subjects A and B were still about 2.3- to 2.4-fold higher than the clearance of PMs in the US study. Additionally, the urinary ratio of atomoxetine to 4-hydroxyatomoxetine in subject A was 0.034, which was the highest value in the Japanese study and among EM subjects in the US study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0091270011398657">Figure 6</xref>); however, it was lower than those of PMs in the US study. Therefore, the above subjects were not considered PMs. The mutation observed in the <italic>CYP2D6</italic>*<italic>2</italic> allele has more recently been identified in other, less frequent alleles with varying activities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0091270011398657">24</xref></sup>; therefore, there is a possibility that more advanced genotyping techniques may actually classify these subjects with <italic>CYP2D6</italic>*<italic>2/</italic>*<italic>5</italic> as a different genotype. It cannot be determined at this time if the <italic>CYP2D6</italic>*<italic>2</italic> allele was correctly identified, owing to technical limitations of genotyping assays at the time that this study was conducted.</p>
<p>Previous studies have shown that for atomoxetine, C<sub>max</sub> and AUC for CYP2D6 PMs were approximately 5 and 10 times higher than for EMs, respectively. Although PMs had slightly more adverse events that may affect tolerability, they had somewhat better responses. Because there do not appear to be serious PM-specific safety concerns, it is unlikely that differential dosing would significantly affect risk-benefit analyses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0091270011398657">25</xref></sup> The investigators were also able to dose atomoxetine to comparable efficacy and safety levels in EMs and PMs without knowledge of genotype of CYP2D6 status in the clinical trials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0091270011398657">26</xref></sup> Therefore, these pharmacokinetic differences have not necessitated dose adjustment based on genotype.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0091270011398657">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0091270011398657">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>All doses of atomoxetine were well tolerated, with no serious or otherwise clinically significant adverse events reported in this study. Adverse events observed in this study were consistent with prior studies with atomoxetine.</p>
<p>At a quantitative level, the frequency, severity, and type of adverse events reported by <italic>CYP2D6</italic>*<italic>10</italic>/*<italic>10</italic> Japanese subjects were indistinguishable from those reported by other Japanese subjects. The <italic>CYP2D6</italic>* <italic>10/</italic>*<italic>10</italic> genotype did not have a clinically meaningful effect on safety in this study as well as in a recent Chinese study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0091270011398657">18</xref></sup> The higher mean exposure in <italic>CYP2D6</italic>* <italic>10</italic>/*<italic>10</italic> subjects is not expected to be clinically significant, especially when one takes into consideration the dose and administration of atomoxetine per the package insert, which is titration from low initial dose.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0091270011398657">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0091270011398657">20</xref></sup></p>

<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Factors in this study limit the conclusions that can be drawn from the reported results. Because this study was the first human dosing study of atomoxetine in Japan, there were no prior results of Japanese subjects to gauge the most appropriate study design. All results had to be based on those from similar studies conducted in the United States.</p>
<p>In this study, the third objective was to evaluate the effect of the <italic>CYP2D6</italic>*<italic>10/</italic>*<italic>10</italic> genotype. For this objective, <italic>CYP2D6</italic>*<italic>10/</italic>*<italic>10</italic> subjects were prospectively enrolled and kept to a “natural” cross section of the general Japanese population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0091270011398657">14</xref></sup> In the protocol, 4 to 7 subjects and 5 to 8 subjects with <italic>CYP2D6</italic>*<italic>10/</italic>*<italic>10</italic> were planned to be enrolled in the single- and multiple-dose parts, respectively, to evaluate the effect in the general Japanese population. As a result, the frequency of <italic>CYP2D6</italic> *<italic>1</italic>, *<italic>2</italic>, *<italic>5</italic>, and *<italic>10</italic> alleles (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0091270011398657">Table II</xref>) in Japanese subjects participating in this study was consistent with the report of Shimizu et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0091270011398657">11</xref></sup> However, the number of <italic>CYP2D6</italic>*<italic>10/</italic>*<italic>10</italic> subjects in this study was too small to provide definitive conclusions. The results of <italic>CYP2D6</italic>*<italic>10/</italic>* <italic>10</italic> effect on pharmacokinetics and safety obtained in this study were similar to those in the Chinese study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0091270011398657">18</xref></sup> A subsequent clinical trial was conducted with a larger sample size (n = 245)—a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study of atomoxetine in Japanese children and adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0091270011398657">27</xref></sup> There was no significant clinical difference in safety between intermediate metabolizer subjects (<italic>CYP2D6</italic> *<italic>10/</italic>*<italic>10</italic> and *<italic>5/</italic>*<italic>10</italic>) and the other subjects (data not shown).</p>
<p>This article shows an indirect comparison between Japanese subjects from this study and US subjects from another study to determine if there were any ethnic differences. The design of the Japanese study was based on the US study for the purpose of ethnic comparison, as prospectively planned. The only difference of importance between the 2 studies was the specific alleles tested in the genotype assay, given that the assay for the <italic>CYP2D6</italic>*<italic>2</italic> and *<italic>10</italic> alleles was not available at the time of the US study’s conduct. The *<italic>10</italic> alleles were presumably not present in the US study on the basis of the ethnic origins of those subjects. It is possible that this genotype assay difference might affect which genotype subcategory a minority of US subjects would be placed into; however, it unlikely to alter the overall conclusions of this comparison.</p>
<p>This study was the first clinical trial in Japanese subjects, and PMs were allowed to enroll, although none were identified. Therefore, it was not possible to compare the PM pharmacokinetics and safety between populations. Given a low prevalence of PMs in the Japanese population (&lt; 1%),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0091270011398657">11</xref></sup> the ethnic comparison was made between Japanese and US EMs. As shown, there were no significant differences between Japanese and US EMs. In a later clinical trial—a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study of atomoxetine in Japanese children and adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder—4 Japanese PM subjects were enrolled into the trial. Therefore, PM subjects were evaluated in larger studies because of the low frequency of that phenotype. The overall efficacy and safety results of the double-blind Japanese study were comparable to the results from clinical trials worldwide.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0091270011398657">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>Finally, over the course of this study, CYP2D6 genotyping (new alleles identified) and genotype-predicted phenotype have been continuously changing along with scientific progress. For the purposes of this study, the CYP2D6 categorization reflected in the Japan package insert<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0091270011398657">20</xref></sup> was used (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0091270011398657">Table II</xref>). Therefore, some observations obtained in this study may have been classified differently because of evolving and different CYP2D6 categorization standards.</p>
