<abstract>
<p>Based on the schema and attribution theories, this study examined hypotheses addressing the effects of cause-brand fit and campaign new source on consumers' attitudes toward a cause-brand alliance by modifying consumers' perceptions of the brand's motivation to engage in the alliance. An online experiment was conducted with a national sample of 742 college students using a 2 (cause vs. brand message source) x 2 (low vs. high cause-brand fit) between-subjects design based on hypothetical cause-brand alliance scenarios. Findings indicate that cause-brand fit influences cause-brand alliance attitude by increasing consumers' perceived altruistic brand motivations, whereas campaign news source did not have a significant impact on cause-brand alliance attitude. Managerial and theoretical implications are discussed.

<p>Cause-related marketing (CRM) is a marketing campaign in which the firm offers a donation to a cause in response to a consumer’s purchase of the firm’s goods or services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0887302X12452339">Varadarajan &amp; Menon, 1988</xref>). CRM is one of the fastest growing forms of marketing in the United States. Even during these difficult economic times, spending on CRM by U.S. firms reached $1.68 billion in 2011, an increase of 3.7% from the previous year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0887302X12452339">Cause Marketing Forum, 2012</xref>). Companies have engaged in CRM campaigns since the early 1980s, inspired by the tremendous success of the 1983 CRM campaign by American Express to donate one cent for each credit card transaction and one dollar for each new credit card membership to the restoration project for the Statue of Liberty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0887302X12452339">Josephson, 1984</xref>).</p>
<p>Recently, specialty retailers such as Coldwater Creek and Chico’s, designers such as Kenneth Cole, and department stores such as Nordstrom and Macy’s have engaged in CRM campaigns. Research-based insight on the impact of CRM campaigns for apparel firms is necessary because more apparel firms are showing growing interest in CRM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0887302X12452339">Hyllegard, Ogle, Yan, &amp; Attmann, 2010</xref>), and the apparel industry is demonstrating increased concern for social issues such as human rights and consumer safety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0887302X12452339">Park &amp; Lennon, 2006</xref>) and preventing damage to the environment during the processing and disposal of apparel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0887302X12452339">Hawley, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Participation in a CRM campaign can foster more favorable consumer attitudes toward the brand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0887302X12452339">Lii &amp; Lee, 2011</xref>), brand credibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0887302X12452339">Bigné-Alcañiz, Currás-Pérez, &amp; Sánchez-Garcia, 2009</xref>), and purchase intention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0887302X12452339">Gupta &amp; Pirsch, 2006</xref>). One of the most influential factors in predicting the success of a CRM campaign is consumers’ attitude toward the campaign (hereafter referred to as CRM campaign attitude). A favorable view of the CRM campaign enhances consumer attitude toward the brand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0887302X12452339">Lafferty &amp; Goldsmith, 2005</xref>), ultimately influencing consumers’ intentions to purchase the product associated with the campaign (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0887302X12452339">Lafferty &amp; Edmondson, 2009</xref>). Hence, understanding factors that influence consumers’ CRM campaign attitude will help marketers create more successful campaigns.</p>
<p>Previous literature suggests gender, donation amount and proximity, and cause attributes (e.g., local vs. national) potentially influence consumers’ CRM campaign attitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0887302X12452339">Grau &amp; Folse, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0887302X12452339">Moosmayer &amp; Fulijahn, 2010</xref>). This study examines the influence of a previously overlooked factor, perceived brand motivations to engage in a CRM campaign, on consumers’ CRM campaign attitude. When exposed to a CRM campaign, consumers may wonder the brand’s reason for joining with the cause (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0887302X12452339">Ellen, Webb, &amp; Mohr, 2006</xref>), such as a desire to help the cause (intrinsic motivations) or to increase sales and profits (extrinsic motivations; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0887302X12452339">Mohr, Webb, &amp; Harris, 2001</xref>). Previous studies have shown that consumers’ perceived brand motivations influence brand credibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0887302X12452339">Bigné-Alcañiz et al., 2009</xref>) and consumer choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0887302X12452339">Barone, Miyazaki, &amp; Taylor, 2000</xref>) and purchase intention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0887302X12452339">Tsai, 2009</xref>); however, little research investigated the effects of perceived brand motivations on consumer evaluation of the CRM campaign itself, a gap that is addressed by this study.</p>
<p>Further, this study investigates two potential predictors of perceived brand motivations to engage in a CRM campaign: CRM campaign news source and cause-brand fit. Marketers may choose different sources to convey CRM campaign news, influencing consumers’ attitude toward the campaign. How the CRM campaign message is presented to the consumer, such as through guilt appeals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0887302X12452339">Chang, 2011</xref>), sexual appeals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0887302X12452339">Hyllegard et al., 2010</xref>), and whether the cause or the brand is the focal point in the message (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0887302X12452339">Lafferty &amp; Edmondson, 2009</xref>), can frame the message in a more positive or negative light in the consumer’s mind. Building on communication literature showing the influence of information source on persuasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0887302X12452339">Clark, Evans, &amp; Wegener, 2011</xref>), this study examines whether the CRM campaign news source (the nonprofit organization or the brand) affects consumers’ perceived brand motivations and subsequent CRM campaign attitudes.</p>
<p>In addition to campaign news source, this study examines the influence of the fit between the cause and the brand involved in a CRM campaign on perceived brand motivations. Marketers have a significant number of causes to choose from when developing a CRM campaign. One factor to consider is the potential effect of the cause-brand fit (hereafter referred to simply as fit), or the degree of similarity between the brand and the cause in a CRM campaign (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0887302X12452339">Lafferty, 2007</xref>). The effect of fit on the consumer’s evaluation of the product or the brand involved in a CRM campaign is not clear. Some researchers have found that fit enhances product evaluations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0887302X12452339">Hamlin &amp; Wilson, 2004</xref>), brand attitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0887302X12452339">Nan &amp; Heo, 2007</xref>), and purchase intention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0887302X12452339">Samu &amp; Wymer, 2009</xref>). Other researchers have suggested that a low fit benefits the brand through more favorable consumer response (Drumwright, 2006) or through the creation of new brand associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0887302X12452339">Hoeffler &amp; Keller, 2003</xref>). Further, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0887302X12452339">Lafferty (2007)</xref> found a nonsignificant relationship between fit and purchase intention. Clearly, more research is needed to understand the mechanisms by which fit influences consumers’ reactions to CRM campaigns. This study examines how fit may affect CRM campaign attitude through influencing consumers’ perceptions of the brand’s motivation to engage in the campaign.</p>
<p>Therefore, the purpose of this study is threefold to examine (1) the relationship between consumers’ perceived brand motivations and CRM campaign attitude, (2) the effect of CRM campaign news source and fit on consumers’ perceived brand motivations, and (3) the mediating role of perceived brand motivations for the effects of fit and CRM campaign news source on consumers’ attitude toward the campaign.</p>

<title>Literature Review</title>
<p>This study uses attribution theory, which attempts to explain how people interpret causes for events or objects that they encounter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0887302X12452339">Weiner, 1974</xref>), to formulate hypotheses about the relationships between perceived brand motivations and CRM campaign attitude and the roles of CRM campaign news source and fit in influencing CRM campaign attitude. Specific concepts and principles from attribution theory and previous literature that assist in explaining the variables and their relationships addressed in this study are illustrated below.</p>
<sec id="section2-0887302X12452339">
<title>Perceived Brand Motivations and CRM Campaign Attitude</title>
<p>Heider (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0887302X12452339">1958</xref>) proposed that individuals perceive that actors have a purpose in performing behaviors, and they focus on the actors’ intentions to determine how to respond. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0887302X12452339">Kelley and Michela (1980)</xref>, when an actor enacts a behavior because he or she is motivated by innate satisfaction from the behavior (e.g., the good feeling associated with helping someone), intrinsic motivation occurs. Extrinsic motivation exists when an actor enacts a behavior because of external causes such as an expectation of some kind of reward (e.g., improving one’s image, getting a monetary compensation).</p>
<p>When a helping behavior is attributed to an intrinsic motivation such as the actor’s inherent desire to help others, people respond to the actor and the behavior more favorably as compared to when the helping behavior is done in response to extrinsic pressure. For example, when study participants asked a person of lower status for help, the participants attributed the helping behavior more to extrinsic pressures (than intrinsic); the same behavior by the higher status helper’s behavior was attributed more to intrinsic motivations (than to extrinsic pressures; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0887302X12452339">Thibaut &amp; Riecken,1955</xref>). Furthermore, participants had more favorable attitudes toward the helper when they associated the helping behavior with intrinsic motivations.</p>
<p>These intrinsic and extrinsic motivation concepts may be applied to explain consumers’ attribution of a brand’s motivations for a CRM campaign—from believing the brand has altruistic desires to help the cause (intrinsic motivations) or profit-based desires (extrinsic motivations; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0887302X12452339">Mohr et al., 2001</xref>). Based on attribution theory, the researchers predict that consumers will have more favorable attitudes toward the CRM campaign when they attribute it to the brand’s intrinsic (rather than extrinsic) motivations. The direct relationship between perceived brand motivations and CRM campaign attitude has not been widely studied; however, there is evidence for the effect of brand motivations on firm attitude and/or purchase intention, suggesting indirect support for this prediction. For example, when firm motivation was manipulated to be extrinsic (vs. intrinsic), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0887302X12452339">Becker-Olsen, Cudmore, and Hill (2006)</xref> found that consumers had a greater number of thoughts, less favorable thoughts, thoughts focused on firm’s motive, more negative attitudes toward firm, and a lower likelihood to purchase the product associated with the sponsorship. In another study, consumers who perceived that a firm had intrinsic motives for participating in a sponsorship had greater perceptions of the firm’s corporate community relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0887302X12452339">Dean, 2002</xref>). Therefore, the following hypothesis is proposed:</p>
<list list-type="simple">

<p>
<italic>Hypothesis 1:</italic> (a) The more intrinsic and (b) the less extrinsic the perceived brand motivations, the more favorable the CRM campaign attitude.</p>

<title>Effect of CRM Campaign News Source</title>
<p>According to attribution theorists, when individuals attribute causes for a behavior, they use <italic>information</italic> and previously held <italic>beliefs</italic> about the actor and the actor’s motivations for a desired outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0887302X12452339">Kelley &amp; Michela, 1980</xref>). Thus, individuals tend to attribute the cause to the information or belief that is “most salient in their perceptual field” at that time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0887302X12452339">Kelley &amp; Michela, 1980</xref>, p. 466). Extending these findings, when CRM campaign news is announced by the nonprofit organization (vs. the brand), the needs of the cause would likely be more salient in the consumer’s mind, and thus the consumer would be likely to attribute the reason for the campaign to an altruistic (i.e., intrinsic) motivation. By contrast, when the brand announces the CRM campaign news, the brand’s needs would likely be more salient, leading to an increased perception of the brand’s extrinsic motivation for the campaign.</p>
<p>This proposition is consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0887302X12452339">Simmons and Becker-Olsen’s (2006)</xref> finding that consumers view a nonprofit organization as having less self-interested motivations than a brand when participating in a sponsorship campaign and with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0887302X12452339">Weiner, Laforge, and Goolsby’s (1990)</xref> findings that when the brand announced the CRM campaign, consumers believed there was more self-interest because the purpose of the brand communicating with consumers is to persuade them to buy their products. Thus, the researchers propose that whether the source of the CRM campaign news is the brand or the nonprofit organization would act as a cue that orients consumers’ attribution to extrinsic or intrinsic brand motivations, respectively. The following hypothesis reflects this idea:</p>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Hypothesis 2</italic>: Brand motivations to engage in a CRM campaign are perceived to be (a) less intrinsic and (b) more extrinsic when the CRM campaign news source is the brand than when it is the nonprofit organization.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>Consumers form expectations about a communicator’s message based on their preexisting information about the communicator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0887302X12452339">Weiner et al., 1990</xref>). Characteristics of message source such as expertise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0887302X12452339">Yalch &amp; Elmore-Yalch, 1984</xref>) and perceived self-interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0887302X12452339">Weiner et al., 1990</xref>) influence consumers’ attitudes toward the topic. When the source of a message is perceived as being less self-interested, consumers view the source as more sincere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0887302X12452339">Eagley, Wood, &amp; Chaiken, 1978</xref>). Therefore, participants may form a more favorable CRM campaign attitude when it is announced by the nonprofit organization (perceived as less self-interested and more sincere) than by the brand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0887302X12452339">Simmons &amp; Becker-Olsen, 2006</xref>). Considering that individuals have more favorable views of actions that are intended to help others (intrinsic motivations) than actions to appease external pressures (extrinsic motivations; Kelley &amp; Michela, 1980), the effect of CRM campaign news source on consumers’ attitude toward the campaign may be mediated by consumers’ perceived brand motivations, leading to the following hypothesis:</p>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Hypothesis 3</italic>: Perceived (a) intrinsic and (b) extrinsic brand motivations mediate the effect of CRM campaign news source on CRM campaign attitude.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0887302X12452339">
<title>Effects of Fit</title>
<p>One is more likely to attribute a helping action to internal causes (i.e., intrinsic motivation) when external causes are less clear; however, when there are clear external causes for the helping action, these external cause take precedence in accounting for the behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0887302X12452339"> Kelley &amp; Michela, 1980</xref>). For example, in aforementioned <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0887302X12452339">Thibaut and Riecken’s (1955)</xref> experiment, when the helper’s status was lower than that of the person helped, the status acted as a cue implying a possible external cause of the helping behavior, resulting in participants’ greater attribution to extrinsic pressures for the behavior. Additionally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0887302X12452339">Moore, Mowen, and Reardon (1994)</xref> found that payment for endorsing a product signaled the existence of an external cause for the endorsing behavior, and participants were less likely to attribute the endorsement to the endorser’s belief about the benefits of the product (intrinsic motivation) and more likely to believe the endorser was recommending the product simply because he or she was paid to do so (extrinsic motivation).</p>
<p>Fit is the similarity between a brand and the cause with which it partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0887302X12452339">Lafferty, 2007</xref>). The cause and the brand may fit together in a variety of ways. The most frequently cited methods of creating fit include having similar target markets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0887302X12452339">Menon &amp; Kahn, 2003</xref>), comparable brand (cause) images (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0887302X12452339">Gupta &amp; Pirsch, 2006</xref>), and shared missions and values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0887302X12452339">Nan &amp; Heo, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0887302X12452339">Simmons &amp; Becker-Olsen, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>People look for congruence when forming attitudes toward a new object, according to the congruity theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0887302X12452339">Osgood &amp; Tannebaum, 1955</xref>). When consumers encounter a CRM campaign, they look for congruity between the associations that they have for the cause and the brand. A high fit (congruity) may lead consumers to easily see the brand’s internal motive for supporting the cause, while a low fit may signal the existence of an external cause for the CRM campaign, leading consumers to pay more attention to the potential extrinsic motivation of the brand. For example, it is intuitive that a company selling fishing rods has an innate interest in water conservation. On the other hand, when there is a lack of fit between the cause’s and the brand’s associations (e.g., a high fashion brand supporting water conservation), consumers engage in further cognitive processing to look for extrinsic reasons for the CRM campaign (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0887302X12452339">Weiner, 2000</xref>) such as increasing sales and boosting brand image. Previous findings that a low-fit CRM campaign led to more negative thoughts by consumers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0887302X12452339">Basil &amp; Herr, 2006</xref>), more thoughts scrutinizing the campaign (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0887302X12452339">Trimble &amp; Rifon, 2006</xref>), and more thoughts on company motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0887302X12452339">Becker-Olsen et al., 2006</xref>) corroborate this speculation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0887302X12452339">Rifon, Choi, Trimble, and Li (2004)</xref> also found that when consumers perceived a high (vs. low) fit between the cause and the sponsor, they were more likely to attribute altruistic (i.e., intrinsic) motivations to the company in the context of sponsorship of a health and disease prevention website. Therefore, the following hypothesis is proposed:</p>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Hypothesis 4</italic>: Brand motivations to engage in a CRM campaign are perceived as (a) more intrinsic and (b) less extrinsic when the fit is high (vs. low).</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>Higher fit results in greater purchase intention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0887302X12452339">Gupta &amp; Pirsch, 2006</xref>) and more favorable response to the campaign (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0887302X12452339">Basil &amp; Herr, 2006</xref>). Given the effect of fit on consumers’ perceived brand motivations, suggested in Hypothesis 4, the researchers propose that the effect of fit on consumers’ CRM campaign attitude occurs through influencing consumers’ perceived brand motivations. That is, a high-fit CRM campaign allows for more attribution to intrinsic motivations and less attribution to extrinsic motivations, resulting in a more positive CRM campaign attitude. Therefore, the following hypothesis is proposed:</p>
<list list-type="simple">

<title>Experimental Design and Stimulus Development</title>
<p>This study employed an online experiment using a 2 (cause-brand fit: low vs. high) × 2 (CRM campaign news source: nonprofit organization vs. apparel brand) between-subjects design. Four mock press releases were created for the experimental manipulation. In all the mock press releases, <italic>The Nature Conservancy</italic> was used as the nonprofit organization that formed a CRM campaign with a brand for their freshwater campaign. The water conservation cause was chosen because concerns over the nation’s water are often considered as one of the most important environmental issues facing the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0887302X12452339">Carroll, 2007</xref>).

<title>Fit manipulation</title>
<p>In order to prevent potential confounding effects of brand familiarity or brand favorability on the experiment results, Pretest 1 identified two apparel brands that were similar in familiarity and favorability among the target population of this study, college students, while projecting different levels of fit with the water conservation cause. Pretest 1 used a self-administered online questionnaire containing 15 existing brand names that were popular with U.S. college students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0887302X12452339">Hall, 2007</xref>) and two fictitious brand names to detect the validity of participants’ responses (rating the fictitious brands as familiar indicates a lack of validity) to collect data. For each brand, participants rated their brand familiarity on a 7-point scale (1 = <italic>not familiar</italic>, 7 = <italic>very familiar</italic>) and brand favorability using five 7-point (1 = <italic>strongly disagree,</italic> 7 = <italic>strongly agree</italic>) Likert-type scale items (To me, this brand is appealing, good, pleasant, unfavorable, and likable), adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0887302X12452339">Spears and Singh’s (2004)</xref> brand attitude measure (Cronbach’s α = .95). Cronbach’s αs for the brand attitude items for all 15 brands from the pretest data were greater than .87, indicating a high reliability of the scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0887302X12452339">Robinson, Shaver, &amp; Wrightsman, 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>A random sample of 2,500 undergraduate students enrolled at a U.S. southeastern university were invited via e-mail to participate in Pretest 1 through the university’s Office of Institutional Research in accordance with university policy. In response to the initial invitation, e-mail and two reminders, 156 students completed the online questionnaire; data from 37 respondents who rated one or both of the two fictitious brands as familiar (i.e., gave a score of 3 or higher on the brand familiarity item) were removed, resulting in 119 usable responses.</p>
<p>Based on results from Pretest 1, <italic>The North Face</italic> and <italic>Old Navy</italic> were selected as appropriate apparel brands to be subjected to the second pretest. These two brands were equally familiar to participants (<italic>M<sub>The North Face</sub> </italic>= 6.3, <italic>M<sub>Old Navy</sub> </italic>= 6.4, <italic>t</italic>
<sub>117</sub> = 1.18, <italic>p</italic> = .24); and although the <italic>t</italic> test reported that their brand attitudes differed (<italic>t</italic>
<sub>111</sub> = 2.99, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), their attitude mean scores were most similar among the 15 brands (<italic>M<sub>The North Face</sub> </italic>= 5.7, <italic>M<sub>Old Navy</sub> </italic>= 5.4). The two brands also provided foundations for the manipulation of the fit variable. Based on the brands’ images (<italic>The North Face</italic> promotes an active, outdoor lifestyle, while <italic>Old Navy</italic> markets basic fashion items), <italic>The North Face</italic> was expected to have a higher fit with The Nature Conservancy’s freshwater campaign cause than would <italic>Old Navy</italic>.</p>
<p>The second pretest verified whether the combinations of The Nature Conservancy’s freshwater campaign with <italic>Old Navy</italic> and <italic>The North Face</italic> successfully manipulated low- and high-fit conditions, respectively. A convenience sample of 257 students from a consumer culture course at a U.S. southeastern university were randomly assigned to one of the two versions of a story describing a hypothetical CRM campaign between The Nature Conservancy and either <italic>Old Navy</italic> or <italic>The North Face</italic> to support the nonprofit organization’s freshwater campaign. After reading their assigned story, participants rated their perceived fit between the brand and the freshwater campaign using a 6-item (This brand and this cause are consistent, typical, representative, and complementary, fit together, and make sense), 7-point Likert-type scale (1 = <italic>strongly agree</italic>, 7 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic>) adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0887302X12452339">Becker-Olsen and Hill (2006</xref>; Cronbach’s α = .99). The Cronbach’s α for the fit items from Pretest 2 data was .95, demonstrating high reliability of the scale. Pretest 2 results revealed that <italic>The North Face</italic> (<italic>M<sub>The North Face</sub> </italic>= 5.3) had a higher fit than <italic>Old Navy</italic> (<italic>M<sub>Old Navy</sub> </italic>= 3.8) with The Nature Conservancy’s freshwater campaign, <italic>t</italic>
<sub>252</sub> = 12.15, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. Thus, <italic>Old Navy</italic> and <italic>The North Face</italic> were used in the mock press release to manipulate the low- and high-fit conditions in the main study.</p>

<title>CRM campaign news source manipulation</title>
<p>To manipulate the CRM campaign news source variable, the mock press release was written to clearly indicate the author of the text. In one mock press release, The Nature Conservancy announced the CRM campaign news throughout the message and in the other press release the brand (<italic>Old Navy</italic> or <italic>North Face</italic> depending on the fit condition) announced the campaign news.</p>

<title>Sampling and Experiment Procedures</title>
<p>The sample consisted of full-time students, 19–25 years old, enrolled in 2- or 4-year colleges or universities in the United States. Marketers want to learn about the shopping behavior of these consumers because the millennial generation has considerably more buying power and a greater population than any previous generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0887302X12452339">O’Donnell, 2006</xref>). More importantly, these consumers are committed to supporting causes that they care about. According to a Cause Evolution Study, 88% of the participants in the millennial generation would switch from using a brand that does not support a cause to one that does (given equal price and quality), and 51% had purchased a product associated with a cause in the past year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0887302X12452339">Cone, Inc., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The sample was acquired through a consumer panel of a national market research company; data collection lasted 13 days. A total of 5,731 panel members clicked on the link to the information page in the invitational e-mail from the market research company. Next, interested panel members completed screening questions to ensure their qualifications (i.e., 19–25 years old, attending a 2-year or 4-year school, etc.). A total of 1,359 panel members met the qualifications for participation and continued to the experimental website.</p>
<p>On the experimental website, participants viewed one of the four mock press releases randomly assigned to them. They were advised that the press release was reported in a local newspaper and there would be a brief quiz to see how much they remembered (to encourage participants to carefully read the press release). After reading their assigned mock press release, participants completed dependent measures, manipulation check measures, and demographic items, and moved to a debriefing page where participants were informed that the press release was fictitious. The market research company offered respondents an incentive for participation.</p>
<p>After removing unusable cases (i.e., incomplete response sets, showing a tendency of response sets [e.g., responding all 5’s on scale items], and not correctly identifying the CRM campaign news source in their assigned mock press release), a final usable sample size of 742 was obtained (with cell sizes of 208, 193, 165, and 176). The final sample demographics were similar across the four experimental conditions. The sample consisted of college students between the ages of 19 and 25 and was almost evenly divided between men (49%) and women (51%). Each state was represented by at least one participant, with California (16%) and New York (10%) having the greatest representation. Respondents were Caucasian/White (57%), Asian/Pacific Islander (23%), African American/Black (7%), and Hispanic (6%). Participants represented all class standings; sophomores (38%) juniors (25%), freshmen (22%), and seniors (15%) and a wide variety of majors.</p>

<sec id="section10-0887302X12452339">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>The dependent measures included perceived intrinsic and extrinsic brand motivations and CRM campaign attitude. Perceived intrinsic and extrinsic brand motivations were measured by an 8-item, 7-point (1 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic>, 7 = <italic>strongly agree</italic>) Likert-type scale adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0887302X12452339">Rifon et al. (2004)</xref>. The scale, originally created to measure whether consumers perceived that a firm had socially responsible/altruistic or self-serving motives for sponsorship, was comprised of four factors: altruism (3 items, α = .80), profit (2 items, α = .69), public image (2 items, α = .67), and ethics (1 item). In this study, the altruism and ethics items were used to tap a brand’s intrinsic motives for helping the cause, whereas the profit and public image items measured a brand’s extrinsic motives for helping the cause. CRM campaign attitude was measured by a 5-item, 7-point semantic differential scale (Cronbach’s α = .95) from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0887302X12452339">Spears and Singh (2004)</xref>.</p>
<p>The same scale that was used to measure perceived fit in Pretest 2 was used to check the manipulation of the fit variable. To check the success of the CRM campaign news source manipulation, participants were asked “Who is the source of the message in the press release that you read?” and chose either The Nature Conservancy or the apparel brand name from a dropdown menu. The <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0887302X12452339">Appendix A</xref> presents all measures.</p>

<title>Manipulation Checks</title>
<p>The CRM campaign news source manipulation check ensured that the final sample consisted of only those who were aware of the source (the brand or the nonprofit organization) of the campaign message in their mock press release. The fit manipulation was successful as the mean scores of the fit measure were greater in the high-fit condition than in the low-fit condition (<italic>M</italic>

<sec id="section13-0887302X12452339">
<title>Measurement Validity and Reliability</title>
<p>The convergent and discriminant validity of the perceived brand motivation measure was evaluated by running correlations among the eight perceived brand motivation items. One reverse-coded item (<italic>[Brand] does not have a genuine concern for the welfare of their customers</italic>) had nonsignificant correlation with 5 other items, and was excluded from further analysis. Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0887302X12452339">Rifon et al. (2004)</xref> originally determined that the scale was comprised of four factors: altruism, profit, public image, and ethics, prior use of the perceived brand motivations instrument had indicated that the scale was comprised of two factors: intrinsic (combining Rifon et al.’s altruism and ethics factors) and extrinsic (combining Rifon et al.’s profit and public image factors) motivations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0887302X12452339">Myers &amp; Kwon, 2012</xref>). Therefore, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) with maximum likelihood estimation was conducted for the two-factor model with the remaining 7 items. CFA results show one extrinsic motivation item had a factor loading smaller than .60 (Hair et al., 2006) and the model had a high root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA = .125). The low-loading item was eliminated, and another CFA was run with the remaining 6 items, resulting in an acceptable model fit, comparative fit index (CFI) = .98, incremental fit index (IFI) = .98, normed fit index (NFI) = .97; RMSEA =.078; χ<sup>2</sup> = 44.19, <italic>df</italic> = 8, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. Although the 6-item model resulted in another extrinsic motivation item with a factor loading of .591, slightly lower than .60, this item was retained in the model because theoretically it made sense, and it is desirable to have at least three indicators for a latent variable.</p>
<p>The average variance extracted of the intrinsic (.57) and extrinsic (.57) brand motivation factors were above .5, showing convergent validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0887302X12452339">Fornell &amp; Locker, 1981</xref>). Correlation between these factors (<italic>r</italic> = .63, <italic>SE</italic> = .031) was less than .8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0887302X12452339">Brown, 2006</xref>); and the confidence interval of the factor correlation [.568, .692], calculated by adding and subtracting two standard errors around the factor correlation, did not contain one (Hair et al., 2006). Both results confirm the instruments’ discriminant validity. Cronbach’s αs showed acceptable reliability for both intrinsic (α = .79) and extrinsic (α = .79) motivation items and reliability of the CRM campaign attitude items was confirmed by a Cronbach’s α of .91.</p>

<sec id="section14-0887302X12452339">
<title>Hypothesis Testing Results</title>
<p>Structural equation modeling (SEM) with maximum likelihood estimation was conducted to test the hypotheses. First, an SEM model (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0887302X12452339">Figure 1</xref>) was specified using dummy variables for the two experimental factors, fit (0 = <italic>low fit</italic>, 1 = <italic>high fit</italic>) and CRM campaign news source (0 = <italic>nonprofit organization</italic>, 1 = <italic>brand</italic>). Each experimental factor dummy variable emitted regression paths to each of the two perceived brand motivation latent variables, which in turn produced a regression path to the CRM campaign attitude latent variable. The latent variables for perceived intrinsic and extrinsic brand motivations were specified with the indicators from the finalized CFA model from the preliminary analysis reported above, and the CRM campaign attitude latent variable was indicated by the 5 items used to measure this construct. Finally, the error terms for the perceived intrinsic and extrinsic brand motivation latent variables were specified to covary in order to reflect the conceptual connection between the two brand motivations irrespective of the effects of the independent variables. The chi-square test (χ<sup>2 </sup>= 162.95, <italic>df </italic>= 60, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) did not support a perfect model fit, but since this test is sensitive to sample size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0887302X12452339">Bentler, 1990</xref>), IFIs, and RMSEA are better measures of model fit. The IFIs all exceeded .95 (CFI = .98, Tucker–Lewis index = .96, IFI = .98, NFI = .96), and the RMSEA was .048, which suggested a close fit of the model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0887302X12452339">Hu &amp; Bentler, 1999</xref>). Thus, path coefficients of this model were further examined for hypothesis testing.</p>

<p>According to the standardized path coefficients from this SEM model, both perceived intrinsic (β = .37, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and extrinsic (β = .30, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) brand motivations positively influenced CRM campaign attitudes, supporting Hypothesis 1a. However, Hypothesis 1b, which predicted a negative influence of perceived extrinsic brand motivations on CRM campaign attitude, was rejected.</p>
<p>SEM results failed to show that CRM campaign news source affected either perceived intrinsic motivations (β = −.06, <italic>p</italic> = .13) or extrinsic motivations (β = −.07, <italic>p</italic> = .08), so neither Hypotheses 2a nor 2b was supported. Fit positively affected perceived intrinsic brand motivations (β = .10, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), that the higher the fit, the greater the perceived intrinsic brand motivation, supporting Hypothesis 4a. However, the effect of fit on perceived extrinsic motivations was not significant (β = −.02, <italic>p</italic> = .66), rejecting Hypothesis 4b.</p>
<p>In addition to the SEM, multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), followed by ANOVAs, also provided further evidence for the above Hypotheses 2 and 4 testing results. The MANOVA was run with the two experimental factors as the independent variables and the average score of the three intrinsic motivation items and that of the three extrinsic motivation items as the dependent variables. The MANOVA results showed a significant main effect of fit, Wilk’s λ = .985, <italic>F</italic>(2, 706) = 5.33, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, but the main effect of CRM campaign news source, Wilk’s λ = .997, <italic>F</italic>(2, 706) = 1.01, <italic>p</italic> = .36, and the fit × news source interaction effect, Wilk’s λ = .999, <italic>F</italic>(2, 706) = .35, <italic>p</italic> = .71, were not significant. Follow-up ANOVAs showed that perceived intrinsic motivation was greater, <italic>F</italic>(1, 707) = 4.56, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, in the high-fit condition (<italic>M</italic> = 4.85) than in the low-fit condition (<italic>M</italic> = 4.67), supporting Hypothesis 4a. Perceived extrinsic brand motivation was greater when the fit was low (<italic>M</italic> = 5.18) than when it was high (<italic>M</italic> = 5.07), consistent with the direction predicted by Hypothesis 4b; however, this difference was not significant, <italic>F</italic>(1, 707) = 1.22, <italic>p</italic> = .27, rejecting Hypothesis 4b. Further, ANOVA results rejected Hypothesis 2, through nonsignificant effects of CRM campaign news source on intrinsic, <italic>M</italic>

<p>Hypothesis 3 predicted that perceived intrinsic and extrinsic brand motivations would mediate the effect of CRM campaign news source on CRM campaign attitude. However, because CRM campaign news source did not have a significant effect on perceived intrinsic and extrinsic brand motivations (see Hypothesis 2 testing results above), Hypothesis 3 was also rejected without further analysis.</p>
<p>The significant effect of fit on perceived intrinsic brand motivation (Hypothesis 4a) and the positive relationship between perceived intrinsic brand motivation and CRM campaign attitude (Hypothesis 1a) suggest a potential mediating role of perceived intrinsic brand motivation for the effect of fit on CRM campaign attitude, as predicted by Hypothesis 5a. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0887302X12452339">Sobel (1982)</xref> test was run based on unstandardized regression coefficients and standard errors for the relationship between fit and perceived intrinsic brand motivation (<italic>b</italic> = .225, <italic>SE</italic> = .095) and the relationship between perceived intrinsic brand motivation and CRM campaign attitude (<italic>b</italic> = .334, <italic>SE</italic> = .049). Results supported mediation of perceived intrinsic brand motivation between fit and CRM campaign attitude (<italic>z</italic> = 2.24, <italic>p </italic>&lt; .005), supporting Hypothesis 5a. However, due to the nonsignificant effect of fit on perceived extrinsic brand motivation and the positive relationship (instead of the hypothesized negative relationship) between perceived brand extrinsic motivation and CRM campaign attitude, Hypothesis 5b was rejected without further analysis.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study examines the effects of fit and CRM campaign news source on consumers’ perceptions of the brand’s motivations and CRM campaign attitude. Findings of this study offer valuable insights on the phenomenon of CRM campaigns that provide meaningful managerial implications. First, this study reveals that when consumers perceive that the brand has more intrinsic (altruistic) motivations for participating in the CRM campaign, they have more favorable CRM campaign attitudes. Previous studies have shown that consumers’ perceptions of the brand having altruistic motivations for engaging in CRM campaigns positively impact brand credibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0887302X12452339">Bigné-Alcañiz et al., 2009</xref>) and purchase intention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0887302X12452339">Tsai, 2009</xref>). The present study provides evidence for an additional positive effect of perceived intrinsic brand motivation by showing its impact on another dependent variable, consumers’ CRM campaign attitude.</p>
<p>This study further reveals that fit contributes to enhancing consumers’ intrinsic brand motivations. When consumers believe that the cause and the brand fit together, they are more likely to perceive that the brand has a fundamental interest in the cause and in turn form more favorable CRM campaign attitudes. For a successful CRM campaign, marketers should make conscious efforts to create conditions that can make the brand’s altruistic and moral motivations salient in the consumer’s mind, and one way to achieve this is by choosing a nonprofit organization that has a good fit with their brand.</p>
<p>This study reveals that perceived extrinsic (self-serving) brand motivations have a positive (although slightly weaker) relationship with CRM campaign attitude, contradicting previous sponsorship literature showing that consumers less favorably view sponsorships when they perceive extrinsic brand motivations (e.g., Becker-Olsen et al., 2006). This seemingly counterintuitive result suggests that intrinsic and extrinsic motives are not opposite view points when consumers interpret a firm’s engagement in a CRM campaign. In other words, high extrinsic motivations are not necessarily linked to low intrinsic motivations. Consumers seem to understand that brands have self-serving intentions for participating in CRM campaigns. No previous studies have reported a positive relationship between consumers’ perceived extrinsic or self-serving motivations and CRM campaign attitude. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0887302X12452339">Gupta and Pirsch (2006)</xref> found that consumers who had more skepticism about brand’s motive for participating in the CRM campaign did not differ in their purchase intention from consumers who had less skepticism.</p>
<p>Gupta and Pirsch’s finding and the positive relationship between perceived extrinsic brand motivations and CRM campaign attitude found in this study allow for a speculation that consumers realize that companies must pursue their marketing goals and thus do not participate in CRM campaigns for the sole purpose of helping the cause. In fact, the mean score of perceived extrinsic brand motivation in this study was above 5 (on a 7-point scale) in all four experimental conditions with 91% of the participants rating 4 (mid-point of the scale) or above. In addition, neither fit nor campaign news source significantly affects consumers’ perceived extrinsic brand motivations.</p>
<p>These findings suggest that some extrinsic brand motivation to enhance sales and improve brand image is taken for granted when consumers view a CRM campaign, regardless of fit or campaign news source. These results related to extrinsic brand motivation, along with the result that perceived intrinsic brand motivation had a greater impact on CRM campaign attitude than did perceived extrinsic brand motivation, suggest that marketers’ efforts in designing a CRM campaign should be focused on enhancing consumers’ perceived intrinsic brand motivations rather than hiding or disguising their extrinsic motivation.</p>
<p>Finally, the findings did not show that CRM campaign news source influences consumers’ perceptions of intrinsic brand motivations despite the literature on message source suggesting that the lower self-interest associated with the nonprofit organization source (vs. the brand source) would lead to greater perceptions of intrinsic motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0887302X12452339">Weiner et al., 1990</xref>). The design of the mock press release may have influenced this result. Although efforts were made to clearly indicate the campaign news source by expressing it multiple ways in the mock press release, the message also inadvertently mentioned the other party almost equally often. In spite of their awareness of the news source, both the nonprofit organization and the brand may have become salient in participants’ minds when they evaluated the CRM campaign. Communication literature suggests that in addition to message source, argument quantity can serve as a peripheral cue that influences information processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0887302X12452339">Chaiken, 1980</xref>). Almost equal exposure to both the brand and the nonprofit organization names in the mock press releases may have interfered with the message source effect. This speculation leads to an interesting managerial implication that when marketers create promotional materials about a CRM campaign, they must be careful to make greater references to the nonprofit organization than to their brand to focus consumers’ attention on the altruistic effect of their participation in the CRM campaign.</p>
<p>This study provides theoretical implications by expanding the applicability of attribution theory in explaining consumer’s reactions to CRM campaign messages. By investigating the causal relationships among fit, perceived brand motivations, and CRM campaign attitude in the framework of attribution theory, this study suggests an insight to understanding how consumers respond to a CRM campaign through attributions of the brand’s motivation for engaging in the campaign and the role fit plays in this process. These findings that the more altruistic consumers perceive the brand’s motivations for engaging in the CRM campaign, the more favorably they view the campaign is consistent with attribution theory and more specifically with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0887302X12452339">Thibaut and Rieckens’ (1955)</xref> findings that individuals respond more favorably to others’ helping actions that are intrinsically motivated.</p>
<p>This study also applies attribution theory to explain how fit positively influences perceived intrinsic brand motivations. A lack of fit acts as a cue that signals the existence of external causes, other than a desire to help, that motivated the brand to engage in the campaign. Thus, consumers are less likely to attribute the campaign to the brand’s intrinsic motive (e.g., interest in the cause, altruistic desire). Given that fit and brand motivations have often been examined separately (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0887302X12452339">Dean, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0887302X12452339">Hamlin &amp; Wilson, 2004</xref>), this study contributes to the literature by providing integrated insight on the roles of fit and brand motivation in the formation of CRM campaign attitude. Future research is recommended to generate insights into potentially differential effects of varying dimensions of fit (e.g., image fit, size fit, target population fit) on consumers’ perceived brand motivations, in order to provide more specific managerial recommendations with regard to ways to enhance fit.</p>
<p>Although efforts were made to ensure the validity of this study, several limitations exist that should be considered when interpreting findings of this study. First, the sample for this study was college students, limiting the generalizability of the findings to other populations. In addition, the low percentage of African American/Black and Hispanic participants in the sample further limits the generalizability of the findings. African American and Hispanic students comprised 14.3% and 11.5%, respectively, of the U.S. college enrollment in 2009 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0887302X12452339">U.S. Census Bureau, 2009</xref>), yet only 7% and 6%, respectively, of the study sample. The market research company’s use of social network sites (SNSs) to recruit its consumer panel may have resulted in disproportionately low participation among African American and Hispanic students as they are less likely to use a SNS as compared to the other racial groups. For example, 83% of Caucasian Millennials have created a profile on a SNS, whereas only 71% of African American and 52% of Hispanic Millennials have created a SNS profile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0887302X12452339">Vernon, 2010</xref>). Therefore, the findings of this study need to be interpreted with caution due to this sampling limitation.</p>
<p>Another potential limitation comes from using only one type of cause and brand in the experiment, compromising the applicability of the findings to other CRM campaigns. Future research using multiple causes (e.g., disease, poverty) and a variety of types of brands (e.g., luxury, discount) could reduce any preexisting bias that participants may have about a particular stimulus cause and brand used in this study.</p>
<p>Finally, using a mock press release to manipulate CRM campaign news source did not allow for detection of the effect of campaign news source on perceived brand motivations. This lack of significance may be due to potential confounding effect of the message content (i.e., using the brand and nonprofit organization names equally) and suggests the effect of CRM campaign news source warrants further research. For example, using a more distinctive way to make participants aware of the CRM campaign news source, perhaps by varying where the press release is published (e.g., on the brand’s website vs. that of the nonprofit organization).</p>
