         <abstract>
            <p>Recent studies suggest that a number of common cold medicines, including nasal decongestants are not suitable for small children. In Latvia nasal decongestants are primarily over-the-counter (OTC) medicines, and patient information leaflets generally permit use of these medicines for small children. The previous studies in Latvia investigating the use of medicines in cases of common cold demonstrated extensive use of decongestants in children less than six years of age, marking a necessity for more profound research. As a result a qualitative study was implemented in 2011 to identify sources of information that offer advice for the use of decongestants in children. The caregivers’ perception of risks, trust, and the role of emotions associated with use of these medicines was considered. The study results suggested that emotions have a considerable effect on the decisions of caregivers. Even though caregivers are aware of the risks associated with the use of decongestants, they still frequently administer these medicines for the sake of the comfort of both the child and the caregiver. It is essential to raise a discussion about the inappropriate use of common cold medications in small children in Latvia.</p>

         <title>Introduction</title>
         <p>A number of studies have suggested that several common cold medicines, including nasal decongestants, are not suitable for children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1367493512456108">Fabi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1367493512456108">KinyonMunch, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1367493512456108">Rimsza and Newberry, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1367493512456108">Ryan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1367493512456108">Shefrin and Goldman, 2009</xref>). These medicines, which are sometimes referred to as remedies, contain no treatment properties, only relieve symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1367493512456108">Johnson and Helman, 2004</xref>), and are no better at treating the illness than a placebo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1367493512456108">Smith et al., 2008</xref>). At the same time, they may cause serious side-effects for children, who experience the common cold on average six to eight times a year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1367493512456108">Heikkinen and Järvinen, 2003</xref>). The common cold is considered to belong to the non-heavy self-limiting disease group; it is caused by numerous viruses and there are no medicines available to properly treat the common cold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1367493512456108">Heikkinen and Järvinen, 2003</xref>). Experts suggest using alternative symptom-relieving means instead, such as fluids, humidifiers and saline water (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1367493512456108">Ryan et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
         <p>In Latvia, the patient information leaflets (PILs) included with most of the nasal decongestants do not contain instructions to abstain from the usage of these medicines in cases of children of a certain age. A previous quantitative study carried out in Latvia showed that nasal decongestants are frequently used for relieving symptoms of rhinitis in children under six years of age (52.2% of the illness cases) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1367493512456108">Salmane-Kulikovska et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
         <p>The use of medicines involves many social, cultural, and psychological aspects which influence the decision to use these medicines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1367493512456108">Haaijer-Ruskamp and Hemminki, 1993</xref>). Emotions are present in the decision-making process and are attributed to one of the stages of information processing: dealing with trial, evaluation, adoption, or rejection. These processes are influenced by emotional or life events, linked to relatives, such as children or other family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1367493512456108">Chetley et al., 2007</xref>). The amount of information users of medicines face nowadays is immense. The evaluation of risk and the establishment of trust are made on the basis of expert opinions, lay people, and public discourse.</p>
         <p>The present study was aimed at clarifying the role of emotions, trust, and risk evaluation on the decision that caregivers make to use nasal decongestants in children under six years of age, based upon the information available to users of medicines.</p>

         <title>Research methods and sample</title>
         <p>A qualitative study was conducted using 27 semi-structured interviews with caregivers of children ages 0–6. The significance of the individual experience and a need for an in-depth investigation of the topic led to the qualitative methodology, based upon explanatory-informative cases and purposive sampling utilizing the snowball sampling method. Interviews were performed in March 2011. The main sampling parameter was ‘having used nasal decongestants in a child (children) age 0–6 for relieving symptoms of rhinitis’. Interviews were semi-structured and problem-centred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1367493512456108">Flick, 1998</xref>), with an average length of 20–30 minutes. Interviews were recorded and each respondent signed an informed consent form prior to the interview.</p>
         <p>There were three groups of interview questions. The first group was aimed at clarifying the health status of a child – how often the child experiences the common cold, what are the usual symptoms, does he/she have any chronic illnesses. The second group of questions focused on rhinitis – responses and activities of caregivers, choice and use of decongestants, sources suggesting the use of these medicines, care-rendering, administration of different medicines, attitude towards rhinitis, perceived properties, and risks associated with nasal decongestants. The third part of the interview examined the evaluation of sources of information about common cold medicines in Latvia, including nasal decongestants, as well as trust in these sources.</p>
         <p>All of the respondents were females, and almost all were mothers (one respondent was a grandmother). Such sample characteristics are determined by the fact that, in Latvia, it is mostly female family members that care for sick children and make decisions about which medicines to use in the case of illness. The age of respondents was 25–57 years of age (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1367493512456108">Table 1</xref>). The total number of children being referred to within the limits of this study was 30. The sample size was determined by data saturation. Analysis, entailing the coding of transcripts, was performed by the program Nvivo 9.0.</p>

         <p>The analysis was based upon a thematic coding procedure and a multi-step process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1367493512456108">Flick, 1998</xref>: 188–190). The transcripts were analysed first by providing a short description of each respondent, enclosing typical statements provided by the respondents related to the interview questions, which emerged from the aim, task, and content of the study. The statements were coded, and three categories were derived out of as a result of the grouping of codes – emotions, perceptions of risks and benefits and trust in the available information sources (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1367493512456108">Table 2</xref>). Transcripts were checked for the presence or absence of categories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1367493512456108">Flick, 1998</xref>).</p>

            <p>Emotions play an important role in the decision-making process for caregivers taking care of a sick child. This includes how they go about choosing a medicine to treat a child. During the interviews, the caregivers stressed that they felt the necessity to maintain the well-being of the child. Empathy and the perceived need to provide comfort for the child, who is experiencing symptoms of rhinitis, seemed to outweigh the perceived possible risks associated with the use of decongestants.
<disp-quote>
                  <p>It is, of course, possible to make philosophical discussions [about side-effects] (…) but it is more important for me that the child feels better. (E_31)</p>
                  <p>And he [the child] is in fact tired from feeling sick. (R_32)</p>
               </disp-quote>Respondents pointed out that the perceived positive effects on the behaviour of the child were proof that they made the right choice of medication.
<disp-quote>
                  <p>I observed that, after I had given her nasal drops, she became livelier after 10–15 minutes. She was more relaxed, ready to play, full of energy. (L_39)</p>
               </disp-quote>The comfort of the child was observed to be parallel to the comfort of the mother and the well-being of the family.
<disp-quote>
                  <p>I understand that a runny-nose – it is a certain reaction to something (…) At the same time, she feels more comfortable [when the decongestant is used] and so do I. (E_31)</p>
                  <p>I do not like that someone from my family is ill. I am not a sickly person myself, and I feel uncomfortable, indeed, if somebody is ill, and I always desperately do my best to stop it. (B_32)</p>
               </disp-quote>These statements made by respondents show that nasal decongestants are often used to demonstrate care, to reduce the amount of inconvenience for caregivers, and to answer their emotional and moral need to improve the child’s experience of illness.</p>

            <title>Perceptions of risks</title>
            <p>The results of the study show that the risk of using nasal decongestants for children is perceived to be greater when compared to similar cases concerning adults. In these cases, information about medicine is gathered and examined more carefully.
<disp-quote>
                  <p>Regarding our own health, oh, yes, we can gather information, read something on the internet, chose something, but the health of the children (…) is different. (I_28)</p>
                  <p>I do not conduct experiments (…) I may permit myself to conduct experiments on myself, but on the child – never! Concerning medicine for a child – I read everything from A to Z. (I_30)</p>
               </disp-quote>One of the reasons for caregivers to consult several sources before making a decision is perceived vulnerability of a child.
<disp-quote>
                  <p>I try to read something. I go to the pharmacy and ask then I ask the doctor. And then I make the decision myself (…) like maybe a normal parent. (B_32)</p>
               </disp-quote>Many of the respondents were aware of the risks potentially arising from the use of nasal decongestants. The main risk mentioned by the respondents was possible damage to the mucous membrane.
<disp-quote>
                  <p>It has a very bad influence on the mucous membrane. Intensive use may cause a habit, and the membrane dries out. (R_32)</p>
                  <p>They [nasal decongestants] burn the nasal membrane. (J_32)</p>
               </disp-quote>Other mentioned side-effects included dependence and reduced efficiency in cases of prolonged use.
<disp-quote>
                  <p>If we use those [decongestants] frequently, our body loses capacity to fight the disease itself. (D_31)</p>
               </disp-quote>The perceived benefits of nasal decongestants included the capacity of these medicines to facilitate symptoms of illness.
<disp-quote>
                  <p>The positive influence is a possibility of sleep and no need to suffer from a stuffy nose. (DZ_37)</p>
               </disp-quote>Some respondents stated that they were confident that they had observed the treatment properties of decongestants.
<disp-quote>
                  <p>I think they [nasal decongestants] facilitate breathing and also treat rhinitis. They seem to shorten [the illness] also. (A_32)</p>
               </disp-quote>Use of decongestants was also justified by the assurance that there is a considerably low risk of side effects if the time of usage is not prolonged.
<disp-quote>
                  <p>If it is used without overdoing it, only when it is really needed, OK, maybe regularly, but for a short period of time, no big harm can occur. (I_30)</p>
               </disp-quote>It was stated by some respondents that use of decongestants helps to minimize the risk of complications that could be caused by rhinitis.
<disp-quote>
                  <p>In order to not start with antibiotics and to not have an effect on their ears, our doctor suggested using Vibrocil three to four times a day. (I_32)</p>
               </disp-quote>In evaluating the risk associated with the use of particular medicines, the respondents were basing their criteria of choice and use of decongestants on erroneous arguments.
<disp-quote>
                  <p>I think this medicine [Vibrocil] is the best to reduce dropsy. Or, maybe I have read somewhere that it has a less negative impact on the membrane (…) I think it somehow disinfects the nose. (J_33)</p>
               </disp-quote>A tendency to associate certain decongestants with lower risk was also present:
<disp-quote>
                  <p>Vibrocil is a less strong, milder medicine, that is more suitable for children, and that’s why it is not able to kill viruses instantly. (S_35)</p>

            <title>Trust in information sources</title>
            <p>The respondents had consulted a variety of information sources prior to the use of nasal decongestants. They had varied accounts about their trust in these sources and on the quality of the information that they had obtained. Instructions received from the doctor usually did not include information about the potential side-effects of decongestants. In some cases it was stated that the doctor had suggested that they avoid the use of decongestants for a prolonged period of time. The advice of experts (doctors, pharmacists), suggesting particular decongestants and using emotionally loaded language (‘the best’, ‘the most harmless’, ‘very mild’, ‘suitable for small children’) has favoured the decision to use these medicines in children.
<disp-quote>
                  <p>Knowing my attitude, I prefer natural things, the doctor suggested to use this [the decongestant Vibrocil]. In this case, mentioning that this medicine is very mild and is not very synthetic, and so on. Meanwhile it is a real medicine. (L_39)</p>
               </disp-quote>The same use of language was adopted by the respondents when describing certain brand names of nasal decongestants.</p>
            <p>The respondents were found to trust the information provided by the doctor, if cooperation with the doctor was positively evaluated.
<disp-quote>
                  <p>I think that the paediatrician loves children and she listens to and understands the patient. (J_33)</p>
               </disp-quote>In several cases trust in the doctor’s advice was questioned, because it was observed that doctors have a tendency to favour certain medications. This often leads to the caregiver’s suspicion that physicians could be paid to promote the medicines of certain companies.
<disp-quote>
                  <p>Of course, it is not a secret that doctors have to suggest certain medicines and they are being reimbursed for that – for the promotion of these medicines. (N_28)</p>
               </disp-quote>It was frequently indicated that the problem in patient–doctor communication was the doctor’s own limited time to meet with a patient.
<disp-quote>
                  <p>Maybe this is because of their limited time for each patient (…), so to say ‘faster, faster’ (…) [she] hurries up somehow – when you enter her room, you have to figure out very quickly what you should ask in order to not forget anything. (L_28)</p>
               </disp-quote>Pharmacists were mostly evaluated to be a convenient source of information. The personal relationship between the pharmacist and patient, as well as the pharmacist’s attitude and personal opinion influenced the caregiver’s trust in the pharmacist’s suggestions.
<disp-quote>
                  <p>A splendid auntie, indeed! I rely on her suggestions. If she is not in the pharmacy, I try not to purchase any medicine (…). She is like a member of our family. (D_31)</p>
               </disp-quote>In several cases the lack of trust in the pharmacist’s advice was based on the perceived bias in the information that they provided to the caregiver.
<disp-quote>
                  <p>I hear only about this brand (…) also in pharmacies. I think there are good sales representatives, who have convinced everybody that this decongestant is the best, and so. (J_33)</p>
               </disp-quote>Trust in the opinions of the lay public (mainly relatives, friends, and the internet community) was a general characteristic of the respondents. This information was characterized as unbiased and objective. Having children of the same age enhanced trust in the opinions of others.
<disp-quote>
                  <p>I ask my friends. Similar problems, also small kids (…). What she has suggested, or what she says, yes, it has helped us, too. (E_34)</p>
               </disp-quote>The internet was characterized as a source that contained plenty of information. However, it was frequently noted that this source is not trustworthy enough, particularly if the health issues of children are addressed.
<disp-quote>
                  <p>As far as the medicines for children are concerned, I do not trust this source. I myself might fall for the bait and think – I might try the product. But for the child – no! (I_30)</p>
               </disp-quote>The lack of trust was explained by the variety and fragmented nature of information on the internet.
<disp-quote>
                  <p>It is not enough to read one source. Instead of reading one, it is necessary to read twenty more. (D_31)</p>
               </disp-quote>Caregivers mostly paid careful attention to PILs before using nasal decongestants in children. However, there is a tendency to read PILs when using the medicine for the first time and then to not re-read them in cases of repeated use. Generally, respondents trust the information provided by PILs, considering it to be objective, understandable, and helpful.
<disp-quote>
                  <p>Every source has its own opinion, and the information differs, I do not know what or whom I should trust. I only trust this instruction or whatever it is called. (J_31)</p>
               </disp-quote>However, there were claims that the information provided by PILs should be more concise. It was indicated that the information available for medicines users is too contradictory, too broad, and too fragmented to be able to find the right one. This makes it more complicated to make a decision or to evaluate a risk.
<disp-quote>
                  <p>If, say, I find several similar pieces of information, I will certainly trust it. But, if every source has its own content that differs, I do not know what to trust. (J_31)</p>
               </disp-quote>A sceptical opinion regarding the availability of unbiased and non-commercial medical information was dominant in the interviews.
<disp-quote>
                  <p>I think that the availability of independent information is limited. Let’s say, available is what the producers want to be available. (D_37)</p>

            <title>Emotions</title>
            <p>The perceived need for medicines in cases of minor childhood ailments is dictated by emotions and can be attributed to the empathy and moral duty of a caregiver to ‘do something for them [children]’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1367493512456108">Johnson and Helman, 2004</xref>: 101), or ‘to do the right thing’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1367493512456108">Neill, 2010</xref>: 333). Medicines possess not only a pharmacological, but also, a social efficiency. They are a means to fight illnesses, to demonstrate care, and to share ideas. A child’s illness is frequently perceived as a ‘moral obligation to seek medical care’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1367493512456108">Calnan, 1987</xref>: 151). Caregivers, especially parents, feel the need to act and to prove to themselves that they are being ‘a good parent’.</p>
            <p>The previous studies suggest that gendered roles are persistent if a child within the family experiences illness symptoms. Although fathers and other family members are often involved in decision-making, women usually bear more emotional responsibility that is described in everyday language as ‘mothers’ worry’ and ‘mothers’ guilt’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1367493512456108">Neill, 2010</xref>: 337–338). Women are perceived also by themselves and others as negligent if they fail to do something in the case of a child’s illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1367493512456108">Whyte et al., 2002</xref>). The aspect of social medication as a means of conforming the child’s behaviour to certain norms, including the comfort of a child or a caregiver, has frequently been attributed to the use of OTC medicines. This pattern has been named by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1367493512456108">Allotey, Reidpath and Elisha (2004</xref>: e381–e382) as a ‘pre-emptive treatment’ that is used to describe situations when medicine has been given for the purpose of comforting a child, rather than for the treatment of a disease. As disclosed by the present study, the perceived main benefit, arising from the use of these medicines, was the comfort and well-being of the child and the caregiver.</p>
         </sec>
         <sec id="section9-1367493512456108">
            <title>Perceived risk</title>
            <p>Studies suggest that caregivers’ knowledge about the risk of OTC medicines covers a wide range, varying from incomplete (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1367493512456108">Hughes et al., 2002</xref>) to a relatively good level of knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1367493512456108">Cuzzolin and Benoni, 2010</xref>: 97). The use of OTC medicines for minor ailments can be attributed to debates about the characteristics of a risk society – how people in the age of modernity reflect on possible risks. The study conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1367493512456108">Bissell et al. (2001</xref>) demonstrated that people tend to unconsciously think that medicines should be safe if they are sold in pharmacies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1367493512456108">Bissell et al., 2001</xref>). Users of medicines have a tendency to concentrate more on the benefits of OTC medicines than on their risks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1367493512456108">Bissell et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1367493512456108">Hibbert et al., 2002</xref>). In other words, ‘riskiness’ is not considered to be a central characteristic of non-prescription medicines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1367493512456108">Bissell et al., 2001</xref>: 23).</p>
            <p>There are some differences in respect to use of medicines in children. Several studies state that children are perceived to be more vulnerable towards risk than adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1367493512456108">Berry, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1367493512456108">Bradley and Blenkinsopp, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1367493512456108">Walter and Britten, 2002</xref>). This was confirmed by the present study – a number of caregivers had consulted several information sources prior to the decision-making in order to gather information about possible risks related to the use of these medicines. As a result, despite awareness of certain side-effects, caregivers were generally sure that the risk was considerably mitigated if use of the medicines was not prolonged.</p>
            <p>Several authors have remarked that, in general, perceptions of risk are influenced by individual characteristics such as previous experience and one’s personal belief system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1367493512456108">Walter and Britten, 2002</xref>). The present study also showed that repeated use of nasal decongestants in children was based upon the fact that their caregivers did not observe any side-effects when they had previously used these medicines, thereby obtaining additional proof of their non-riskiness. One more reason given for using decongestants, as disclosed by the current study, was the perceived potential risk of complications arising from rhinitis.</p>

         <sec id="section10-1367493512456108">
            <title>Trust in information sources</title>
            <p>The amount of information people face nowadays is extensive. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1367493512456108">Beck (1992</xref>) suggests that due to the enormous speed of dissemination of information it is now difficult to establish perceptions regarding risk and trust with any certainty. Uncertainty, the lack of sufficient evidence, and emotions place caregivers in a difficult situation in respect to decision-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1367493512456108">Austin, 2001</xref>: 58).</p>
            <p>In the context of risk perception, the influence of social relationships is very important. Risk perception is shaped and influenced by a number of different, often contradictory, agendas, including different sources of expert information – as well as information provided by lay people. Knowledge shaped by these sources often challenges the authority of the expert – also known as ‘official’ knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1367493512456108">Giddens, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1367493512456108">Grinyer, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1367493512456108">Williams et al., 1995</xref>). Lay people are becoming experts in risk evaluation. In order to become more capable, they gather a variety of information sources and ‘construct an informational basis (…) via an exchange of information’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1367493512456108">Scott and Freeman, 1995</xref>: 162). The present study has revealed that caregivers often double-check a doctor’s advice against other sources of information, including lay people who have children of approximately the same age. Their trust in the advice of experts has to be re-confirmed by lay experience and mutual negotiations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1367493512456108">Bissell et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
            <p>The quality of information is a crucial factor in making a decision about the usage of medicine. Information about use of medicines for a particular health problem should be clear and factual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1367493512456108">Austin, 2001</xref>). The respondents of the present study mentioned such criteria as comprehensibility, conciseness, and lack of bias. Cooperation with the advice-giver is proven to be important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1367493512456108">Austin, 2001</xref>: 58). The present study showed that personal attitude, devoted time and patient satisfaction are preconditions of trust in the advisor.</p>
            <p>Unbiased information helps one to make decisions by evaluating the potential risks against the potential benefits. However, information from commercials and product advertising always put an emphasis on the benefits of the products and stress the emotional and moral duty to alleviate the condition of a sick child, and convinces people that ‘a pill for every ill’ is needed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1367493512456108">Busfield, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1367493512456108">Whyte et al., 2002</xref>). Respondents frequently remarked that most information about medicine available for consumers is aimed at selling the medicine, thus maximizing the profits of the pharmaceutical companies. It was also revealed that commercial advertising strives to mitigate the risks associated with the use of nasal decongestants in children, by implying that certain nasal decongestants are `mild' and/or `more suitable for small children’.</p>

         <title>Conclusions</title>
         <p>The role of emotions in the decision-making process regarding the use of nasal decongestants in children is evident. Caregivers are driven by the empathy and perceived need to enhance the well-being of a child. The influence of emotions is frequently exploited by advertisements, reinforcing the conviction that every symptom of illness, including those of the common cold, has to be suppressed by medication. If a doctor’s advice is required in case of children’s rhinitis, the wish of a caregiver ‘to do something’ should be taken into account. Instead of suggesting nasal decongestants, alternative symptom-relieving means can be offered, for example, saline nasal drops, humidifiers and homeopathic medicines.</p>
         <p>According to the findings, caregivers using nasal decongestants in children put more emphasis on the benefits of these medicines – such as clear nose, comfort and reduced discharge. than on the perceived risks associated with the use of these medicines. There is also a belief that use of these medicines is unlikely to cause side-effects if usage is not prolonged. In order to stress the inappropriateness of these medicines for children and their lack of healing properties, it is necessary to provide information campaigns for healthcare professionals and users of medicines.</p>
         <p>The studies suggest that the information on risk is more useful if it is provided taking into account different lifestyle factors, community structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1367493512456108">Fainzang and Haxaire, 2011</xref>) and the actual knowledge level of the patient. ‘Tailored communication is more effective than general messages’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1367493512456108">Chetley et al., 2007</xref>: 27). Knowledge about the risk associated with the use of nasal decongestants is inconsistent in Latvia, therefore experts, such as doctors, pharmacists, and nurses, should be more proactive in educating their patients about the possible side-effects of nasal decongestants and in dispelling erroneous perceptions regarding the ability of these medications to provide a healing effect.</p>
         <p>A variety of information sources that offer fragmented information of varying quality may hinder risk evaluation and establishment of trust. It is not always necessary to ask for a doctor’s advice in the case of minor ailments, like children’s rhinitis. Therefore, it is essential to establish a non-commercial, interactive, and regularly updated internet source of information about medicine, including detailed information about side-effects, compatibility with different medicines, as well as other healthcare-related issues.</p>

            <title>Limitations of the study</title>
            <p>The number of cases included in the study is too limited for broader generalizations, and that was not the aim of the study. The qualitative method was chosen to select cases for problem investigation, and not to acquire any representative sample. Selection of the respondents was based on the single criterion – representation of different age groups of children up to the age of six. All the caregivers were middle- or upper-class women. Opinions of a more diversified sample (including different gender, age, occupation, nationality, residence) could have provided additional perspectives to the current study.</p>
