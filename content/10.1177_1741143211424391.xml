<p>Eagle-eyed readers may have spotted that this is the first issue of volume 40 of <italic>Educational Management Administration &amp; Leadership </italic>(<italic>EMAL</italic>). The journal was published for the first time in 1973, the year after its parent body, the British Educational Leadership, Management and Administration Society (BELMAS) was founded. Both organizations have adapted to the changing nomenclature of the field. The journal began as <italic>Educational Administration</italic>, became <italic>Educational Management &amp; Administration</italic>, and adopted its present name in 2004. The September issue (volume 40(5)) will be a Special Edition to celebrate the 40th anniversary, with review papers by leading academics.</p>
<p>The old adage, ‘life begins at 40’, seems to apply to <italic>EMAL</italic>. BELMAS has recently renewed its contract with SAGE Publications, on favourable terms. Submissions are at an all-time high, with more than 170 in the past 12 months. The success of the journal has been acknowledged by its inclusion in the prestigious Index of Social Sciences, published by Thomson Reuters, backdated to 2009. These achievements owe much to the work of the Editorial Board, to our colleagues at SAGE, and to all referees and authors, without whom the journal could not flourish.</p>
<p>The first article in this issue, by Jacky Lumby and Jan Heystek, presents a comparative study of diversity in South Africa and England. The authors note that the United Nations anticipates intensifying diversity among nations and report that some schools in both countries have experienced ‘dramatic demographic change’. They also comment that changes in the ethnic diversity of pupils have not been matched by equivalent changes in the profile of leaders or educators, who remain overwhelmingly white in both countries. Drawing on interviews with leaders in two primary schools, one in each country, they conclude that staff do not regard their ethnicity as an issue, and that ‘the local community exerts no detectable pressure to shift attitudes towards white privilege’.</p>
<p>In the second article, Panayiotis Angelides examines the relationship between leadership and inclusive education, drawing on data from Cyprus. He notes that many authors consider the role of leaders to be significant in developing inclusive education. The author gathered survey data from four schools, purposively sampled because he believed that they had inclusive practices and inclusive leadership. The data suggest that forms of leadership that support inclusion are not static and were context-specific. He concludes that leadership for school inclusion requires leaders to listen and to take student views into account.</p>
<p>Shirley Yeung Sze Yin, in the third article, explores the school evaluation policy in Hong Kong, focusing specifically on the views of curriculum leaders. She links evaluation to accountability and refers to the ‘high stakes accountability systems’ prevalent in many countries. She outlines the recent history of school evaluation in Hong Kong and reports on a survey of curriculum leaders in primary schools, conducted using questionnaires and interviews. She concludes that the evaluation policy in Hong Kong is linked mainly to bureaucratic accountability with elements of market accountability. </p>
<p>The next article features a discussion of the Primary Strategy Learning Networks (PSLNs) in England, by Tessa Moore and Desmond Rutherford. This policy was introduced by the former Labour government but the authors comment that the strategy was not evidence based. Drawing on data from interviews with heads in two PSLNs, and from observations, the authors note the benefits and challenges of the initiative and conclude that these networks have many positive features but that successful implementation of this, and similar initiatives, requires the active engagement of classroom teachers. </p>
<p>The final three articles all provide insights into aspects of leadership in Australian universities. Debbie Richards examines the student perspective on leadership for learning, drawing on an online survey of 85 students of computing in one university, with 54 replies. She reports that students identified self-organizing skills, and inter-personal empathy, as the most important leadership capabilities. She concludes that students seeing their teacher as a leader has a positive impact on their learning.</p>
<p>The next article, by Tricia Vilkinas and Richard Ladyshewsky, focuses on the leadership behaviour and effectiveness of academic program directors (APDs) in Australia. They note the paucity of research on academic leaders below head of department level and stress that APDs are ‘front line’ managers who play a significant role in learning and teaching. They report on a survey of 91 APDs at four Australian universities’ linked to a 360-degree process with ‘significant others’ identified by the participants. The ‘significant others’ rated APD effectiveness slightly higher than the incumbents. The authors conclude that APDs are the ‘bridge between the multiple stakeholders involved in teaching and learning in universities’.</p>
<p>The final article also features Richard Ladyshewsky, with Helen Flavell, and examines the transfer of learning from an academic leadership program for course coordinators, the same program from which respondents were drawn for the survey that underpinned the previous article. The authors note that transfer of learning to the organization can be problematic. They interviewed 10 participants and note that they had enhanced confidence and leadership skills as a result of the program. They conclude that there was ‘some evidence’ that the program produced enduring changes in learned behaviour.</p>
<p>This issue of the journal features papers from five countries, further emphasizing the global significance of educational leadership as a field of research and practice.</p>
