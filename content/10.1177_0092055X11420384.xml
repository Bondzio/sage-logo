<p>The title of this documentary, <italic>Power and Control: Domestic Violence in America</italic>, is borrowed from one of the guiding principles of the Domestic Abuse Intervention Project, which was created in Duluth, Minnesota, by Ellen Pence and her colleagues in the 1980s. The Duluth Model, as the project became known, is described as fomenting revolutionary changes in the way that domestic violence was understood and handled by service providers, law enforcement, and the court system. The premise of this film is to examine the conceptual and practical roots of the Duluth Model and to review the more recent critiques of this approach. Viewers are introduced to the model, which required the system to address domestic violence more proactively, through interviews with some of the original advocates and creators and from the unfolding story of Kim and Josh Mosher and their children.</p>
<p>The documentary opens with Kim Mosher and her children adjusting to life at the Safe Haven shelter in Duluth. Kim, who is employed at a local McDonald’s restaurant, reveals a first-person account of her experience of being physically, emotionally, and sexually bullied and abused by her husband. Her children have also been subject to verbal and physical abuse from Josh. After a series of violent episodes, Kim decided to leave the family home with her children and be admitted to the shelter. Life in the shelter is presented realistically, that is, as safe and clean but also transitional and unsettling. The documentary follows Kim for several months as she is able to relocate to public housing, participate in counseling, and eventually reunite with her husband. Josh Mosher also speaks about his abusive actions, the child rearing to which he was subject, and his efforts to change his behavior toward Kim and their children.</p>
<p>The fundamental components of the Duluth Model are based on the premise that violence against women is a direct consequence of patriarchal institutions that empower and privilege men over women. As a feminist project, the program is designed to make visible the intimate violence and abuse that had been considered an acceptable, or at least inevitable, aspect of domestic life. A tool frequently used by the counselors and caseworkers, the Power and Control Wheel, summarizes the interpersonal dynamics that women can typically experience in abusive relationships. Men who are privileged by the social structure will use a variety of tactics, including social isolation, emotional abuse, threats, coercion, verbal abuse, and intimidation, to exercise control over women and children. The patriarchal nature of social institutions allows these dynamics to either be denied or justified as a legitimate expression of male superiority. Hence, women who are battered have little cultural, social, or economic recourse to end these relationships.</p>
<p>The documentary focuses in detail on two of the better known innovations: (1) mandatory arrest policies and (2) counseling programs for men who have battered. Both practices are intended not only to protect individual women who are being battered but also to redefine male violence against women as criminal and deviant behavior. Interviews and statements from law enforcement officers, legal advocates, and men in treatment groups are used to explain the impact of these practices. The testimony and analysis from these individuals reinforce the perspective that domestic and other forms of violence are institutionalized practices related to maintaining status and power.</p>
<p>The documentary concludes with a review of the criticisms of the Duluth Model and of the underlying feminist, social constructionist perspective. Several interviews with those identified as “prominent academics” and leaders of men’s rights groups are used to present what is described as a social-psychological-health perspective of domestic violence. Brief statements in the film from scholars such as Murray Straus, Richard Gelles, and Donald Dutton seem to suggest that they have jettisoned gender and power as salient issues. In addition, pioneer advocate Erin Pizzey states that she never intended to address domestic violence as a “gender issue.” Rejoinders to these statements are provided by Ellen Pence and other activists, who voice a continued strong commitment to the role that institutionalized patriarchy plays in fostering violence against women and to the feminist sisterhood that created and sustained the battered women’s movement.</p>
<p>This documentary provides a rich view of one of the groundbreaking programs in domestic violence intervention. However, only more advanced students may be able to appreciate the complex history and controversies presented. Although personal stories are used well to explain the emotional, physical, and social impact of family violence, students in introductory classes may have trouble assimilating the complex conceptual issues related to institutionalized patriarchy, social constructionism, and feminist criticism. The weakest part of the documentary, the presentations of the criticism of “prominent academics,” could lead students to resist giving the feminist model serious consideration. For example, the comments of Straus and Gelles suggest that approaches such as the Duluth Model (1) ignore the violence that is perpetrated by women against other family members and (2) are engaged primarily in advocacy and ideological work, which have no place in designing intervention programs. The responses to these statements are rather brief and simply reiterate the premise that as a primarily feminist project the Duluth Model is attempting to assist victims and generate fundamental social changes. Students who do not have a sufficient background in family violence literature and the history of the battered women’s movement will have difficulty with these debates.</p>
<p>Another caution is warranted regarding the need for familiarity with the work of family violence theorists and researchers. The statements included in the documentary present an extremely abbreviated view of these works and a general sense that gender and patriarchy have been deemed irrelevant. Although there is much to debate about the academic analysis presented in this film, the recent work of some of these researchers does not seem to have rejected the connections between gender, power, and control and family violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0092055X11420384">Loseke, Gelles, and Cavanaugh 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0092055X11420384">Straus, Gelles, and Steinmetz 2006</xref>). Students will need to explore this literature to appreciate thoroughly the debates portrayed in this film.</p>
<p>Despite these caveats, <italic>Power and Control: Domestic Violence in America</italic> provides a compelling account of personal experiences with family violence as well as a review of the issues related to intervention. It can serve as a supplemental resource for advanced courses that address gender, feminism, and/or family violence. Rich discussions can be generated around the legal, social, and theoretical controversies regarding the analysis and response to violence in intimate settings. Other important issues regarding the intersection of social movements, advocacy, ideology, and academic research can also be raised for discussion. Instructors who are interested in using the documentary should consult the film’s Web site (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.powerandcontrolfilm.com">http://www.powerandcontrolfilm.com</ext-link>). More extensive footage and transcripts of the interviews and more details on the Duluth Model and the battered women’s movement are available. Hence, with adequate preparation and background, students and instructors can use this documentary to initiate a thorough and compelling exploration of family violence.</p>
