<abstract>
<p>This article explores how discursive repertories about black masculinity inform the construction of white masculinity in two settings assumed diametrically opposed: white nationalists and white antiracists. Drawing from in-depth semi-structured interviews, year-long ethnographic field notes, and content analysis from two nationwide white nationalist and white antiracist organizations, the author finds three common discursive frames to saturate both groups’ discourse: black male dysfunctionalism, paternalistic surveillance of black masculinity, and the patriarchal protection of femininity from black masculinity. Through these shared patterns, both groups rationalize essentialist, racist, and unequal social relations and thus reproduce white masculine identity as normative, functional, and superior.</p>

<p>Literary critic Keith Clark once wrote, “The black male body serves an array of conflicting social and cultural functions. . . . Inexorably, American culture has trafficked in the black male body” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0891241611431580">2001</xref>, 201). In manifold settings throughout the United States, black men hold a tenuous and contested position. The critical digestion of the fictional Bigger Thomas, media spectacles surrounding Michael “Air” Jordan and Tiger Woods, and the momentous election of Barack Obama, highlight the formation, function, and future of control over black masculinity in divergent public spheres. Moreover, white men largely “traffic” in discourse about black men. One may witness two cogent sites of such discursive control that bookend the political spectrum—white nationalists and white antiracists. In this article, I compare these two seemingly antithetical sites of white male discourse and seek to answer the following question: how do discourses about black men simultaneously constrain and enable the construction of white masculinities across different, even antithetical, settings?</p>
<p>Through a fourteen-month ethnographic examination of a white nationalist organization I call “National Equality for All” (NEA) and a white antiracist organization I call “Whites for Racial Justice” (WRJ), this article provides evidence of strikingly similar white male discourse about black masculinity. While clear political differences between these two groups subsist, they rely on strikingly similar discursive repertoires about black men in order to construct their white male selves. Against this backdrop, I read the framing of black masculinity not as narratives merely descriptive of race and gender but as discursive repertoires that guide the construction of white masculinities. Dominant stories about black men frame the racialized and gendered meanings of the white masculine subjects who speak that discourse. Plainly said, “Identity is achieved in and through talk” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0891241611431580">Maynard and Peräkylä 2006</xref>, 244).</p>

<title>Discourse and White Masculine Identity Formation</title>
<p>The scrutiny of racial discourse and white masculine identity represents a prescient intersection in modern research. To <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0891241611431580">Foucault (2003</xref>, 61), discourse does not merely describe race but creates it. Discourse serves as a technique for fragmenting human populations into “naturally” dominant and subordinate “superrace” and “subrace” categories (of note, Foucault considered “race” to include categories of gender, sexuality, and ability). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0891241611431580">Van Dijk’s (2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0891241611431580">2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0891241611431580">2004</xref>) vast oeuvre verifies Foucault’s contention: discourse forms racial identity. As applied to gender, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0891241611431580">Wodok (1997)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0891241611431580">Talbot (1998)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0891241611431580">Goddard and Patterson (2000)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0891241611431580">Litosseliti and Sunderland (2002)</xref> all draw on Foucault’s claim that we should not so much examine the specificity of word use in a given context as the ways in which discourse constrains and enables the emergence of gendered identities.</p>
<p>A diverse and international cadre of scholars have done well to interrogate the contextual specifics that link discourse, race, and gender across the globe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0891241611431580">Goodman and Burke 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0891241611431580">Reisigl and Wodak 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0891241611431580">Riggs and Augoustinos 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0891241611431580">Steyn and Foster 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0891241611431580">Winn and Rubin 2001</xref>). Specific to a U.S. context, a hefty portion of scholarship examines how white male college students engage in racial and gender identity management by navigating politically correct discourse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0891241611431580">Bonilla-Silva 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0891241611431580">Bonilla-Silva and Forman 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0891241611431580">Foster 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0891241611431580">Masser and Abrams 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0891241611431580">Myers and Williamson 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to data on white male college students, the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0891241611431580">Hill (2008)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0891241611431580">Myers (2005)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0891241611431580">Eliasoph (1999)</xref> examines the public and everyday strategies by which racialized and gendered discourse enables privileged actors to “make their world more coherent and comprehensible . . . and promote their sense of privilege and well-being” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0891241611431580">Hill 2008</xref>, 34). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0891241611431580">Feagin and O’Brien (2003</xref>, 11) find that the “discourse generated by ordinary whites becomes societally important only when it is incorporated into the umbrella ideology.” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0891241611431580">Feagin (2010</xref>, 3, 6) describes this umbrella ideology as a “white racial frame” that encompasses “racial ideas, terms, images, emotions and interpretations [which] . . . aggressively rationalizes” racial oppression and white supremacy. The discursive tool of blackness, particularly black masculinity, has “long functioned as a key metaphor and fundamental referent for white Americans in public discourse” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0891241611431580">Feagin 2010</xref>, 101).</p>
<p>Despite recent advances in the literature, several gaps remain. First, this corpus remains sufficiently bifurcated. On one hand, substantial work falls into the “constructionist” camp that emphasizes the emergent properties of racial and gender identity within specific discursive interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0891241611431580">Eliasoph 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0891241611431580">Hill 2008</xref>). On the other hand, the “critical” camp examines discursive strategies for blaming nonwhites for social problems while protecting and excusing white attitudes and behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0891241611431580">Bonilla-Silva 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0891241611431580">Bonilla-Silva and Forman 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0891241611431580">Picca and Feagin 2007</xref>). I synthesize the two in order to examine actors as both producers and products of discourse.</p>
<p>The second major gap in the literature concerns data and methodology. The extant literature centers on interview analysis, surveys, content analysis of public media, and the discursive patterns endemic to local institutional arrangements. Such public talk constitutes words carefully shared with outsiders and subject to “social desirability” bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0891241611431580">Myers 2005</xref>). We have yet to sufficiently tease out how discourse and identity formation work when scrutinized via the temporal length and contextual depth afforded by ethnographic methodologies. Ethnographic methods may reduce the effects of social desirability through the development of researcher/subject trust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0891241611431580">Crowley 2007</xref>), verification of statements through triangulation and aggregation of diffuse data points, standpoints, and methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0891241611431580">Burawoy 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0891241611431580">Jenness 2010</xref>), and the generation of research depth and explanatory mechanisms opposed to generalizability and predictability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0891241611431580">Homans 1967</xref>).</p>
<p>The third aspect concerns the assumption of speakers’ intent. Prior scholarship has done well to illuminate the means by which actors directly and implicitly attempt domination in specific social structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0891241611431580">Foster 2009</xref>, 686). Structuralist work of this type—either of the conflict or functionalism/utilitarian variant—rests on an important assumption: that white males <italic>intentionally</italic> wield raced and gendered language. Rather than empirically verify or falsify intent or motivation—such arguments entail theoretical leaps and assumptions about the content of the mental “black box”—I contend that discourse can rationalize and glorify the pursuit of a particular, idealized, white male identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0891241611431580">Hughey 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0891241611431580">2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The notion of an ideal or “hegemonic” form of white masculinity traces to both <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0891241611431580">Connell’s (1995)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0891241611431580">Lewis’s (2004)</xref> work on “hegemonic masculinity” and “hegemonic whiteness,” respectively. Both authors denote how, in any given historical moment, specific performances of masculinity and whiteness become dominant. Explicit and implicit cultural messages about <italic>who</italic> authentic white men are, and expectations for <italic>how</italic> they should behave, together structure identity formation. While the concept of hegemonic identity has been critiqued (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0891241611431580">Demetriou 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0891241611431580">Wetherell and Edley 1999</xref>), I do not refer to it as a proxy for measuring static ideologies or abstract values. I employ the concept to reference the shared sets of social expectations and accountabilities linked to categories of meaningful difference (like race and gender) that we occupy. Michael <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0891241611431580">Schwalbe (2008</xref>, 171) writes:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Often when we’re called into account, it’s as a member of a group or social category. And usually this is because we’re not behaving the way someone thinks we should, as a member of that group or category. We are thus vulnerable to being ignored, discredited, shamed, or otherwise punished for behaving in a way that others deem wrong in light of who we claim to be or who they think we are. One way to put it is to say that identities carry accountability obligations.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The cultivation of adherence to identity-related expectations constrains and enables the contestation and reproduction of material realities.</p>
<p>“Hegemonic” or an ideal white racial identity represents a configuration of practices that simultaneously produce and maintain white racial identity cohesion and difference in two main ways: through positioning those marked as “white” as essentially different from, and superior to, those marked as “nonwhite” and through marginalizing practices of whiteness that fail to meet and exemplify racial expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0891241611431580">Hughey 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0891241611431580">2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0891241611431580">forthcoming a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0891241611431580">forthcoming b</xref>). In relation to masculinity’s place within the framework of “hegemonic whiteness,” white men generally hold a closer proximity to the white racial ideal by relying upon, and reproducing, entrenched gendered distinctions and inequalities that already privilege and venerate supposedly “masculine” traits. Gendered differences, often thought natural and essential, serve as potent material and symbolic resources for reconstructing intrawhite distinctions of “ideal” and “lesser-than.” In this sense, white male speech acts provide a “‘rational’ subject position by strategically working up their views as reasonable . . . in order to position themselves as decent, moral, reasonable citizens” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0891241611431580">Every and Augoustinos 2007</xref>, 412), while challengers to such “rational” discourse risk subordination within racial in-group interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0891241611431580">Myers and Williamson 2001</xref>, 22).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0891241611431580">1</xref></sup></p>

<title>Why White Nationalists and White Antiracists?</title>
<p>Some scholars point to a growing “culture war” characterized by political and ideological bifurcation within the white population of the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0891241611431580">Winant 2004</xref>). The antagonism between “racists” and “antiracists” stands as a key site for this supposed fracture. Moreover, the recent mainstreaming of both white nationalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0891241611431580">Daniels 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0891241611431580">Dobratz 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0891241611431580">Levitas 2002</xref>) and white antiracism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0891241611431580">Bonnett 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0891241611431580">Hughey 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0891241611431580">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0891241611431580">O’Brien 2001</xref>) signal an implicit acceptance of this white racial division.</p>
<p>Drawing from this trend, many agree that different contexts refract white masculinity into a constantly changing and morphing identity. The recent work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0891241611431580">Winant (2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0891241611431580">2004</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0891241611431580">Connell (1995)</xref> emphasize that <italic>whitenesses</italic> and <italic>masculinities</italic> together resemble a bifurcated political spectrum. This political fracturing results from the changing relations of men and whites to patriarchy, white supremacy, and a substantial “backlash” to antiracism and feminism. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0891241611431580">Winant (2004</xref>, 12) writes:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Existing racial projects can be classified along a political spectrum, according to explicit criteria drawn from the meaning each project attaches to “whiteness.” . . . Focusing on five key racial projects, which I term, far right, new right, neoconservative, neoliberal, and new abolitionist.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0891241611431580">Connell (1995</xref>, 85) writes:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Masculinities are reconfigured around this crisis tendency both through conflict over strategies of legitimation, and through men’s divergent responses to feminism. . . . While the tension leads some men to the cults of masculinity . . . , it leads others to support feminist reforms.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>While such an understanding of white masculinities can assist the examination of overt <italic>political</italic> differences in raced and gendered groups, it assumes little overlap in the discursive constructions of the world and themselves. The comparative examination of nationalists and antiracists provides a cogent opportunity to refine our understanding of the reach of dominant discourse and its relationship to racial and gender identity formation.</p>

<title>Of Whites and Men: Data, Methods, and Setting</title>
<p>I contacted both the white nationalist organization “National Equality for All” (NEA) and the white antiracist organization “Whites for Racial Justice” (WRJ) (all names pseudonyms) in the early spring of 2006. I identified both because of their growing membership and relative proximity to one another. After multiple phone and electronic communiques between myself and group leadership, meetings in which members interviewed me, my full disclosure as a sociologist, and the offer of IRB-sanctioned confidentiality, I was allowed to attend meetings, interview members, and access their documents and literature. For little more than one year (May 2006-June 2007), I spent at least one day a week with either or both of the headquartered members of NEA and WRJ. I triangulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0891241611431580">Downward and Mearman 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0891241611431580">Olson 2004</xref>) the data via (1) ethnographic fieldwork (I attended fifty-eight meetings in total, including; thirty-one with NEA, and twenty-seven with WRJ), (2) forty-five semi-structured in-depth interviews with members, and (3) content analysis inclusive of newsletter issues, flyers, and any additional textual information such as emails and office memos.</p>
<p>After entrée, both groups still viewed me with suspicion. I was highly aware that as white male sociologist, members of both NEA and WRJ understood me as simultaneous insider and outsider. I approached such ambiguity as opportunities to engage in critical and controversial discussions. Throughout this process, I was careful to reiterate my personal beliefs, interests, experiences, and position as a researcher in relation to white racial identity, so as neither to mislead the members nor create an ethnographic “blind spot” by which involvement might cause me to lose critical distance. After time, my data slowly morphed from resistant and cross-armed white men muttering one-word responses to my questions at their headquartered offices into invitations to eat dinner at members’ homes where they opened themselves to my queries.</p>
<p>Both groups were male dominated in their headquartered chapters. WRJ claimed to possess relatively equal gender demographics amid their national membership. NEA’s overwhelmingly male headquarters reflected their male-dominated membership. Given this dynamic, I was attentive to both the tone and timbre of discourse when the few female NEA or WRJ members entered or left a room, as well as how members received my own white masculine practice. Regardless of organization or gender, most members claimed to join because of personal friendships with other members and/or because of deep-seated frustrations with the current state of “race relations.” Both groups understood themselves as enlightened and conscious white actors, doing exactly what white people should do in a world increasingly hailed “postracial.”</p>
<sec id="section4-0891241611431580">
<title>National Equality for All</title>
<p>NEA is a nationwide “white nationalist” organization that came into being in the early 1980s. The headquarters is located in a mid-Atlantic city I call “Riverside.” There are more than twenty chapters throughout the United States, and they claim a roll of more than five hundred members. Twenty-four “part-time” volunteers make up their headquarters. All identified themselves with pride and exuberance as “white.” NEA members explicitly advocate a racial definition of the nation-state, so that racial groups segregate from one another with separate social institutions, customs, and limited interactions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0891241611431580">2</xref></sup></p>

<p>The headquarters for WRJ is located just a couple hours’ drive from Riverside in another metropolitan area I call “Fairview.” WRJ, which began work in the 1970s, has developed into a nationwide organization of more than thirty chapters with a membership of approximately eight hundred. All twenty-one members of the headquarters-chapter consider themselves white. WRJ generates publications, gives workshops, and promotes media events about what white people can do to eliminate racism from both their daily lives and from the social structures that surround them (education, religion, family, and employment).</p>

<title>Identifying Discourses of White Masculine Identity Formation</title>
<p>Actors carry a socially shared “definition of the situation.” My understanding of identity-making discourse aligns with the notion that “those who are in the situation ordinarily do not <italic>create</italic> [emphasis in original] this situation, even though their society often can be said to do so; ordinarily, all they do is to assess correctly what the situation ought to be for them and then act accordingly” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0891241611431580">Goffman 1974</xref>, 1-2). Social situations often take the form of “relatively bounded sets of arguments organized around a specific diagnosis or solution to some social problem” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0891241611431580">Ellingson 1995</xref>, 107). The defining of solutions and problems within particular discursive situations includes three specific characteristics: (1) clearly defined casts of characters, (2) demarcations of particular characters as active or passive, and (3) the narrative arrangement of those characters into causal relationships. NEA and WRJ members often identified black men, white men, and white women as central characters, demarcated black men as dynamic and dangerous social actors, and framed black masculine actions as primary causes of harmful social problems related to violence, poverty, and transgressive interracial gendered and sexualized interactions.</p>
<p>My production of coding categories was twofold. First, categories derived from the sociological literature on white male identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0891241611431580">Bucholtz 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0891241611431580">Kimmel and Ferber 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0891241611431580">Robinson 2000</xref>). Second, based on a pilot study with a multiracial, antiracist student organization in which discussions of black men often devolved into stereotypes about supposed pathologies and dysfunctions that mirrored white nationalist discourse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0891241611431580">Hughey 2007</xref>), the possibility of discursive similarities between NEA and WRJ informed the creation of categories. However, as the ethnographic studies of NEA and WRJ began, the analysis consisted of reflexive movement between concept development, sampling, data collection, data coding, data analysis, and interpretation—a staple of ethnographic inquiry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0891241611431580">Burawoy 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>In specific to this study and research question, I coded only those frames that related to black masculinity. Given that the members of NEA and WRJ had few interactions with black men, interviews with select members and content analysis limit the data. My unit of analysis is every paragraph of discourse, whether transcribed interviews, newsletters and flyers, or emails, and memos. Each unit was coded (0 = no, 1 = yes) for the presence of themes. To access reliability, an independent research assistant coded a random sample of the data from August to December 2009. The research assistant had no knowledge of my prior coding results.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0891241611431580">3</xref></sup></p>

<title>NEA and the hyper-violent threat of black men</title>
<p>NEA members often employed a discourse characterized by fear of, and control over, black men they found <italic>inherently</italic> criminal-prone. Accordingly, most members resided in largely segregated neighborhoods, refused to let their children hold interracial friendships, and believed in a genetic explanation to black violence. As Franklin (thirty-seven years old, sales associate, five years in NEA) explained:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Biological differences explain much of today’s racial conflict. . . . Genetics makes clear that there is a connection between race and intelligence where the more melanin you have the less intelligent you are, you know, the less mental capacity you possess. . . . DNA and genetics are proving what we knew all along really. Blacks, Hispanics, darker-skinned people are more aggressive and dangerous. . . . It’s not racist, it’s a fact.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Many of NEA’s publications focus on “factual” race and crime statistics. For example, NEA members often cited their own “studies” regarding the extraordinarily high black male incarceration rate. These members often told me that black men’s “natural” predilection to violent crime and illicit drug use caused their growing rate of imprisonment. In addressing these claims, I responded that rates for violent crime among blacks have declined over the past four decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0891241611431580">BJS 2007</xref>), and that serious pro-white biases drive unequal sentencing rates, particularly amid drug cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0891241611431580">Reiman 2004</xref>, 134). In hearing these retorts, NEA members became incredibly defensive. For example, Harry (thirty-seven years old, lawyer, six years in NEA) harshly rebuked me:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>No, black people, Mexicans, et cetera are poor and have low education because they are black. . . . The violence that is hardwired in them prevents them from getting advanced educations. . . . Sure you have exceptions, but overall, I mean, no, you’re just trying to explain away the reality of the situation that black people are more violent than whites. . . . White people just don’t carry on like that. Our culture reflects our biology.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<speech>
<speaker>MWH:</speaker>
<p>So, white people, like you and your fellow members, are just biologically superior?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Harry:</speaker>
<p>Not just biologically, culturally. Maybe it’s not all that much, but it’s enough to keep us out of jail. We just know how to act right.</p>
</speech>
<p>By way of another example, NEA members discussed an article they planned to publish in their national newsletter. After providing statistics on the propensity of blacks to commit violent crime, they agreed that more “layperson” examples should be included. Adam (thirty-four years old, consultant, six years in NEA) stated:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I mean, there’s plenty of examples really. . . . Mike Tyson and all his rapes of those women, he was a monster. . . . Then of course there’s O.J. [Simpson] and all of his foolishness . . . from killing Nicole to that crazy chase in L.A. . . . Oh yeah, Kobe Bryant, . . . he raped that girl in Colorado. Black athletes are a goldmine for that shit. . . . I just need to go back and look through the paper over the past month or so and I’m sure I’ll find a few more to give it some local context.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Cultural and biological rationales for racial inequality rest at the heart of the white nationalist enterprise. These justifications provide a firm foundation for the discursive construction of normal and superior white selves.</p>
<p>Moreover, members interpreted other white men’s lack of belief in this narrative as evidence of their inferior or lesser abilities; they were framed as wanting in relation to the white ideal. For example, in evoking a particularly charged narrative replete with eugenics-based logic, Albert (fifty-eight years old, plumber, six years in NEA) told me that black men were</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>either sissies, you know, or like whiners and complainers who just want hand-outs because they’re too lazy. . . . Slavery bred them that way, I guess. They come from house or field slaves. That’s my theory. So they’re either spoiled or savage. . . . White people who don’t understand this basic difference, they are just fooling themselves and are completely asleep at the wheel. It’s just irrational, you know?</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<speech>
<speaker>MWH:</speaker>
<p>“What do you mean by asleep or irrational?”</p>
</speech>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It’s lots of white people, especially white men who have lost touch with who they are and their role as leaders in this messed up society. It’s connected. If you think your wife should tell you what to do and you think blacks are really mentally equal, you, you just have been, well, you know? You’ve just been brainwashed. . . . Real men, white men, should stand up and take back control of their homes and their communities. That’s all we’re [NEA are] trying to do. . . . It’s just a rational, conscious thing. . . . White men that don’t see it, at least to me, they aren’t really real men.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As Albert makes clear, members’ social adherence to the anti–black male narratives form boundaries that demarcate the “real” white men from those that lack in racial and gendered authenticity.</p>
<p>My own interactions with NEA members indicate how intragender and racial boundaries easily emerge to make categorical distinctions and judgments. My social positioning as a white male sociologist thought both “politically correct” and “liberal” led many NEA members to confront me as a “white man lost.” Mason (thirty years old, assistant manager, three years in NEA) told me in an interview:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I used to be just like you, I did. I think you’re just kind of lost now. . . . I wanted to believe that with enough social engineering that we could make the country a harmonious place, that we could have a real equality. It’s an attractive and seductive proposition, I know. It still kind of pulls at my heart. . . . I mean no offence, but really, I can show you biological evidence that refutes any claim for racial equality. . . . Black men are violent . . . especially in regard to sexual violence . . . you can’t fight your genes, you know?</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A longstanding racist discourse equates black men with hypermasculine criminality. Although this narrative is less overt today, it saturates the discursive construction of a hegemonic or ideal form of white masculinity. Loyalty to this narrative rewards white men with symbolic capital that stands as the leitmotif in intraracial and gender boundary making between ideal and less-than-ideal white men.</p>

<title>WRJ and the “culture of poverty,” reloaded</title>
<p>WRJ holds frequent evening “educational sessions” in which members attend classes and seminars about the effects of racism. At one such meeting, Malcolm (forty-four years old, consultant/counselor, five years in WRJ) said to the seven people in attendance:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Racism has hidden costs. . . . We as whites are often taught not to see it, and to acknowledge it only when it is most blatant and in your face. . . . Well, what happens when racism has an effect you are not expecting? Maybe one that is so subtle to you that you don’t see it. What if racism also works on gender relations? On people’s very notions of gender identity? . . . What might seem normal in that area might be the effect of racism.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>During this educational session, Malcolm reiterated the point that racism had effectively reversed the “natural order” of black gender relations to the point that most black men were now “emasculated.” Malcolm continued:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Black men today are an effect of years of oppression, . . . of having to see their women and children taken from them, of not being allowed to be the man of their household, of constantly being told to call white boys a fraction of their age “sir,” while they were in turn called “boy” . . . the legacy of such degradations have not allowed black men to become men. (<italic>long pause</italic>) Some of you might think that black men are dangerous and destructive, violent criminals and what not. Many are. But how would you respond? Would you steal and do what you had to do to survive . . . would you do it if pressed by your family to support them. . . . How would you respond to a society that says you are little more than a boy, I think you might do some childish things.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Genetically conditioned violent black men represent a potent symbol against which NEA members construct their white male selves, while WRJ members frame black men as dysfunctional due to racism and a naturally upset gender order. The crucial similarity between these two worldviews center on a white supremacist vision of black men (regardless of the biological or cultural cause) as deficient, inferior, and violent opposed to white men as the antithesis of such behavior. The following two quotations from Philip (fifty-three years old, grocery store owner, five years in WRJ) and Franklin (thirty-seven years old, sales associate, five years in NEA) illuminates more clearly the interorganizational similarity. Philip told me:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Discrimination against blacks, reinforced by prejudicial media messages and unfair policies, creates a reality for blacks that is so ugly and violent that some whites are scared of their own creation. I think this then goes on to reinforce those stereotypes . . . but of course, this is the way that whites designed the system. . . . I’ve read Marx too, and you have to be more structural. . . . I think we try to show to others how harsh racism is, you know the material realities of things. The fact is that many fears by whites are realistic because of how we have treated blacks. If people are treated terribly they will become terrible. Now we may not like to admit that, but look at drugs and crime. Those are black things. If I get scared when a bunch of black boys walk down my street should I be scared, and if I am, am I racist? I’m not sure, but I do think that it’s logical to assume that black boys are more dangerous than white boys.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>NEA member Franklin explained:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Sure there is racism against blacks, it’s against whites too. But you don’t see whites running around shooting each other and getting high all the time. If prejudice really had that much of a social effect you would see it on both sides. Blacks can’t help it. . . . They are not as intelligent or moral, and it’s unfair of us to expect them to be. Racial conflict is going to happen, prejudice is going to happen, . . . that’s natural. But that this happens everywhere and white succeed and blacks fail, well, that’s a social experiment right there for you (<italic>laughing</italic>), the conclusions are right there. Whites are clearly superior and we deserve our own space. Maybe with time, if blacks had their own space and environment, that would somehow stabilize, but probably not much, it is biological.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The frames of a white antiracist with a quasi-Marxist understanding of racial inequalities (in which black boys morph into a lumpen-proletariat group of violent thugs because of the atrocities that the white bourgeoisie enforced upon them) and a white nationalist that argues blacks are naturally prone to criminal activity are similar. The white men in both groups make sense of black pathologies in ways that leave white, patriarchal, and North American conceptions of gender and race as pure and normalized.</p>
<p>WRJ members often reified the image of a predatory black male thug when trying to recruit new members and/or rationalize the necessity of WRJ activism to a mainstream that increasingly understands the world as “postracial.” The trope of violent and criminal black men provides the necessary “commonsense” rationale for antiracist activism. Whites emerge as the parties responsible for ending racism and “fixing” the pathological condition of black men. During a WRJ recruitment meeting with more than twenty interested men and women, Michael (thirty-six years old, Banker, four and a half years in WRJ) stated:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>We have to atone for the racism of our ancestors and for the prejudice we all carry within ourselves today. . . . Functionally, we have to fight racism because the continued presence of racial inequality in the world makes all our communities, but especially black communities, dangerous places filled with strained and angry men who cannot get jobs, cannot have dignity as men, and who then turn their violence on their families or simply become violent in their absence. That is, they are absent fathers and husbands, leaving women in the unfair position of having to fend for themselves. . . . There are too many black matriarchs today . . . such a situation is both <italic>immoral and unnatural</italic> [my emphasis]. . . . Whites who are antiracist in the everyday lives are those that take a stand to change these conditions.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The specter of dysfunctional black men, whom years of racism have conditioned, help construct an ideal type of white masculine identity. Amid WRJ members and sympathizers, the continual reproduction of white masculine identity rests on a three-pronged social apprehension: (1) a collective sense of “white guilt” (a sentiment expressed by WRJ members in statements like “I have to pay for the sins of my ancestors”), (2) a conception of a vulnerable and weaker white masculinity that must be physically protected from black male violence, and (3) a gendered defense of a patriarchal and heteronormative order in which the black male loss of control over black women (represented by talk of “too many black matriarchs”) poses a threat and alternative to (white) masculine control over (white) women.</p>

<title>Inspi(RED) Paternalism</title>
<p>During the 2006-2007 research time frame, “Campaign Red” gained a great deal of momentum. The campaign raised awareness and money toward the goal of eliminating AIDS/HIV in Africa. The campaign was made notable by its alignment with “(Product)Red” branded commodities such as red iPods, laptops, and cell phones. Perhaps the most iconic product became <italic>The Gap</italic> brand T-shirt line in which a solid red shirt was emblazoned with a word such as “inspi(red),” “admi(red),” or “empowe(red).”</p>
<p>Weeks after the Red Campaign kicked off, I walked in WRJ’s headquarters to find members discussing the campaign. While two of the red T-shirts lay on a table, members debated whether WRJ should officially support the campaign:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Patrick (twenty-eight years old, writer, two years in WRJ): “It seems prudent that we support it, I mean if we don’t what kind of example is that, (<italic>said in mocking sarcasm</italic>): ‘Oh so you guys are antiracists but you don’t care about the inequality in Africa?’ Yeah, great.”</p>
<p>Andre (twenty-four years old, graduate student, one year in WRJ): “I’m not saying that, it’s just, I don’t know, . . . okay, look it’s a little commercialized right. I mean, I want to help, and I think it’s good, but okay. I don’t know how these products are made and just don’t want to support capitalism. How do we know that these products are not made in ways that actually take money out of Africa?”</p>
<p>Colin (twenty-six years old, student, one year in WRJ): “Yeah, but at the same time I think we need to consider that we do something. They can’t help themselves. There’s not much there to help.”</p>
<p>Malcolm (forty-four years old, consultant/counselor, five years in NEA) [said with a sigh]: “I’m just not sure, is it better than nothing?”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>WRJ members were not confident in Campaign Red. Some believed that the public would view them as inauthentic or sophomoric activists while others argued the campaign was little more than thinly-veiled capitalism. Gendered and racialized concerns drove this tension. In the former, members worried about the perception of their masculine identity. For example, Bret (age fifty-one, writer, seven years in WRJ) said:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I’m not sure what’s best. . . . We’re already critiqued for having too few female members here, don’t think I don’t know that. So, you know? All we need now is to be like, you know, publically chastised for being these “callous” and “hard-assed” <italic>men</italic> [said with emphasis] who, number one, don’t care about the kind of, of, uhhh, racist effects of colonialism as they relate to the spread of AIDS. And then, number two, we’d be called out for being sexist men because of how AIDS particularly hits women and children in Africa.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In the latter, members expressed that support of the campaign would lump them into a camp of racist profiteers: “I’m not comfortable with supporting mega-rich companies get even richer by pretending to care about black people in Africa,” said Mark (thirty-three years old, corporate sales, seven-year member of WRJ).</p>
<p>Despite this tension, and after several weeks of debate, WRJ reached a conclusion. In a culminating meeting, Colin stated:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>After years of exploitation, those folks are past the point of clear thinking, because it’s just a sad story of exploitation and rape and really, fundamental exploitation on every level, really, so, yeah . . . if privileged whites from the U.S. can’t put some of their power to good usage and fix things, you know, set things straight, then it’s just a sad situation.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Describing an amorphous group of “Africans” as “past the point of clear thinking,” against a group of antiracist whites whose moral goal is to “help save them,” helped to reconcile the previous tension and solidify a hierarchical relationship of paternalism. Members’ conceptions of masculinity and white racial identity implicitly rationalized their paternalistic stance. After the final discussion, Malcolm stated: “And really, at the end of all this, if people, especially black people, aren’t supportive of what we’re doing, then they’re stupid anyway, we don’t need their support.” James (thirty-six years old, construction manager, four years in WRJ), who was entirely quiet during the meeting, replied to Malcolm, “Yeah, I rarely know how to help; this makes me feel better.”</p>
<p>Weeks after WRJ decided to officially support Campaign Red, I walked into the headquarters of NEA to find John (forty-two years old, consultant, six years in NEA) wearing a Gap “Red” t-shirt, emblazoned with the word “admi(red).” Shocked that John, a particularly staunch member of NEA would wear a shirt in support of AIDS/HIV assistance in Africa, I asked about his choice of apparel. He responded:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It’s great! (<italic>laughing</italic>) Who can really say that white nationalism is selfish, right? I mean, if Africa doesn’t pull their shit together, how are we going to rationalize our aims? . . . So, let’s say that I have a child and he is misbehaving. . . . So my son doesn’t want to clean up his room, he always leaves his toys out all over the house. So I’ve been trying to convince my wife to convert one of the rooms into a game room you know, pool table and what not. She keeps saying no because my boy leaves his toys all over the place. She just thinks he should have his run just about all over the house, except my office, and he just does as he pleases. She knows I would throw a fit if he did that in my game room. So, it’s in my interest to get him to clean up his stuff, to grow up and do as I say, so I started giving him some money every time he cleans up. In a few weeks, I bet you I will be able to get my game room, because he’ll be better behaved. . . . It’s the same situation with Africa. This campaign, if you do the research, is so tied into the bureaucratic strings that if certain African companies and governments don’t act right, they won’t get any money . . . and really, I mean, it’s kind of hard to call me a racist with this shirt on.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>John’s explanation makes clear how paternalism serves a white nationalist function in terms of both macro-economic global relations and micro-politics in which he elides claims of racism with the Gap “Red” T-shirt. Weeks later, several NEA members bought the red T-shirts. And no less than a month after our conversation, NEA printed a pro–Campaign Red article in their newsletter and posted on several white nationalist websites about the white nationalist utility of supporting Campaign Red.</p>
<p>One such website included the picture of a young brown-skinned girl. Extremely malnourished, and wearing ripped and filthy clothing, the girl sat on the ground as dozens of flies swarmed around her emaciated body. “This is a great photo, I mean, it’s really the same one we see all the time, on the Sally Struthers commercials or the Christian Relief stuff,” said Charles (twenty-five years old, graduate student, three years in NEA). He continued:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>We’re not without compassion, . . . it’s a functional relationship really we need Africa to be ready to take Africans, same with the Caribbean and South America. . . . We have to take over these areas to make sure they are up to par . . . otherwise, they will keep trying to come here. Unless people understand this pragmatic reality, we will keep having immigration problems . . . or problems with blacks and welfare.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Charles’s comments represent a deep-seated fear of white male instability vis-à-vis employment competition with immigrants. This nouveau “white man’s burden” helped construct a modern sense of white masculinity as the rightful controllers and administrators of the economic landscape. John (forty-two years old, consultant, six years in NEA) explained:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I like the t-shirt. . . . For me, it drives home the point that white nationalism is not about hating others; it’s about us all having a space and a place. . . . The sooner Africans get their shit together, the sooner they can leave. . . . Real white men, those that take care of their families that provide for a wife at home, that control their destiny, they are the ones that get that we all have to help Africans, or Caribbeans, or South Americans, whatever so that we can have our North American and European homelands.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Charles’s and John’s logic is not atypical, but represent the latest installation in the racial and gender underpinnings of paternalism. U.S. white masculine supremacy, embodied in their supposed providence over rationality, courage, strength, fidelity, and control of democratic practice have enjoyed a close relationship in everyday discourse. Black male attempts to assert self-determination in venues outside of white male paternalism often translate into potent threats against the “natural” arrangements of nation, the heteronormative white family structure, and white masculine ego and esteem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0891241611431580">Carroll 2003</xref>, 226-27).</p>
<p>The dominant logic of white paternalism effectively rallied WRJ and NEA support of Campaign Red. For the white antiracists, engaging in the support of the Campaign Red meant they could feel comfortable in “saving the Africans” via their support of companies like Gap, Converse, Motorola, and Armani. The campaigned seemed to flatter WRJ members into thinking their purchase of a new cell phone or pair of sneakers was not just a routine market transaction, but a moment of white male redemption and reconstruction as rational, strong, and competent actors. For the white nationalists, Campaign Red became a site in which they could remake the meanings of white masculinity in relation to concepts of intelligence, morality, and civilization. NEA members labor quite hard to make sure that their attitude toward Campaign Red shuns the image of traditional white power but instead appears as a kindly action.</p>
<p>When members of NEA speak of building either an all-white nation or a segregated portion thereof, they concomitantly speak of the need to take over and “help” blacks get their lives in order so that they can exist autonomously on their own—the end goal being very simply—that they will leave whites alone. When WRJ members speak of their target of a racially healed nation in which people of all colors can live harmoniously, they talk of doing for blacks and other people of color because they cannot do for themselves.</p>
<p>Akin to the use of black pathology arguments, Campaign Red functions to solidify the meaning of white masculinity as both normative and superior. That is, while the humanitarian work raised both money and awareness for HIV/AIDS relief in globally marginalized nations, one should not uncritically celebrate the campaign <italic>strategies</italic>. Rather than advocate the development of infrastructure for increased self-determination, NEA and WRJ reinforce paternalistic philanthropy. Regardless of white nationalist or white antiracist intention, they obscure more profound factors such as globalization, neoliberalism, and environmental racism while concomitantly enabling the interactive production of a neocolonial white masculinity.</p>

<title>White Men: Sexual Saviors</title>
<sec id="section13-0891241611431580">
<title>NEA and protecting the “cult of true womanhood.”</title>
<p>The eighteenth and nineteenth centuries in the United States witnessed a changing racist and sexist order in which new industries and professions enabled a new white middle-class familial arrangement. This structure consisted of public masculinity (e.g., lawyers, managers, merchants, and doctors) alongside a private (white) femininity underpinned by an ideological ideal called the “cult of domesticity” or the “cult of True Womanhood.” This new ideal, found in newspapers and magazines, advice books, religious journals, and fiction-based novels, cataloged the virtues of (white) feminine subordination and domestic piety.</p>
<p>Such gender relations remain indelibly racialized. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0891241611431580">Fraiman (1994</xref>, 71) writes, the “paradigm of American racism, available during slavery but crystallized in the period following Reconstruction and still influential today, in which White men’s control of Black men is mediated by the always-about-to-be violated bodies of White women.” White masculine meaning making in both NEA and WRJ is constrained and enabled by the intertwined logic of racism and sexism. For example, NEA literature states, “The lust and desire that the black male brain carries is so overpowering that it drives them insane . . . they can be bent on having and possessing women, and white women are the greatest prize.” Accordingly, many of NEA’s public lectures include admonitions against interracial dating, marriage, and advice to white fathers on “protecting” their daughters from interracial dating.</p>
<p>Half of the twenty-four NEA members I interviewed had children. Of these twelve children, eight were girls and of those eight I met five (ages five, eight, nine, fifteen, and nineteen). Four of the NEA daughters seemed very well acquainted with their fathers’ activism. One seemed largely aloof to what her father did—a practice that was seemingly intentional given that I received instruction not to speak about NEA while in this member’s home. After gaining permission to view three of the NEA daughter’s rooms, I observed a copy of <italic>Mein Kampf</italic> (Hitler’s autobiography/manifesto), an album by “Prussian Blue” (a controversial white nationalist folk teen duo), and a piece of paper taped to the side of a desk that read: “white rights are human rights.” These rooms also held an array of items that most would not automatically equate with white nationalism. For instance, in one girl’s room there hung a poster in which Kipling’s poem “The Stranger” was superimposed over the image of an arm-in-arm white couple walking through a gate toward an orange and yellow sunset on the far-off horizon. White nationalists often reference this poem because they believe it expresses white identity politics based on biological and communal solidarity while expressing distaste for the “stranger within my gate.” A portion of it reads:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The men of my own stock, Bitter bad they may be, But, at least, they hear the things I hear, And see the things I see; And whatever I think of them and their likes, They think of the likes of me.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The discourse of white men as the sole protectors of white girls and women is a key component in the NEA worldview. Without those men in their lives, white women transformed into adrift and directionless objects in need of a remedy only masculinity could provide. As another daughter told me, “My dad has always told me what is right and wrong. . . . He has always helped keep a lot of the black guys away.” Such an ideology was not endemic only to father–daughter relationships. As Lisa (thirty-six years old, executive secretary, two years in NEA), the only regularly attending, female, NEA member told me:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I think I have told you this before right? I have, I mean, again, a big part of the reason I help out here is because these guys are, well, number one, they are serious. They are not playing around, I mean, they really believe what they are doing and want to protect the race. They don’t just talk about like a lot of whites do, they are acting on it. And uh, number two, they really do, I mean, this is on an emotional level for me, so they really make me feel safer. The more men in [NEA] we can get, I mean, I try to recruit people all the time, . . . We need strong white men to protect us . . . especially as society goes through further cultural decay. . . . I mean, there are drawbacks sometimes, like my ex-husband used to tell me what to do all the time, and that got old, but I mean, sometimes I wonder if I was just too hard on him, he was just trying to protect me. I didn’t always listen. I was stubborn and did what I wanted, I should have obeyed him more. He always told me where I could and couldn’t go. . . . I guess it was for my own good.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In a similar manner, many of the daughters expressed a mixture of frustration and thankfulness for white male paternalism: One daughter of an NEA member told me:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I just can’t stand it when he [her father] is so controlling. . . . Sometimes I just have to take a deep breath and tell myself that he knows more than me and always will and that his intentions are good. . . . I mean really, it’s not his fault. It’s the blacks and Mexicans that rape women like me that are the problem. It’s really not his fault.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The placement of blame for the white male control of white women is telling. When Lisa understood the prevalence of a masculine and nonwhite threat, white male control over female bodies became both normalized and needed. Constructed as helpless victims of predatory men of color, white women gain social significance through this narrative. And even as these women gain maturity and adulthood, such paternalistic white men will supposedly know “more than me and always will.”</p>

<title>WRJ and saving women of color</title>
<p>When WRJ members held meetings, talks, and forums, they would occasionally mention class and gender oppression. At one particular business meeting, members discussed a letter they received from a nearby women’s shelter I call “Safe Haven.” The shelter, specializing in care and counseling for women survivors of domestic abuse, asked WRJ if they would give a series of talks on how whites can resist the combination of sexism and racism.</p>
<p>With the permission of Safe Haven’s administrators, I accompanied WRJ members Malcolm, Mark, Patrick, and James to the shelter. Meeting at The Center, we all piled into Malcolm’s car and headed to Safe Haven. Upon arrival, the shelter director asked WRJ members to relate a series of lectures and workshops to how racism and sexism both impact family violence, children and their racial and gender identity development, and what people could do to work within the confines of state policies and laws related to race, gender, and violence. After setting up a tentative schedule for the following month, Mark asked to meet some of the women in the shelter. “I’d just like to get a feel for who we’ll be speaking to,” he said.</p>
<p>On the condition that I—as a non-WRJ member and researcher—could not interview the shelter’s residents, they checked with some of the women and agreed. Almost all the women in the shelter were black or Latina and seemed to hail from working- and lower-class backgrounds. Many told WRJ members blunt stories about sexual violence, malicious beatings, and constant psychological abuse. After an hour of these introductions, the WRJ members thanked those with whom they spoke, briefly conferred with Safe Haven’s director, and headed out the door. As we climbed back into Malcolm’s car, Patrick began to cry. Wiping away his tears, he explained that he “cognitively” knew about abuse, but that hearing and “feeling” those stories was too much to bear. “I had an idea, but I had no idea,” he said. The rest of the drive back to The Center took place in utter silence.</p>
<p>For WRJ members, “saving” these women from sexual and sexist violence meant navigating a tricky space between reactionary and progressive politics. For example, Patrick stated:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I don’t know what helps except, well, if there were some type of harsher penalties that worked as a deterrent, then that, of course, might help. But that, I mean, that’s less than ideal obviously. I’m not comfortable with encouraging, let’s say, more police on the street when black men are obviously unfairly racially profiled. No way. But, there’s just no easy answer here.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Neither approach was satisfactory. While they wished to surveil men of color for their imaged hyper-violent and sexist behavior, they had no effective model for enacting such surveillance. So also, they did not want to put such surveillance in the hands of police—coded as a racist and violence-prone force in and of themselves.</p>
<p>To solidify the meaning of their own identities as moral and sacrificing saviors for the well-being of nonwhite women, they instructed women to stay clear of places and spaces thought dominated by men of color. As Duncan explained to a group of nine women (six black, two Latina, and one white) during a workshop at Safe Haven:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Racism and sexism are powerful forces. . . . Contemporary capitalist economics only worsens the oppression of men of color because they can’t get jobs and can’t get a sense of pride. Think about it. You didn’t see the crips and the bloods out in California until black and brown unemployment rose. Violence breeds violence and racism only generates a desire to oppress others more. . . . I think that if racism toward men of color lessens, then they will, will, uh, be less violent toward women. . . . Until that day, be smart. Stay out of black and lower-class neighborhoods. Don’t go to black men’s houses at night.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Similarly, when Bret spoke to a high school classroom full of black women, he stated:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It’s just dangerous to be in areas that are dominated by black men. . . . Don’t be alone, so, use the, the, it’s called the “buddy system,” right? Yeah, so don’t be alone. Have white friends with you, like uh chaperones. . . . But I’ll tell you, you may laugh, but when you date, consider white men. Don’t think that you have to subscribe to outmoded ways of doing things when like, you’re considering who you like, so, you know, statistically, I think, because white men, we don’t suffer racism because of our privilege, so we’re less likely to be sexist in an interracial relationship. . . . But really, consider white men as partners. . . . And let me just tell you, I think most white men have a thing for black women, they just won’t tell you.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Duncan and Bret’s arguments to stay away from black male areas, to use white “chaperones,” and to reduce chances of violence by dating white men, collectively rationalizes the surveillance and segregation of black men and black women. More disturbingly, the statement that “white men have a thing for black women” reproduces the very sexual objectification of black women that WRJ members say they are trying to contest. In the end, demands to conform to a proper Messianic white male antiracist identity reproduce a postcolonial form of paternalism. Living up to this aspect of the white masculinity ideal is to gain the status of a worthy and committed member. This meant signifying that one possesses the qualities of compassion, intelligence, rationality, tenacity, moral courage, and the ability to solve others’ problems. Once someone joins WRJ, one slowly learns the implicit scripts and unspoken rules associated with this dimension until they become practical knowledge and embodied dispositions.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Comparative ethnographic examinations of white nationalist and white antiracist discourse about black men opens up a space to interrogate more fully the discursive construction of white masculinity. Whether through belief in the essential dysfunctions of black men, the understanding that whites should serve as paternalistic guardians, and/or the conviction that black men seek to oppress women of color, repertoires eddy off one another and overlap in imaginative and everyday modes of action. Dominant discourse about black masculinity serves as both reflections of dominant expectations for white male speech-acts and as potent reservoirs for the narrative reproduction of white male identity.</p>
<p>The implications of this study are several-fold. Rather narrow and compulsive racial identity expectations weigh on whites across the conventional political spectrum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0891241611431580">Hughey 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0891241611431580">2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0891241611431580">forthcoming a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0891241611431580">forthcoming b</xref>). Such accountabilities engender the pursuit of an intersubjective ideal or “hegemonic” white racial identity. This collective quest holds a two-sided character: positioning those marked as whites as essentially different from and superior to nonwhites, and marginalizing those whites that fail to adhere to those socially shared racial distinctions. Accordingly, the data herein demonstrate how dominant and expected discursive repertoires not only help to reproduce a sense of white masculinity <italic>contra</italic> black men but rely on and reproduce significantly gendered intrawhite distinctions and hierarchy.</p>
<p>The intersection of dominant raced and gendered meanings structure actors’ social accountabilities. These intersections are neither fixed character types nor a collection of particular white supremacist and patriarchal traits. Rather, they address the social expectations for white male identity and discursive formation about Western civilization’s quintessential “other”—black men. Deviation from those expectations may result in being called into account as a lacking member of particular social groups and categories for which there exist prevailing narratives of authentic belonging. Failure to adhere to these scripts leaves one vulnerable to social sanctions that both materially and symbolically mark the self as less-than, inauthentic, and immoral. Likewise, pursuit of the ideal white male self remains rather obligatory if one seeks to occupy the safe space of normality within the context of each organization. One constantly adjusts and re-creates identity in relation to group expectations and social accountabilities; identities are “ongoing accomplishments” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0891241611431580">Garfinkel 1967</xref>) that carry “accountability obligations” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0891241611431580">Schwalbe 2008</xref>). Such obligations circulate in contexts and locales of unequal relations that may appear, at first glance, disconnected. My focus on the widespread reach of these compulsions and commitments leads to a second point.</p>
<p>This research demonstrates that a particular ideal of whiteness—expressed in expected discursive repertoires that hold actors accountable to one another—holds a far reach and appeals to white men across lines of antagonistic political ideology and resource attainment (barriers previously thought primary causal variables in identity formation models) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0891241611431580">Darity, Mason, and Stewart 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0891241611431580">Jost, Federico, and Napier 2009</xref>). A particular ideal of white racial identity formation thus persists across and between supposedly hostile and disconnected spheres of activity and organization. The discursive schemas that reflect that hegemonic ideal appear “transposable.” “To say that schemas are transposable, in other words, is to say that they can be applied to a wide and not fully predictable range of cases outside the context in which they are initially learned” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0891241611431580">Sewell 1992</xref>, 17). Race and gender categories persist across contexts as structural and discursive roadmaps. While the exigencies of locale certainly matter and can refine, resist, or revolt against dominant ideals, the diversity of the world is increasingly interconnected. Global capitalism, media, militarism, migration, neoliberalism (as a radical practice of free-market, hyperindividualism), and neoconservatism (populist support for Western ethnocentrism and security) have opened previously closed or isolated locales to the raced and gendered U.S. symbolic order. While this growth certainly means the hegemonic ideal of whiteness does not go unchallenged, certain inter- and intraracial distinctions prove quite robust.</p>
<p>Third, this research drives yet another coffin nail into the claim that the United States has reached a postracial or postracist society. Yet in so doing, it does unearth one particular skeleton. Recent sociological research on race has consistently reiterated the claim that overt racism has declined in relation to an increase in “subtle prejudice” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0891241611431580">Meertens and Pettigrew 1997</xref>), “color-blind racism” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0891241611431580">Bonilla-Silva 2002</xref>), or “laissez faire racism” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0891241611431580">Bobo, Kluegel, and Smith 1997</xref>). This research tempers such a conclusion. Racism may have shifted form, but it may have also shifted location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0891241611431580">Hughey 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0891241611431580">Krysan 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0891241611431580">Picca and Feagin 2007</xref>). Future social scientific attention should refocus on how particular overt discourse, which some assumed died with the passing of Jim Crow, may now haunt our private settings. Moreover, the specter of this ugly racist and sexist speech may now find new life in the public sphere through its connection to performances of a “rational,” “strong,” and “courageous” white masculinity that we might call James Crow, Esquire.</p>
<p>This article may tempt a reading of NEA and WRJ as distinct anomalies that share a serendipitous similarity. Yet, one must recall that these two groups do not reside in a social vacuum. They make meaning of their white racial identities by drawing on rather mainstream views of race and gender, and in particular, black masculinity. These two groups appear similar because they attach to dominant expectations of white and male identity performances. Racism is neither respecter of persons nor political leanings. Political ideology and organizing appear not to fully shield whites from the effects of anti–black male narratives that pervade the social landscape as supposedly natural, normal, and mundane stories about racial and gendered identities and differences.</p>

<p>I chose the pseudonym “National Equality for All” to reflect the organization’s ideological stance: Given their belief that white people are unfairly victimized and stigmatized, they contend a white nationalist consciousness and program to protect and empower white people will create real racial and social equality across the nation. Furthermore, some members believe that whites are inherently (either biologically or culturally) superior to nonwhites and that political correctness delimits their “innate” place of superiority. In this sense, allowing whites to claim their rightful place atop a racial hierarchy is framed as “equal” because it reflects a “natural” state of being.</p>
