<p>Sun, L., &amp; Nippold, M. A. (2012). Narrative writing in children and adolescents: Examining the literate lexicon. <italic>Language, Speech, and Hearing Services in Schools, 43</italic>, 2–13.</p>
<p>Considerable information is available regarding the vocabulary and syntactic abilities of preschool and early elementary children, but relatively little is known about the development of these in older school-aged students. The authors of this study investigated the use of literate words in school-age children and adolescents in the context of narrative writing. Narrative writing was addressed because narrative skills are associated with academic success. Students are evaluated on their ability to express themselves using precise vocabulary and grammatically appropriate sentences in narratives. Students with histories of language impairment typically struggle with the production of narrative discourse.</p>
<p>This study focused on two types of vocabulary words: abstract nouns (ABNs, for example, <italic>anticipation, curiosity, loneliness</italic>) and metacognitive verbs (MCVs, for example, <italic>decide, imagine, realize</italic>). ABNs refer to intangible entities, inner states, and emotions; MCVs refer to mental states or activities of the mind. ABNs and MCVs are considered part of the literate lexicon because they are later developing words that occur in school-related contexts, for example,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Henry David Thoreau <italic>explored</italic> (MCV) many <italic>ideas</italic> (ABN) about human <italic>nature</italic> (ABN) before <italic>deciding</italic> (MCV) to write his <italic>memorial</italic> (ABN) to his brother.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Research has shown that knowledge of ABNs and MCVs develops during late childhood and into adolescence and early adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1048395012440418">McGhee-Bidlack, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1048395012440418">Nippold, Hegel, Sohlberg, &amp; Schwarz, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1048395012440418">Nippold, Ward-Lonergan, &amp; Fanning, 2005</xref>). Concrete nouns are probably easier to understand than ABNs because the former are linked to stronger mental images stored in memory. Concrete nouns such as <italic>cow, airplane</italic>, and <italic>cherry</italic> can evoke vivid visual, auditory, tactile, and olfactory images that help promote memory. In contrast, ABNs such as courage, misfortune, and knowledge are difficult to visualize, hear, feel, or small, making it necessary to link their meanings to other words and concepts rather than to rich mental images.</p>
<p>This study was designed to address the following questions:</p>
<list id="list1-1048395012440418" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Does the use of ABNs and MCBs in narrative writing increase during the years between late childhood and late adolescence?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Is the use of these words associated with production of complex syntax?</p></list-item>

<title>Study</title>
<sec id="section2-1048395012440418">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Students from Grades 5, 8, and 11 (mean ages 11.1, 14.1, and 17.5, respectively) participated in this study. There were 40 students at each grade. All students spoke English as their first language, and none of them were receiving special education services.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1048395012440418">
<title>Task</title>
<p>Each student was asked to write a narrative essay, titled, “What Happened One Day.” They were told that the stories could be factual or imaginary about something funny, sad, or scary that happened to them or a friend. They were given 20 min to complete the task.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1048395012440418">
<title>Analyses</title>
<p>Each student’s essay was typed, segmented into T-units, and entered into the computer program (Systematic Analysis of Language Transcripts [SALT]). A T-unit consists of a main clause (MC) and any subordinate clause (SC) that is attached to it. The essays were then coded for all instances of ABNs, MCVs, MCs, and SCs. Other variables calculated included total T-units (TTU), mean length of T-Unit (MLTU, a measure of syntactic development), and clause density (CD; the mean number of clauses per T-unit, another measure of syntactic development). To obtain an estimate of the frequency of occurrence of the ABNs and MCVs, each word was given a standard frequency index (SFI) value from The American Heritage Frequency Book (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1048395012440418">Carroll, Davies, &amp; Richman, 1971</xref>).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<list id="list2-1048395012440418" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>17-year-olds used a greater number of different ABNs and MCVs than did the 14-year-olds, who used a greater number of different ABNs and MCVs than did the 11-year-olds. As the number of ABNs increased, so did the number of MCVs.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The majority of ABNs and MCVs used by all three groups had a high frequency of occurrence in the language.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>For ABNs, there was a tendency for moderate-frequency words (e.g., admission, offense, trait) and low-frequency words (e.g., acknowledgment, apathy, antic) to increase slightly with age, but there was no such trend for MCVs. Some words were used by all three groups (ABNs: accident, end, fun, life, problem, shock; MCVs: decide, expect, feel, forget, guess, realize), whereas other words were used only by the oldest groups (ABNs: accomplishment, anticipation, apathy, boredom, competition, destination; MCVs: assume, attempt, digest, imagine, reflect, suppress). Moderate- and low-frequency MCVs (e.g., confuse, suppress, ignore) were rarely used by any of the three groups.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>17-year-olds had more T-units in their narratives than the 14- and 11-year-olds. The 17-year-olds had longer MLTUs than the 14-year-olds, and the 14-year-olds had longer MLTUs than the 11-year-olds.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>As MLTU increased, CD increased.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>MLTU and CD were significantly correlated with ABN and MCV; that is, greater frequency of ABNs and MCVs was associated with more complex syntax.</p></list-item>
</list>

<title>Implications</title>
<p>This study provides a framework for speech-language pathologists (SLPs) to use in assessing and developing the language skills of older students. The narrative writing task is easily administered, and the key lexical features (ABNs and MCVs) are easily identified and the syntactic features (TTU, MLTU, and CD) are easily calculated. Given the connection between reading comprehension and a literate lexicon, it makes sense that SLPs address these words in intervention</p>
