<abstract>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> About 2–5% of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) experience their first symptoms before age 18. Sleep disorders occur frequently in MS. The prevalence of sleep problems and their impact on fatigue and daytime sleepiness in pediatric MS is unknown.</p>
<p><bold>Objective:</bold> To determine whether pediatric MS patients have more sleep disturbances, fatigue, and daytime sleepiness compared with an age-, sex-, and race-matched control group.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> Patients and age-, sex-, and race-matched controls were surveyed to quantify daytime sleepiness via the modified Epworth Sleepiness Scale, sleep quality and hygiene through the Adolescent Sleep Wake and Hygiene Scale, respectively, and fatigue using the PediatricQL Multidimensional Fatigue Scale.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Pediatric MS patients (<italic>n</italic> = 30) and age-, sex-, and race-matched controls (<italic>n</italic> = 52) had similar levels of fatigue; however, when compared with previously published historical controls, both groups reported worse fatigue across all dimensions (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Pediatric MS patients also had similar sleep quality compared with the matched controls, but reported better sleep hygiene on the ‘sleep stability’ dimension (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). In addition, pediatric MS patients had less daytime sleepiness than the matched controls (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Although patients with MS reported similar levels of fatigue, they have better sleep hygiene, which could possibly account for the decreased amount of excessive daytime sleepiness. Also, when compared with historical controls, the MS and control samples reported more fatigue. Thus, caution must be taken when using published control data, especially when not properly matched.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Although multiple sclerosis (MS) has been considered an adult-onset disease, an estimated 2–5% of MS patients experience their first symptoms before the age of 18.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458511424307">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458511424307">2</xref></sup> Since 1980, hundreds of pediatric MS cases have been reported, with some patients experiencing initial symptoms as early as 13 months. This increase in diagnosis of pediatric-onset MS may, in part, be due to the widespread availability of magnetic resonance imaging.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1352458511424307">3</xref></sup> The natural history of pediatric-onset MS is different from the adult-onset disease in that pediatric-onset MS takes longer to reach irreversible disability, but because MS onset occurs at a younger age, disability develops at a younger age.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458511424307">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Fatigue is one of the most common symptoms associated with the MS population. Although not thoroughly studied in the pediatric MS population, adult patients with MS report increased fatigue and lower quality of life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1352458511424307">5</xref></sup> MS-associated fatigue is multifactorial and attributed to immune system deficiency, changes in the nervous system, physical deconditioning, pain, medication side affects, and poor sleep among others.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1352458511424307">6</xref></sup> Patients with MS report higher levels of general, physical, and mental fatigue, contributing to reduced activity and motivation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1352458511424307">7</xref></sup> Moreover, fatigue is associated with disrupted sleep and excessive daytime sleepiness in patients with MS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1352458511424307">8</xref></sup> Other symptoms correlated with fatigue include cognitive deficits, depression, heat sensitivity, and physical impairment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1352458511424307">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1352458511424307">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Poor sleep also impacts the quality of life of patients with MS. Sleep disorders commonly diagnosed in MS patients include insomnia, nocturnal movement disorders, sleep-disordered breathing, narcolepsy, and rapid eye movement disorders.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1352458511424307">11</xref></sup> In several studies, sleep disorders are reported to be independent predictors of mental and physical state among MS patients as well an overall marker for quality of life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1352458511424307">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1352458511424307">13</xref></sup> Moreover, poor sleep is an important predictor of fatigue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1352458511424307">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although many attempts have been made to assess fatigue and sleep disturbances in adults, very little is known about their affects on the lives of the pediatric MS patients. Optimal management of symptoms such as fatigue, excessive daytime sleepiness, and sleep disturbances may improve the physical and mental quality of life of these patients. The purpose of this study was to determine if pediatric MS patients have more sleep disturbances, fatigue, and daytime sleepiness compared to an age-, sex-, race-matched control group.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-1352458511424307">
<title>Study population</title>
<p>The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB).</p>
<sec id="section4-1352458511424307">
<title>Pediatric multiple sclerosis patients</title>
<p>Adolescents with MS were recruited from the UAB Center for Pediatric Onset Demyelinating Disease (CPODD) at the Children’s Hospital of Alabama from June 2008 to December 2009. Patients were recruited by mail and during routine follow-up visits. All pediatric MS patients were off steroids and relapse free for at least 1 month prior to completion of the surveys. Relapse was defined as new or worsening of neurological symptoms that lasts for at least 24 h in the absence of fever or infection. Date of MS onset, defined as the date of the first demyelinating event, disease duration, months since last relapse, and number of relapses at time of evaluation were recorded. Current medications, other medical diseases, and past surgeries were also recorded.</p>
<p>The Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), a standardized and validated tool used to measure disability in patients with MS, was collected.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1352458511424307">15</xref></sup> This scale is based on a comprehensive neurological examination and is an ordinal, non-linear scale that can be completed fairly quickly in the setting of a clinic visit.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1352458511424307">
<title>Matched control subjects</title>
<p>Age-, race-, and sex-matched healthy adolescent control subjects were recruited from well-patient clinics in an outpatient setting (<italic>n</italic> = 27), either while waiting to be seen by the doctor or while waiting for a sibling/friend to be evaluated in the clinic. Additional healthy controls (<italic>n</italic> = 15) were recruited from local high schools. To control for socioeconomic status and potential confounders from home environment, healthy siblings of the pediatric MS patients were also recruited (<italic>n</italic> = 10). For both siblings and non-sibling controls, current medications, medical history, and past surgeries were also recorded.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1352458511424307">
<title>Historical control subjects for the PedsQL Multidimensional Fatigue Scale from literature</title>
<p>Data from a historical published control sample looking at pediatric fatigue was compared with our pediatric MS group and their matched controls. The participants in the historical control group were healthy children ages 5–18 years (<italic>n</italic> = 52) and parents of healthy children ages 2–18 (<italic>n</italic> = 102) derived from the PedsQL Multidimensional Fatigue Scale field test in pediatric rheumatology.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1352458511424307">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1352458511424307">17</xref></sup> Subjects in the historical control group were recruited at the Orthopedic Clinic in Rady Children’s Hospital and Health Center, San Diego, and included patients who presented with broken bones or fractures 6 months prior to survey administration via the telephone. All patients were considered healthy at the time of assessment by the nurse. The average age of the 69 boys (67.7%) and 30 girls (29.4%; missing = 3, 2.9%) was 8.88 years (standard deviation (SD) = 10.98). The average age for the child self-report of the 40 boys (76.9%) and 11 girls (21.2%; missing = 1, 1.9%) was 10.40 years (SD = 14.45). The race/ethnicity included 28 (27.45%) White non-Hispanics, 47 (48.08%) Hispanics, six (5.88%) Black non-Hispanics, two (1.95%) Asian/Pacific Islander, one (0.98%) American Indian or Alaskan Native, 14 (13.73%) other, and four (3.92%) missing.</p>

<title>Questionnaires</title>
<p>Questionnaires were administered to both the pediatric MS and matched control subjects assessing excessive daytime sleepiness, sleep quality and hygiene, and fatigue.</p>
<sec id="section8-1352458511424307">
<title>PedsQL Multidimensional Fatigue Scale</title>
<p>The PedsQL Multidimensional Fatigue Scale is an 18-item instrument used to measure fatigue in pediatric patients and comprises three domains: general fatigue (six items), sleep/rest fatigue (six items), and cognitive fatigue (six items). Subjects were asked to indicate how often they have had problems in each of the domains during the past month using a 5-point scale, ranging from 0 (‘never’) to 4 (‘almost always’). Mean subscale scores for each dimension and a total fatigue score were obtained. Items on the 0–4 scales were then reversed scored and linearly transformed to a 0–100 scale, with higher scores indicating fewer fatigue symptoms. The internal consistency for the PedsQL fatigue scale total score (α = 0.95), general fatigue scale (α = 0.93), sleep/rest fatigue scale (α = 0.88), and cognitive fatigue scale (α = 0.93) were excellent.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1352458511424307">17</xref></sup> The scale has excellent reliability and has been validated in other diseases affecting children and adolescents including rheumatic diseases,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1352458511424307">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1352458511424307">18</xref></sup> cancer and brain tumors,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1352458511424307">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1352458511424307">20</xref></sup> obesity,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1352458511424307">21</xref></sup> chronic pain,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1352458511424307">22</xref></sup> diabetes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1352458511424307">23</xref></sup> and fibromyalgia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1352458511424307">24</xref></sup></p>

<title>Adolescent Sleep–Wake Scale</title>
<p>The Adolescent Sleep Wake Scale (ASWS) is a 28-item questionnaire that assesses sleep quality in 12–18-year-old adolescents, developed by LeBourgeois and colleagues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1352458511424307">25</xref></sup> It is similar to the Children’s Sleep–Wake Scale.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1352458511424307">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1352458511424307">27</xref></sup> Subjects were asked to indicate how often sleep behaviors have occurred during the past month using a 6-point scale (‘always’, ‘frequently-if not always’, ‘quite often’, ‘sometimes’, ‘once in a while’, and ‘never’). Sleep was measured along five behavioral dimensions including going to bed (five items), falling asleep (six items), maintaining sleep (six items), reinitiating sleep (six items), and returning to wakefulness (five items). Mean subscale scores for each dimension and a total sleep quality score were obtained. Scores range from 1–6, with higher scores indicating better sleep quality. Adequate internal consistency for the full ASWS has been demonstrated (α = 0.86).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1352458511424307">25</xref></sup></p>

<title>Adolescent Sleep Hygiene Scale</title>
<p>The Adolescent Sleep Hygiene Scale (ASHS) is a 24-item questionnaire that assesses sleep-facilitating and sleep-inhibiting practices in 12–18-year-old adolescents developed by LeBourgeois and colleagues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1352458511424307">25</xref></sup> It is a modified version of the Children’s Sleep Hygiene Scale.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1352458511424307">28</xref></sup> Subjects were asked to indicate how often sleep behaviors have occurred during the past month using a 6-point scale, ranging from 1 (‘always’) to 6 (‘never’). Questions are divided among six different domains: physiological (five items), cognitive (six items), emotional (three items), sleep environment (four items), substances (two items), and sleep stability (four items). Mean subscale scores for each dimension and a total sleep hygiene score were obtained. Scores range from 1–6, with higher scores indicating better sleep hygiene.

<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>Data were analyzed using student <italic>t</italic>-test, Mann–Whitney, Fisher’s Exact, and ANOVA. Summary measures were represented as means and SDs where appropriate. The significance level for the described comparisons was set to a <italic>p</italic>-value of 0.05; <italic>p</italic>-values were corrected for multiple comparisons using the Tukey–Kramer Multiple Comparison post-test where applicable. Matched control and MS patients who did not complete all four surveys with at least 75% completion for each survey were excluded (MS = 4, 11.76%; Control = 0, 0%). Missing responses among data that were used were very minimal across all four surveys (&lt; 1% for both MS and control samples). Scale scores were computed as the sum of items divided by the number of items answered (this accounts for missing data).</p>

<p>A total of 51 MS patients were between the ages of 13 and 18 years in the UAB CPODD clinic database during the study period. Surveys were mailed to all eligible patients at the beginning of the survey period and 10 (20%) patients mailed back completed surveys. Patients who did not return surveys were given the opportunity to complete surveys during follow-up neurology clinic visits. Two patients were not approached as they were experiencing an acute relapse at the time of their follow-up clinic visit. Altogether, 34 patients (69%) responded to the surveys. Four patients’ surveys were excluded from the data analysis because they did not complete at least 75% of each survey. Thus, data from a total of 30 adolescent MS patients were used in the study. Sub-analysis of the respondent (<italic>n</italic> = 34) versus the non-respondent (<italic>n</italic> = 15) MS patients showed no difference with respect to age, sex, race, duration since symptom onset, EDSS score, or relapse rate.</p>
<p>Most of the MS patients (<italic>n</italic> = 25, 83%) were on disease-modifying therapy at the time of survey completion: Interferon-beta 1a SC (10 patients), Interferon-beta 1a IM (6), Interferon-beta-1b SC (4), Glatiramer acetate (4), and Natalizumab (1). Among the MS group, five were taking one or more medications with sleep-promoting potential (amitriptyline, baclofen, clonazepam, cyclobenzaprine, gabapentin, melatonin, nortriptyline, and topiramate) and three with wakefulness-promoting side effects (amantadine and lisdexamfetamine). Sub-analysis of these patients showed no difference between groups.</p>
<p>Overall, the MS patients had mild neurological impairment with 26 adolescents (86.7%) with EDSS scores between 0.0–3.0. Only four study subjects had moderate impairment (EDSS of 3.5–6.0) and none had severe disability (EDSS &gt; 6.5). The average MS disease duration and relapse rate at the time of completing the study was 2.6 ± 2.4 years (range = 0.2–12.3 years) and 1.9 ± 2.3 (range = 0.1–12.8 per year), respectively.</p>
<p>Although having a family member with a chronic disease such as MS potentially increases the risk for fatigue and sleep disturbances, healthy siblings of the MS patients were recruited in order to control for social-economic status, living environment, and family structure. However, only 10 siblings (19% of control group) who completed surveys were between ages 13–18, so paired comparison of MS patients to their sibling was not possible. Sub-analysis of the control group comparing healthy siblings with non-sibling controls (<italic>n</italic> = 42) did not show any difference between the groups with respect to age, race or sex. Only four of the 52 healthy control subjects were taking medication at the time of survey completion (diphenhydramine, albuterol, budesonide, montelukast, loratadine, Yaz, ranitidine, and lisdexamfetamine). One of the non-sibling controls was on a medication (lisdexamfetamine) with potential wakefulness-promoting properties at the time of survey completion.</p>
<p>The historical control sample previously used in numerous studies incorporating the PedsQL Multidimensional Fatigue Scale consisted of 52 children with a mean age of 10.40 ± 14.45. It was divided among 40 female (76.92%) and 12 male (23.08%) with 28 Caucasians (27.45%), six African Americans (5.88%), and 70 people representing other races (67.31%). These demographics were statistically different from the MS and matched control groups based on race and age (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05).</p>

Comparison of the MS cohort with the sibling controls was not conducted due to the low number in the healthy sibling group.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Although fatigue and sleep disturbances have been studied in adult MS, very little is known about fatigue, sleep disturbances, and daytime sleepiness in pediatric MS. Our aim in this study was to investigate the impact of these symptoms in pediatric MS patients. Relative to previously published historic controls, our 13–18-year-old pediatric MS cohort appeared to have more fatigue, but when compared with healthy matched controls with respect to age, race, and sex, similar levels of fatigue were seen in both the MS and healthy matched control groups. In fact, MS patients exhibited significantly better sleep hygiene and lower daytime sleepiness compared with the healthy adolescent group.</p>
<p>Because of the clinical observations in our clinic and other centers that fatigue is common in both adult and pediatric MS patients, we attempted to elucidate fatigue using the PedsQL Multidimensional Fatigue Scale. To our surprise, pediatric MS patients showed similar subscale levels of general, sleep/rest, and cognitive fatigue compared with their matched controls. There are several potential explanations for our findings: (1) The subjective level of fatigue reported by MS patients is truly no different than healthy matched controls, but as pediatric MS patients are assessed more frequently by healthcare professionals and queried specifically about fatigue, this can promote a bias that MS patients are more fatigued than their healthy peers. (2) Alternatively, the survey instruments may not appropriately measure what pediatric MS patients report as fatigue and may actually refer to a different underlying problem such as depression, cognitive impairment, or other difficulties they are not able to fully express or wish not to mention.</p>
<p>Other groups have also examined fatigue and quality of life using the same Varni PedQL Multidimensional Fatigue Scale. Similar to our pediatric MS cohort, the Stony Brook pediatric MS patients (<italic>n</italic> = 51) were also predominantly teenage females (64.7% female, mean age of 14.8 years), with similar disease duration (1.7 years) and disability (average EDSS score 1.7). Compared with the same historical control group,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1352458511424307">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1352458511424307">17</xref></sup> their pediatric MS patients also experienced significantly more fatigue across all three subscales – general, sleep/rest, and cognitive.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1352458511424307">32</xref></sup> Similarly, our MS group, when compared with this published historical control, also showed more fatigue across all three domains. The major difference between our study and that of the Stony Brook group was that they compared the patients only with the published historical normative data described by Varni and collleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1352458511424307">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1352458511424307">17</xref></sup> with control patients who were younger and of different racial and sex composition than either pediatric MS cohort. Our age-, sex-, and race-matched control group also exhibited more fatigue across all three subscales relative to the historical control group. However, we found no difference between our MS group and its matched controls in the PedsQL Multidimensional fatigue measures. Our findings call into question the utility of historical controls, and confirm the necessity of using appropriately matched controls in research studies, especially in highly variable diseases like MS. Moreover, other theoretical confounders of using historic controls include potentially large differences in the environment and time of survey collection.</p>
<p>We also investigated sleep patterns and daytime sleepiness in MS patients using the ASWS, the ASHS, and the modified ESS, which are reported to have high internal consistency. There was no significant difference between the pediatric MS and matched control group with respect to most fatigue and sleep measures, with the exception that our pediatric MS group had better hygiene and less daytime sleepiness compared with the matched control group. Sleep hygiene was better in the pediatric MS patients, specifically with respect to sleep stability. This domain addresses the consistency of following a specific bedtime during the weekdays and weekends. These findings suggest that MS patients were more consistent in following a sleep schedule on both the weekdays and weekends. This may be a result of the MS patients and their parents understanding the importance of a more structured schedule throughout the week to reduce the effects of MS on quality of life. Alternatively, pediatric MS patients may regulate their own sleep schedule out of necessity, or their parents may be enforcing a regular schedule for them. Another unexpected result was that MS patients experienced less daytime sleepiness than the healthy control adolescents, 16.7% compared with 42.3%, respectively. It is possible that improved sleep stability and sleep hygiene reported by our pediatric MS group protected them from daytime sleepiness. Alternatively, the pediatric MS group may have downplayed their daytime sleepiness but if that were the case, other aspects such as fatigue or sleep quality would have been expected to be altered as well.</p>
<p>A number of other factors could also explain why our pediatric MS cohort did not exhibit increased fatigue or sleep difficulties compared with the matched control group. The MS respondent population could have been healthier than the average adolescent MS patients. However, the MS patients who responded to the surveys were statistically similar to the non-respondent MS patients followed during the same period in our center with respect to disease status. In addition, our pediatric MS cohort was similar to the Stony Brook cohort with respect to sex, race, disease duration, EDSS score, and relapse rate, and had similar scores on the PedsQL Multifunctional Fatigue Scale. Another explanation for the results could be that the control patients could be sicker than the average healthy control. Yet, only four out of 52 control subjects were on any medications. It is possible that our control population, recruited from a number of community high schools and adolescent clinics plus siblings of the MS patients, experienced increased daytime sleepiness for other reasons.</p>
<p>Next, it is possible that the study was underpowered and requires a higher number of MS and control participants to detect small differences between the groups. However, with a response rate of nearly 70% of eligible pediatric MS patients during the study period, a multi-center trial would be required. It is possible that these surveys, as currently designed, may not be able to detect the types of fatigue and sleep disturbances reported by our MS patients during clinic visits. Lastly, it could be that the PedsQL Multidimensional Fatigue Scale, the ASWS, the ASHS and the modified ESS all appropriately detected fatigue and sleep difficulties in both the MS and control population, and that the relatively few differences between the groups reflect the common findings of fatigue and inadequate sleep in both otherwise healthy adolescents as well as adolescents with MS.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this research is the first to address sleep, daytime sleepiness, and fatigue in the pediatric MS using an appropriately matched control group. While our MS cohort reported increased fatigue compared with published historical controls, we found that matched adolescent controls report equal levels of fatigue and even higher levels of daytime sleepiness. These findings highlight the pitfalls of comparing only with published historical controls, especially when not properly matched to the study group. Unexpectedly, we found pediatric MS patients had better sleep hygiene and sleep stability compared with their peers, which could account for the reduced daytime sleepiness in the pediatric MS group.</p>
<p>Compared with studies of fatigue in adult MS, most of our MS patients had a disease duration of less than 3 years and had mild or no neurological impairment. So they may not yet exhibit worse fatigue and sleep measures compared with same-age peers. Alternatively, MS patients at any age may have less cognitive reserve and, therefore, a lower threshold of tolerating fatigue and poor sleep than the general public. However, adults may have greater stressors and a more unpredictable lifestyle compared with the structured daily routine for the school-age pediatric population, which is manifested as higher fatigue in adults with MS. All of these are areas that need to be explored in the future.</p>
