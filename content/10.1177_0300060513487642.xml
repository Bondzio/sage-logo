<p>Recurrent spontaneous abortion (RSA) is one of the most common complications of pregnancy and is defined as two or more clinical pregnancies lost before 20 weeks’ gestation. Up to 5% of women experience RSA around the world, primarily in the first trimester,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0300060513487642">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0300060513487642"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0300060513487642">3</xref></sup> and affected women are at an increased risk of developing clinical depression and anxiety.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0300060513487642">4</xref></sup> Despite extensive investigation, the exact causes of RSA cannot be determined in almost 50% of cases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0300060513487642">5</xref></sup> The process of implantation may include mechanisms preventing allograft rejection, and tolerance to the fetal allograft represents an important mechanism for maintaining a pregnancy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0300060513487642">6</xref></sup> It has been postulated that a proportion of these recurrent pregnancy losses might be due to immunological dysfunction,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0300060513487642">1</xref></sup> but the precise mechanisms for the disturbance of immune tolerance at the fetal–maternal interface are still poorly understood.</p>
<p>Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) is the key metabolic enzyme responsible for tryptophan degradation via the kynurenine pathway.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0300060513487642">7</xref></sup> IDO is widely produced in human tissues and cell subsets, including at the fetal–maternal interface, where it modulates their function by increasing tolerogenic capacities <italic>in vivo</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0300060513487642">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0300060513487642"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0300060513487642"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0300060513487642">11</xref></sup> Munn et al<italic>.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0300060513487642">8</xref></sup> showed that inhibition of IDO by exposure of pregnant mice to 1-methyl-tryptophan induced a T cell-mediated rejection of allogeneic concepti, whereas syngeneic concepti were not affected; this suggests that IDO expression at the fetal–maternal interface is necessary to prevent rejection of the fetal allograft. Accumulating evidence indicates that IDO production and normal function at the fetal–maternal interface may play a prominent role in pregnancy tolerance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0300060513487642">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0300060513487642">12</xref></sup> It has been shown that reduced activity or decreased levels of IDO protein may participate in the pathogenesis of the immune complications of pregnancy, such as pre-eclampsia and RSA,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0300060513487642">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0300060513487642"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0300060513487642"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0300060513487642">16</xref></sup> but the relationship between levels of IDO protein and RSA at the fetal–maternal interface remain largely unknown.</p>
<p>Several research groups have reported the presence of IDO at the fetal–maternal interface, however, there have been some conflicting data in the literature concerning the distribution of IDO protein in human first trimester placenta and deciduas.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0300060513487642">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0300060513487642"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0300060513487642"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0300060513487642"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0300060513487642"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0300060513487642"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0300060513487642"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0300060513487642">24</xref></sup> It has been reported that there was variable levels of IDO staining for the placental syncytiotrophoblast, invasive extravillous cytotrophoblast (evCT) cell columns and macrophages in the villous stroma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0300060513487642">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0300060513487642">18</xref></sup> Conversely, others have found that IDO was only present in subtrophoblastic capillaries of the placental villi of first trimester pregnancies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0300060513487642">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0300060513487642"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0300060513487642">21</xref></sup> Hönig et al<italic>.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0300060513487642">22</xref></sup> demonstrated that the invasive evCTs were strongly positive for IDO, but that syncytiotrophoblasts were negative in the first trimester of pregnancy. Moreover, IDO was localized to the decidual glandular epithelium, decidual stromal cells, monocytes or ‘lineage negative, human leucocyte antigen D-related positive dendritic cells’ according to numerous studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0300060513487642">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0300060513487642">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0300060513487642">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0300060513487642">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>Taking into account the particular immunological situation of the uteroplacental unit, it was considered worthwhile to investigate levels of IDO mRNA and protein, and IDO activity, in first trimester pregnancies on both sides of the fetal–maternal interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0300060513487642">Figure 1</xref>). The current study aimed to localize IDO mRNA and protein, and to undertake a functional study at the first trimester fetal–maternal interface, in order to determine whether the distribution and function of IDO are related to the occurrence of RSA.

<sec id="sec3-0300060513487642"><title>Patients and tissue samples</title>
<p>This prospective study obtained first-trimester placenta and decidua directly from consecutive healthy women undergoing legal termination of normal pregnancy (5–9 weeks; healthy control group) and women with RSA (5–9 weeks; RSA group) at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Ji’nan, Shandong Province, China and the Maternity and Child Care Hospital of Ji’nan, Ji’nan, Shandong Province, China, between January 2007 and November 2009. The inclusion criteria for the control group were: healthy women; normal pregnancy; at 5–9 weeks’ gestation. The inclusion criteria for the RSA group were: a history of two or more consecutive spontaneous abortions; currently at 5–9 weeks’ gestation. In addition, patients were excluded from the study if they had systemic disease or had received previous treatment for abortion (such as progesterone and mifepristone) or treatment with immunomodulatory drugs.Among the healthy control subjects, six placental tissues were immediately placed in ice-cold sterile Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium/Nutrient Mixture F12 (DMEM/F12) and kept for ≤30 min before subsequent trophoblast villous explant isolation. Other placental and decidual tissues were cut into small blocks, washed several times with 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.2) to remove excess blood, either frozen at −80℃ or fixed for 24 h in 4% paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin wax.</p>
<p>Written informed consent was obtained from all study participants and this investigation was approved by the Ethics Committee of Qilu Hospital of Shandong University.</p>

<sec id="sec4-0300060513487642"><title>Cell lines and culture</title>
<p>The HTR-8/SVneo cell line was a gift from Dr Charles H Graham (Queen’s University, Kingston, ON, Canada). This cell line was derived from an explant culture of human first trimester placenta and has the biomarkers of evCT cells <italic>in situ.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0300060513487642">25</xref></sup> HTR8/SVneo cells (10<sup>4</sup> cells/well) were seeded into 96-well plates (Costar®, Shanghai, China) in RPMI 1640 medium (GIBCO® Cell Culture, Carlsbad, CA, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT, USA), and were allowed to adhere overnight. Cells were then treated with interferon (IFN-γ) at concentrations of 10, 100, 1000 and 10 000 IU/ml (PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ, USA) or vehicle (0.1 M PBS, pH 7.4), and were incubated in a CO<sub>2</sub> incubator (Heraeus, Hanau, Germany) for a further 48 h at 37℃ with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. The cells were then used for immunocytochemistry and total RNA extraction as described below. The conditioned medium was collected and used for high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0300060513487642"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title>
<p>Tissue specimens were embedded in paraffin wax and 5 -µm sections were mounted onto silane-coated glass slides. Sections were dewaxed in histolene (2 × 5 min incubations) and rehydrated. After section rehydration, an antigen retrieval procedure was performed by boiling in 0.01 M citrate buffer (pH 6.0) in a microwave (3 × 2 min). Slides were cooled for 20 min and endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked with 3% hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) in methanol for 10 min. A 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB) kit was purchased from Zhongshan Golden Bridge Biotechnology (Beijing, China). A nonspecific protein-binding block (10% normal goat serum; Zhongshan Golden Bridge Biotechnology) was applied for 10 min. Washes between each step of the immunostaining process were undertaken using 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.4) (3 × 2 min per wash). Mouse antihuman IDO monoclonal antibody (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA, USA) was diluted to 1 : 150 in 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.4) containing 1% bovine serum albumin (Hyclone Laboratories), then applied to sections overnight at 4℃. A negative control was performed by substituting isotype matched immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 at the same concentration as the primary antibody. Sections were then incubated with secondary biotin-labelled goat antimouse IgG antibody from the DAB kit for 30 min at 37℃. After being washed three times with 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.4), sections were incubated with peroxidase-labelled streptavidin-biotin for 10 min at 37℃, followed by staining with DAB solution from the DAB kit to allow visualization of the immunolabelling. Thereafter, sections were counterstained with haematoxylin, dehydrated in graded concentrations of ethanol and mounted with coverslips. The extent of the immunolabelling was evaluated using an Olympus IX81® microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).</p>
<p>Slides were examined at × 400 magnification and the extent of immunolabelling was scored according to the following method described by Lu et al:<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0300060513487642">26</xref></sup> slides were defined as +, ++ or +++ if 10–24%, 25–50% or &gt;50% of the cells were stained positive, respectively. If &lt;10% of the cells were stained, the section was considered negative. IDO immunostaining was scored blindly by two independent observers (Y.C. and Yan Fang, Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University) without knowing the study group from which the section came; 10 fields per subject were examined in each section.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0300060513487642"><title>Immunocytochemistry</title>
<p>A total of 200 µl of HTR-8/SVneo cell (5 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells/ml) culture was transferred to the wells of a chambered slide and the cells were allowed to grow to confluence with the addition of fresh tissue culture medium. Cells were washed thoroughly (5 × 2 min washes) in 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.4), then fixed with 95% ethanol and 5% glacial acetic acid for 5 min. Cells were again washed thoroughly (5 × 2 min washes) in 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.4) then incubated in 0.25–0.5% Triton™ X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) in 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.4) for 10 min to permeabilize the membranes. After being washed (3 × 5-min washes) in 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.4), the cells were incubated in 3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.4) for 10–30 min in order to block endogenous peroxidase activity. Subsequently, 10% normal goat serum (Zhongshan Golden Bridge Biotechnology) was applied for 10 min as a nonspecific protein-binding block. Thereafter, the cells were incubated with mouse antihuman IDO monoclonal antibody, and routine DAB immunocytochemistry procedures were undertaken as described above.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-0300060513487642"><title>Real-time RT–PCR</title>
<p>Real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT–PCR) was used to measure the amount of IDO mRNA in tissue specimens and HTR8/SVneo cells. Total RNA was extracted from 100 mg of placenta and decidua tissue that were stored at –80℃ following collection, and from 1 × 10<sup>7</sup> HTR8/SVneo cells, using TRIzol® reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The cDNA was synthesized from 2.0 µg (10 µl) of total RNA using oligo-dT18 primer (0.1 µg; Invitrogen). Moloney murine leukaemia virus reverse transcriptase (200 U; Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and 25 U of RNAsin (ribonuclease inhibitor; Promega) were used in a total volume of 20 µl. Reverse transcription was performed using a Mastercycler® instrument(Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). Subsequently, real-time RT–PCR was run on a LightCycler® 2.0 instrument (Roche Diagnostic Systems, Branchburg, NJ, USA) based on general fluorescence detection with SYBR® Green-based detection chemistry (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan). The levels of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA were used to internally standardize the levels of mRNA. Primers for IDO were used as previously described:<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0300060513487642">27</xref></sup> IDO (forward) 5′-AGAGTCAAATCCCTCAGTCC-3′; IDO (reverse) 5′-AAATCAGTGC CTCCAGTTCC-3′ (Life Technologies, Shanghai, China). Primers for GAPDH were as follows: GAPDH (forward) 5′-GCACCGTCAAGGCTGAGAAC-3′; GAPDH (reverse) 5′-TGGTGAAGACG CCAGTGGA-3′ (Life Technologies). Real-time PCR was performed using SYBR® Green Real-time PCR Master Mix (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan). The cycling programme involved preliminary denaturation at 95℃ for 10 min, followed by 45 cycles of denaturation at 95℃ for 15 s, annealing at 56℃ for 20 s, and elongation at 72℃ for 10 s. Amplification and detection of contaminating genomic DNA was avoided by constructing one of the primers over an exon/intron boundary. The PCR products were separated on 1.5% agarose gel and visualized using ethidium bromide staining and ultraviolet light. In all cases, the PCR products were confined to a single band of the expected size (222 base pairs) for IDO. Sequencing of the different bands (Life Technologies) confirmed homology with the reported sequences for human IDO and GAPDH. The quantitative endpoint for real-time PCR, the threshold cycle (<italic>C</italic><sub>T</sub>), was defined as the cycle number at which fluorescence passed a fixed threshold, which was determined automatically by the LightCycler® system. The level of IDO relative to GAPDH was calculated using the equation 2<sup>−</sup><sup>ΔCT</sup>, where Δ<italic>C</italic><sub>T</sub> = (<italic>C</italic><sub>T IDO</sub> − <italic>C</italic><sub>T GAPDH</sub>) and the Δ<italic>C</italic><sub>T</sub> value was negatively correlated with the level of IDO.</p>

The tissue was washed in sterile DMEM/F12 and aseptically dissected using a standard microscope to remove endometrial tissue and fetal membranes. Small fragments of placental villi (15–20 mg wet weight) were teased apart and placed in a 24-well culture dish that was precoated with 0.2 ml diluted Matrigel™ Basement Membrane Matrix (3–4 mg/ml) (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA), polymerized at 37℃ for 30 min. Explants were cultured in either regular DMEM/F12 (with 100 mg/ml streptomycin, 100  IU/ml penicillin and 0.25 mg/ml ascorbic acid, pH 7.4), or DMEM/F12 with 1000 U/ml IFN-γ. Villous explants were kept in culture in a CO<sub>2</sub> incubator≤48 h at 37℃ in 5% CO<sub>2,</sub> as described above, and the conditioned medium was collected at 48 h for measurement of tryptophan and L-kynurenine concentrations. In all experiments, a single placenta was used. Triplicate explants were set up for each treatment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-0300060513487642"><title>Measurement of IDO activity by HPLC</title>
<p>The IDO activity was measured by HPLC as described previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0300060513487642">16</xref></sup> The medium that had been conditioned by culture with trophoblast villous explants or HTR-8/SVneo cells was deproteinized with 4% trichloroacetic acid. Total free tryptophan and L-kynurenine were assayed by HPLC (Waters 2695 Alliance System and Waters 2996 photodiode array detector; Waters, Milford, MA, USA) on a C-18 column (Zorbax C18, 250 × 4.6 mm, 5 µm; Agilent Technologies, Wilmington, DE, USA) eluted isocratically using a solvent of 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 4.0) with 1.0 M sodium hydroxide.

<p>First trimester placenta and decidua were obtained directly from healthy women undergoing legal termination of normal pregnancy (<italic>n</italic> = 40; mean ± SD age, 27.9 ± 4.1 years) and women with RSA (<italic>n</italic> = 26; mean ± SD age, 28.5 ± 4.7 years). There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of mean age.In general, IDO protein was restricted to the cytosol and could not be detected in the nucleus of cells. For the samples from normal pregnancies, there was strong IDO staining for trophoblasts. In 22/40 samples, all types of placental trophoblast cells (including syncytiotrophoblast, cytotrophoblast and invasive evCT cell columns) were stained strongly for IDO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0300060513487642">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0300060513487642">2B</xref>). In the remaining 18/40 samples there was strong staining for cytotrophoblast and invasive evCT cell columns, but no staining for syncytiotrophoblast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0300060513487642">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0300060513487642">2D</xref>). In addition, some IDO-positive cells were seen in the villous stroma; this was probably localized to macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0300060513487642">Figure 2D</xref>).

<p>Serving as an immunologically privileged tissue, the placenta (especially the syncytiotrophoblasts and evCTs) and the decidua play essential functions in pregnancy maintenance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0300060513487642">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0300060513487642"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0300060513487642">33</xref></sup> Increasing evidence suggests that IDO might induce immune tolerance by providing a low L-tryptophan environment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0300060513487642">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0300060513487642">12</xref></sup> Therefore, the detailed localization of IDO production and function in terms of mediating fetal–maternal tolerance at this site is worthy of further investigation. This current study demonstrated the precise distribution of IDO protein in placental trophoblasts from normal pregnancies. Interestingly, for some samples of normal pregnancy, it was the cytotrophoblasts rather than the syncytiotrophoblasts that demonstrated immunostaining for the IDO protein. To our knowledge, this is the first study to describe the characteristic localization of IDO in placental trophoblasts. For the other samples of placenta from normal pregnancies that were analysed in our study, the IDO protein was present in all types of placental trophoblast cells including syncytiotrophoblasts, cytotrophoblasts and invasive evCT cell columns, which was consistent with two other reports.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0300060513487642">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0300060513487642">18</xref></sup> In contrast, another two studies reported that there was no IDO staining in placental villi in first trimester samples, and that it was first detected at around 14 weeks of gestation and increased rapidly thereafter.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0300060513487642">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0300060513487642">20</xref></sup> The discrepancies may be due to individual differences, immune microenvironments and local cytokines such as IFN-γ, β-human chorionic gonadotropin, interleukin-4 and transforming growth factor-β,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0300060513487642">34</xref></sup> suggesting the complexity of IDO distribution and function. Moreover, technical differences may also account for the discrepancies, since immunohistochemistry is a highly specialized procedure affected by many parameters such as antibody preparations, tissue processing and blocking steps. Sedlmayr et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0300060513487642">19</xref></sup> used the same monoclonal antibody to IDO as Takikawa et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0300060513487642">35</xref></sup> at dilutions between 1 : 500 and 1 : 1000, whereas Hönig et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0300060513487642">22</xref></sup> used the same rabbit antiIDO polyclonal antibody as Munn et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0300060513487642">36</xref></sup> diluted to 1  : 1000. In this current study, after titration, mouse antihuman monoclonal antibody (clone 10.1) was found to be optimal at a dilution of 1 : 150. Moreover, we used paraffin wax-embedded tissue sections and heat-mediated antigen retrieval in citrate buffer, which was consistent with the methods of Sedlmayer et al.;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0300060513487642">19</xref></sup> in contrast to Kudo et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0300060513487642">17</xref></sup> who used Tris-ethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid for antigen retrieval, whereas Hönig et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0300060513487642">22</xref></sup> used frozen sections. Certain antigens are very sensitive to the retrieval methods used and these methodological differences may explain the discrepant results obtained. Future work will need to establish which factors regulate IDO protein levels at the fetal–maternal interface. Moreover, this current study found that cultured trophoblast villous explants showed an increased IDO activity when stimulated by IFN-γ, suggesting an important role for the invasive evCTs in pregnancy tolerance.</p>
<p>In addition, our current study found, as far as is known for the first time, that HTR-8/SVneo cells produce IDO protein and mRNA, and that IDO activity was increased by culture with IFN-γ. Similar findings were reported for evCTs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0300060513487642">22</xref></sup> Our current findings were compatible with the fact that the HTR-8/SVneo cell line was derived from an explant culture of human first trimester placenta and has the biomarkers of evCT cells <italic>in situ</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0300060513487642">25</xref></sup> In contrast, others have reported that trophoblast cell lines such as JAR and BeWo cells do not constitutively produce IDO.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0300060513487642">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0300060513487642">37</xref></sup> Therefore, the HTR-8/SVneo cell line might provide a valuable tool for the future investigation of the function and mechanism of IDO in the placenta.</p>
<p>The characteristic distribution of IDO in the trophoblasts and decidua has pointed to a critical role for IDO at the fetal–maternal interface. It has been shown that the placenta might be protected from immune rejection by maternal immune cells by means of IDO-dependent depletion of L-tryptophan.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0300060513487642">8</xref></sup> The levels of IDO protein at the fetal–maternal interface may generate a low L-tryptophan environment, which subsequently promotes immune pregnancy tolerance by inhibiting T cell and natural killer cell proliferation, or by inducing regulatory T cells and tolerogenic dendritic cells (DCs).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0300060513487642">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0300060513487642">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0300060513487642">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0300060513487642">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0300060513487642"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0300060513487642"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0300060513487642"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0300060513487642"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0300060513487642"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0300060513487642"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0300060513487642">45</xref></sup> It is possible that decreased activity or reduced levels of IDO protein may contribute to disorders of pregnancy such as RSA and pre-eclampsia.</p>
<p>Our findings that IDO protein immunostaining and levels of IDO mRNA in RSA were significantly lower than those observed in normal pregnancies were consistent with other work.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0300060513487642">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0300060513487642">23</xref></sup> Levels of IDO protein on both peripheral blood DCs and decidual DCs and monocytes were upregulated during normal pregnancy. Conversely, levels of IDO on DCs and monocytes after IFN-γ or cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 treatment were decreased in spontaneous abortion cases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0300060513487642">23</xref></sup> Munn et al<italic>.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0300060513487642">8</xref></sup> showed that 1-methyl-tryptophan (a pharmacological inhibitor of intestinal IDO administered to pregnant mice) could induce the loss of the fetus: rejection of the allogeneic fetus was accompanied by a unique form of inflammation that was characterized by T cell-dependent and antibody-independent activation of complement. However, a study reported that there was no association between IDO polymorphisms and susceptibility of Iranian women to RSA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0300060513487642">46</xref></sup> It is tempting to speculate that reduced IDO enzyme production or functional activity, rather than IDO polymorphisms, may contribute to RSA and the exact mechanism might be worthy of further investigation.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this current study demonstrated the characteristic distribution of IDO protein in the normal pregnancy placenta and deciduas. For the first time, IDO protein was found in cytotrophoblasts rather than syncytiotrophoblasts, in some of the samples and in HTR-8/SVneo cells. Significantly decreased levels of IDO protein and mRNA were observed in RSA samples, suggesting an important role for IDO in the maintenance of normal pregnancy. Therefore, the findings of our current study provide a basis for further research into the role of IDO in the immunoregulation of human pregnancy, and may open up an attractive drug target for the therapy of RSA.</p>
