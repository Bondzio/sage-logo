<p>Finland is a small Nordic country with a population of 5.3 million. The Finnish juridical system is manifestly rooted in the legal culture of Western Europe, with strong influences from neighbouring Nordic countries. Today, Finland enjoys an internationally high level of social security and equality, high social trust and political legitimacy, and low levels of penal repression.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1477370811424372">1</xref></sup> But this has not always been the case. During the 20th century, Finland experienced three wars (the 1918 civil war and the two wars against the Soviet Union between 1939 and 1944). These crises left their marks both on Finnish society and on criminal justice policy in the country.</p>
<p>Following a brief review of the development of criminological research in Finland, this article focuses on the normative, legislative and practical aspects of the evolution of penality in the country from the 1960s onwards, an era generally characterized by a decisive shift towards decarceration. The subtleties of this evolution are then uncovered by drawing a distinction between the period from the mid-1960s to the mid-1990s, on the one hand, and the period from the mid-1990s to date, on the other hand. The former period, it is shown, was consistently one of liberal reforms, whereas the latter began with a ‘punitive turn’ that was eventually counterbalanced by way of well-planned legislative measures of a progressive orientation. Attention is subsequently paid to trends in crime in Finland as compared with its Nordic counterparts, demonstrating that levels and patterns of crime in the country do not give cause for concern. The last core section of the article provides an overview of the Finnish system of criminal justice today, from justice officials and institutions to the system of sanctions and sentencing practice. The conclusion offers some brief remarks as to what the future of Finnish penality might hold.</p>
<sec id="section1-1477370811424372">
<title>Criminological research in Finland</title>
<p>As an academic discipline, criminology has a relatively weak position in Finland. Most criminological research to date has been conducted in agencies and institutes outside the university system.</p>
<p>A key actor in this respect has been the Institute of Criminology in Helsinki, which was established in 1963 by the Ministry of Justice. In 1974, the institute was renamed the National Research Institute of Legal Policy (NRILP) so as to signify the expansion of its research agenda to other areas of socio-legal research. A major focus of the institute since its founding has been the development of standardized indicators of crime, especially through self-report and victimization surveys; indeed, the institute’s annual report ‘Crime and Criminality in Finland’ has long been the standard up-to-date source of information for criminal justice organizations in the country. In 2001, reflecting the long-term emphasis placed in Finnish criminology on homicide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1477370811424372">Kivivuori and Lehti, 2011</xref>), the institute established a national homicide monitoring system in cooperation with the Police College. Another substantial part of the institute’s work has been focused on evaluations of law reforms, particularly as concerns sentencing, drug policies and mediation.</p>
<p>Turning to higher education, criminology is taught and criminological research is carried out in the context of other disciplines such as law, sociology, psychology, history and medicine. In Jyväskylä University, for instance, the department of psychology has since the mid-1960s been leading a longitudinal survey linking early childhood experiences to later criminal behaviour. The departments of sociology and social policy at Tampere University, meanwhile, have been hosts to research on criminal careers and control cultures in ‘borstals’, and psychiatric and medical criminology research has been conducted at the universities of Helsinki, Turku and Kuopio. All in all, academic criminology in Finland may be characterized as rich in content but thin in volume.</p>
<p>Although universities have remained uninterested in developing institutional structures for criminological research and teaching, other actors have moved in the opposite direction. In 1981, a new United Nations institute – the European Institute for Crime Prevention and Control, better known as HEUNI – was established in Helsinki, its primary objective being to serve as the European link in the network of institutes operating within the framework of the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Programme. Also, in the mid-1990s, a research institute was established by the Ministry of the Interior in connection with the Police College. Its focus is studies of the police and policing, but also economic and organized crime.</p>
<p>Special reference needs to be made to the fact that Finland participates in Nordic-wide scientific endeavours, including in the field of criminology. Examples range from the Nordic Criminal Law Committee, which operated during the period 1960–84 with the aim of harmonizing criminal law in the region, to the Scandinavian Research Council for Criminology, which was established in 1962 by the Nordic ministries of justice with the aim of furthering criminological research within member countries and advising Scandinavian governments on issues related to crime and criminal justice. Also, against the background of rising crime rates and growing public concern in all Nordic countries from the 1960s onwards, so-called Nordic Crime Prevention Councils were formed in each country, first in Denmark, Sweden and Norway and then, in 1989, in Finland. The Councils share the goal of promoting crime prevention at a local level, stressing social and situational prevention over criminal justice approaches, and underlining the importance of community participation (see, further, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1477370811424372">Aromaa and Takala, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1477370811424372">Knutsson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1477370811424372">Takala, 2005</xref>).</p>

<title>Major phases in Finnish penal policy</title>
<p>As is evident in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1477370811424372">Figure 1</xref>, Finland has a long history of high use of imprisonment. We may speak of three main phases in Finnish penal policy. The first, covering the period from the civil war of 1918 until the end of the war with the Soviet Union in 1945, was characterized by recurring social, political and economic crises – and great variation in the use of imprisonment. The second phase, known as the ‘age of reconstruction’, started in the early 1950s. Finland was still recovering from the war, paying war compensation and building the industrial infrastructures that formed the foundations of the welfare state that was to come. The criminal justice system lacked adequate resources and penal repression was higher in Finland than in its Nordic neighbours. This was all about to change during the third phase, from the 1960s onwards.</p>

<p>A heated social debate took place in the Nordic countries in the 1960s regarding the justifications for and outcomes of involuntary treatment in penal and other institutions. In Finland, criticism of the so-called ‘treatment ideology’ was combined with criticism of the overly harsh Criminal Code and the excessive use of custodial sentences. The resulting model became known as ‘humane neo-classicism’, and it stressed both legal safeguards against coercive care and the more general goal of promoting less-repressive measures. Thus, proportionality and predictability became the central principles in the field of sentencing; individualized sentencing and sentencing for reasons of general prevention or perceived dangerousness were retired (see, further, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1477370811424372">Anttila, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1477370811424372">Lahti, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1477370811424372">Lappi-Seppälä, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1477370811424372">Törnudd, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>More specifically, the aims and justifications of punishment shifted towards general prevention, although this concept was now understood in a different manner. It was assumed that general prevention could be achieved not through fear and deterrence but through the moral disapproval of crime that is inherent in punishment (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1477370811424372">Andenaes, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1477370811424372">Lappi-Seppälä, 1995</xref>). Correspondingly, it was thought that general prevention would be best served by a system of sanctions that focuses on the blameworthiness of the criminal act, but also follows procedures perceived as fair and just by all the parties involved. Instrumental compliance based on fear of sanction and sentence severity was given only a marginal role. Indeed, upper limits of proportionality were set on the sentences for each offence, without at the same time restricting the possibility of lenient sentencing (see, further, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1477370811424372">Hinkkanen and Lappi-Seppälä, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1477370811424372">Lappi-Seppälä, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Behind the shift in the strategies of criminal justice policy were more profound changes in the ways of conceptualizing the problem of crime and the role of the criminal justice system. Under the influence of social scientific scholarship, the aims of criminal justice policy were redefined in line with the aims of general social policy, and cost/benefit analysis was introduced into political thinking about crime and criminal justice. As a consequence of this, the scope of criminal justice policy was extended to include social welfare interventions, environmental planning and situational crime prevention. Punishment, once considered to be the primary form of criminal justice, came to be regarded as only one option amongst many.</p>

<title>Sentencing practices and legislative reforms</title>
<sec id="section4-1477370811424372">
<title>From the mid-1960s to the mid-1990s</title>
<p>Systematic and thorough reforms to sentencing legislation started during the mid-1960s and continued until the mid-1990s. They addressed both the general sanction system and specific offences. The substance of all major reforms, their effects on the use of imprisonment and their underlying sociopolitical causes are summarized and discussed briefly below.</p>
<p>The general structure of the sanctions system did not change during the period under consideration, and consisted of fines, conditional sentences and imprisonment. The rate of imprisonment declined as a result of the drop in the length of custodial sentences and the expanded use of fines and suspended sentences. In 1950, for example, the average length of custodial sentence imposed for theft was 12 months, whereas in 1971 it was 7 months and in 1991 it was 3 months. Similar changes occurred in relation to other common offences such as robbery, physical assault and drunk driving. Albeit initially the outcome of sentencing practice, the reduced use of imprisonment was also supported by legislative reforms from the 1970s onwards.</p>
<p>Legislation passed during the 1970s promoted the replacement of the option of short-term imprisonment with fines (although the monetary value of the latter rose), and extended the scope of suspended sentences by relaxing the relevant eligibility criteria. Also, restrictions were imposed on the role of previous convictions in sentencing by allowing for increased punishment only when recidivism implied increased culpability, and so-called ‘preventive’ or ‘secure detention’ for repeat offenders was confined to serious violent recidivists. As a consequence of these reforms, the caseload of fines and suspended sentences underwent significant growth, while the length of prison sentences for recidivist offenders (especially chronic property offenders) and the caseload of preventive detention dropped.</p>
<p>Furthermore, community service was introduced by law in the early 1990s. In order to ensure that it would function as an alternative to imprisonment without undermining the use of other non-custodial measures, provisions were made that commutation would be possible only in the case of custodial sentences already passed. Within a short space of time, community service grew to become an important alternative to custody (indeed, today it serves to replace around 35 percent of short-term prison sentences; that is, sentences of up to eight months of imprisonment). As concerns ‘back-door’ strategies to reduce the prison population, meanwhile, parole and other forms of early release were used on a routine basis. A series of reforms relaxed the eligibility criteria for release on parole, including reducing the minimum term of confinement required to 14 days, and imposed restrictions on parole revocation (see, further, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1477370811424372">Lappi-Seppälä, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Legislative reforms also focused on particular offences. Most notably, provisions were made in the 1970s that drunk driving should no longer be punished by way of imprisonment, but rather with conditional sentences and fines. As a result of this, the share of imprisonment among the sanctions imposed for drunk driving dropped dramatically, from 90 percent in the late 1960s to 20 percent in the mid-1990s. (Legislation also restricted the then widespread use of imprisonment for fine defaulters, the majority of whom were offenders originally sentenced for drunk driving.) Similarly, penalties for property offences were reduced, which caused the share of imprisonment among the sanctions imposed for property offences to drop from 50 percent to 25 percent, and the share of fines to rise from 20 percent in the mid-1970s to 50 percent in the mid-1990s. What may be termed the ‘de-penalization’ of drunk driving and property offences was reflected in prison statistics. In 1975, for example, 1000 prisoners were serving a sentence for drunk driving and 3000 for theft, but the corresponding numbers in 1998 had dropped to around 300 and 550. Furthermore, whereas two out of three prisoners had been sentenced for either drunk driving or theft in the mid-1970s, the corresponding share of these offences in 1998 had fallen to around one-third.</p>
<p>Regarding young offenders, provisions were made in the late 1980s and early 1990s to restrict the use of imprisonment to exceptional cases, as well as to reduce the minimum penalties for joyriding – an offence typically committed by young people. Thus, whereas in 1975 the caseloads of court-imposed prison sentences for juveniles (15–17 years) and young adults (18–20 years) were over 761 and 2204, respectively, the corresponding figures in 1995 were 117 and 827 (see, further, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1477370811424372">Lappi-Seppälä, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The liberalizing trend in Finnish penal matters from the mid-1960s to the mid-1990s was the result of a conscious and systematic process of policy-making over a long period of time. As mentioned earlier, policy choices were themselves supported by a normative shift that combined the pragmatic aims of criminal justice with ideas of fairness and respect for legal safeguards, thereby calling for greater investment in social and situational interventions. But what were the driving forces behind this normative shift and what were the conditions that made its translation into policy and practice possible?</p>
<p>Historically, penal liberalization in Finland coincided with the expansion of the country’s welfare system and radical positive changes in its economic conditions. From 1950 to 1970, for instance, Finland’s gross domestic product (GDP) increased by 125 percent, far exceeding the average growth of 75 percent amongst the countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) over the same period. Between 1960 and 1998, moreover, total public social expenditure increased in Finland by 18 percent as a share of GDP, compared with average growth of 13 percent amongst OECD countries. Finally, between 1966 and 1990, income differentials in the country (as measured by Gini coefficients) dropped by 8.3 points (from 33.4 to 25.1). In short, Finland was joining the Scandinavian welfare family in terms of its levels of welfare provision, economic prosperity and income equality.</p>
<p>Part of the explanation may also be found in Finland’s political and media culture. Rather than exploiting issues of crime and punishment for electoral gain, politicians of all colours had long exhibited a determination to bring down the rate of imprisonment in the country (see, further, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1477370811424372">Törnudd, 1993</xref>). Penal policy-making thus relied significantly on inputs by liberal-minded experts, but also drew inspiration from other Nordic countries; indeed, the reform work of the 1960s and 1970s in Finland was heavily influenced by the then intensifying cooperation between Nordic countries in legal matters, including criminal justice. The resulting structure of sentencing, which treated criminal sentencing as a non-exceptional area of judicial decision-making, may also be said to have functioned as a shield against any possible political pressures (see, further, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1477370811424372">Lappi-Seppälä, 2001</xref>). The national media, meanwhile, retained a relatively sober approach towards crime and punishment. Unlike their British counterparts, for example, the Finnish media tended to report crime by adopting a less emotional tone and providing research-based commentaries.</p>
<p>Lastly, but equally importantly, legislative reforms were accepted and supported in practice by the judiciary. Various training courses and seminars arranged for judges (and prosecutors) in cooperation with universities arguably played an important role in this respect.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1477370811424372">
<title>From the mid-1990s to date</title>
<p>The penal landscape of Finland has been less straightforward since the mid-1990s. The overall downward trend in the use of imprisonment continued until the late 1990s; indeed, the rate of imprisonment reached an all-time low in 1999, when the annual caseload of prisoners was 2743, or 53 per 100,000 population. During the period 1999–2005, however, the rate of imprisonment increased by 40 percent, up to 74 prisoners per 100,000 population. The figures have since dropped again to the levels of the mid-1990s: in 2010, for example, the rate of imprisonment was 61 per 100,000 population (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1477370811424372">Figure 2</xref>). What follows is a brief discussion of these fluctuations.</p>

<title>The punitive turn</title>
<p>A period of tougher penal policy started in the mid-1990s, with the passing of legislation that placed domestic violence (and other assault offences committed in private spaces) under public prosecution. As an immediate consequence of this, levels of crime reporting and court-imposed penalties both increased significantly. A series of similarly determined reforms were to follow in subsequent years, restricting non-prosecution in cases of domestic violence (in 2004) and increasing the minimum penalties for an array of offences, from rape (in 1999) and aggravated assault (in 2001) to human trafficking, procurement, child pornography (in 2004) and domestic violence (in 2010). Also, purchasing the services of a prostitute was criminalized in 2006, and the definition of rape was expanded in 2011 to include sexual intercourse with unconscious victims.</p>
<p>Against this background, the annual caseload of prisoners (including pre-trial detainees) increased by 42 percent between 1998 and 2005, from 2743 to 3888, largely as a result of a doubling of the average length of custodial sentence passed by courts. The steepest rise, in terms of both caseload and average sentence length, was for prisoners convicted of violent and drug offences (a notable increase also occurred in the case of fine defaulters). Whereas the number of newly sentenced drug offenders actually increased during the period at issue, the rise in the caseload of prisoners convicted of a violent offence was mostly a matter of increased sentence severity. For example, between 1998 and 2005, the average sentence length for aggravated assault increased from 17 to 22 months. Finally, there was a rise in the caseload of foreign prisoners (especially from Russia and the Baltic countries), which was in large part the outcome of the doubled average duration of custodial sentences given out by the courts to foreign defendants (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1477370811424372">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>The punitive legislative developments from the mid-1990s onwards have been explicitly modelled after Nordic (mostly Swedish) examples, which found strong advocates in high officials, including the then newly appointed Prosecutor General and the former Minister of Justice. More importantly, however, the 1990s were a decade of increased subjective insecurity and fear among the public. Nationwide victimization surveys indicate that there was a steady increase in the fear of violent victimization from 1988 to 1997, despite the fact that actual victimization rates either remained stable or, indeed, declined. It is plausible that fear of violent victimization was the displaced manifestation of socioeconomic insecurities. For example, the early 1990s in Finland witnessed a deep recession, which gave rise to significant cuts in welfare expenditure and widening income differentials, as well as the opening of the eastern border and an increase in the foreign population (see, further, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1477370811424372">Lappi-Seppälä, 2008b</xref>). In the meantime, crime reporting underwent substantial growth in the tabloid media (but not in televised news), especially in cases involving violence (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1477370811424372">Kivivuori et al., 2002</xref>). It may thus be said that punitiveness at the level of legislation functioned to give expression to insecurities largely unrelated to crime as such.</p>

<sec id="section7-1477370811424372">
<title>Counterbalancing the punitive turn</title>
<p>Further legislative reforms have been undertaken in more recent years, this time to counterbalance the punitive effects of previous legislation. This has been in accordance with the declaration of the Ministry of Justice that ‘control of prison rates’ is one of the key strategic aims of its policy plan for the years 2007–11. More specifically, whereas the earlier legislation addressed offence categories that are typically amenable to political exploitation (for example, sexual and violent offences), the latest legislative interventions have mainly addressed the criminal justice system as a whole. Focal points have included the intensification of local crime prevention networks, the promotion of fairness in sentencing, the expansion of community sanctions in lieu of short-term imprisonment, the integration of substance abuse programmes and social support with criminal sanctions, the enhancement of victim support services, and increased investment in and use of criminological research in political decision-making.</p>
<p>A few concrete examples follow. Emphasis has been placed once again upon reducing the number of fine defaulters in prison, for instance by excluding all cases of small fines (that is, under 20 day-fine units) from the provisions of imprisonment for fine default, and by reducing the maximum duration of default imprisonment from 90 to 60 days. Also, in 2006, ‘preventive detention’ was abolished and replaced with a system that enables courts to order serious violent offenders to serve their custodial sentence ‘in full’; namely, without the possibility of release on parole. New prison law has been introduced, meanwhile, to protect the constitutional rights of prisoners, including the principles of minimum intervention and harm minimization (see, further, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1477370811424372">Lappi-Seppälä, 2009</xref>). A new early release scheme (probation supervision) has also been established for long-term prisoners nearing their normal conditional release, and parole revocation has been restricted to cases where violation of the licence consists of an offence that would result in imprisonment of at least three months (and, even then, the remainder of the original sentence to be served usually needs to exceed three months). Finally, a new supervision order (electronic monitoring) was introduced in 2010 to replace short-term sentences of up to six months of imprisonment for offenders who do not qualify for community service owing to alcohol-related or other social problems. At the time of writing, however, the enforcement date of this order had yet to be finalised.</p>
<p>As a result of these reforms, between 2005 and 2010, the annual caseload of prisoners declined by 15 percent (even though the caseload of pre-trial detainees remained stable), and the caseload of sentenced prisoners declined by 17 percent. The latter decline was mainly to the result of the drop in the caseload of prisoners sentenced for fine default (by 122 percent), a property offence (by 32 percent), drunk driving (by 23 percent) or a drug-related offence (by 19 percent). Also, the average duration of custodial sentences passed by courts decreased, especially in the case of fine defaulters, although it increased almost by five months in the case of sexual offences. On the other hand, the caseload of foreign prisoners increased by 40 percent.</p>

<title>Crime trends: Nordic comparisons</title>
<p>The profound change in the use of imprisonment in Finland over recent years naturally raises questions about its effects on crime rates. There are several well-known methodological difficulties in establishing causal relations between crime and imprisonment rates. However, a comparison between Nordic countries, which share strong social and structural similarities but differ sharply in terms of their penal histories, provides an unusual opportunity to examine how variation in penal policies and practices relates to crime rates. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1477370811424372">Figure 3</xref> shows the rates of reported crime and imprisonment in Finland, Sweden, Denmark and Norway, from 1950 to 2010. Despite the striking similarity in crime trends, there is a stark difference in the use of imprisonment. That Finland has substantially reduced its rate of imprisonment as of the mid-2000s has not upset the symmetry among Nordic countries as concerns crime rates. Once again, therefore, the penological axiom is confirmed that crime and imprisonment rates are fairly independent of one another.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1477370811424372">Figure 4</xref> provides a summary of trends in reported crime in Finland, Sweden, Denmark and Norway during the period 1980–2009. The figures cover the total number of offences reported (excluding traffic offences), as well as the subtotals for theft, assault, robbery, rape and homicide. The overall trend in reported crime has been similar in all four countries. Following an increase during the 1980s, rates have since remained stable (in Finland, Norway and Sweden) or have declined (in Denmark). Theft declined in all four countries from the early 1990s onwards, but, with the exception of Denmark, assault has increased significantly since the early 1980s. Rape remained stable in Denmark, increased moderately in Finland and to a somewhat greater degree in Norway, but tripled during the 2000s in Sweden (although this seems to reflect a change in reporting practices; compare, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1477370811424372">NTU, 2009</xref>: 36–37). Data on homicide show that Finland has two to three times as many homicides as the other Nordic countries. This has long been the outcome, almost exclusively, of alcohol-related violence. For example, the rate of alcohol-related lethal violence in Finland is four to five times higher than in Sweden, whereas the rate of non-alcohol-related homicide is roughly similar in the two countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1477370811424372">Kivivuori and Lehti, 2011</xref>). In any case, however, there has been a clear downward trend in lethal violence over recent years.</p>

<p>Further information on crime trends in Finland and the other Nordic countries can be drawn from the International Crime Victimization Survey (ICVS). During the period 1995–2004, for example, Nordic countries scored lower than other European countries on robberies and most property offences but higher on sexual assaults and non-sexual assaults and threats. In intra-Nordic comparison, Finland had low rates of property offences and average rates in terms of non-sexual assaults and threats (see, further, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1477370811424372">Van Dijk, 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>The Finnish system of criminal justice today: an overview</title>
<sec id="section10-1477370811424372">
<title>Justice officials and institutions</title>
<p>Finland has a unified police force that operates under the supervision of the Ministry of the Interior. The country is divided into police districts with a considerable degree of independence in terms of budget responsibility, personnel policy and prioritization of activities. The prosecuting authorities are separate from the police, and prosecutors are appointed career civil servants with legal education. Prosecutors have the power to impose fines and are allowed not to prosecute even if the facts of the case are clear. There is no plea-bargaining at the prosecution stage, and cooperation with the police may result in more lenient treatment only when it concerns offences committed by the cooperating party.</p>
<p>Turning to the court system, it comprises local courts, regional appellate courts and the Supreme Court. Courts enjoy constitutionally granted independence, although organizationally they operate under the Ministry of Justice. Like prosecutors, judges are appointed career officials. Criminal procedure is mainly accusatorial, with public prosecutors bearing the burden of proof. Prosecutors, defendants and victims have the right to appeal; indeed, victims have traditionally had a strong position in the process, including an unlimited right to press charges. Compensation claims are dealt with during criminal proceedings, although compensation orders are not classed as criminal sanctions. In most cases of violent offences, victims receive compensation directly from state funds.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1477370811424372">
<title>Sanctions</title>
<p>The Finnish constitution forbids the use of the death penalty, as well as any form of degrading and inhuman punishment more generally. The principal forms of punishment in Finland are the following: fine, community service, and conditional and unconditional imprisonment.</p>
<p>Fines are imposed as day-fine units, in order to ensure that the severity of this sanction is the same for offenders with different economic backgrounds. Thus, although the number of day-fine units is determined on the basis of the seriousness of the offence, the monetary value of a day-fine unit depends on the financial situation of the offender. The number of day-fine units varies between 1 and 120, and the monetary value of a day-fine unit is roughly half the offender’s daily income after tax. The majority (around 60 percent) of court cases are dealt with by fines. Failure to pay a fine may result in imprisonment (default imprisonment) through separate proceedings.</p>
<p>Community service is imposed only in place of unconditional imprisonment. Its duration may vary between 20 and 200 hours. Four conditions need to be met in order for the offender to be given a community service order: first, that the offender himself or herself consents to the order; second, that the length of the custodial sentence already passed does not exceed eight months; third, that the offender is deemed capable of carrying out the community service order (a ‘suitability report’ may be required of the Probation Service by either the prosecuting authorities or the judiciary); and, fourth, that prior convictions do not disallow the use of a community service order. If the conditions of the community service order are violated, the court normally passes a new sentence of unconditional imprisonment.</p>
<p>Sentences of imprisonment of up to two years may be imposed conditionally, provided that ‘the seriousness of the offence, the culpability of the offender as manifested in the offence, or the offender’s previous convictions do not require unconditional imprisonment’. Young offenders under the age of 18 may be sentenced to unconditional imprisonment only if special reasons call for this option. If conditional imprisonment alone is not considered to be a sufficient sanction for the offence at issue, an unconditional fine may be imposed in addition. Also, if the length of the sentence is between one and two years, a short community service order (between 20 and 90 hours) may be added to it. Young offenders under the age of 21 (at the time of the offence) may be placed under supervision if this is considered ‘justified in view of the promotion of the social adjustment of the offender and of the prevention of new offences’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1477370811424372">2</xref></sup> Conditional imprisonment entails the suspension of the custodial sentence for a probationary period of one to three years. If during this period a new offence is committed for which the court imposes a custodial sentence, the offender can be ordered to serve his or her original sentence in prison. Finnish courts annually pass around 15,000 sentences of conditional imprisonment, and between 700 and 800 conditional sentences are revoked each year.</p>
<p>Sentences of imprisonment may be imposed on an unconditional basis either for a determinate period (between 14 days and 12 years for a single offence, or up to 15 years for several offences) or for life. In practice, life imprisonment is used only in murder cases, and life-sentenced offenders actually spend around 12–14 years in prison. More generally, prisoners in Finland are released on parole after serving one-half or two-thirds of their sentence. Sentences of unconditional imprisonment are served in either closed or open establishments. There are 13 closed and 18 open prisons, all of which are funded and run by the state. There are no plans to introduce prison privatization, not least because it would contradict paragraph 124 of the Finnish constitution that any ‘task involving significant exercise of public powers can only be delegated to public authorities’. Prisons are fairly small in size: the largest closed units hold over 300 prisoners, while the smallest ones can accommodate 40–50 prisoners. Open prisons hold around 25 percent of the current prison population, and are in practice institutions without walls – prisoners are obliged to remain in the prison area but there are no fences.</p>
<p>Victim–offender mediation offers a possible alternative to the official criminal justice routes. An agreement or settlement between the offender and the victim may result in the waiving of charges by the prosecutor, as well as in the waiving or mitigation of punishment by the court. Provincial governments are obliged to make mediation services available in their region, in cooperation either with the municipal authorities or with other public or private partners. The process of mediation can be triggered by any of the parties involved (although participation is voluntary) at any point between the commission of the offence and the execution of a sentence. In complainant offences, successful mediation automatically means that the prosecutor drops the case. In non-complainant offences, by contrast, successful mediation is not binding for the prosecutor. In 2007, the total number of criminal offences undergoing mediation was 9000. Of these, 80 percent concerned either minor property offences or minor forms of assault and battery. More generally, agreement or settlement is reached in the majority (around 60 percent) of referrals, and an average of 90 percent of contracts (most of which entail monetary compensation to victims) are fulfilled.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1477370811424372">
<title>Sentencing practice</title>
<p>Roughly speaking, fines cover 60 percent of all court dispositions in Finland. Community service and conditional imprisonment are used in 5 percent and 25 percent of cases, respectively, and unconditional imprisonment covers the remaining 10 percent. The median length of unconditional prison sentences is 4 months and the mean is 10 months, the difference being due to long prison sentences meted out for serious offences.</p>
<p>The average length of custodial sentence for homicide is just below 10 years (although, as mentioned earlier, murder cases may also be dealt with by life imprisonment). Basic forms of rape are usually punished with 2-year prison terms, and aggravated rape with 4–5 years of imprisonment. The majority of cases of basic assault are punished by fine, whereas aggravated assault is punished either by 1–2 years of conditional imprisonment or by 2 years of unconditional imprisonment. Basic theft is usually punished by a fine or 2–3 months of conditional or unconditional imprisonment, whereas aggravated theft commonly leads to 1 year of unconditional imprisonment or to a somewhat shorter conditional prison term. Punishment for basic robbery is similar to that for aggravated theft, but aggravated robbery leads to unconditional imprisonment of 2–3 years in the overwhelming majority of cases. Penalties for drunk driving depend on the level of the offender’s blood alcohol content (BAC) at the time of the offence. If the BAC is below 1.2 mg/ml the offender is fined, but if the BAC exceeds 1.2 mg/ml then the penalty is either a conditional prison term of 15–45 days or, for repeat offenders, community service or an unconditional prison term of 2–4 months. Finally, drug consumption is punished with a fine (20 day-fine units), and distribution and trafficking of small quantities of drugs are punished with either a fine or a short prison term (conditional or unconditional). The distribution and trafficking of large quantities of drugs are treated as aggravated drug offences and are punished with unconditional prison terms of 2–10 years (the mean being 3.5 years).</p>

<title>Concluding remarks</title>
<p>Over the past 100 years Finnish penal policy and practice have gone through three major phases. The first reflected struggles in severe social and political crises, and the second was one of normalization and recovery. The third phase began in the 1960s, with the reformulation of the principles guiding criminal justice against the background of a strengthening welfare state. Today, Finnish penal policy and practice can be taken to reflect the Nordic example, a pragmatic and non-moralistic approach that treats measures against social inequality and marginalization as helping to counter crime as well.</p>
<p>But, just like other Nordic states, Finland has suffered a deep economic crisis during the past two decades or so, with cuts in the public sector, a general scaling-down of welfare provisions, increases in income differentials and growing social inequality. Furthermore, the Nordic region has not been immune to the global ‘punitive turn’. Granted, punitive trends in the region are generally ‘softer’ in type and lesser in scale when compared with trends elsewhere in Europe and beyond, but this does not detract from the fact that they exist (see, further, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1477370811424372">Balvig, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1477370811424372">Tham, 2001</xref>). Finland, as we saw earlier, experienced such trends for a brief period of time, from the late 1990s to the mid-2000s. The question of whether this was an exceptional moment in contemporary Finnish penality or will be repeated in the near future remains open.</p>
<p>An optimist would point out that very few of the background social, political, economic and cultural conditions that explain the rise of mass imprisonment in such countries as the United States and Britain apply to Finland. In particular, political culture in Finland continues to encourage negotiation and to appreciate expert knowledge, and the social and economic security granted by the Nordic welfare state model may still function as a bulwark against public fears and penal populism. A pessimist, on the other hand, might argue that neoliberalism has been gaining ground in Finland since the early 1990s, and will tighten its grip in the years to come. If so, and as some signs from the other Nordic countries indicate, Finland may be bound to experience intensified punitiveness.</p>
<p>However, making predictions about the evolution of penal policy and practice is a risky business. This applies especially to Finland in the present political situation and after the victory of right-wing populists in the national elections of April 2011.</p>
