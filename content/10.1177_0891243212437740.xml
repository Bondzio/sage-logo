<p>I’m sure I’m not the only sociologist of gender, sex and sexuality who considers events on my college campus and wonders, “Where is feminist activism?” Clearly, social networking media and online petitions give us some sense of the fundamental “issues,” but this type of activism is sometimes generationally lost on me (and I suspect, many colleagues). In the flesh, face-to-face interactive consciousness-raising seems almost like a quaint throwback. That is, in part, why I was so taken with Chris Bobel’s qualitative, interpretive, feminist analysis of menstrual activism, a little known body-centered movement. Menstruation is perhaps the first introduction to a life course of varied body shame that includes pubic hair, flappy vaginas, saggy breasts, giggly buttocks, muffin-tops and stretch marks, and is not often considered a crucial area of activism for feminism or pedagogy for gender studies. In the revelatory voice that peppers her readable and, at times, funny account, Bobel reflects on how others have questioned the relevance of this research topic. Couldn’t she find something more crucial to feminist/gender political activism and epistemology, she was asked.</p>
<p>Luckily for sociologists of social movements, gender, sex and sexuality scholars, qualitative methodologists, and medical sociologists, she prevailed. When done well, little compares with a feminist interpretive qualitative research study in its ability to capture the breadth of indigenous knowledge from subcultures. Through her four years of fieldwork, Bobel finely honed her methodological skills using Weberian <italic>verstehen</italic>, or empathetic understanding to maintain rapport with a heterogeneous group of informants, while at the same time preserving a commitment to social justice. Her descriptions of various menstrual actions and workshops are fascinating and richly evocative.</p>
<p>To establish a backdrop that informs contemporary menstrual activism, Bobel considers the periodization of feminism through the second and third wave and the legacy of divisions that are now evident. Her analyses, which begin and end the book, are incredibly useful for those interested in the contemporary history and epistemology of feminism. Furthermore, it is deeply validating to see how the “us versus them” language of the third wave both denigrates historical accomplishments and leads to possibilities of intervention.</p>
<p>The majority of the book details Bobel’s participant observation of the two wings of the movement—the feminist spiritualists and the radical menstruation activists. The feminist spiritualists, perhaps the less sympathetically drawn, emerge in part from the women’s health movement, the consumer rights movement, and the environmental movement. Most aligned with second wave’s cultural feminism, feminist spiritualists hold workshops to increase body literacy and ceremonies to celebrate women’s fertility, with souvenirs for purchase including jewelry, clothing, and statues. On the other hand, the radical menstruation activists mobilize to engage with critical consumption and to reject the corporatist medicalized model through culture jamming, radical cheerleading, DIY teach-ins and ‘zines (among other practices). These punk/queer activists reject the FemCare industry for their corporate greed and exploitive practices, as well as the feminist spiritualists for their essentialism.</p>
<p>Bobel also investigates the limitations of the movement as racially homogeneous. In one chapter, she examines the overwhelming whiteness of the menstrual activists in her sample and at the events she attends. This chapter will be particularly useful to those interested in intersectional analysis as it carefully takes the reader through alternative interpretations of why whiteness eclipses all people of color activists in the movement. Deeply committed to reflexivity in the research process, Bobel acknowledges her own racial standpoint as constraining the nature of her data collection processes. Furthermore, using informant interviews and building on the scholarship of a wide array of feminists, her discussion of African American women’s relationship to their vaginas and their sense of respectability is a significant contribution to the literature.</p>
<p>One area I wish Bobel had more thoroughly explored is the possible role of internalized misogyny by activists and Bobel herself. This examination would have been particularly salient in the discussion of menstruators – a move away from the term “girl or woman” as synonymous with menstruation. Bobel does discuss the degendering of menstruation as a powerful and productive step in the movement, influenced by the queer and trans-orientations of the radical menstruation activists. However, some of these arguments are more academically situated and lose some of the lived experiences of informants and the affective qualities of self-loathing that would be so useful to tease apart.</p>
<p>Perfect for gender studies courses, particularly undergraduate courses, <italic>New Blood</italic> is guaranteed to generate very lively discussions and opportunities for engaged critical pedagogy.</p>
