<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>A 17-year-old, right-handed male sustained a wrist injury in a moped accident. His dominant hand was trapped between the handlebar and handbrake handle, which resulted in a hyperflexion injury of the wrist. Initial radiographs and subsequent CT scan revealed a capitate fracture in which the proximal fragment was displaced dorsally and rotated 90°, in combination with a dislocated, coronal triquetrum fracture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753193412446777">Figure 1</xref>). Through a dorsal approach, the joint capsule was found stretched with a minor ulnar tear. The joint capsule was opened with preservation of the dorsal radiotriquetral and dorsal intercarpal ligaments. There were still some soft tissue attachments to the capitate fragment. The dorsal and proximal parts of the scapholunate and lunotriquetral ligaments were undamaged, except from haemorrhage around the lunotriquetral ligament. After accurate reduction both fractures were stabilized with headless compression screws.</p>

<p>The wrist was immobilized in a short arm cast for 4 weeks. A removable orthotic was used between range-of-motion exercises for an additional 4 weeks. At 1 year follow-up, the patient was able to perform any previous activity without limitation. His active wrist range of motion was 70° flexion and 75° extension. Grip strength was 50 kg. X-ray demonstrated that the fractures had healed with no signs of osteonecrosis or degenerative changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753193412446777">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<p>The majority of perilunate fracture-dislocation injuries emerge from a high-energy fall onto an outstretched hand, resulting in hyperextension of the wrist, ulnar deviation, and intercarpal supination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193412446777">Mayfield et al., 1980</xref>).</p>
<p>A transverse scaphoid fracture combined with a displaced fracture of the capitate neck was first described by Jones and later popularized by Fenton as scaphocapitate syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193412446777">Jones, 1955</xref>). It represents a rare form of stage II, greater arc, progressive perilunar instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193412446777">Mayfield et al., 1980</xref>). Besides the scaphoid fracture, it consists of a capitate neck fracture with 90 to 180° rotation of its proximal pole. It is assumed to occur during hyperextension due to impact between the neck of the capitate and dorsal rim of the radius. When the wrist is brought back into neutral position, an instable proximal capitate fragment displaces volarly with varying degree of rotation.</p>
<p>The existence of a reverse perilunate instability pattern, which originates ulnarly and progresses towards the radial side of the wrist, has previously been suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193412446777">Apergis et al., 2001</xref>). So far, the trauma mechanism advocated for such injuries includes hyperextension and radial deviation of the wrist, together with intercarpal pronation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753193412446777">Viegas et al., 1990</xref>). However, in several previous reports, the patients have not had any recollection of the position of the hand at impact.</p>
<p>In this particular case, the patient did not release his grip on the handlebar at impact, and according to his description, sustained a hyperflexion injury to the wrist. With such a trauma mechanism, the triquetrum and capitate could fracture due to ulnar styloid impaction and impact on the volar ridge of the radius, respectively. The coronal triquetrum fracture may have released strain on the dorsal radiotriquetral ligament and, in part, explain why it was not torn during the forceful hyperflexion.</p>
<p>For treatment of carpal fracture dislocations, CT scan is helpful in order to ensure accurate diagnosis due to its ability to help visualize occult carpal fractures and demonstrate any fracture dislocation. To prevent nonunion and restore normal carpal biomechanics, displaced carpal fractures require anatomic reduction and stable fixation.</p>
<p>This is the first report of a dorsally displaced capitate neck fracture combined with a coronal shear fracture of the triquetrum. It supports the existence of a reverse perilunate instability pattern, which in this case was caused by severe hyperflexion of the wrist.</p>
