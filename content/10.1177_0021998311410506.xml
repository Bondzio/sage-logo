<abstract>
<p>In liquid composite molding (LCM) processes, the constitutive behavior of fibrous reinforcements has a strong bearing on the choice of manufacturing parameters and final part properties. In many LCM processes, the fibrous preform is subjected to loading and unloading, the latter occurring during both filling and postfilling phases of the manufacturing process. Fiber reinforcements display inelastic behavior with rate-dependent and rate-independent components and this must be modeled accurately over several load–unload cycles in order to accurately simulate such processes. An important feature of the material behavior is its unchanging response to successive load cycles once a large number of load cycles has been applied. Inelastic effects such as fiber–fiber frictional sliding occur during loading as well as unloading and the inelastic deformation remaining after successive cycles appears unchanged. The model presented is developed within a thermomechanical framework and reproduces such behavior using a single internal variable to account for inelasticity. It is compared to cyclic loading experiments on three fiber reinforcements of different architecture, showing that the model is effective in capturing the repeatable compaction behavior of debulked preforms and serves as a starting point for the incorporation of effects such as cyclic softening and rate effects through additional internal variables.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0021998311410506" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>The term ‘liquid composite molding’ (LCM) is used to describe a family of composite material manufacturing processes in which a dry reinforcement fibrous preform is placed in a mold and then impregnated with liquid polymeric resin. The mold construction and the manner in which the resin is forced through the fibrous preform distinguish the various LCM processes from one another. LCM processes are out-of-autoclave processes and are capable of producing high-quality parts of complex geometry, which has led to their adoption in the aerospace, automotive, marine, and civil industries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998311410506">1</xref></sup> LCM processes can be broadly categorized into rigid-mold and flexible-mold processes. Typically, the tools employed in rigid-mold processes are heavy and expensive, so such processes are suited to high-volume production runs where low cycle times are at a premium. The basic rigid-mold LCM process is resin transfer molding (RTM), where the mold is closed to the final part thickness and then the resin is injected. Compression resin transfer molding (CRTM) is a variation of RTM where filling commences before the preform has been compacted to its final thickness; then the part is completely infiltrated by ‘squeeze’ flow as the mold is completely closed. There is potential for injection times to be reduced through this two-step filling approach as filling takes place when the preform is not fully compacted and hence more permeable to resin flow. In applications where rigid molds are prohibitively expensive, such as for larger parts and/or smaller production runs, flexible-mold processes such as RTM-light and vacuum assisted resin infusion (VARI) are increasingly employed. In RTM-light, one or both sides of the RTM tool may be replaced by a less rigid mold – perhaps itself a composite part – of lower cost. For VARI, one side of the mold is rigid and the other is a flexible vacuum bag.</p>
<p>Compaction of the fibrous preform is a common requirement among all the LCM processes, as a means of achieving a high fiber volume fraction component and the associated improvements in mechanical properties. In rigid-mold processes (RTM and CRTM), deformation of the mold is assumed negligible and knowledge of the constitutive behavior of the fibrous reinforcement is critical in the prediction of tooling forces, optimal process parameter selection, and tooling designs. In contrast to the rigid-mold processes, the constitutive response of the preform contributes significantly to mold deformation in RTM-light and VARI. This in turn determines final part thickness and fiber volume fraction and hence the viability of flexible-mold processes, particularly as cost-effective alternatives to rigid-mold processes.</p>
<p>Furthermore, significant mold and preform deformations can occur after the initial dry compaction as a result of resin flow. Resin flow initially relieves the preform of compaction stress, but the preform is typically reloaded in the postfilling stage as resin pressures equilibrate. For this reason, constitutive models that account for several cycles of loading, not simply a single initial compaction, are required for accurate simulation of reinforcement compaction. Furthermore, an effective technique known as debulking, where the preform is subjected to a number of cycles of loading before filling, is sometimes used. This can help lead to increased fiber volume fractions for flexible-mold processes such as in the controlled atmospheric pressure resin infusion (CAPRI) process,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998311410506">2</xref></sup> or to the necessity of relatively low compaction forces in rigid-mold processes.</p>
<p>The complex inelastic behavior of fibrous materials is well documented and differs from metals or granular media in a number of ways. These materials exhibit a nonlinear stiffening response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021998311410506">3</xref></sup> and inelastic deformation appears to occur continuously with load, showing no apparent transition from elastic to inelastic behavior.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021998311410506">4</xref></sup> Inelasticity is manifested in the basic load–unload response as hysteresis and cyclic loading leads to an evolution in material behavior, as inelastic effects are accumulated with successive cycles. Somashekar et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021998311410506">5</xref></sup> showed that both rate-dependent and rate-independent components of inelastic deformation are present in significant proportions when the preform is subjected to cyclic compaction.</p>
<p>The constitutive model development presented in this study is a step toward producing a simulation of a generic LCM process. For this purpose, the model must capture the salient features present in compaction experiments, including time and load history dependence, yet be practical to characterize experimentally. The accuracy of the model within full-scale simulations should not be undermined by excessive complexity or computational expense. Finally, the model should have a physical basis, allowing it to provide insight into the physical processes, which contribute to the constitutive behavior.</p>
<p>A number of approaches have been adopted in the past to model individual aspects of the material response, namely elasticity, viscoelasticity, or rate-independent plasticity – as well as combinations of these behaviors. Notable examples include the pioneering work of van Wyk,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021998311410506">6</xref></sup> who produced a nonlinear elastic compaction response by considering a random assembly of fibers forming a collection of bending units. Carnaby and Pan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021998311410506">7</xref></sup> extended this probability–distribution-based approach to produce a rate-independent inelastic response by accounting for frictional sliding of fibers. Such probability-based models do not use explicit geometric representations, so are computationally inexpensive. Other micromechanical models involve explicit geometric representations of fabrics at the mesoscale.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021998311410506">8</xref></sup> Individual fibers within the tow could be modeled similarly to account for interactions within the tow; however, at present this appears prohibitively computationally expensive.</p>
<p>An alternative to the micromechanical approaches mentioned earlier involves the treatment of fibrous materials as continua. Inelastic effects can be considered within a continuum mechanics framework using hypothetical components such as dashpots, springs, and friction blocks, without the computational expense associated with micromechanical models. Several models have reproduced aspects of the permanent deformation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021998311410506">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021998311410506">10</xref></sup> and time-dependent response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021998311410506">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021998311410506">12</xref></sup> observed in experiments.</p>
<p>The thermomechanical model proposed in this study uses a continuum approach, but lies within a framework, which ensures that thermodynamic requirements are satisfied. Physical processes that contribute to the material behavior are described using state variables, their evolution governed by the laws of thermodynamics. Within the continuum-based approach, two models of note are those of Kelly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021998311410506">10</xref></sup> and Comas-Cardona et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021998311410506">9</xref></sup> In these models, the material behaves inelastically as it is loaded, so that plastic strain is accumulated. On unload, however, the material behaves elastically. Although the observed nonlinear hysteretic response is accounted for in this way, inelastic mechanisms such as sliding and rearrangement of fibers occur during both loading and unloading, and inelastic unloading is not accounted for in these models. The model presented adopts a similar modeling framework as that employed in Kelly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021998311410506">10</xref></sup> and in addition, accounts for inelastic behavior, which occurs during unloading in order to achieve a repeatable response to cyclic load, as a precursor to a more comprehensive model where features such as cyclic evolution in behavior and rate effects are accounted for.</p>

<p>For isothermal deformations, the power of stresses applied may be expressed as

where σ and <italic>d</italic> are the stress and deformation rate tensors, respectively, their inner product being the rate of applied work.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021998311410506">13</xref></sup> The constitutive behavior of the material is defined by two potential functions, the Helmholtz free energy potential, Ψ, and the dissipation rate, Φ. Ψ gives the amount of energy stored within the material, whereas Φ is the rate at which energy is lost from the material through dissipative processes such as friction. The second law of thermodynamics states that Φ must be nonnegative.</p>
<p>The definition of potential functions Φ and Ψ is a point of difference between the thermomechanical approach and classical models in plasticity or viscoplasticity, which define material behavior through a combination of yield functions and flow rules. In the thermomechanical framework, these functions follow directly from the definitions of Φ and Ψ and thermodynamic restrictions are automatically satisfied.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0021998311410506"><title>Fiber reinforcements</title>
<p>The reinforcements considered are textile fabrics, formed from bundles of fibers, termed tows. Tows are woven, stitched, or arranged randomly to form the fiber reinforcement. A number of physical processes contribute to the complex behavior of fiber reinforcements. Several authors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021998311410506">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021998311410506">7</xref></sup> acknowledge the contribution of fiber bending to the material behavior, whereby strain energy is accumulated in the material. This energy may also become frozen into the material if fibers become locked into bent configurations and, due to friction, do not fully unbend upon unloading; this manifests itself as a permanent deformation upon unloading. Fibers exhibit frictional behavior, providing an avenue for dissipation. Rate effects may also arise from dissipative time-dependent rearrangement of fibers within the tow. Unlike other materials that are commonly considered to be inelastic, many fibrous materials do not exhibit a clear yield point; inelastic processes such as fiber–fiber sliding and fiber rearrangement appear to occur instantaneously and continuously with load.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0021998311410506"><title>The repeatable state</title>
<p>When fibrous materials are subjected to cyclic compaction loading, for example, repeatedly loading to some given fiber volume fraction and unloading again, they exhibit a debulking response. That is, the material softens (peak compaction stress reduces) with successive load cycles to the same volume fraction with the extent of additional softening decreasing with each cycle. Eventually, the response reaches a single hysteresis loop, which appears unchanging with successive cycles.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021998311410506">5</xref></sup> Key features of this load-cycle-invariant behavior include significant hysteresis as well as an apparently constant value of permanent deformation remaining after successive cycles. The goal of this study is to develop a model of this repeatable behavior as a precursor to a more comprehensive model, where cyclic softening and rate effects are accounted for.</p>

<p>In complex LCM processes, deformation of the preform is mostly one dimensional. Even in the compaction of a 3D part, the deformation of the preform is predominantly in the through-thickness direction. Some shear deformations may occur but these are not accounted for here; it is assumed that these have a small effect on the through-thickness compaction response. Therefore, we focus on a simple 1D implementation of the model presented in Section ‘A one-internal variable model,’ where tensor quantities for state variables ε<italic><sub>ij</sub></italic> and α<italic><sub>ij</sub></italic> and applied stress σ<italic><sub>ij</sub></italic> can be characterized by scalars ε, α and σ, respectively. We consider the cyclic loading illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998311410506">Figure 1</xref>, segments of which bear relevance to various LCM processes. In rigid-mold processes, the fiber reinforcement is only subject to a single compaction, with no unloading. In flexible-mold processes, the infiltration of resin following compaction causes unloading, followed by reloading postfilling as resin pressures equilibrate. New variations to these processes, such as the CAPRI,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998311410506">2</xref></sup> also employ cyclic compaction in order to achieve increased fiber volume fractions at atmospheric compaction stresses.

</fig></p>
<p>For each cycle in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998311410506">Figure 1</xref>, the gap between platens is reduced at a constant rate, making contact with the preform. The same velocity is maintained, compressing the preform until the designated fiber volume fraction is reached; the preform is then unloaded at the same rate. During unload the platen lifts off the preform, allowing it to recover under zero-stress conditions. This load regime thus involves both stress-driven and strain-driven periods of loading. For a generic LCM process simulation, it is important that compaction models can be expressed in both stress-driven and strain-driven forms, allowing both types of loading to be simulated. In flexible-mold processes, the loading is stress-driven, while in rigid-mold processes, the loading is predominantly strain-driven; periods of stress-driven preform recovery occur when the mold loses contact with the preform.</p>
<sec id="sec8-0021998311410506"><title>Solution process</title>
<p>The solution procedure for displacement-controlled compaction of an inelastic material model is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998311410506">Figure 2</xref>. Such a compaction is typical of rigid-mold processes, whereas flexible-mold processes are more appropriately simulated using a stress-controlled compaction solving <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula14-0021998311410506">Equation (14)</xref>. The algorithm employs an ordinary differential equation (ODE) solver in order to solve stress- or strain-driven equations for the incremental response of the preform, given previously in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula13-0021998311410506">Equations (13)</xref> and (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula14-0021998311410506">14</xref>).

<p>Suppose the position of the compressing platen for an 1D compaction is given by <italic>h</italic><sub>platen</sub> and the height of the preform by <italic>h</italic><sub>preform</sub>, the gap between platen and preform is then Δ<italic><sub>h</sub></italic> = <italic>h</italic><sub>platen</sub> − <italic>h</italic><sub>preform</sub>. This forms the basis for criteria to determine the driving variable for the simulation, that is, stress or strain.</p>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998311410506">Figure 1</xref>, a displacement-driven compaction profile is considered. Initially, the platen descends toward the preform – so that before contact, no load is applied to the preform. Once the platen has come into contact with the preform <inline-formula id="ilm15-0021998311410506"><mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mml-math15-0021998311410506"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>Δ</mml:mi><mml:mi>h</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>Δ</mml:mi><mml:mi>h</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>&lt;</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, the stress applied to the preform is computed using the strain-driven evolution <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula13-0021998311410506">equation (13)</xref>. Between successive loads, the platen lifts off the preform and the preform experiences zero stress. There is hence no evolution in strain during this period, according to <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula14-0021998311410506">Equation (14)</xref>.</p>
<p>For constitutive models that incorporate rate effects such as viscoelastic recovery, stress-driven evolution in preform strain occurs when the platen has lifted off the preform. When liftoff has occurred, the period of stress-driven recovery before next contact that occurs, between the loading platen and preform, is first estimated. The evolution of stress-driven preform thickness is solved for this period and the solution then examined a posteriori for interference between the platen and the preform. In this way, the algorithm can take advantage of ordinary differential equation solvers, which have adaptive-step-sizing functionality. If interference between the platen and preform is detected, the solver reverts to solving strain-driven evolution in preform stress. Similarly, the time for liftoff is estimated a priori in order to exploit adaptive step sizing, then the solution is examined a posteriori for platen liftoff. A similar estimation and a posteriori check may be performed in switching between elastic and inelastic formulations.</p>

In all the experiments, a large number of load cycles were applied, ranging from 20 to 60 cycles, such that a repeatable compaction response was obtained in the later cycles of each experiment. The compaction experiments are also carried out at a range of compaction rates, demonstrating that the emergence of repeatable behavior after a large number of cycles is independent of compaction rate.

The material initially exhibits a softened response with successive cycles; however, the extent of this softening diminishes and by the end of the 60th cycle, the material has been debulked and hence exhibits repeatable behavior.

<p>The model is fitted to the stress vs. fiber volume fraction curve for the last load–unload cycle for each experiment, by which time the material appears to exhibit a repeatable response to successive loads. One such cycle is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021998311410506">Figure 4</xref>. Material parameters were ascertained as follows: First, parameters for the first free energy function are prescribed heuristically. As a starting point, one may appeal to studies such as Robitaille and Gauvin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021998311410506">3</xref></sup> and models such as Kelly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021998311410506">10</xref></sup> for parameters suited to describing the nonlinearity of the material response. Parameters for the dissipation function can be prescribed through examination of experimental data as follows: The parameter σ* gives the stress at which the load direction may be changed while maintaining inelastic behavior in accordance with <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula12-0021998311410506">Equation (12)</xref>, and the parameters <italic>k</italic>, ν, and <italic>w</italic>, termed <italic>hysteresis shape parameters</italic>, are determined by examination of the hysteresis observed over a load–unload cycle. Note that ν and <italic>w</italic> control the extent of hysteresis near the stress limits of 0 and σ*, respectively, and <italic>k</italic> is a scaling factor for the amount of hysteresis present over the whole load cycle.

<p>Once the first free energy and dissipation functions have been defined, the elastic strain is known for any applied stress. Given experimentally determined data for strain against stress, or equivalently fiber volume fraction against stress, a family of parameters for the second free energy function may be derived in order to explicitly match the experimentally observed total strain, ε* at a designated applied stress of σ*, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021998311410506">Figure 4</xref>. In this way, the number of free parameters in the second free energy function is reduced from two to one. Finally, the value of the free variable in Ψ<sub>2</sub> is computed by minimizing the objective function:
<disp-formula id="disp-formula15-0021998311410506"><label>(15)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311410506-eq15.tif"/></disp-formula>

<p>The objective function is expressed in terms of volume fraction and effective stress residuals in order to better match the nonlinear form of the experimental data for stress against volume fraction. The subscripts ‘load’ and ‘unload’ indicate the portions of experimental data from which the objective function is computed. The weighting factors <italic>W</italic><sub>load</sub> and <italic>W</italic><sub>unload</sub> allow the overall quality of fit to be refined by altering the contributions of load and unload data to the objective function.</p>
<p>Although a number of model parameters (Ψ<sub>1</sub>: <italic>E</italic>, <italic>m</italic>; Φ: <italic>k</italic>, <italic>v</italic>, <italic>w</italic>) are prescribed heuristically, the quality of the final model fit is insensitive to small changes in these due to the nature of the optimization approach employed in computing the parameters for Ψ<sub>2</sub>, (<italic>H,p</italic>).</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998311410506">Figure 5</xref> shows good agreement between model and experiment for all the three material architectures. This suggests that the forms of the free energy and dissipation functions chosen are capable of reproducing the behavior exhibited by both random and ordered architectures. Furthermore, the results show that the assumptions made regarding the physical mechanisms, which underpin the material behavior are successful in reproducing key features of fibrous preform behavior, including nonlinearity, hysteresis, and inelastic behavior, on both loading and unloading; the mechanisms include energy storage by fiber deformation and energy dissipation through frictional slippage.</p>
<p>As observed experimentally, the model behaves inelastically during both loading and unloading, returning to an identical volume fraction after each load–unload cycle. The model does not account for cyclic evolution in behavior but successfully captures the repeatable response of debulked fiber reinforcements. This is an improvement over previous models for compaction developed within a thermomechanical framework such as that by Kelly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021998311410506">10</xref></sup>, where the material behaves elastically as it is unloaded and is hence inherently unable to replicate the behavior of debulked preforms. Another model featuring elastic unloading is that by Comas-Cardona<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021998311410506">9</xref></sup>; critically, these models neglect the occurrence of dissipative processes such as fiber–fiber sliding and rearrangement within tows as the material unloads.</p>
<p>Compared to existing micromechanical models that account for inelastic behavior during unloading, such as that of Carnaby and Pan's,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021998311410506">7</xref></sup> the model presented adopts a continuum thermomechanical approach in place of a micromechanical basis and as such captures the response of a variety of fiber architectures and provides additional insight into energy storage and dissipation within the material. Using the current model, further investigations may be carried out into the evolution in inelastic strain, dissipation, and locked energy as the material is loaded and unloaded. Such studies may provide additional insight into the behavior of fibrous materials and new methods of model validation.</p>
<p>Characterization of the model presented has been shown to be straightforward; even though there are eight independent parameters for the model, many of them are easily determined from a single cyclic compaction experiment. The presented optimization approach then provides an objectively determined best-fit for the model to experimental data. The method has been successfully used to match model data for a range of materials, each subject to different load histories to elicit a repeatable compaction response. Improved correlation between simulation and experiment data may also be achieved by extending the parameter estimation approach employed for Ψ<sub>2</sub> to other parameters in Ψ<sub>1</sub> and Φ, currently prescribed through heuristic methods.</p>
<p>The expression of the model presented in stress- and strain-driven incremental forms allows the model to be simply incorporated into simulations of both rigid-mold and flexible-mold LCM processes. However, to increase its applicability, a number of improvements can be made to the model, and these need to be investigated. For example, since in most industrial LCM processes the number of compaction cycles applied is insufficient to achieve a repeatable compaction response, a more comprehensive model suitable for the simulation of generic LCM processes would include cyclic softening behavior (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998311410506">Figure 3</xref>).</p>
<p>Another important improvement would be to account for the lubricating effects of the resin, which can be important for some fiber reinforcements. Without considering these effects, the current model will overestimate tooling forces in rigid-mold processes following resin infiltration. In flexible-mold processes, the effects of inelastic unloading of the preform due to resin infiltration may be investigated, while first neglecting the lubricating effects of the resin.</p>
<p>In order to account for the cyclic softening behavior that precedes repeatable behavior during cyclic compaction experiments, an additional internal variable may be introduced into the model. As a consequence, the inelastic state of the material would no longer be uniquely defined by the inelastic strain and the evolution of the additional internal variable would account for cyclic evolution of the compaction response.</p>
<p>Finally, an important aspect of inelastic behavior that has not been addressed in the current model is rate dependence. Rate-dependent inelasticity as well as cyclic evolution in inelastic effects are important in the compaction regimes typical of LCM processes, where the number of load cycles applied is insufficient to elicit a repeatable response from the preform. The debulked response of reinforcements is also dependent on the compaction rate, with not all compaction rates giving rise to the same repeatable response.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021998311410506">16</xref></sup> It is postulated that rate effects arise from the rearrangement of fibers at the intra-tow scale, suggesting that future models incorporate a variable describing the state of rearrangement within tows.</p>

<sec id="sec13-0021998311410506" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>A rate-independent thermomechanical model for fibrous materials exhibiting repeatable hysteretic behavior has been presented. A single internal variable, equivalent to inelastic strain, was used to account for energy storage through fibers becoming locked in strained configurations. Continuous frictional dissipation, characteristic of fiber slippage mechanisms observed during compaction, is incorporated through the chosen form of the dissipation function. The model is validated against compaction experiments performed on glass fiber reinforcements of three architectures: PWF, CSM, and twill weave. A simple compaction simulation is presented and model parameters are ascertained through the use of an optimization algorithm, yielding excellent fits for all the three architectures tested. Further work needs to be carried out in order to incorporate rate-dependent effects and cyclic evolution in material response, which are prevalent in compaction regimes typically present in LCM processes. These features are required in a compaction model for the accurate simulation of flexible-mold LCM processes (VARI, RTM-light), and will provide significant benefits when addressing the rigid-mold variants (RTM, CRTM).</p>

<title>Derivation of incremental constitutive relations</title>
<p><xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula8-0021998311410506">Equation (8)</xref> provides an incremental constitutive relation between stress σ<italic><sub>ij</sub></italic>, total strain ε<italic><sub>ij</sub></italic>, and inelastic strain α<italic><sub>ij</sub></italic>.

<p>In order to eliminate <inline-formula id="ilm16-0021998311410506"><mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mml-math16-0021998311410506"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>α</mml:mi><mml:mo>˙</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mrow><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> from this relation, one first expresses the yield function (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula12-0021998311410506">Equation (12)</xref>) in incremental form, providing the consistency condition governing inelastic flow:

<p>Rearranging (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula17-0021998311410506">Equation (A2)</xref>) gives:

<p>Substituting <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula18-0021998311410506">Equation (A3)</xref> into <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula16-0021998311410506">Equation (A1)</xref> yields the strain-driven incremental constitutive relation:

<p>Inversion of this relation yields the stress-driven incremental constitutive relation:
