<p>Michael Robbins, a Boston-based psychoanalyst, has published extensively on theoretical issues ranging from creativity and linguistics to the nature and treatment of borderline and psychotic disorders. The present volume embraces all these issues in a comprehensive treatise on the role of what he calls the “primordial mind” as it manifests itself in persons, sick and well, in Western and non-Western cultures. As he defines it, “Primordial mental activity (PMA) is a normal way that mind works that is qualitatively different from thought. . . . PMA is fully functional at birth and is the ‘normal’ form of expression and learning in infancy. . . . PMA does not transform into thought. Rather, under ordinary circumstances thought comes to have regulatory control over PMA . . .” (pp. 208–209). PMA is central in “spiritual” and “creative” mentation and has a dominant role in “non-Western” cultures, while “thought,” which develops later, is characteristic of Western societies.</p>
<p>Robbins is explicit and extensive (at times repetitively) in tracing the development of his concepts from a wide scope of influences, particularly psychoanalytic ones ranging from Freud, Klein, and Mahler to Kernberg, Bion, Matte Blanco, Jung (!), and, more recently, Daniel Stern. In his thoughtful chapter comparing and contrasting the theories of Freud and Klein he attributes to both the view of infancy and childhood as a “psychotic state.” This would, I think, more accurately apply to Klein than to Freud. He blames Freud for “trying to create neuroscientific terminology” (p. 31) like id and ego, unaware, apparently, that it was Strachey who with that aim in view coined these terms in his translation of Freud’s “Es” and “Ich” (properly, as in Makari’s <italic>Revolution in Mind</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0003065113486189">2008</xref>], “it” and “I”).</p>
<p>More immediately, he cites at length his indebtedness for his cross-cultural understanding to a Maori shaman of his acquaintance who serves as a therapist in an unnamed mental health clinic and who has educated him in the role of “primordial mind” in “spiritual” cultures. Robbins persuasively elaborates this theme in his chapter on dreaming, where he contrasts the Western idea of dreaming as a sleep phenomenon and the non-Western experience of dream states as a part of waking life, subject to interpretation and integration into daily living by the shaman. A later chapter is devoted to the relevance of recent research studies in neuroscience that, he acknowledges, “do not prove or disprove the existence of PMA but are highly suggestive” (p. 204).</p>
<p>Buttressing his argument with clinical illustrations, Robbins maintains that the mind of the psychotic is dominated by PMA: “PMA in psychosis is literal rather than figurative, it is concrete and enactive. In the psychotic state ordinary rules of logic, causality, time and space are not appreciated. . . . Contradictory opposites are not distinguished” (p. 135). These are, of course, long-recognized characteristics of psychotic thinking as defined by Kraepelin as well as of primary process as defined by Freud. In contrast, in “spiritual” cultures PMA is collectively shared, monitored and validated by the shaman or his equivalent. I think that Robbins understates the point that it is precisely the matter of consensual validation that, in any culture, distinguishes “deviant” or “psychotic” mentation from what is seen as “normal” thought.</p>
<p>To this reader, the distinctions between Robbins’s PMA and Freud’s primary process are less than decisive. Particularly is this true given Holt’s reassessment of Freud’s concept (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0003065113486189">1967</xref>): “From the beginning of his life,” says Holt, “a child is . . . exposed to culture, and to a special child’s subculture, which contains numerous crystallized and far-reachingly organized primary-process systems . . . incorporating recognizable forms of the primary process [that] seem to be the favorite fare of young children in other societies besides our own. . . . I find it a fascinating possibility that they also comprise an indoctrination into consolidated and extended forms of the primary process, a cultural transmission of ways to dream, to fantasy consciously and unconsciously, even to construct delusional systems and other kinds of symptoms . . .” (p. 375).</p>
<p>Similar questions arise regarding Robbins’s views on creativity. He devotes the better part of a chapter to an extended survey of the work of Bob Dylan, whom he sees as prototypic of the creative mind. Like the shaman, Dylan has “some degree of disciplined, integrated control over entry into and exit from his PMA states” (p. 127). It is difficult to distinguish this formulation from that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0003065113486189">Ernst Kris (1952)</xref>, who, Robbins acknowledges in passing, conceived the concept of “regression in the service of the ego” as central to the creative process. Further, his dichotomy between “Western thought” and “non-Western PMA” seems rather arbitrary; the “non-Western” native, however “spiritual,” must surely rely on “Western”-style thinking without help from the shaman in the management of much of his everyday adaptive activity, just as vast numbers of “Western” thinkers find comfort in the PMA of prayer, the Holy Sacrament, faith healing, and other religious and “spiritual” rituals.</p>
<p>Robbins has clearly thought long and seriously about these matters. His scholarship and the range of his learning are impressive, and in his clinical sections he lays out their implications for work with seriously disturbed, even psychotic, patients that can be helpful to analysts who, like him, have the courage to venture into this difficult realm. Overall, however, much of what he appears to see as theoretical innovation seems to me to consist of pouring old wine into new, if rather elaborate, bottles. His “cross-cultural perspective” does serve as a reminder, to clinicians and researchers alike, of the need for familiarity with the subject’s cultural background and the specific metaphors of his language in offering diagnostic judgments or therapeutic interventions and interpretations.</p>
