<p>Many people are left incredulous when they first come across the figures revealing widespread geographical variations in health care practice. This incredulity can be followed by a stream of questions - does the variation signify inequity of access, or differences in health service efficiency, or is there some acceptable explanation such as differences in population levels of disease?</p>
<p>John Wennburg has devoted himself to researching these practice variations. I cannot think of anyone who has contributed more to documenting the extent of the variations, and to providing a framework for helping us differentiate between acceptable and unwarranted variation. His book “Tracking Medicine” starts by describing the moment that he first discovered the small area variations around Vermont, and then proceeds to tell of his subsequent career investigating them across the United States. However, this potted history is merely one of the narrative threads which together document how he and his colleagues slowly pieced together the various causes of practice variation. He illustrates how large variations cannot be explained by population differences, and that it is typically not patient preferences that lie behind the variations we observe but rather the preferences of health care professionals or the supply of services such as hospital beds. From this, Wennburg builds an argument about how US health services should be reformed if unwarranted variations in health care are to be reduced. It is a compelling argument but, as Wennburg notes, the extent of geographical variations in health care utilisation across the US are much the same as they were 30 years ago. This salutary lesson suggests that practice variations will be with us for a while yet, together with all the inefficiencies and inequities that they imply. I would have wished for an additional chapter that placed the US situation into the broader experience of other developed countries. Nonetheless, the book will repay anyone who takes the time to read it.</p>
