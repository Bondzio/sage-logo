<p>Do you understand what is meant by the term “health literacy”? Phil Mackie, Lead Consultant, Scottish Public Health Network and Consultant in Public Health, NHS Health Scotland, suggests that the term can often be confusing and leave us wondering what we are actually suppose to do about it</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>I first heard the term used back in the 1980s, when I was a graduate student. Back then, it seemed to be used primarily about the relationship between health status and the literacy – for which read (no pun intended) capacity of the individual to comprehend written materials. In any given year there would be a handful of studies published in peer-reviewed journals exploring the readability of health education materials or patient information sheet. Such studies often concluded that the average reading age of such materials was rather high for many in the population with “low literacy”. Yet, then again, health literacy also seemed to be applied to considerations of training health care professionals. In some cases they would consider the levels of literacy in emerging academic health care settings in what were called “developing countries”. In others the concern would be about the necessary literacy to be willing to adopt new technologies for information delivery (aka computers).</p>
<p>Then in the 1990s, as the number of papers mounted to a hundred or so a year, the new themes emerged. The predominant theme may be characterised by studies which looked at the effects of literacy – and particularly low literacy – on patient compliance with treatment regimes. This would manifest in various health care settings, though all were exploring how low literacy was a <italic>barrier</italic> to accessing necessary health care. At the same time, a separate theme could be discerned: that of improving literacy, or finding mechanisms (including using aid such as hand puppets or computers) to enhance understanding as a means of increasing patient participation in health and health care decisions. I can even recall that some of these papers were promoting the view that the more literate a patient, the more likely they would be to being partners in the caring relationship.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1757913911431043">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, it is more recently that my confusion has grown. Not only has the number of papers published since 2000 increased year on year, but also the variation in what is meant by the term “health literacy” has increased. A scan at the type of papers being published in peer reviewed journals suggest that poor health literacy is a cause of health inequalities, it engenders poor compliance in health care professional and self-management regimes, it reduced access to necessary health care interventions, it contributes to ill-judged decisions about health care by patients, and the list goes on. But these types of outcomes cannot simply be the consequences of low or poor literacy? If they were, improving basic literacy would have improved health outcomes long ago and clearly that has not happened. That health literacy is a barrier to effective health care delivery and efficacious health care consumption is clearly not in question.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1757913911431043">2</xref></sup> But how can we make progress when it is such an all encompassing issue? And where the evidence suggests that direct interventions to improve literacy and improve health have had limited impact? <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1757913911431043">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Reflecting on three decades of research into health literacy, it is possible to see the emergence of a complex concept. But it also may show the basis of an approach to aid addressing health literacy. At its simplest level, health literacy has three components:</p>
<list id="list1-1757913911431043" list-type="order">
<list-item><p><italic>Literacy</italic>: a lack of capacity to read, write, communicate, or solve problems which affects the ability of an individual to gain necessary knowledge of health and health systems;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Comprehension</italic>: a lack of capacity to understand how health and health care services are structured and operate to meet health and health care needs and how they can be accessed; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Participation</italic>: a lack of capacity to follow a course of treatment or self-management that will improve health and wellbeing, or change behaviour to prevent disease processes starting or progressing.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>These components may not be anything new, but they do help to clarify what the purpose of any interventions to promote health literacy and prevent the consequents of its absence for individuals within a wider population, as well as for the public health and health care professionals who work with them.</p>
<p>It may be old fashioned, but it is almost possible to recognise a primary, secondary and tertiary preventative approach could be applied to such components. So we can take action to improve general literacy and specific health literacy. At the same time, for those who have a reduced capacity in health literacy we can act to militate against the consequences of reduced comprehension and also put in place measure which can improve participation in health and health care.</p>
<p>Health literacy is not a new concept, though it does seem to have developed over time into something of a complex one. Perhaps if we keep in focus what we are trying to do to improve literacy, comprehension and participation in our communications about and for health and health care we will not go far wrong.</p>
