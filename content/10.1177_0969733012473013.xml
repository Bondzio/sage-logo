<abstract>
<p>This short article reflects the author’s engagement with nursing ethics. The experience of the global market is used to highlight the current practice of working to guidelines and laws rather than professional experience. The need for personal and professional responsibility is stressed as a significant counterbalance to instability in people and societies.</p>

<body>
<p>Somewhat overdue in 2006, <italic>Nursing Ethics</italic> carried a summary that I had made of the changes that were evident over the first 10 years of the journal’s existence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0969733012473013">1</xref></sup> Twenty years of publication now calls for something more or different than a statistical analysis of numbers and topics of articles, and I am very pleased to have been invited to contribute to this.</p>
<p>Although ethics as a subject and ethics teaching and learning are no longer novel topics in nursing as they were some 20 years ago, a new aspect is now emerging. Nursing students are more likely now to say, ‘first let me learn all that I need to pass my exams, and then I will think about ethics if there is any time left’. This reflects to some extent what has been happening globally.</p>
<p>In the last 30 years or so, the concept and reality of the market have dominated all our lives. The market was generally considered to be beyond or above ethics. As long as people used the tools of the market, the world was going to be equal and everyone had a share. What is now becoming obvious is that the principles of the global market rest on local values and local communities. Many of these values were overlooked or considered too parochial. Perhaps that lack of understanding of the intrinsic way a market works is now becoming obvious in the erosion of the stability of society, of people looking after themselves first and only much later after anybody else. Ethics has been trying to be a corrective over the same period, but often as an outsider and as an add-on, not as something absolutely intrinsic to the market. It seems that we are now seeing another corrective, with the emphasis on responsibility, dignity and care. We see this in the kind of grassroots movements that are springing up everywhere, such as the ‘Occupy’ movement (Occupy Wall Street; Occupy London Stock Exchange) and the many networks for social action. In one way or another, everyone has been affected by the spectacular misuse of powers by the media, banks and bankers, churches, big business and big pharma and authoritative institutions of many kinds. Each time some wrongdoing surfaced, there were protests and enquiries, and with each protest, the word ‘responsibility’ is being heard more loudly and studied more carefully. ‘The buck stops here’ is an example of responsibility, but that is not enough. People do not only have to do good but they also have to be good, that is, they have to work and live out of personal and corporate values that are integral to how to deal with each other.</p>
<p>Responsibility is a big aspect of nurses’ work and is much wider than the legal responsibility of working the necessary hours and to the declared skills and capacity. Ethical responsibility engages with individuals, the profession and the wider community in which nurses are situated.</p>
<p>As in the early days of <italic>Nursing Ethics</italic> when authors tried to describe and argue for various kinds of ethics (care, virtue, principle-based ethics), in the general ethics literature at present, various types of responsibility are described and dissected. One such type is ‘remedial responsibility’, which means the responsibility one has in remedying or addressing a situation. This can sometimes concern the person responsible for causing an inappropriate event or being linked to a wronged or harmed party.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0969733012473013">2</xref></sup> The type of responsibility required in such situations is detailed in this category.</p>
<p>Another area that has been written about is ‘outcome responsibility’. In an article in the <italic>Journal of Global Ethics</italic>, Stan van Hooft<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0969733012473013">3</xref></sup> (who has often written in the nursing literature) questioned whether aid should be given to poor people on the basis of global justice or on the basis of humanitarian assistance, that is, on the basis of caring about others as human beings, and therefore, on the basis of a principle of humanity. He says that ‘it is because we care about others as human beings that we pursue justice for them and the alleviation of their avoidable suffering’; hence, both principles are involved and neither is prior to the other. Responsibility here describes the arguments and actions necessary for ethical outcomes. Very similar arguments apply in nursing.</p>
<p>As market forces demand easy production processes, there is a plethora of rules, laws and guidelines to work to, making the job foolproof. I consider that as in part robbing nurses of their professional caring capacity and responsibility. They have no choice but to work to the rules and laws, no longer to professional expertise, judgement and initiative. An often-heard comment is that today nursing is just a job and that there is nothing vocational about nursing any more. I do not subscribe to this view, because looking after sick and suffering people is not something one can do for long unless there is some element of caring about people to it. However, if too many rules and regulations stifle professional practice and individual care, then the profession is likely to become a job, depleted of initiative. Issues of resources, and hence the market, are inevitably reasons for diminishing care.</p>
<p>Professional care is clearly bound up with teaching and learning of ethics, personal and professional autonomy, and leadership. Where nurses are supported in ethical practice by making professionally independent judgements, their institutions become more ethical, enabling more staff, at any level, to behave more caringly and more ethically. It does not mean that rules and regulations are overlooked or disregarded, but that nurses recognise them as simple boundaries, and professional work is always to push the boundaries further out. To be able to do that, and to be able to think and argue professionally, demands more than a few lectures on ethics here and there. It demands ‘ethical resilience’ (S. Monteverde, personal communication). This means more than simply knowing a few principles. Ethics is not an add-on, but has to be written through nurses, the profession and indeed through the whole of society, like ‘Brighton’ is written through a stick of rock (a stick-shaped boiled sugar confectionery, commonly sold at seaside resorts in the United Kingdom, like Brighton, with the name of the town or a pattern embedded throughout its length, visible at both ends and any point where broken). Ethics is not something that is learned when there is any time left or put on or discarded like clothing, but it is truly intrinsic to all interaction.</p>
<p>Over its lifetime, studies in <italic>Nursing Ethics</italic> have shown and increasingly confidently argued that one type of ethics (care, virtue, etc.) is not enough for practice, but that many approaches to ethics are necessary for holistic practice. It was a surprise, therefore, to come across a website called REBEL, which stands for ‘Responsible Business – European e-Learning Module’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0969733012473013">4</xref></sup> that advocated an ethics of care for modern businesses. The website gives no names and no date, but lists all its collaborating institutions. On its home page, it states, ‘Feel free to browse, read, reflect, use, try out, share, add and comment’. Some of the text about the module on ‘Introduction to ethics, resilience and care’ is intriguing, given that it is aimed at business:
<disp-quote>
<p>Looking from a planetary perspective (including all life, present and future) we have to acknowledge that much of the present global free market economy is characterised by (unwitting or deliberate) irresponsible behaviour. The increasingly deregulated global market and the financial system on which it is built, are exploitative in nature: there is no drive to take care of people, resources and ecosystems. The talk is very much about rights and freedoms, not about responsibilities and duties.</p>
<p>… we have to admit that this is an unhealthy and dangerous world view. What is badly needed is an ethics of care; not just as a corrective (and therefore often dismissed) afterthought with economic decisions, but as (and at) the heart of a new world view. This means a paradigm shift in how we look at business responsibility: no business charter should be able to contradict the Earth Charter. [This declaration of fundamental principles for building a just, sustainable, and peaceful global society for the 21st century will be used as one of the inspirational forces for this course module.]</p>
<p>Care is about extending our field of attention and empathy to much more than ourselves, our personal development and the small circle we live in. One of the daring challenges is to re-envision ourselves as part of an intricately interconnected web of life that we are vitally dependent on. Ethics, viewed in this way and as an integral part of a much broader world view, is not the powerless afterthought it all too often seems to be now. An ever more complex system of (ethical) codes and regulations and the near impossibility of monitoring compliance and the lack of power to impose sanctions on non-compliance, will not do for the future. It lacks the inner drive of an ethics of care.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that this ethics of care is a key part in a holistic world view that in itself questions the current tendency to split up reality into ever more specialised and disconnected fields. Care is about connection.</p>
</disp-quote>This reinforces what was mentioned above about both remedial and outcome responsibility. Responsibility connects people. Only in specific circumstances are nurses responsible <italic>for</italic> patients and clients, but in all circumstances they are responsible <italic>to</italic> them, which is important to understanding care at every level. This includes the care given to colleagues, and especially to students, at every level. When care is shown in how we treat each other, the care becomes intrinsically ethical and care can spread further out. Rules and guidelines still play an important role, but personal support and adequate freedom to express professional care and to learn and improve care are hallmarks of an ethic of care. Any situation where humanity and social justice are fostered reflects the kind of ethics that is ‘virtuous’ in the sense of being concerned with communication, empathy, vision and leadership. They are the skills of connection, of personal contact, personal and professional engagement, respect, kindness, the ability to care about and for others, working in and with teams and understanding how teams work, and mentorship. My instinct is that these aspects and areas will fill at least some part of the pages of <italic>Nursing Ethics</italic> in the next 10 years.</p>
