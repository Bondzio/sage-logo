<abstract>
<p>The present study was designed to pilot test an adjusted version of a questionnaire, used in earlier studies with college music students, to determine opinions of college music faculty on the topic of private lesson teaching. Full-time tenure-track college music faculty, with primary appointments in applied music at two universities in the United States, were contacted for the project. Thirty-two of 51 completed the task with no negative comments about the format, focus or specific questions in the instrument. Results were similar in many ways to previous student responses, and this group felt strongly that they liked teaching, training for teaching is important, and that their applied music lesson students would likely teach someday themselves. They enjoyed talking about pedagogical issues with students and liked the challenges of teaching musicians. Future research with this instrument should focus on larger groups with delineations in specialty area, faculty appointment, institution type/size, teaching assignment, and global representation.</p>

<body>
<p>In departments, schools, and colleges of music at the over 600 institutions of higher education accredited in the United States (USA) by the National Association of Schools of Music (NASM), as well as the hundreds of other institutions not accredited by NASM, teachers of instruments and voice meet one-on-one with students to teach the art of performing music. In spite of the expense inherent in this type of instruction, these “private lessons” are still seen by many as the best way to teach an individual how to properly sing or play music. This system of teaching applied music study has not changed much in hundreds of years, and the apprenticeship nature of this model has not decreased in popularity, or been supplanted by what some might consider more efficient methods of instruction, in spite of growing economic pressure on educational institutions.</p>
<p>Watching a fine teacher in action is one popular way to identify the best in pedagogical approaches. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0255761413488712">Duke and Simmons (2006)</xref> did just that by watching over 25 hours of videotaped lessons given by three master teachers in private lesson settings. Their analysis of the tapes identified 19 strategies these teachers had in common. Even though the students participating in these lessons were all considered to be excellent players already, the researchers identified the common elements used by these teachers for these outstanding students as “. . . teaching-learning principles that are generally accepted by the discipline . . .” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0255761413488712">2006</xref>, p. 16). Duke and Simmons state that the “. . . goals of teacher preparation must be defined by a clear picture of the very best of instructional practice. Whether our discipline has yet defined such a picture is arguable” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0255761413488712">2006</xref>, p. 16).</p>
<p>Band, orchestra, and choir programs in K-12 schools in the USA, particularly middle and high schools, have had success in teaching groups of students to perform music at a relatively high level. But even with younger students, the acknowledged approach to learning the intricacies of musical performance at the highest levels of achievement most often occurs in private lessons. As a result, musicians teaching in music stores, private homes, churches, community centers, and public schools (after the regular school day has finished for children) engage in this time-honored apprenticeship towards the mastery of musical performance. The surprising thing is not that this activity continues so consistently across cultures, but that so little research has been done on the topic. When MENC: The National Association for Music Education awarded their first “Senior Researcher” award in 1988 to Clifford Madsen, he identified in his acceptance speech (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0255761413488712">Madsen, 1988</xref>) basic areas “. . . that need to be analyzed and developed in much greater detail before we can expect research to have the influence it deserves” (p. 134). Number one on that list was “. . . investigating attitudes toward all issues relating to applied music study . . .” (p. 134).</p>
<p>The vast majority of systematic inquiry into applied music study in the USA since 1988 has been focused on the pedagogical issues idiosyncratic to specific instruments (e.g., strings, voice or keyboard) or related to the teachings of famous pedagogues. But there has been notable work done, related to the larger social and educational issues surrounding all of these activities. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0255761413488712">Duke, Flowers, and Wolfe (1997)</xref> undertook a massive study, funded by the National Piano Foundation, which surveyed piano teachers (<italic>N</italic> = 124) as well as students and their parents (<italic>N</italic> = 663) from 30 states in the USA. This study was encouraging for the many positive personal/social/artistic aspects the participants cited related to music study. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0255761413488712">Rife, Shnek, Lauby, and Lapidus (2001)</xref> surveyed students ages 9–12 years (<italic>N</italic> = 568) to determine their levels of satisfaction with music lessons on various instruments. For these students having fun in lessons and enjoying the music they play were the most important issues. Researchers see motivation and music practice as being central to the pedagogy of individual lesson instruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0255761413488712">McPherson, 2000/2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0255761413488712">Pitts, Davidson, &amp; McPherson, 2000</xref>) but it appears to be far from broadly understood by either teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0255761413488712">Fredrickson, 2007b</xref>) or students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0255761413488712">Madsen, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0255761413488712">Byo and Cassidy (2008)</xref> observed that while college music students reported they understood proper practice technique, many did not do those things they identified when actually engaged in practice. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0255761413488712">Cash (2009)</xref> has observed improvements in motor learning and memory consolidation for musicians who practice with overnight sleep in between practice sessions versus multiple sessions without sleep (for example practicing in the morning and then again in the afternoon). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0255761413488712">Duke, Simmons, and Cash (2009)</xref> observed, analyzed, and evaluated 17 graduate and advanced undergraduate pianists’ practice routines in relation to their ability to play select passages and found that how students practiced was more important than how long they practiced. But, while the majority of music students see themselves teaching lessons at some point in time, very few see motivation of and practice by their students as the teacher’s responsibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0255761413488712">Fredrickson, 2007a</xref>).</p>
<p>In a comprehensive literature review covering 25 years of systematic inquiry into instructional effectiveness in music, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0255761413488712">Duke (1999/2000)</xref> suggested that not enough empirical evidence existed in the extant literature to connect what teachers said or did with what students accomplished, and suggested that more research focus on the cause-and-effect nature of music teaching. That said, research to study the role of the teacher in the private lesson-setting, and the outcomes of student’s learning, is taking place. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0255761413488712">Ward (2004)</xref> proposed that private music teachers use musical theory analysis as a basis for planning lessons that teach expressive elements. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0255761413488712">West and Rostvall (2003)</xref> looked at teacher behaviors and the juxtaposition of symbols and sounds during lessons, noting a preference by teachers for attending to technical detail over attention to musical expression when working with younger students. When <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0255761413488712">Henninger, Flowers, and Councill (2006)</xref> compared teaching by experienced and inexperienced teachers in one-on-one settings, they found that experienced teachers used more verbal explanations and less rote modeling than did their less experienced counterparts. How teachers evaluate their students’ progress is also important. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0255761413488712">Parkes (2008)</xref> found that college music performance faculty members who were given basic instruction in assessment technique had more positive perceptions of the process of grading their students’ performance in a jury setting. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0255761413488712">Ciorba and Smith (2009)</xref> successfully used multidimensional rubrics for judges in a series of graded juries in a traditional end-of-semester college music performance setting to increase judges’ inter-reliability scores. Each of these examples of research represents a piece of a very large puzzle. Making both the examination of those pieces and a broader look at the emerging picture created from that puzzle should be part of the education of teachers.</p>
<p>Advanced students of music, who focus on music performance, naturally gravitate toward teaching as a way to supplement income (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0255761413488712">Fredrickson, 2007a</xref>). Though relatively few positions to teach private music lessons in institutions of higher education become available each year in the USA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0255761413488712">Fredrickson &amp; McCabe, 2007</xref>), there are still many ways for musicians to find interested students who want to study. While teaching in USA public schools is highly regulated, any musician can open a studio and solicit individual students. This creates questions about motivation, training, and quality of instruction. College music students focused primarily on musical performance, as opposed to teaching, showed improvement in their attitudes about teaching after they participated in a required 12-week introductory teaching class (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0255761413488712">Bennett and Stanberg, 2006</xref>). It has been suggested that musicians who have specifically made a choice to teach are better teachers in the long term than those who report that they see teaching as a “back-up” activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0255761413488712">Madsen and Kelly, 2002</xref>). These examples
<disp-quote>
<p>. . . highlight the issue of the musician’s comfort with and motivation for teaching. If a student’s attitude is such that their commitment to teaching is as an activity of convenience, as opposed to a commitment to development of a craft, it may have an unfortunate impact on the experience of their future students. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0255761413488712">Fredrickson, 2007a</xref>, p. 328)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>On the other hand, it is typical of many young music students to begin thinking about both making music and teaching at a relatively early age. The bonds formed with teachers, family, and others in musical settings have long-lasting effects that could lead to an affinity for teaching music to others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0255761413488712">Odena &amp; Welch, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Looking for a systematic way to investigate college-level music performance students’ attitudes toward teaching, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0255761413488712">Mills (2004)</xref> developed and tested a survey instrument that was administered to students at the Royal College of Music in London, UK. Results indicated that those students who planned to do some teaching after college, felt that training to be a teacher was necessary, and showed a definite preference for teaching students with more advanced abilities. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0255761413488712">Fredrickson and Brittin (2009)</xref> replicated Mills’ study with students from two universities in the United States housing music schools labeled “conservatory” and having a primary focus on the performance of music. The largest undergraduate subpopulation within music at both of these institutions consisted of students enrolled in a Bachelor of Music Performance degree. Based on the results of the replication, Fredrickson and Brittin stated the following about their subjects and Mills’:
<disp-quote>
<p>It is interesting to note that these students, both in the US and UK, feel strongly about wanting to teach after graduation. It is possible that the performers and teachers they admire participate in these dual roles to varying degrees. It is also interesting that they feel so strongly that good teaching techniques are not obvious, training is necessary, and that a good performer does not necessarily make a good teacher. (p. 26)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0255761413488712">Fredrickson (2007a)</xref> surveyed undergraduate and graduate music majors (<italic>N</italic> = 486) across disciplines (education, performance, theory, etc.) and degree programs (bachelors through doctoral) using a version of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0255761413488712">Mills’ (2004)</xref> instrument. Students across this sample agreed with their peers from the earlier projects about wanting to teach, and only half saw monetary reward as the primary motivator. Most rejected the notion that a good performer is always a good teacher. While many were both willing to and interested in teaching younger students the majority expressed an interest in someday teaching in higher education. Most importantly the majority felt that training to teach was necessary.</p>
<p>College music majors’ positive attitudes towards teaching privately, and learning the pedagogical information necessary to do so (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0255761413488712">Fredrickson, 2007a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0255761413488712">Fredrickson &amp; Brittin, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0255761413488712">Mills, 2004</xref>), foreshadows the next most important question. How do university faculty currently employed as applied music teachers feel about these issues? If curricular adjustments are to be made it will be necessary for faculty to agree upon the need, and eventually the means, to undertake that task. The present study was designed to pilot test an adjusted version of the questionnaires used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0255761413488712">Mills (2004)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0255761413488712">Fredrickson (2007a)</xref> with a select population of higher education professionals in music performance teaching.</p>
<sec id="section1-0255761413488712" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>It was decided that the data collection instrument would be constructed by modifying the original questionnaire developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0255761413488712">Mills (2004)</xref>, incorporating changes made by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0255761413488712">Fredrickson (2007a)</xref>. The previous works were designed to elicit the opinions of college students. For the current study, the questions were altered to elicit the opinions of college faculty members, with a specific focus on their opinions of their own students’ feelings about applied teaching. The first draft of the questionnaire included 28 statements to which the participants were asked to respond, using a 7-point Likert-type scale, by indicating their level of agreement or disagreement with the statements. Response choices ranged from strongly agree (1) through no opinion (4) to strongly disagree (7). The 28 statements were grouped into six subgroups, categorized as follows:</p>
<list id="list1-0255761413488712" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>students’ roles as teachers</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>teaching roles of the “best” students</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the enjoyment of applied teaching</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the relationships between teaching and performing</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the role of motivation in applied teaching</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>curricular and pedagogical issues</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Following the initial 28 statements, demographic questions regarding number of years teaching, current assignment, and degrees held by respondents were asked.</p>
<p>The first draft of the survey was given to experienced applied collegiate faculty members (<italic>N</italic> = 5) to determine if the questionnaire directions and statements could be clearly understood, while also evaluating any possible issues regarding the completion of the entire document. As a result, the formatting was revised, and some minor wording changes were made for clarity. The final version of the instrument for the pilot (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0255761413488712">Figure 1</xref>) was distributed to participants electronically using an email containing the link to the appropriate web page containing the survey.</p>

</fig>
<p>Because the study was considered exploratory the questionnaire was only sent to a limited population of faculty members who currently hold full-time, tenure track appointments primarily teaching applied music in one of two state university schools of music. Both music units were considered comprehensive, offer multiple music degree programs at multiple levels, bachelor through doctorate, and are identified by NASM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0255761413488712">National Association of Schools of Music, 2009</xref>) as being in their largest enrollment category (400+). Due to the limited subject population, no attempt was made to identify the individual teaching area of respondents (woodwind, brass, keyboard, etc.) because this information could compromise anonymity.</p>

<sec id="section2-0255761413488712" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Of the original 51 faculty members identified as meeting the criteria of full-time, tenure track appointments with primary duties in applied music, 32 individuals responded, resulting in a return rate of 63%.

<p>There was consistent agreement among participants regarding the idea that their best students will teach in the future. Eighty-four percent agreed that their best students desire a performance career, but realize they will need to teach for income purposes, while 81% agreed that their best students would like to teach on the college level. Though these results indicate a belief that students will eventually teach, 72% disagreed with the idea that students want to engage in a teaching career and eventually leaving to perform full-time, while only 15% agreed with that statement in any way.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0255761413488712">
<title>Enjoyment of applied teaching</title>
<p>Responses were very positive regarding the participants’ enjoyment of private lesson-teaching. Ninety-seven percent agreed that they enjoy seeing students develop into better musicians, with 91% agreeing strongly and only 3% having no opinion. Ninety-seven percent also agreed that they enjoy helping students better understand a particular point, with 85% agreeing strongly. In addressing the idea of helping students become better teachers, 97% agreed that they enjoy working to improve their students’ teaching skills, while 94% agreed that they enjoy talking about pedagogy with private students. Only 3% of respondents disagreed with the latter statement.</p>
<p>Applied teachers’ opinions on the types of students they enjoy teaching were slightly more varied. Eighty-one percent of respondents agreed that they particularly like to teach students focused on a performance career, while 12% disagreed with this statement. Only 28% of responses agreed that they enjoy teaching beginners, whereas 53% disagreed with this statement and 19% had no opinion. Sixty-three percent of respondents agreed that they enjoy teaching students who find music easy, while 12% disagreed and 25% had no opinion.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0255761413488712">
<title>Relationships between teaching and performing</title>
<p>The statement that a good performer will always be a good teacher prompted 88% of respondents to disagree, with the remaining 12% having no opinion. This apparent belief in a separation between the skills of performing and teaching was confounded somewhat by 88% of respondents agreeing that teaching private lessons helps in their own performing, while only 6% disagreed with that statement. It is notable that 84% of respondents agreed with the statement that they often talk to their students about how teaching helps to improve their personal playing.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0255761413488712">
<title>The role of motivation in applied teaching</title>
<p>The majority of respondents expressed some degree of personal obligation and/or responsibility for their students’ progress and work ethic. Sixty-nine percent of respondents agreed that if a student is not practicing it is their job, as the applied teacher, to motivate that student. Thirty-seven percent agreed that when a student gives up, they worry that their teaching was not good enough, while 41% disagreed with this statement and 22% had no opinion. Regarding the origins of their teaching ability, only 31% agreed that they teach their students in exactly the same way their best teacher taught them, with 60% disagreeing with this statement. Eighty-one percent of respondents disagreed with the idea that good teaching technique is obvious and does not require training. When addressing the idea of society’s value of private music teaching, only 28% agreed that this skill is valued by society, while 47% disagreed and 25% had no opinion.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0255761413488712">
<title>Curricular and pedagogical issues</title>
<p>The respondents’ opinions on pedagogy and curriculum were varied. Eighty-one percent agreed that their studio curriculum is completely individualized, while 50% agreed that they have a specific pedagogical framework that guides their teaching with every student. Only 25% agreed that their curriculum is differentiated by major, while 56% disagreed with this statement and 19% having no opinion. In addressing the need for students to expand their pedagogical knowledge, 63% agreed that if a student wants to know about teaching they are encouraged to take a pedagogy class, whereas 22% disagreed and 15% had no opinion. Eighty-one percent of respondents agreed that they often use portions of lesson time to teach pedagogical information.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present study was designed to pilot test an adjusted version of the questionnaire, originally developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0255761413488712">Mills (2004)</xref> and used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0255761413488712">Fredrickson (2007a)</xref> with college students, to survey higher education faculty on their opinions and attitudes about teaching. The current population (<italic>N</italic> = 32) of full-time, tenure track applied music professors all successfully completed the questionnaire. All were given the option of responding to the original email inquiry if they had questions or comments about the questionnaire itself. No questions or comments were received and it is assumed that the respondents who completed the task did not perceive the questions to be difficult or misleading. There were no partially-completed questionnaires in the database, indicating that everyone who chose to attempt to answer the questions completed the task.</p>
<p>Responses from the current population were relatively homogeneous. Participants indicated that they expected that most of their students would indeed do some teaching, and that earning money was at least a part of the motivation to do so. They also indicated that they preferred to work with students focused on performance careers. At the same time, they themselves enjoy the process of teaching their students, the challenges of helping students understand musical issues, and discussing teaching with their students. Many felt their teaching informed their own performance, but not as many thought they actively shared that information with their students. Large percentages indicated that they did talk about pedagogical issues with their students within the context of lessons. As a group, they disagreed strongly with the idea that good teaching technique was obvious and thought training to teach was necessary.</p>
<p>Contrary to the beliefs expressed by students surveyed in earlier studies, teachers in the present study felt that working with beginners would be something their own students might enjoy. This is an interesting contradiction in that it may represent the teachers’ hope related to their students’ interest in the challenges of teaching more strongly than their understanding of their students’ attitudes towards teaching. Those students, like these teachers, were more focused on working with advanced musicians and may not realize that they will inevitably work with a variety of students. Since not everyone who teaches private music lessons can realistically teach only the best of the best students, how to prepare future teachers to work successfully with and enjoy students with varying abilities from a wide range of situations becomes an important question.</p>
<p>Probably the most interesting comparisons between these faculty members and the students in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0255761413488712">Fredrickson, 2007a</xref>) can be found in two particular places where the populations evidenced either similar thinking or divergent thinking. Faculty and student groups both disagreed strongly with the ideas that good teaching was obvious and good performers were always good teachers, as well as equally ambivalent about teaching as they had been taught (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0255761413488712">Figure 2</xref>). If this is true amongst the broader population of faculty, this bodes well for future discussions of the need for training teachers in private lesson settings. On the other hand students felt that faculty did not often talk about the role of teaching in their own development as a musician, while faculty seemed to feel that they did discuss this often (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0255761413488712">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

<p>The current project was certainly not sufficient in scope to make generalizations based on these data. But, for the faculty of the two institutions represented in the present study, there appears to be evidence that the interest to sustain meaningful conversations about the pedagogical possibilities inherent in the data exists among colleagues. Starting those conversations and eventually finding solutions that fit the local circumstances would be the challenge. Current versions of degree curricula will need to be examined to find the capacity for change or expansion. There are instructional materials that could be used in coursework, one example being a recent addition to the literature by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0255761413488712">Mills (2007)</xref>. And there is always the possibility of adding a systematic pedagogy focus to university students’ private lessons, taking advantage of the one-to-one relationship that faculty members have already developed with these students in a naturalistic setting in which the issues can be addressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0255761413488712">Fredrickson, 2007a</xref>).</p>
<p>Future research should be conducted that differentiates the opinions of faculty in specialty areas (winds/percussion, voice, strings, keyboard). In the United States, there are well-established organizations made up of music instructors specializing in voice (National Association of Teachers of Singing), strings (American String Teachers Association), wind/percussion instruments (National Association of College Wind &amp; Percussion Instructors), and many piano teachers belong to the Music Teachers National Association. One of the purposes of these organizations is to focus on pedagogy of instruction in their areas. It is reasonable to assume that detailed, area specific ideas about teaching within these sub-groups may vary and surveying within these organizations may highlight potential differences. In addition, teachers from institutions in other regions of the world should be sampled and compared. For example, using the template for International Society for Music Education (ISME) research commission representation (Europe, Australia, Latin America, Asia, UK &amp; Africa, USA &amp; Canada)</p>
<p>In addition, faculty with varying types of academic appointments in higher education institutions (full-time/part-time, tenure-track/non tenure track) or outside of higher education (community music schools, within commercial businesses like music stores, and as private teachers acting alone) should be examined. Instructors with differentiated teaching load responsibilities (applied teaching only, primarily applied teaching, primarily academic teaching with some applied, etc.) are a large sub-group in higher education in the United States. Whether an instructor is primarily focused on this type of instruction or not may impact their opinions in these areas.</p>
<p>Bringing these various groups into a conversation with organizations focused on teacher training (MENC) and college curriculum (NASM) might prove fruitful. Curriculum for music teachers in USA higher education is highly structured and regulated by various agencies, and is highly focused on the teaching of music. The curricula in other areas of music include comparatively little, if any, coursework or supervised practical experience related to teaching even though those students often see themselves teaching at some point in the future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0255761413488712">Fredrickson, 2007a</xref>). Some have suggested that schools teaching primarily music performance skills could benefit by readjusting from a focus on the product to a focus on the process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0255761413488712">Carruthers, 2008</xref>). In any case, raising awareness and examining ways to adjust current curricula without forcing wholesale change on the existing educational system warrants careful exploration.</p>

<title>Attitude des enseignants d’exécution musicale de haut niveau à l’égard des étudiants qui donnent des leçons privées après obtenir la licence: une etude-pilote aux États Unis</title>
<p>L’étude dont on rend compte dans le present article a eu pour but de faire un test pilote d’une version adaptée d’un questionnaire utilisé auparavant pour déterminer les opinions des enseignants universitaires de musique à l’égard de l’enseignement par leçons privées. Pour ce projet, ont été contactés des enseignants d’écoles de musique employés à plein temps dans des postes de haute responsabilité menant à la permanence, auprès de deux universités des États-Unis. Trente-deux d’un total de 51 ont complété leur tâche sans faire de remarques negatives sur le format et sur les questions contenues dans l’outil de recherche ou sur les thèmes qu’il mettait en évidence. Les résultats sont pareils sous plusieurs aspects aux réponses des étudiants antérieurs; les sujets de ce groupe éprouvaient un sentiment assez fort qu’ils aimaient à enseigner, qu’une préparation pour enseigner est importante et que les élèves à qui ils donnaient des leçons de musique appliquée s’attendaient à être un jour eux-mêmes des enseignants de musique. Ils parlaient volontiers de questions pédagogiques avec leurs étudiants, et aimaient le défi d’enseigner à de musiciens. La recherche à laquelle on compte de passer par la suite en employant ce même outil devra porter sur des groupes plus larges, avec des distinctions par domaine de specialization, par rôle vis à vis du corps d’enseignants, par type / dimensions de l’institution, par responsabilités d’enseignement, et par represéntation globale de soi-même.</p>

<title>Actitudes del Profesorado de Instrumento de Alto Nivel para dar Clases Particulares a Estudiantes tras su Graduación: Un Estudio Piloto en los EEUU</title>
<p>El presente estudio se diseñó como prueba piloto para la validación de un cuestionario, empleado en investigaciones previas con estudiantes universitarios de música, con el fin de conocer la opinión del profesorado universitario de música sobre las clases particulares de instrumento. Contactamos con profesorado interino trabajando a tiempo completo en enseñanzas universitarias de música de dos universidades. 32 de ellos, de un total de 51, completaron las tareas encomendadas sin que hubiera comentarios negativos sobre el formato, objeto de estudio o cuestiones específicas sobre el instrumento. Los respuestas dadas fueron similares en muchos aspectos a las dadas con anterioridad en estudios previos. Los resultados de este grupo indican que les gusta la enseñanza, reconociendo su importancia y que en el futuro probablemente aplicarán el tipo de enseñanzas prácticas que ahora están recibiendo. Les gustaba además hablar de cuestiones pedagógicas con sus estudiantes y el reto de enseñar a músicos. Futuras investigaciones con esta herramienta deberían centrarse en grupos más grandes con diseños especializados por área, situación contractual del profesorado, tipo de institución y tamaño, encargos docentes, y visión global.</p>
