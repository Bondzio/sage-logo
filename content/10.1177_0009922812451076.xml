<title>Introduction</title>
<p>PFIC3 (progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 3) is an inherited cholestatic disorder caused by mutations in the <italic>ABCB4</italic> gene encoding the Multidrug Resistance Protein 3 (MDR3) protein.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922812451076">1</xref></sup> PFIC3 typically presents during infancy or early childhood, often progressing to chronic liver disease and cirrhosis, requiring liver transplantation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922812451076">2</xref></sup> Since the clinical features of PFIC3 overlap with many other forms of liver disease in childhood, definitive diagnosis may be problematic or delayed. Here, we report 2 patients, ultimately diagnosed with PFIC3, who initially presented with liver histological features including marked hepatic copper accretion that were considered indicative of Wilson disease (WD).</p>
</sec>

<title>Case Reports</title>
<p>Patient A first presented at age 11 with elevated liver enzymes and abdominal distension. She had hepatosplenomegaly and moderate ascites. Her past medical history was significant for prolonged neonatal jaundice and gallstones requiring cholecystectomy at age 9. In addition, her mother reported pruritus during the late stages of pregnancy. A liver biopsy revealed hepatocyte ballooning degeneration, chronic inflammation in periportal areas, micronodular cirrhosis, and a markedly elevated hepatic copper content (860 µg/g). By report she had elevated 24-hour urinary copper with normal ceruloplasmin levels. She was diagnosed with WD and started on chelation therapy with trientine that, by report, led to some improvement in serum liver indices.</p>
<p>At age 13 she was referred to our institution for further management and evaluation for liver transplantation. She appeared healthy, was 19th percentile for height and 24th percentile for weight with moderate hepatosplenomegaly. Serum liver indices were aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 85 U/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 80 U/L, alkaline phosphatase 774 U/L, γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT) 293 U/L, albumin 2.6 g/dL, and conjugated bilirubin 0.0 mg/dL. The ceruloplasmin level was 26.7 mg/dL (reference = 18-46), serum copper 84 µg/dL (reference = 90-190), and urine 24 hour copper 125 µg (reference = 3-50). At that time she was on chelation therapy with trientine. A liver biopsy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0009922812451076">Figure 1A</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0009922812451076">C</xref>) revealed inflammation, lobular disarray, and cirrhosis with detectable copper deposition in periportal hepatocytes (hepatic copper content 191 µg/g). Full exon sequencing of the <italic>ATP7B</italic> gene (WD gene) did not reveal any mutations. She was then evaluated for other causes of cholestatic disorders. <italic>ABCB4</italic> gene sequencing was recently commercially available, and analysis revealed compound heterozygosity with known deleterious mutations in the <italic>ABCB4</italic> gene (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0009922812451076">Table 1</xref>), leading to the diagnosis of PFIC3. After diagnosis, chelation was discontinued and ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) therapy at 20 mg/kg/d initiated. Liver indices remained stable over the next 4 years.</p>

<p>Patient B was referred by his pediatrician at the age of 6 for jaundice, elevated serum liver indices, and dark urine. His past medical history was unremarkable and physical examination revealed minimal scleral icterus and hepatosplenomegaly. Serum liver indices were AST 192 U/L, ALT 139 U/L, alkaline phosphatase 397 U/L, GGT 608 U/L, albumin 4.5 g/dL, and conjugated bilirubin 0.6 mg/dL. Twenty-four-hour urinary copper excretion was elevated (66 µg/d) and ceruloplasmin level was normal at 44.6 mg/dL. A liver biopsy (Figure 1D-F) revealed hepatic inflammation, bridging fibrosis, histochemically detectable copper, and elevated total hepatic copper (863 µg/g), suggesting the potential diagnosis of WD. While awaiting results of the <italic>ATP7B</italic> and <italic>ABCB4</italic> gene sequencing, the patient was started on chelation therapy. Full-sequence analysis of the <italic>ATP7B</italic> gene did not reveal any mutations. However, <italic>ABCB4</italic> gene sequencing confirmed the diagnosis of PFIC3, due to the presence of deleterious mutations (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0009922812451076">Table 1</xref>), leading to discontinuation of chelation and initiation of UDCA therapy at 20 mg/kg/d. His liver indices continue to be stable for the past 18 months.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Determining the underlying etiology of cirrhosis in childhood is sometimes problematic, and a relatively recent addition to our diagnostic toolkit includes sequencing of genes that, if mutated, contribute to the development of many chronic liver diseases. These 2 patients, with marked hepatic copper overload and liver histology consistent with WD have defects in a hepatobiliary transporter gene for phospholipids (<italic>ABCB4</italic>) and not the gene responsible for WD (<italic>ATP7B</italic>). Moreover, this diagnosis underscores the advantages of incorporating specific genetic testing for diagnosis and that such utilization can potentially change treatment options.</p>
<p>PFIC3 results from either monallelic or biallelic mutations in the <italic>ABCB4</italic> gene located on Chromosome 7 encoding for the MDR3.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922812451076">1</xref></sup> This gene product is predominantly expressed in the hepatocellular canalicular membrane and is responsible for phospholipid transport into bile. Decreased or absent function of the MDR3 transporter results in impaired phospholipid secretion, previously identified as “low phospholipid syndrome.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922812451076">3</xref></sup> Injury to the biliary epithelium occurs from continuous exposure to hydrophobic bile salts, whose detergent effects are not attenuated by phospholipids. Furthermore, the altered ratio of phospholipids and bile salts leads to increased lithogenicity of bile, resulting in crystallization of cholesterol with cholelithiasis. Injury to the biliary epithelium results in cholestasis, biliary cirrhosis, and hepatocellular failure.</p>
<p>Patients with PFIC3 that manifest early with severe disease tend to have homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations affecting protein function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922812451076">2</xref></sup> These patients often have complete absence of the protein on immunostaining or impaired function of the MDR3 transporter. Patients with either missense or nonsense heterozygous mutations may present with less severe phenotypes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922812451076">2</xref></sup> the most common of them being cholelithiasis in adulthood, or maternal pruritus during pregnancy, as in patient A. However such genotype–phenotype correlations are not precise and are not completely reliable.</p>
<p>Children with PFIC3 often present in the first year of life with clinical signs of cholestasis that leads to progressive liver disease and cirrhosis. Older children and adolescents may have features of portal hypertension, including hematemesis and splenomegaly. PFIC3 patients have elevated serum GGT activity that differentiates them from those with PFIC1 and PFIC2. They also show elevations in liver transaminases (AST, ALT), alkaline phosphatase activity, and moderate elevation in bile acids. Ultrasonography of the liver and gall bladder may rarely show biliary stones. Liver histology shows hepatocellular damage, inflammatory infiltration of the portal tract, and fibrosis. In advanced disease, extensive fibrosis and biliary cirrhosis are seen. Immunostaining of the MDR3 protein can be variable, ranging from complete absence to diminished staining, depending on the mutation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922812451076">4</xref></sup> The diagnosis of PFIC3 is confirmed by molecular genetic analysis of the <italic>ABCB4</italic> gene.</p>
<p>The two PFIC3 patients reported here presented with cholestasis and significant copper accretion in liver. Impaired copper secretion and copper accumulation can be seen in all chronic cholestatic disorders; however, the quantity of copper was significant to meet diagnostic criteria for WD. WD is caused by mutations in the <italic>ATP7B</italic> gene that encodes for the copper transporting P1 type ATPase.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922812451076">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922812451076">6</xref></sup> In hepatocytes, this protein is required for proper copper excretion into bile. In the two patients, MDR3 deficiency led to altered copper excretion, but the mechanism remains to be elucidated. Moreover, this diagnosis altered therapy from copper chelation to UDCA, since to date, there are no known beneficial effects of chelation in PFIC3 or other non-WD or cholestatic conditions. Thus, the two cases underscore the importance of molecular genetic testing in the accurate diagnosis of cholestatic disorders that directly affects management decisions and patient outcomes.</p>
