<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Aldosterone (ALDO) modulates membrane receptors and signaling molecules and influences the actions of a variety of agents to sensitize the vasculature to the effects of various agents that induce vasoconstriction. ALDO and angiotension II (Ang II) are thought to be important players in the control of blood pressure. We have found that ALDO-induced endothelial dysfunction in both normotensive and hypertensive rats may be related to exaggeration of the prostanoid pathway. Several studies have reported that cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) derived prostacyclin (PGI<sub>2</sub>) and prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> (PGE<sub>2</sub>) are key molecules that play a critical role in regulating the release of renin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1470320312443911">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1470320312443911">2</xref></sup> Renin converts plasma angiotensinogen to angiotensin I (Ang I), which is converted to Ang II, a potent vasoconstrictor. The roles of the prostanoids in renovascular hypertension, however, have not yet been clearly defined. Reduced bioavailability of one or all of these protective endothelial factors results in vascular dysfunction, a condition that has been documented in patients with hypertension, diabetes, atherosclerosis and angina.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470320312443911">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1470320312443911"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1470320312443911"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1470320312443911"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1470320312443911"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1470320312443911">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Salt-induced hypertension has been linked with increased oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction, which may be due in part to Ang II induced increase in ALDO. Several studies have demonstrated that the administration of ALDO is associated with a proinflammatory vascular response including increasing cytokine levels and cyclooxygenase (COX) activity. The beneficial effects of ALDO blockade on atherosclerosis and hypertension have been attributed to multiple factors including enhanced endothelial function and reduced oxygen free radical generation. Several lines of evidence have demonstrated that ROS contribute to COX-2 expression in various cell types.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1470320312443911">9</xref></sup> NADPH oxidase is an important enzymatic source for the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) under various pathologic conditions. Thus, the role of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-oxidase in ROS generation associated with COX expression in response to ALDO and salt was investigated in this study.</p>
<p>In the present study, we used Dahl salt-sensitive (DS) rats to test the hypothesis that apocynin (APC) and/or eplerenone (EPL) inhibits ALDO/salt-induced kidney damage by preventing the production of PGE<sub>2</sub>. We also determined whether hypertensive DS rats have an upregulation of cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and COX-2 in the kidney, which is mediated by ALDO binding to the mineralocorticoid receptor and NADPH oxidase. DS rats were placed on either a low-salt diet (0.3% NaCl) or a high-salt diet (8% NaCl) for four weeks and treated with the mineralocorticoid receptor blocker, EPL or the NADPH oxidase inhibitor APC. The purpose of this study was to examine the signal pathways associated with ALDO/salt-induced hypertension via inhibition of ALDO at the receptor level and by use of the NADPH oxidase inhibitor, APC.</p>

<sec id="section7-1470320312443911">
<title>Experimental design</title>
<p>Male DS rats (4–5 weeks, Charles River Laboratories) were grouped three per cage in the animal facility that has 12-hour light/dark cycles with the temperature controlled between 21–23°C. Food and water were available ad lib. Following acclimatization, the animals were divided into two groups: (1) low-salt diet (0.3% NaCl; <italic>n</italic>=24); (2) high-salt diet (8% NaCl; <italic>n</italic>=24). Within each group, the rats were placed on one of four treatment protocols: (1) no drug (control); (2) ALDO (0.2 mg pellet given subcutaneously); (3) ALDO plus EPL (100 mg/kg/day in the drinking water); (4) ALDO plus APC (1.5 mM in the drinking water) for 4 weeks. Body weight, systolic blood pressure and heart rate were measured prior to treatment (basal) and weekly thereafter.</p>

<sec id="section8-1470320312443911">
<title>Indirect blood pressure measurement in conscious rats</title>
<p>Blood pressure was non-invasively measured by determining the tail blood volume with a volume pressure recording (VPR) sensor and an occlusion tail-cuff (CODA System, Kent Scientific, Torrington, Connecticut, USA).</p>
<sec id="section9-1470320312443911">
<title>Collection and storage of blood samples</title>
<p>Blood samples (2.0 ml), for prostanoid measurements, were collected into chilled heparinized and indomethacin (100 µM) rinsed tubes. Blood samples (5–10 mL) were withdrawn via cardiac puncture (under 80 mg/ml ketamine/10 mg/ml xylazine im) prior to sacrifice and transferred to heparinized tubes. All blood samples were then centrifuged at 3000xg for 25 minutes at 4°C. All plasma samples were frozen in aliquots and stored at -80°C until assayed.</p>

<sec id="section10-1470320312443911">
<title>Tissue harvesting</title>
<p>Immediately following collection of blood by cardiac puncture, the heart and left kidneys were harvested from all animals, frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C for use in western blot analysis. The right kidney was stored in 10% formalin and sent to AML (Maryland, USA) for immunostaining. The ratios of heart and kidney wet weights to body weight were calculated.</p>

<sec id="section11-1470320312443911">
<title>Measurements of plasma prostaglandins</title>
<p>Plasma levels of 6-keto-prostaglandin F<sub>1α</sub>, PGE<sub>2</sub> and thromboxane A<sub>2</sub> were measured using an enzyme immunoassay kit (Cayman Chem. Corp., Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and expressed as pg/ml.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1470320312443911">
<title>Western blot analysis of COX expression</title>
<p>The total kidney from individual animals was homogenized separately in ice cold T-PER lysis buffer containing protease inhibitor cocktail (Pierce, Rockford, Illinois, USA). Homogenates were pelleted at 3000 g for five minutes at 4°C and supernatants were collected for western blotting. Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, California, USA). Tissue lysates (30 µg) were separated by 4–12% Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, USA) and electro-transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes. The membranes were incubated overnight at 4°C with specific antibodies to COX-1 and COX-2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, California, USA). After incubation with the secondary antibody, immune complexes were detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence method. Protein levels from western blots were evaluated by quantifying the band intensities using NIH Image version 1.6.3 software. Densitometry units were normalized to actin. Each lane in a blot represented tissue lysate from one rat. Western blots were repeated four times, each blot derived from a different set of treated animals. Fold changes between treatment groups were calculated from individual blots, and mean changes were derived from replicates.</p>

<title>Immunostaining of renal COX-2</title>
<p>Formalin-fixed rat kidney samples were embedded in paraffin and sectioned at approximately 5 microns. Slides for each sample were subjected to immunohistochemical procedures using an antibody to COX-2. All slides were examined by a board-certified veterinary pathologist (Dr Michael Hawes; Charter Preclinical Services). IHC staining of tissues was assessed on a semi-quantitative scale from 0–5. Data was entered into Microsoft Excel. Statistics were performed using GraphPad software version 4.03 and consisted of a non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test followed by a Dunn’s post-test comparing all groups to each other.</p>

<title>Systolic blood pressure and heart rate</title>
<p>The effect of EPL and APC on ALDO-augmented blood pressure was evaluated in DS rats fed a low-salt or high-salt diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1470320312443911">Figure 1</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1470320312443911">Figure 1A</xref>, in the presence of ALDO only, systolic blood pressure increased by 65% over controls (low-salt diet without drug treatment). EPL blocked the increase in systolic blood pressure induced by ALDO at weeks two, three and four. Also, systolic blood pressure was slightly but significantly reduced by APC (27%) by the end of the treatment period. In contrast, throughout the treatment period, DS rats fed the high-salt diet with ALDO showed no significant change in blood pressure when compared to the high-salt diet control group (182±3 vs 179±17 mm Hg; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1470320312443911">Figure 1B</xref>).

<title>Effect of ALDO on vasoactive agents</title>
<p>Plasma levels of prostacyclin (measured as 6-keto-PGF<sub>1α</sub>), were significantly higher in the rats fed the low-salt diet (control group; without ALDO) compared to rats fed the high-salt diet (615±47 vs 359±96 pg/ml). When ALDO alone was added to the low- or high-salt diets, plasma prostacyclin levels declined by 63% and 43% respectively. Also, EPL treatment in the presence of ALDO caused a further decline in plasma prostacyclin levels.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study examined the effect of APC and EPL on COX expression in ALDO/salt-induced hypertension. Administration of ALDO to non-hypertensive rats for four weeks resulted in a progressive increase in blood pressure. EPL therapy significantly lowered blood pressure in the ALDO-induced hypertensive rats. In contrast, APC treatment did not entirely block the ALDO/salt-induced hypertension but appeared to delay the rise in blood pressure over time. Furthermore, APC and EPL treatment partially blocked the ALDO and salt-induced increase in renal COX levels.</p>
<p>We previously reported that the salt content of the diet was crucial for the hypertensive effect of ALDO.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1470320312443911">10</xref></sup> In fact, ALDO produces a time-dependent increase in blood pressure in the presence of a low-salt diet, but not in the presence of a high-salt diet, implicating an inappropriate control of plasma ALDO levels during the development of ALDO-induced hypertension. Changes in blood pressure are a common observation after either ALDO administration or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1470320312443911">11</xref></sup> We have shown in previous study that EPL given alone lowers blood pressure significantly thus EPL was given in combination with ALDO to determine if blood pressure changes induced by ALDO can also be blocked with EPL.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1470320312443911">12</xref></sup> The response to EPL was much faster in the rats fed a low-salt diet. We observed a change in blood pressure in the high-salt group after four weeks of EPL treatment. These findings indicate that the rise in blood pressure during a high salt intake diet may be primarily due to Ang II acting on the Ang II type 1 (AT<sub>1</sub>) receptor, as ALDO can increase local production of angiotensin II by upregulating the angiotensin-converting enzyme.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1470320312443911">13</xref></sup> In addition, ALDO has been shown to upregulate Ang II receptors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1470320312443911">14</xref></sup> Thus, the rise in blood pressure in the ALDO/salt-treated rats may be due to the Ang II pathway induced by ALDO. It is also of interest that APC partially inhibited the rise in blood pressure induced by ALDO/salt treatment. These findings suggest that the NADPH oxidase pathway may play a significant role in the vasculopathic effect of ALDO.</p>
<p>It is now well known that NADPH oxidase is a major source of ROS in the vasculature and kidney.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1470320312443911">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1470320312443911">16</xref></sup> Several studies indicate that ALDO increases ROS production.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1470320312443911">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1470320312443911">18</xref></sup> Virdis et al. have shown that vascular NADPH oxidase activity and ROS production were increased in ALDO/salt-treated hypertensive rats.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1470320312443911">19</xref></sup> A previous finding from our laboratory showed that ALDO/salt treatment increased kidney expression of the NOX4 and p22phox components of NADPH oxidase.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1470320312443911">10</xref></sup> These findings suggest that at least some of the ALDO/salt-induced effect in the kidney is mediated through the NADPH oxidase pathway. In the vasculature, these effects would be expected to increase the bioavailability of nitric oxide (NO) and possibly the prostanoids. The chemical reaction between superoxide and NO leads to the formation of peroxynitrite, another ROS. Peroxynitrite is a highly reactive molecule that can oxidize or nitrate many subcellular targets, resulting in significant alteration of cellular homeostasis. One potential outcome of intracellular peroxynitrite formation is nitration of PGI2-S, the process that has been suggested to inactivate its enzymatic activity and consequently attenuate PGI2 synthesis. The inhibition of prostacyclin synthesis by peroxynitrite could explain the suppression of prostacyclin levels by ALDO.</p>
<p>Other studies have shown that administration of APC to hypertensive Dahl rats can reduce renal damage, oxidative stress and inflammation. Our current findings show that treatments related to an induction of high blood pressure inhibit the production of plasma prostacyclin. Based on COX-1 and COX-2 protein expression in the kidney, we suspect that the prostanoids are highly involved in the vasculopathic effects of ALDO. COX-1 and COX-2 expression were upregulated by ALDO/salt treatment. COX-2 stimulates renin release which plays a role in hypertension via the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1470320312443911">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1470320312443911">21</xref></sup> COX-2 plays a role in maintaining the physiological functions of the kidney via the production of prostanoids.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1470320312443911">22</xref></sup> Even so, excessive expression of COX-2, as observed in this study, may stimulate the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and, as suggested by others, lead to increased arterial pressure and vascular lesions in inflammatory diseases, including hypertension and diabetes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1470320312443911">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1470320312443911">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1470320312443911">6</xref></sup> The higher renal expression of COX-2 in the ALDO/salt-treated rats correlated with higher plasma PGE<sub>2</sub> levels. Inhibiting NADPH oxidase activity reversed the ALDO-induced expression of COX-2. We reasoned that APC reduces COX-2 expression thereby inhibiting COX-2 stimulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and, consequently, reducing the development of hypertension and excessive ROS production due to increased NADPH activity, possibly via the mineralocorticoid receptor.</p>
<p>In summary, the protective effects of a mineralocorticoid receptor blocker are clearly distinct from the effects of a NADPH oxidase inhibitor in the DS rats and suggests that these agents can have differential roles in cardiovascular disease. The mechanism underlying these differences seems to involve opposing effects on the regulation of NADPH oxidase. Noticeably, these results suggest that the beneficial effects of EPL may relate to a reduction in end-organ renal damage that is associated with an inhibition of PGE<sub>2</sub>.</p>
