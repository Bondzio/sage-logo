<p>Although Pan American World Airways declared bankruptcy and stopped flying in 1991, the mystique of Pan Am lives on in memorabilia, museum exhibitions, and gatherings of former flight attendants nostalgic about “The Pan Am Way.” Recognizing this phenomenon, ABC television rolled out a new series this season, recounting the international escapades of four look-alike Pan Am “stewardesses,” set in the 1960s. The series is suffering in the ratings, but it is telling that the program is not about the experiences of stewardesses flying for TWA or United or Lufthansa or Air France, but about their experiences with Pan Am.</p>
<p>The story of the airline, which began flying in 1928, and its charismatic founder, Juan Trippe, has been told in dozens of books (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0001839212447601">Daley, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0001839212447601">Bilstein, 2001</xref>; for an extensive list, see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.everythingpanam.com">http://www.everythingpanam.com</ext-link>). Yet, in <italic>Airborne Dreams</italic>, anthropologist Yano has found a unique aspect of the story to tell. Hers is the story of Pan Am’s marketing strategy, begun in 1955, to hire “Nisei” (second-generation Japanese-American) flight attendants based in Hawaii. This strategy was ostensibly intended to assure that Pan Am’s stewardesses flying the Pacific routes would be able to speak Japanese to the airline’s Asian clientele. Through a very carefully researched project that included extensive interviews with flight attendants who were hired under the Nisei program and others who worked with them, Yano reveals the underlying purpose of this hiring strategy. She points out that a number of the Nisei stewardesses, born and raised in Hawaii, had never lived in Japan and did not speak Japanese very well, if at all. But they “looked” the part. Thus the bilingual qualification served as a smokescreen for Pan Am’s window-dressing goal of hiring stewardesses on racial and ethnic grounds. These young women were repeatedly showcased, on and off the job, to reinforce the “exotic” element of the airline as part of its quest for global domination.</p>
<p>In the first sections of the book, Yano does a convincing job of laying out this premise, supported by a thorough analysis of Pan Am’s early history. One particularly appealing aspect of the analysis is her use of the notion of “frontier” to bring together the threads of the story, with Pan Am as the pioneer of international air travel during the postwar period, embarking on an adventurous—and, at the time, legal—approach to staffing its Asian routes. Yano characterizes her story as a “case study in the larger history of postwar America during the Jet Age and its own negotiations of race, gender, and class” (p. 16).</p>
<p>The second part of the book turns to a micro-level analysis of the Nisei stewardesses themselves. Here, Yano explores the tensions encountered by these young women, many from rural areas of Hawaii and who joined Pan Am despite their families’ objections. These women were groomed for a cosmopolitan lifestyle as international stewardesses serving an upper-class customer base. On the one hand, Yano argues, Pan Am was seeking a “girl next door” image; on the other hand, Pan Am was training the Nisei stewardesses to provide the level of attention to their first-class passengers that bordered on the image of a “geisha” (albeit with strict prohibitions against physical contact with passengers). Details from the interviews with former Nisei stewardesses offer glimpses of how these women negotiated such tensions. For the most part, however, they reported a deep appreciation for the opportunities to enjoy what Yano characterizes as “proximal prestige” (p. 95). They became educated about the world and became sophisticated beyond their dreams. “What these women learned through their Pan Am training were the standards of upper-class, Euro-American life. The conditions of work created a web of expectations and practices shared with passengers, as well as other Pan Am flight attendants. These became lived as the Pan Am Way” (p. 156).</p>
<p>The demise of the Nisei stewardess program foreshadowed the demise of the airline itself in 1991, brought about by a confluence of social, legal, economic, and cultural pressures. Yano’s concluding chapter returns to the macro-level of analysis, nicely summarizing these forces. Her Appendix provides an interesting chronology of the company that demonstrates how the Nisei stewardess program paralleled the airline’s rise and fall.</p>
<p>Yano’s book is an especially appealing addition to the literature because it juxtaposes the macro-level analysis of corporate behavior and the institutional context within which it plays out, with the micro-level analysis of the individuals involved. <italic>Airborne Dreams</italic> can thus be read as both a study in an international corporation’s elaborate marketing strategy rolled out in postwar America and as a study in the lives of those who were being used as the centerpiece of that strategy. It is revealing that the women whom Yano interviewed retained a lifelong devotion to Pan Am and enthusiasm about the Pan Am Way. There is little in the book about negative experiences of those who worked for Pan Am, a weakness in the research that Yano acknowledges. Nevertheless, she presents an intriguing and insightful analysis with the data available to her.</p>
