<abstract>
<p>The Men in STD Training and Empowerment Research Study (MISTERS) program and epidemiological criminology began their development in Atlanta at about the same time. MISTERS focuses on men recently released from jail to reduce both HIV/STD and crime-related risk factors through a brief educational intervention. This article examines ways in which MISTERS and epidemiological criminology have been used to inform one another in the replication of the MISTERS program in Orange County, Florida. Data from 110 MISTERS participants during the first 10 months of operation are analyzed to examine the overlapping occurrence of health and criminal risk behaviors in the men’s lives. This provides a test of core hypotheses from the epidemiological criminology framework. This article also examines application of the epidemiological criminology framework to develop interventions to address health and crime risk factors simultaneously in Criminal Justice-Involved populations in the community.</p>

<p>The focus of the <italic>Journal of Correctional Health Care</italic> special issue (Volume 17, number 4) with guest editors from the Morehouse School of Medicine was on reentry from correctional experience to the community and its impact on individual and community health, especially minority communities. We begin this article with a critical observation: An exclusive focus on health outcomes to the exclusion of reducing criminal activity is shortsighted. Indeed, recidivism (generally defined as arrest on new criminal charges after release) has been the outcome variable of interest in federal funding for reentry programs. Scant funding beyond an HIV focus has been available for reentry programs. It seems that marrying positive health outcomes with the reduction of subsequent criminal activity should be a priority for any reentry program, regardless of the funder.</p>
<p>In this article, we provide an overview of three programs designated as evidence-based interventions (EBIs) by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and a comparison with the Men in STD Training and Empowerment Research Study (MISTERS) program, funded once by the CDC, currently being replicated in the Orange County area of Florida (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1078345812458085">Table 1</xref>). We then explain the components we believe make the MISTERS approach better suited than other EBIs to reducing both criminal recidivism and poor health outcomes from the perspective of epidemiological criminology.</p>

<title>Diffusion of Effective Behavioral Interventions (DEBIs), MISTERS, and the Epidemiological Criminology Framework</title>
<p>As noted in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1078345812458085">Table 1</xref>, several public health-focused, EBIs are used in correctional settings or with criminal justice populations: Sisters Informing Sisters on Topics About AIDS (SISTA), START, and VOICES/VOCES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1078345812458085">Effective Interventions, 2012</xref>). They tend to focus exclusively on health and substance abuse. Most of these four primarily HIV-focused programs are brief in duration, lasting from one 45-minute session (VOICES) to 10 hours of group work (SISTA). START is the only program that works in a “client-centered” individual manner, though the initial in-facility sessions may be conducted in a group setting. START is also the only program that begins while individuals are incarcerated (state prisons only at this point) and continues services in the community postrelease. SISTA is the only sex-/gender-specific program, although START was conducted initially with male-only populations. VOICES has been used with incarcerated individuals, but no reports of use with community-supervised groups are available. A comparison of the basic program objectives and delivery methods is provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1078345812458085">Table 2</xref>.</p>

<p>Missing from the three DEBI (SISTA, START, and VOICES) interventions is a specific link between health risk behaviors and criminal behaviors, or criminogenics. <italic>Criminogenic</italic> refers to factors, characteristics, or influences that have been consistently associated with the commission of criminal behaviors. In the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1078345812458085">Lowenkamp, Holsinger, and Latessa (2001</xref>) approach, “risk predictors are those factors identified through recidivism research that can be targeted and changed through correctional intervention.” These factors include such areas as prior criminal behaviors and involvement, substance abuse, family dysfunction, antisocial/criminal peers, certain personality traits, low self-control, criminal thinking patterns, and poor social involvement, among others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1078345812458085">Taxman, 2006</xref>). With respect to criminogenics, we tend to speak of criminogenic risk/need being of two types in the corrections world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1078345812458085">Andrews, Bonta, &amp; Hoge, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1078345812458085">Hanson &amp; Harris, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1078345812458085">Lowenkamp, Holsinger, &amp; Latessa, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1078345812458085">Schlager &amp; Simourd, 2007</xref>). <italic>Static risks</italic> are those correlates that cannot be changed, such as biological sex, race, and age. <italic>Dynamic factors</italic> (or risk/need) are those variables, especially behavioral, that are subject to modification to improve a desired outcome. Key dynamic factors on which correctional programs can focus include educational attainment, substance dependence, and job skills. Some instruments have also been shown to be effective in predicting rules violations during incarceration—correlates of the risks often cited in the public health literature such as sexual behavior and/or substance use.</p>
<p>The MISTERS intervention is based directly on the “information-motivation-behavioral skills model” of HIV behavior change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1078345812458085">Fisher &amp; Fisher, 1992</xref>). MISTERS adds to health promotion and disease prevention the element of dynamic criminogenic risk reduction by focusing on the role of substance use/abuse, anger management, and errors in thinking that lead individuals to behave in ways that bring them to the attention of law enforcement agencies. When examined in the context of an epidemiological criminology perspective, whether it is a very brief intervention of 2 hours focusing on the role of substance abuse as a criminogenic or health risk, the intervention is sufficient and is one area of inquiry for our current evaluation of the MISTERS program in Orange County. However, the issue becomes whether a brief intervention of any type is sufficient to change both health practices and criminal behaviors, which can lead policymakers, practitioners, and academics to ask a broader question of whether or not a new model is needed that takes into account both the public health and the criminal justice perspective, as opposed to one versus the other.</p>
<p>MISTERS fits within the “problem syndrome” approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1078345812458085">Donovan, Jessor, &amp; Costa, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1078345812458085">Jessor &amp; Jessor, 1977</xref>) developed from earlier work exploring the issues brought to juvenile justice by the youth processed through that system. That is, rather than assuming that delinquent/criminal behavior in itself is the only problem presented by most of those involved with criminal justice systems, it recognizes that Criminal Justice-Involved persons often have problems that place them at risk of encountering the criminal justice system. In the context of reentering inmates, or those who are on community supervision (probation, diversion) with little or no incarceration experience, this approach seeks to identify whether substance abuse, psychological, financial, or other problem areas contribute to the delinquent/criminal behavior that brought the persons to the attention of law enforcement. Missing from all of the interventions listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1078345812458085">Table 1</xref> is the role of the mental health status of individuals in the criminal justice system, especially those with co-occurring disorders, an area in desperate need of attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1078345812458085">Osher &amp; Steadman, 2007</xref>).</p>

<title>Health and Criminogenic Factors in a MISTERS Cohort</title>
<p>The Orange MISTERS program had been in operation for 10 months for outreach and intervention purposes when our data were collected. After potential participants have been screened for inclusion and signed an informed consent agreement, they complete a lengthy baseline psychosocial interview. As in the original DeKalb County (Georgia) MISTERS program, participants are randomized into either a control group that receives the VOICES session only or the treatment group that receives the 10-hour MISTERS intervention. The VOICES session and STD/HIV knowledge and condom demonstration round out the first 2 hours of the MISTERS program. Four more 2-hour segments follow, dealing with more in-depth knowledge about STD/HIV/hepatitis risk and protective behaviors, substance abuse, anger management, and life skills topics and situational exercises. The original DeKalb MISTERS program was conducted over a 5-night sequence in a 2-week period. The Orange MISTERS program has found it necessary to modify the delivery to a 3-day sequence with two 4-hour same-day sessions. Follow-up interviews using a similar interview instrument will occur at 3, 6, and 12 months postintervention.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1078345812458085" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>Data collected for the Orange MISTERS project had multiple purposes. First, the data had to include risk information required by the CDC’s Program Evaluation Management System (PEMS). Next, an expanded set of data is collected for program evaluation purposes beyond the PEMS system. Finally, we attempted to use as many questions from the DeKalb MISTERS project as possible for evaluation comparative purposes. For data collection purposes, the MISTERS baseline questionnaire was first modified by the University of Central Florida (UCF) team for local compatibility and additional analysis points of interest.</p>
<p>Data were collected by outreach workers employed by Nehemiah Education and Economic Development (NEED). They first screened potential participants with a 10-question survey that determined eligibility based on disqualifying criteria (e.g., sex offense history, intoxication at the time of screening, reporting no sexual activity in the past year). If a participant was eligible, a baseline questionnaire was administered by outreach workers. Data entry first occurred at NEED offices for the PEMS database and then at UCF for the project evaluation. All data collection instruments and procedures were reviewed and approved by the UCF Institutional Review Board.</p>
<p>Preliminary statistical analyses were generated by SPSS (v.16) using frequencies and cross-tabulations. Data points with missing cases were later reexamined to determine a possible entry; if none was possible, the entry was marked as a “missing case” in the data analysis. Many sexual history questions had “missing case” entries. Many of these are because of the skip patterns employed in the questionnaire. Some missing data are generated due to questions about main and non-main sexual partners where respondents may not have had both. This is especially true for the questions detailing condom use and intoxication during sex.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1078345812458085">
<title>Results</title>
<p>For this article, we examined the descriptive univariate-level health and criminogenic risks brought to the project by 110 Criminal Justice-Involved men in the community who have qualified for participation in the first 10 months. All men who agreed to participate in the program had been previously incarcerated (<italic>n</italic> = 110). The length of incarceration ranged from 1 night to 21 years, with a median of 60 nights confinement. About 90% of the men self-identified as African Americans, the remainder primarily Latino. The average age of the participants was 36 years, with a range from 18 to 65 years.</p>
<sec id="section5-1078345812458085">
<title>Health Risks</title>
<p>Section A of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1078345812458085">Table 3</xref> presents the frequencies for health-related risks for acquiring HIV, STDs, and viral hepatitis among the MISTERS participants. Eighty percent of the men reported having vaginal sex since their last incarceration; 57% reported using a condom at least once during one of those sexual encounters, leaving 43% who reported no condom use. Vaginal sex with a “main” sexual partner was reported by 75% of the men, and 45% used a condom with that partner at least once. Fifty-six percent of the men reported having vaginal sex with a “non-main” partner, with 80% using a condom at least once during those encounters. Oral sex with a “main” partner was reported by 38% of the men, but only 28% reported using a condom or dental dam (72% nonuse). Oral sex with a non-main partner was reported by 44%, and 56% of those report not using a condom or dental dam during the encounters. About one quarter of the men reported “receptive oral sex,” but with high levels of condom use (89%). Only five of the men reported “receptive anal sex,” and only one participant self-identified as having a same-sex orientation. Among those who reported receptive anal sex, however, condom use and nonuse was relatively evenly divided. Unfortunately, we did not ask about the consistency of condom use across partners and encounters. As part of the project men are tested for HIV, chlamydia, and gonorrhea. Among the 110 tested in this time period, three were found to be living with HIV (and previously unreported cases). One case of chlamydia, one of gonorrhea, and one of genital herpes were reported. None of the men had more than one disease.</p>

<title>Substance Use</title>
<p>Substance use and abuse provides one of the common pathways to poor health outcomes and criminal justice involvement. In this group, alcohol use was relatively common, with 61% reporting they had consumed alcohol within 30 days of the interview and 29% reporting they had become intoxicated in that time frame. Marijuana use was the second most frequently reported substance used (23%) and the most frequently used illegal drug. Cocaine (powder or crack) and other illegal drug use each were reported by only 2% of the respondents. For all substances reported, inhalation was the only route of administration reported; no needle/injection use. How much underreporting might have occurred, especially because of the levels of criminal justice supervision (see below), is an open question.</p>

<sec id="section7-1078345812458085">
<title>Criminal Justice System Involvement</title>
<p>As noted earlier, all of the men who agreed to participate in the Orange MISTERS program had spent at least 1 night in jail, and several had prison experiences up to 2 decades of confinement. Just over three quarters (77%) reported a history of misdemeanor arrests or convictions. Misdemeanors are crimes that attract a potential period of detention for 1 year or less in Florida. Three quarters (75%) reported a history of felony arrests or convictions. In Florida, felony convictions carry a potential period of imprisonment of 1 year and a day to life imprisonment or the death penalty. In addition, 75% of the men report a history of being on probation and 49% were on probation status at the time of the interview. Only 19% reported a history of being on parole, with 8% on parole status at the time of the interview.<sup>

<title>Implications From the Epidemiological Criminology Framework</title>
<p>Working from information collected from a group of men voluntarily participating in a health and criminogenic risk reduction intervention is illustrative, but not necessarily generalizable to the nation. However, for the purposes of demonstrating the application of the epidemiological criminology framework, these data are instructive. We can see that health and criminogenic (static, at least) risk are characteristics of the lives being lived by these men in their community, either alone or with their extended family. The presence of relatively high levels of substance use, legal and illegal, points to a common behavior that can potentially lead to risky sexual practices and recidivism back into the criminal justice system. Indeed, through disease testing as part of the program, we witnessed, firsthand, that some of the men have already been negatively impacted by their past behaviors. What we cannot address in this analysis is the causal ordering that exists among risky sexual behavior, criminal justice involvement, and substance use.</p>
<p>The epidemiological criminology framework provides an intellectual space in which to explore the common causal pathways that lead to both health risk behaviors and criminal justice involvement. For example, in a demonstration project built on the epidemiological criminology framework, we could anticipate exploring not only the individual (bio-psycho) level variables, but also the community and societal factors (psychosocial, environmental, geospatial, economic) that contribute to co-occurring health and criminal problems for the individual, groups, communities, and nation-states (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1078345812458085">Figure 1</xref>). The co-occurrence of health and social problems has been noted in the United States since at least the days of the Chicago School of Social Ecology. Our tendency, unfortunately, has been to separate these issues through disciplinary silos, despite attempts to draw them together by notable researchers such as Richard Jessor and Ronald Akers.</p>

<p>The epidemiological criminology framework also provides possibilities for thinking about interventions that target multiple domains simultaneously. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1078345812458085">Lanier and Lutya (2009</xref>, p. 11; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1078345812458085">Lanier, 2010</xref>) list “interdisciplinary collaboration” as one of the five benefits of this approach to health professionals. Again, we want to expand that notion to thinking about programs that affect not only health but also criminal behaviors simultaneously. Programs that reduce youth violence reduce youth injuries from violence; programs that increase self-control among young people may also decrease vehicle-related injuries, as well as speeding and perhaps criminal behaviors. If there are underlying dimensions of risk taking for both health and criminal behaviors, using the epidemiological criminology framework may help intervention developers to broaden the range of outcomes they intend to target. This means we would no longer rely on “happy accidents” and unintended consequences, but instead think strategically about using one interdisciplinary domain to affect multiple disciplinary outcomes.</p>
<p>For thinking about reentry and work with Criminal Justice-Involved persons in the community, the MISTERS program provides an example of employing the epidemiological criminology paradigm, though the developer of MISTERS (Charles Sperling) only learned of this approach after he developed the program. MISTERS seeks to reduce thoughts, beliefs, and behaviors that lead to both sexual risk taking and behaviors that have resulted in criminal justice involvement in the lives of men returning from jail or prison. Whether it is the health risks or the criminogenic needs/risks that provide the most risk reduction, or a synergy of the two, is the empirical question we seek to address in the evaluation of the Orange MISTERS program. Without the dual focus, however, MISTERS would be simply another health- or crime-reduction intervention. With the dual focus, it provides an exemplar of how epidemiological criminology can be conceptualized and applied to reentry and recidivism for both health and crime risks.</p>
<p>In some ways, this relationship between the MISTERS program and epidemiological criminology is not accidental, as both have evolved from common roots at the CDC. In the late 1990s, while Akers and Potter were at the CDC, they began to develop their idea of epidemiological criminology into more of a unified construct while moving it away from being simply a collision of two disciplines. One author was also present at the development of the MISTERS program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1078345812458085">Williams &amp; Sperling, 2005</xref>). Both authors eventually left the CDC for academia and reengaged the epidemiological criminology development process. One of the authors, with community partners, was able to secure funding to replicate the MISTERS program while the other author began introducing this new paradigm to colleagues through meetings, presentations, reports, and articles. The unique nature of the MISTERS program in relation to other health-focused programs for Criminal Justice-Involved populations is demonstrated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1078345812458085">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Development of the Epidemiological Criminology Framework</title>
<p>The development of the epidemiological criminology framework has been a work in progress since the early 1990s, addressing initially the issues around sentencing disparities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1078345812458085">Akers &amp; Corley, 1991</xref>). As the 1990s advanced so too did our effort at slowly evolving the epidemiological criminology model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1078345812458085">Akers &amp; Potter, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1078345812458085">2003</xref>). When we leap forward a decade, we see that readers of this journal have been exposed to another variant of the epidemiological criminology framework as it applies to drug use among African American gang members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1078345812458085">Lanier, Pack, &amp; Akers, 2010</xref>) and other scientific venues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1078345812458085">Akers, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1078345812458085">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1078345812458085">Akers &amp; Lanier, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1078345812458085">Lanier, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1078345812458085">Lanier, Lucken, &amp; Akers, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1078345812458085">Lanier &amp; Lutya, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1078345812458085">Potter, 2008</xref>; among others), illustrating this convergence between criminal behavior and health. The purpose of incorporating the epidemiological criminology model into this analysis is to address how easily it may be generalized to other research and application.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1078345812458085">Figure 1</xref> provides a graphic representation of the epidemiological criminology framework. It illustrates the continuum of behaviors that are impacted by bio-psycho-social-environmental factors, which includes almost all human behavior. To think of these domains as separate and distinct minimizes their relationship, depth, and complexity. This is especially true when we wish to understand more thoroughly their interactions and impacts on one another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1078345812458085">Zhang, Wieczorek, &amp; Welte, 1997</xref>). The behavioral components of crime and health disparities comprise a complex set of factors that can influence and impact the individual, family, community, and society at large. Current behavioral approaches have lacked a coherent interdisciplinary framework, diagrammatical representation, or theoretical model with which to approach seemingly divergent perspectives of crime and health.</p>
<p>Our departure from Lanier’s (2010) definition is to create a more functional, operational, and causal “framework” of epidemiological criminology. This revised definition directs a focus to the study of variables/factors that contribute to both criminogenic and health risks, that is, common causal pathways. These variables are hypothesized to include biological, psychological, social, and environmental factors—the bio-psycho-social-environmental approach—to the study of both health and criminal behavior (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1078345812458085">Figure 1</xref>). This expanded nature of the epidemiological criminology model can include, but not be limited to, the geospatial, legal, philosophical, and technological boundaries related to both health and crime. Behavior is a bio-psycho-social-environmental product; law is a social product. Without law there is no crime, only behavior judged to be “harmful” by some group. For something to fall within the domain of epidemiological criminology, it must acknowledge the primacy of the legal definition of a behavior as criminal (or delinquent).</p>
<p>One way to examine the epidemiological criminology framework in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1078345812458085">Figure 1</xref> is to first and foremost think of it as a snapshot of dynamic interactions among the individual, family, community, or society. These levels need to be thought of as interacting with one another. Some factors may have a greater impact on behavior than others. That is, all behaviors have some biological component, from the electrical activity involved in thought process through the mechanical activity involved in striking another person or sexual activity. Behaviors are a complex interaction in the biology of a person, from how they think psychologically, to how they interact with others socially, to their behavior’s impact on the larger environment. Social context leads to the development of morals, ethics, rules, and laws that define behaviors as acceptable or unacceptable, and provides justification and punishment for deviation from those laws. Established social practices provide the definitions of pity or stigma attached to behaviors and diseases.</p>
<p>Another brief example would be the legal and social stigma attached to the use of illegal substances resulting in criminal prosecution and conviction. Even before one might come to the attention of law enforcement for possession of illegal substances, many communities will have attached a social devaluation (stigma) to the user, which may be aggravated by the condition of arrest, prosecution, and conviction. The developmental pathways that led the individual to engage in the use of illegal substances fall into the epidemiological criminology framework. These common causal variables can lead to the probable effects of poor health and criminal behavioral outcomes.</p>
<p>Were there not a criminal definition (and penalties) attached to the potential health outcome, such as substance use or the intentional infection of someone with HIV, then it would not fall under the epidemiological criminology framework. It would belong, more properly, to the domain of the sociology of deviance. However, if substance use or risky sexual behavior places one at risk of committing <italic>x</italic> or being the victim of a criminal act, then it would fall within the scope of our paradigm. Following that logic, the movement of legal boundaries around drunk driving from “stupid” to criminal behavior is of interest to this framework because it combines potential health and criminal outcomes. It is the dual poor health and criminal outcome that places the phenomenon in the realm of epidemiological criminology.</p>
<p>Simply examining disparities in either criminal populations or poor health outcomes is not epidemiological criminology. Indeed, research on disparities across ethnic groups in the areas of crime and health is a hardly recent development. Disproportionate minority contact with the justice system has been a concern in criminal justice and criminology since the 1970s. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1078345812458085">Figure 1</xref> further illustrates how biomedical or behavioral disparities can fall under the domain of crime or health. Health disparities research, for example, has been a staple of the sociology of health. Public health’s interest in criminal justice populations along with their social determinants of health blossomed in the 1990s.</p>
<p>Criminal justice and public health are interdisciplinary areas often drawing from the same core social sciences of anthropology, economics, psychology, and sociology. In the context of criminal justice and public health practitioners, while there may be direct relationships, their interconnectedness may be less obvious. Through the epidemiological criminology framework we hope to illuminate those conditions that cause and/or contribute to the development of health and criminal justice problems and disparities by developing innovative interventions that address the intersection between both criminal and poor health outcomes. We offer MISTERS as an exemplar of this sort of approach in this article.</p>

<p>Probation and parole are terms that have become muddied in practice over the past 2 decades. Traditionally, probation referred to a term of community supervision without imprisonment (one might have been in jail, however); parole referred to post-prison conditional release and supervision in the community. Probation terms are often associated with short stays in jail or “shock-type” prison incarcerations of short duration and release back into the community. Parole, on the other hand, is generally an earned conditional release associated with serving a significant portion of one’s prison sentence. Violation of either supervision status can result in reincarceration.</p>
