<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) is a constellation of left-sided heart defects that results in variable hypoplasia of the left ventricle, left ventricular outflow tract, and aorta, ultimately resulting in the left heart’s inability to support the systemic circulation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1089253213480853">1</xref></sup> With an incidence of 0.2 per 1000 live births, HLHS is the most common single ventricle congenital heart defect.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1089253213480853">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1089253213480853">3</xref></sup> This complex congenital heart disease invariably leads to death if untreated, but since the first successful repair of this lesion by Norwood et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1089253213480853">4</xref></sup> care of these patients has undergone a paradigm shift. The successful palliation, preoperative care, and postoperative care for these patients have now become routine in many centers. Early survival is now as high as 75% to 90%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1089253213480853">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1089253213480853">6</xref></sup> with modern surgical and postoperative care. Critical to the management of these patients is perioperative imaging with transthoracic echocardiography, supplemented by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and cardiac catheterization. Imaging serves to delineate the anatomy and physiology of this complex lesion, which is critical for surgical planning, risk stratification, prognosis, clinical decision making, parental counseling, and diagnosis of postoperative complications.</p>
<p>This review considers the preoperative evaluation of HLHS using transthoracic echocardiography and cardiac MRI with particular emphasis on preoperative anatomy, risk stratification, and surgical planning in borderline cases. Postoperative transthoracic echocardiography and cardiac MRI for the assessment of complications from the Norwood procedure is also addressed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1089253213480853">
<title>Background</title>
<p>Hypoplastic left heart syndrome was first described by Lev<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1089253213480853">7</xref></sup> in 1952 and the description has been refined over the intervening years. The final pathway for HLHS is hypoplasia of the left ventricle, outflow tract, and aorta. Individual lesions that make up this constellation include supravalvar mitral ring, mitral stenosis/atresia, aortic stenosis/atresia, structural abnormalities of the mitral and aortic valves, aortic hypoplasia, and coarctation of the aorta. The left ventricle in HLHS can vary from a rudimentary slit-like structure to mild hypoplasia. Included in this group of patients are those whose left ventricle’s ability to support the systemic circulation is difficult to determine. Some authors have dubbed this borderline subgroup as hypoplastic left heart complex (HLHC).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1089253213480853">8</xref></sup> Identifying this group is important because there has been some success with initial biventricular repair or a staged approach resulting in eventual biventricular physiology in these patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1089253213480853">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1089253213480853"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1089253213480853"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1089253213480853"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1089253213480853"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1089253213480853">14</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1089253213480853">
<title>Pathophysiology</title>
<p>The physiology that unites this lesion is hypoplasia of the left ventricle characterized by left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Except in the subgroup of HLHC, this physiology results in a left heart that cannot support the systemic circulation. Left ventricular hypoplasia is tolerated well in utero because the foramen ovale and ductus arteriosus bypass the left heart, allowing the right ventricle to produce the majority of cardiac output. Maintenance of these fetal structures after birth is necessary for survival because at this time egress from the left atrium is mostly accomplished by flow across the foramen ovale rather than the mitral valve, especially in cases of mitral atresia where egress from the left atrium is entirely dependent on the foramen ovale. Significant restriction of this atrial level left-to-right shunt is not well tolerated and must be recognized and treated promptly (see Atrial Septum section).</p>
<p>Mitral atresia is an extreme form of HLHS that prevents filling of the left ventricle, arresting its development and resulting in a very rudimentary left ventricle and aortic atresia. A rare exception to this pattern is when there is a ventricular septal defect, which allows ventricular filling and development.</p>
<p>In the case of mitral stenosis there is variable hypoplasia of the left ventricle. Egress from the left ventricle is accomplished though a stenotic aortic valve or rarely through a ventricular septal defect. When neither of these routes is available, as in the case of mitral stenosis with aortic atresia, the ventricle becomes extremely hypertensive and can develop ventriculocoronary connections (sinusoids) and fibrotic changes to the endocardium or endocardial fibroelastosis (EFE).</p>
<p>The left ventricle’s ability to contribute to systemic output depends on the severity of the HLHS. In the majority of cases, the left ventricle does not contribute meaningfully to systemic output. Therefore, the right ventricle supplies systolic flow to the entire aortic arch via the ductus arteriosus. In less severely affected patients, the left ventricle contributes to systemic output providing antegrade filling of the ascending aorta and transverse aortic arch.</p>
<p>The dominant physiology is one of balance between the pulmonary and systemic circulation. Because the right ventricle supplies both circuits the balance between pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance dictates the relative flow to each circuit. Balancing these flows is the key to avoiding the extremes of pulmonary overcirculation with acidosis and shock versus severe cyanosis in both the preoperative and postoperative states.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1089253213480853">
<title>Management Strategies</title>
<p>The majority of patients with HLHS will proceed down a single ventricle palliation pathway consisting of 3 operations: (<italic>a</italic>) the Norwood procedure, (<italic>b</italic>) superior cavopulmonary anastomosis, and (<italic>c</italic>) Fontan completion. For the purposes of this review, we will only consider the first palliative surgery. Patients are typically treated with a prostaglandin E1 infusion to maintain ductus arteriosus patency until surgery can be performed, usually in the first week of life.</p>
<sec id="section5-1089253213480853">
<title>Norwood Procedure</title>
<p>The Norwood procedure consists of an anastomosis of the ascending aorta with the pulmonary artery, augmentation of the aortic arch, placement of a modified Blalock–Taussig (MBT) shunt, and atrial septectomy. The anastomosis of the ascending aorta with the pulmonary artery and augmentation of the aortic arch results in a neo-aorta that arises from the right ventricle and supplies both systemic output and flow to the coronary arteries. The MBT shunt supplies pulmonary blood flow.</p>
<p>A variation on this procedure, described by Sano et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1089253213480853">15</xref></sup> replaces the MBT shunt with a right ventricle to pulmonary artery conduit.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1089253213480853">
<title>Hybrid Procedure</title>
<p>The hybrid procedure is an attempt to mimic the Norwood physiology while avoiding cardiopulmonary bypass. This procedure involves placing a stent in the patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) to serve as a protected supply of pulmonary blood flow. A balloon atrial septostomy with or without stent placement in the atrial septum is used to guarantee unobstructed flow across the atrial septum. Finally, bilateral pulmonary artery bands are place surgically to limit pulmonary blood flow. This option is usually reserved for high-risk patients who are not able to tolerate cardiopulmonary bypass.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1089253213480853">
<title>Primary Transplant</title>
<p>A minority of centers use cardiac transplantation as the primary approach to HLHS. This approach may lead to higher quality of life, but it is limited by organ supply.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1089253213480853">
<title>Preoperative Imaging</title>
<p>The mainstay of preoperative imaging in hypoplastic left heart syndrome is transthoracic echocardiography. There are specialized cases where cardiac MRI can provide important additional data. Although no longer routinely used, cardiac catheterization can also provide important information in cases of aortic atresia and mitral stenosis where left ventricular coronary sinusoids are present or when a hybrid procedure is planned.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1089253213480853">
<title>Transthoracic Echocardiography</title>
<p>The goal of preoperative imaging is to visualize the relevant anatomy and physiology. In most cases, transthoracic echocardiography will suffice.</p>
<sec id="section10-1089253213480853">
<title>Pulmonary Veins</title>
<p>The pulmonary venous anatomy must be carefully defined. In a large cohort of infants with HLHS, 6.3% had anomalous drainage of the pulmonary veins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1089253213480853">16</xref></sup> Anomalous pulmonary veins complicate the surgical approach in both the Norwood procedure and in primary transplantation; therefore, anomalous pulmonary veins must be diagnosed preoperatively. In cases where echocardiography does not adequately define the pulmonary venous anatomy, cardiac MRI may be helpful.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1089253213480853">
<title>Atrial Septum</title>
<p>The atrial septal communication is also critical to the preoperative physiology in HLHS. Except in rare cases, the atrial communication is the only available egress for left atrial blood and can range from completely unobstructed to nonexistent.</p>
<p>Aside from the patient’s clinical status and chest radiography, the principle way to assess the patency of the atrial communication is by echocardiography. The size of the defect can be easily assessed with 2-dimensional imaging. Color flow Doppler of the atrial communication highlights the abnormally turbulent flow, and pulsed wave Doppler can be used to calculate the mean pressure gradient across the defect. Because of the peculiar anatomy of the atrial septum in HLHS, the septum primum typically has a leftward and superior displacement of its insertion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1089253213480853">Figure 1</xref>). This particular anatomy results in an unusual location of the atrial communication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1089253213480853">17</xref></sup> with a more superiorly and posteriorly directed jet across the atrial septum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1089253213480853">Figure 2</xref>). Therefore, it can be difficult to properly align the ultrasound beam with the flow across the atrial septum. Poor alignment will result in a falsely low calculated gradient.</p>

The superior insertion of the septum primum has resulted in a relatively superior foramen ovale. The turbulent jet across the foramen ovale (arrow) can be seen directed superiorly crossing the flow from the superior vena cava (red). This unusual orientation of flow across the foramen ovale is typical of patients with hypoplastic left heart syndrome and care must be taken to properly align with the jet in order to calculate mean gradient.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1089253213480853-fig2.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>A completely unobstructed atrial level communication could potentially cause excessive pulmonary blood flow at the expense of systemic blood flow. If unchecked, this imbalance leads to systemic hypoperfusion, acidosis, and death. Some restriction at the atrial level is beneficial over the short term because it results in mild pulmonary venous hypertension and reflex vasoconstriction of the pulmonary arteries, limiting pulmonary blood flow.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1089253213480853">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>On the other hand, severe restriction at the atrial level tips the balance away from pulmonary blood flow resulting in cyanosis and poor oxygen delivery. If mechanical ventilation fails to resolve this cyanosis, an atrial septostomy with or without stent placement is needed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1089253213480853">Figure 3</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1089253213480853">18</xref></sup> At the extreme end of this spectrum is an intact atrial septum where there is essentially no egress from the left atrium. A minority of these patients develop collateral vessels, which serve as an alternate route for blood flow out of the left atrium. These patients’ clinical presentation resembles more mild forms of atrial level restriction. It is important to image the entire course of these decompressing veins with two-dimensional imaging and pulse wave Doppler, as they can become stenotic over time.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1089253213480853">17</xref></sup> Patients with an intact or highly restrictive atrial septum without a decompressing vein require urgent intervention at birth. In utero, they have severely elevated left atrial and pulmonary venous pressure causing arterialization of the pulmonary veins and abnormal development of the entire pulmonary vasculature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1089253213480853">19</xref></sup> This abnormal development is likely the principal factor in their low rate of survival, despite aggressive postnatal interventions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1089253213480853">20</xref></sup> Fortunately, a number of these patients are discovered prenatally, permitting preparation for decompression of the atrial septum immediately after birth. Prenatal diagnosis and risk stratification also allows the patient to be referred to centers where in utero atrial septal perforation can be performed. Experience is too limited at this time, however, to know if this strategy will ultimately increase survival.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1089253213480853">21</xref></sup></p>

<p>Transthoracic echocardiography is the imaging tool of choice to provide valuable information regarding the extent of atrial level communication patency.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1089253213480853">
<title>Mitral Valve</title>
<p>The mitral valve is highly relevant in the pathophysiology of HLHS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1089253213480853">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1089253213480853">18</xref></sup> The valve anatomy can vary from absent to mildly hypoplastic and from stenotic to atretic. The structure of the mitral valve can be dysplastic, thickened and doming limiting its excursion resulting in stenosis. The papillary muscle arrangement and chordal support structure must be visualized. In some cases, the majority of chordal attachments arise from one papillary muscle resulting in a stenotic “parachute” mitral valve. Accurate description of the mitral valve structure is critical in cases of biventricular repair because structural abnormalities of the mitral valve can preclude biventricular repair or require mitral valve intervention, such as papillary muscle splitting, at the time of repair.</p>
<p>Functional evaluation of the mitral valve is also highly relevant. In the case of mitral stenosis without significant regurgitation and aortic atresia, the left ventricle has inflow without any egress. This anatomy causes very high left ventricular pressure, which results in ventriculocoronary connections, endocardial fibroelastosis, and left ventricular hypertrophy. A recent study showed that 15% of patients with mitral stenosis without significant regurgitation and aortic atresia, had evidence of these connections on transthoracic echocardiography.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1089253213480853">22</xref></sup> For unclear reasons, patients with this particular subset of HLHS have increased mortality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1089253213480853">23</xref></sup> It is possible that ventriculocoronary connections predispose these patients to ischemia and arrhythmia. It is important, therefore, to carefully examine the left ventricular myocardium in these patients with color Doppler to discover these connections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1089253213480853">Figure 4</xref>). It may be difficult to distinguish between ventriculocoronary connections and prominent trabeculations in the myocardium. If definitive diagnosis of these connections cannot be done by echocardiography, cardiac catheterization should be performed.</p>

<title>Left Ventricle</title>
<p>Assessment of the size, function, and hypertrophy of the left ventricle itself is required. In severe cases, where there is only a rudimentary left ventricle, further investigation may not be needed; however, in borderline hypoplasia of the left ventricle a careful investigation of its size and function is imperative to determine if a biventricular repair is possible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1089253213480853">Figure 5</xref>; see Borderline Left Ventricle section).</p>

<title>Outflow Tract and Aortic Valve</title>
<p>The aortic outflow tract can be hypoplastic. The aortic valve can range from stenotic to atretic. The aortic valve can be uni/bicommissural, thickened, doming, and hypoplastic.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1089253213480853">
<title>Aorta and Patent Ductus Arteriosus</title>
<p>Dimensions of the entire aortic arch are necessary for surgical planning and risk stratification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1089253213480853">Figure 6</xref>). In particular, a smaller diameter of the ascending aorta (&lt;2 mm) has been associated with increased mortality during the Norwood operation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1089253213480853">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1089253213480853">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1089253213480853">26</xref></sup></p>

</fig>
<p>In HLHS, the aortic arch is typically severely hypoplastic requiring reconstruction of the entire arch. As such, describing the branching pattern of the arch is necessary. For example, a left aortic arch with an aberrant right subclavian will have a right carotid artery as the first branch rather than a right innominate artery. In this case, the right carotid artery will be significantly smaller, which may require the placement of a central shunt rather than an MBT shunt to avoid proximal stenosis. HLHS with a right aortic arch has also been described.</p>
<p>Patients with HLHS usually have a large PDA when they are born (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1089253213480853">Figure 7</xref>). Without medical intervention, the PDA may close in the first days of life. As the PDA in HLHS supplies most or all of the systemic output, patients who experience PDA closure present with acidosis and shock. With a large PDA, there is systolic right-to-left shunting, supplying blood to both the ascending and descending aorta followed by diastolic runoff into the pulmonary arteries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1089253213480853">Figure 8</xref>).</p>

<p>The coronary arteries are usually normal in HLHS. Their anatomy and presence of any connections to the ventricle should be documented. The right coronary artery system is usually enlarged compared with the left because of the differential in myocardial mass.

<p>Magnetic resonance angiogram techniques use a contrast agent, which is injected intravenously and imaged with a 3-dimensional acquisition. MR angiograms are particularly useful in HLHS because it identifies all the vessels in the thorax in standard planes, nonstandard oblique planes, and 3-dimensional volume rendered formats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1089253213480853">Figure 9</xref>).

<p>In our center, a common indication for cardiac MRI is in a patient with unrepaired HLHS with suspected anomalous pulmonary veins, which echocardiography could not fully define (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1089253213480853">Figure 10</xref>). Cardiac MRI is also helpful to determine the suitability for biventricular repair. Cardiac MRI can more accurately calculate the volume of the left ventricle without using the geometric assumptions typically of volume assessments in echocardiography.</p>

<title>Borderline Left Ventricle</title>
<p>Hypoplastic left heart complex is the subset of HLHS where the left-sided valves are small but not structurally abnormal. HLHC also requires absence of EFE in the left ventricle permitting the possibility of biventricular repair.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1089253213480853">13</xref></sup> The management of these patients is controversial because the short-term risk of a biventricular repair must be weighed against the long-term morbidity and mortality of a univentricular repair.</p>
<sec id="section20-1089253213480853">
<title>Echocardiography</title>
<p>Echocardiography is the workhorse for determining the feasibility of a biventricular repair in these patients. The first step in this evaluation is to diagnose any lesions that would preclude biventricular repair. These may include dysplastic mitral valve, parachute mitral valve, mitral valve arcade, dysplastic aortic valve, or unicommissural aortic valve.</p>
<p>Once these lesions are excluded, the size of the left heart must be considered. Mitral valve annulus size, mitral valve area, left ventricular volume, length of the left ventricle, left ventricular function, the presence of left ventricular EFE, aortic valve annulus size, and aortic root size should be measured. Rhodes et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1089253213480853">28</xref></sup> have developed a predictive model that incorporates some of the 2-dimensional parameters mentioned above to determine the survival rate of biventricular repair in patients with critical aortic stenosis. A constellation of these parameters predicts survival in &gt;90% of cases, but there is significant overlap between survivors and nonsurvivors when only one parameter is considered. In fact, the commonly accepted limit of a left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) of at least 20 mL/m<sup>2</sup> is not always necessary.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1089253213480853">28</xref></sup> In critical aortic stenosis, a lesion similar to HLHC, multiple authors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1089253213480853">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1089253213480853"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1089253213480853">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1089253213480853">13</xref></sup> have demonstrated successful biventricular repairs in patients with unfavorable Rhodes scores and left ventricles with an LVEDV of &lt;20 mL/m<sup>2</sup>. A revision of the Rhodes model to include the aortic annulus has better predictive value.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1089253213480853">29</xref></sup> Therefore, this parameter may have particular importance, although there is no absolute minimum cutoff of aortic annular size in determining the feasibility of biventricular repair.</p>
<p>In addition to these 2-dimensional parameters, interrogation of the aortic arch with color flow Doppler is also important in HLHC. In contrast to HLHS, where the aortic arch is invariably supplied retrograde from the PDA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1089253213480853">Figure 11</xref>), in HLHC there may be antegrade filling of the ascending aorta and transverse aortic arch, suggesting that the ventricular function is more robust. Indeed, in critical aortic stenosis, antegrade filling of the aortic arch does predict successful biventricular repair.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1089253213480853">30</xref></sup> When this criterion is applied to HLHC patients, however, the data are mixed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1089253213480853">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1089253213480853">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1089253213480853">31</xref></sup></p>

<title>Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging</title>
<p>Cardiac MRI may provide additional information in this difficult patient population. Because it does not rely on geometric assumptions, cardiac MRI can more accurately measure left ventricular volumes, whereas echocardiographic techniques typically assume the ventricle to be bullet shaped. This assumption is not often the case in HLHC because right ventricular loading conditions shift the ventricular septum leftward. In a series of 20 neonates with an LVEDV &lt;30 mL/m<sup>2</sup>, Grosse-Wortman et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1089253213480853">9</xref></sup> found that echocardiography underestimates the ventricular volume when compared with MRI. In fact, in their series, the majority of patients who underwent successful biventricular repair had left ventricular end-systolic volumes of &lt;20 mL/m<sup>2</sup> when measured by echocardiography. Therefore, the echo-determined limit of 20 mL/m<sup>2</sup> would unfairly exclude some patients for biventricular repair.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1089253213480853">9</xref></sup> Although they were not able to propose a new LVEDV limit by cardiac MRI, this area holds promise for future studies.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, the decision between single and biventricular repair in this population rests on the left ventricle’s ability to maintain an adequate cardiac output. Phase contrast imaging by cardiac MRI can accurately measure flow in vessels as small as 16 × 16 pixels.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1089253213480853">32</xref></sup> Unlike echocardiography, therefore, cardiac MRI has the ability to measure the output through even the smallest left heart prior to repair. Quantitative left ventricular flow by cardiac MRI may prove to be an important functional parameter for predicting success in biventricular repair.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1089253213480853">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although the presence of EFE is most often used to exclude patients from biventricular repair, some centers now perform left ventricular rehabilitation with EFE resection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1089253213480853">6</xref></sup> Using myocardial delayed enhancement imaging, cardiac MRI is an excellent tool for demonstrating the location and extent of EFE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1089253213480853">24</xref></sup> Cardiac MRI has therefore become an integral part of surgical planning for left ventricular rehabilitation.</p>

<title>Intraoperative Imaging</title>
<p>Intraoperative imaging during the Norwood procedure is not always needed, but transesophageal echocardiography can be used to reveal complications associated with separation from bypass including; neo-aortic regurgitation, poor right ventricular systolic function, tricuspid valve regurgitation, and aortic arch obstruction. All are poorly tolerated in the immediate postoperative period.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-1089253213480853">
<title>Postoperative imaging</title>
<p>The immediate postoperative period is a tenuous time for patients with HLHS. Postoperative imaging is used to diagnose surgical complications and to confirm the cardiac physiology needed to guide medical therapy. Transthoracic echocardiography has significant advantage during this time as it is portable and readily available for patients in the intensive care unit. Occasional patients who are stable enough to travel may require more extensive imaging in the MRI scanner.</p>
<sec id="section24-1089253213480853">
<title>Atrial Septum</title>
<p>During the Norwood procedure, the atrial septum is excised to prevent any obstruction to blood flows from the left atrium. Echocardiography can confirm the patency of this connection or calculate a gradient across any residual septum. Obstruction to flow across the atrial septum can result in pulmonary venous hypertension, pulmonary edema, and cyanosis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section25-1089253213480853">
<title>Tricuspid Valve</title>
<p>Tricuspid valve regurgitation is an important cause of low cardiac output postoperatively. After the Norwood procedure, the heart is volume loaded, which can result in right ventricular dilation. The tricuspid valve is particularly prone to dilation-mediated regurgitation because it has attachments to both the ventricular septum and right ventricular free wall. Dilation of the right ventricle, therefore, pulls the leaflets of the tricuspid valve apart causing regurgitation. Echocardiography can rapidly quantify and track tricuspid valve regurgitation at the bedside.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section26-1089253213480853">
<title>Neo-Aortic Valve and Aortic Arch</title>
<p>Neo-aortic valve regurgitation is another important cause of low cardiac output. Any degree of preoperative pulmonic insufficiency predisposes the patient to neo-aortic regurgitation. Excessive neo-aortic valve regurgitation can result in diastolic steal from the coronary arteries, impairing coronary perfusion, causing ischemia, and reducing ventricular function.</p>
<p>Residual aortic arch obstruction is also poorly tolerated in the postoperative period. Narrowing of the supravalvular aortic region as well as the aortopulmoanry anastomosis can also occur. Unfortunately, echocardiography cannot always visualize the entire aortic arch. If these diagnoses are suspected, cardiac MRI or cardiac catheterization may be necessary.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section27-1089253213480853">
<title>Systemic to Pulmonary Artery Shunt</title>
<p>An MBT shunt connects the innominate artery to the pulmonary arteries and serves as a protected source of pulmonary blood flow in the Norwood procedure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-1089253213480853">Figure 12</xref>). The degree of resistance in the shunt should allow just the right amount of blood flow to the pulmonary system.</p>

</fig>
<p>In the event of postoperative cyanosis, it is important to determine the patency of this shunt. Blood flow through an unobstructed shunt will have a typical saw-toothed pattern on spectral Doppler (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-1089253213480853">Figure 13</xref>). MBT shunts are prone to narrowing at both the proximal and distal ends. Because these shunts do not typically have a focal stenosis, the modified Bernoulli’s equation will underestimate the gradient across a MBT shunt. Therefore, measuring the actual diameter of the shunt with 2-dimensional imaging is critical in this setting.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1089253213480853-fig13.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>In contrast to shunt obstruction, a MBT shunt can also deliver excessive pulmonary blood flow at the expense of systemic blood flow. Spectral Doppler in the distal aortic arch can be used to approximate systemic to pulmonary flow ratio by measuring the velocity time integral of the spectral Doppler pattern of forward flow to backward flow.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1089253213480853">33</xref></sup> Excessive runoff into the pulmonary arteries can also comprise coronary perfusion and systolic function.</p>
<p>The Sano variation of the Norwood procedure replaces the MBT shunt with a right ventricle to pulmonary artery conduit. This eliminates the diastolic runoff from the aorta, typical in the MBT shunt. This variation may protect these patients from pulmonary overcirculation and decreased coronary blood flow associated with MBT shunts. The right ventricle to pulmonary artery conduit, however, is prone to kinking and dynamic obstruction at the right ventricular end.</p>

<title>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</title>
<p>As with the preoperative assessment, postoperative cardiac MRI is extremely useful in selected cases. Cardiac MRI may better define vascular anatomy inadequately visualized by echocardiography. These may include the following: MBT or Sano shunts, pulmonary arteries, ascending aorta, aortopulmonary anastomosis, and the aortic isthmus.</p>
<p>Very anterior structures are particularly difficult to image with echocardiography. Right ventricular free wall aneurysms are a common postoperative complication of the Sano shunt. They can be challenging to see with echocardiography but are well demonstrated by cardiac MRI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-1089253213480853">Figure 14</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Perioperative imaging the HLHS is important for surgical planning, risk stratification, medical management, and surveillance of postoperative complications. Echocardiography is usually readily available and accurately describes the relevant anatomy and physiology. When questions remain after a thorough echocardiographic examination, cardiac MRI can be an excellent adjunctive tool. Cardiac MRI is particularly suited to describing extracardiac anatomy, obtaining accurate ventricular volumes, and identifying myocardial ischemia and EFE.</p>
