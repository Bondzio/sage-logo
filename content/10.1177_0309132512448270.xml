<title>I Introduction</title>
<p>This article suggests that a multiscalar and interdisciplinary construct is required to analyse climate justice in an appraisal of the distribution of Climate Finance for Adaptation (CFfA). The climate justice debate within the adaptation literature has many associations within geography, through its evolution from the early political ecology literature and the disaster literature of the 1990s onwards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0309132512448270">Adger, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0309132512448270">Blaikie, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0309132512448270">Blaikie et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0309132512448270">Paavola and Adger, 2006</xref>). This research possesses the capacity to identify local level actors in the developing world who experience climate injustice, based on the exacerbation of pre-existing socio-economic inequalities through climate change. Nevertheless, for a more comprehensive understanding of climate justice, this article avails of geography’s ability to identify multiscalar processes within an interdisciplinary framework.</p>
<p>It is important to clarify the meaning of ‘inequalities’ within the context of climate justice analysis. The core inequalities are responsibility for, capability in responding to, and the experiencing of the adverse effects of climate change. Recent work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0309132512448270">Füssel (2010</xref>) finds a ‘double inequality’ through developing states having little responsibility in causing climate change and a low capability of resisting/recovering from its effects. Coupled with this is the exacerbation of vulnerability to their food security and human health. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0309132512448270">Miranda et al. (2011</xref>) conclude that developing states will be more adversely affected by temperature rises than developed states. Responsibility for anthropogenic climate change is unequal due to disparities in past and present resource use in developed states since the Industrial Revolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0309132512448270">Mearns and Norton, 2010</xref>). Further, while the developing world has begun to industrialize, the developed world has requested that their economic development and subsequent resource use be restrained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr116-0309132512448270">UNFCCC, 2010</xref>). Capability to resist and recover from climate change is unequal, which is itself embedded in the variation of socio-economic competencies between governments, communities and individuals of the world. Adverse effects are experienced unequally due to factors such as geographical location, the proportion of the population engaged in subsistence agriculture, and access to basic services. The claim is that the developing world is suffering disproportionately to the developed world for an eventuality which was itself caused by the developed world.</p>
<p>An empirical study of climate justice requires a means to identify whether just distribution and effectiveness of compensatory actions has been realized between the appropriate scales – global regions, nation states and, arguably most importantly, on the ground for the villages and households most exposed to climate change. There are two forms of justice applied to the analysis of CFfA: distributive and substantive. First, distributive justice requires clarification within this context. This is justice as developed from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0309132512448270">Rawls’ (1972)</xref> account of ‘justice as fairness’ and in particular the ‘difference principle’: if a decision-maker has no information regarding their position within a society, they would distribute resources to the most disadvantaged groups. Therefore, this article applies the procedure of top-down distribution of CFfA – from interstate transfers to intrastate distribution, to ground level implementation – as an observable and measurable proxy for climate justice. These include financial transfers for climate change adaptation, or to facilitate adaptive capacity, which are either made through dedicated climate change funds such as the Adaptation Fund, or arrive through channels of Official Development Assistance (ODA). Such distributive actions constitute a tangible means for the developed world to compensate those in the developing world for the inequalities stated above. Crucially, the disadvantaged groups within this context are those most vulnerable to climate change via social, political, economic and physical factors: the focus is the relationship between the distribution of CFfA and the climate vulnerability of actors on multiple scales. Second, a substantive justice element exists when discussing the ultimate effectiveness of CFfA. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0309132512448270">Heywood (2004</xref>: 176) states, ‘it is outcomes, and not merely procedures, that claim to be just’. Within the context of climate justice, CFfA must lessen the climate vulnerability for those actors most exposed to climate change on the ground in the developing world. From this approach, the following questions guide the analysis:</p>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>What are the primary sites and actors to analyse the flows of interstate and intrastate CFfA distribution and its ultimate effectiveness on the ground?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>What perspectives have the ability to analyse CFfA flows across scales where the process of climate justice can be actualized in terms of ‘distribution’ according to climate vulnerability and ultimate ‘effectiveness’ in terms of the lessening of climate vulnerability?</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>This analysis understands the production of climate justice as an accumulative multiscalar <italic>process</italic>. CFfA must be distributed to climate vulnerable states, who then must distribute to climate vulnerable domestic regions and finally this distribution must ease climate vulnerabilities for those actors on the ground with the greatest exposure to climate change. The analysis is attempting to establish a means through which to follow CFfA down – from its origin to the beneficiary – as a process that illuminates the production of climate justice through its course.</p>
<p>The findings are that CFfA flows across three scales of analysis. (1) At the global scale, there is an interstate distribution of CFfA. Particular perspectives within International Relations (IR) and the international development literature identify states as the primary actors and locate whether climate vulnerability is a principal determinant in their distribution of CFfA. (2) CFfA flows down to the national scale, where there is an intrastate distribution. Political geography/developing world Political Science have an aptitude to understand the state in the developing world as a fragmented entity. State weakness and the culture of ethno-regional clientelism often inhibit the intrastate distribution of CFfA being conducted according to climate vulnerability. (3) The ultimate destinations of CFfA are local level adaptation or adaptive capacity building projects in the developing world. Perspectives from the political ecology/adaptation literature elucidate households and communities in the developing world as the primary actors and facilitate an assessment of the ultimate effectiveness of CFfA projects in lessening climate vulnerability. The actualization of climate justice is contingent upon the inter- and intrastate distribution of CFfA being determined by climate vulnerability leading to the ultimate lessening of climate vulnerabilities for local level actors.</p>
<p>This article is divided into five sections: section II situates the study of climate justice as a multiscalar process within the scale literature; section III explores the hitherto climate justice debate and introduces CFfA as a proxy for climate justice; section IV investigates the flows of CFfA and presents various perspectives that facilitate the identification of the primary sites, actors and methods to determine a multiscalar analysis of climate justice as an accumulative process; and section V reflects on the necessity for a multiscalar analysis of climate justice.</p>

<title>II Climate justice analysis as a multiscalar process</title>
<p>Crucial to this analysis is the previous research into scale. Early work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-0309132512448270">Swyngedouw (1997</xref>) stresses process over form in the sense that ‘theoretical and political priority … never resides in a particular geographical scale, but rather in the process through which scales become (re)constituted’. Geographical scales are not perceived as demarcated areas, but as a continuum that should be formed and analysed according to the context of real-world practices. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0309132512448270">Betsill and Bulkeley (2006</xref>) perceive how climate change mitigation operates as a process through two interacting scales; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-0309132512448270">Towers (2000</xref>) explains how the articulations of grassroots environmental movements find a transcendent voice in the environmental justice movement and its ‘scale of humanity’ (p. 23); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0309132512448270">Cash and Moser (2000</xref>) stress the cross-scale dynamics of the climate change assessment and management process. Conversely, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0309132512448270">Cox (1998</xref>) approaches scale in network terms – movement from one scale to another is not a transition involving discrete areas, but rather a process whereby actors develop associations of engagement. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0309132512448270">Mansfield (2005</xref>) encapsulates the approach attempted in this article by suggesting that analysis needs to perceive the scalar dimensions of practices, instead of practices that are occurring at different scales. The framework given here builds on these understandings by following the flows of CFfA as a process that offers a depiction of climate justice as an accumulative development. This approach has close associations with the following research: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0309132512448270">Osbhar et al. (2008)</xref> investigate the cross-scale formal and informal institutional dynamics of livelihood adaptation to climate change in Mozambique; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0309132512448270">Betsill and Bulkeley (2006</xref>) analyse the multiscalar dimensions of climate change mitigation. The inclusion of non-state actors such as the Cities for Climate Protection (CCP) network, as well as state-based actions, are deemed central to any comprehensive analysis of mitigation efforts.</p>
<p>The network approach provides an alternative perspective to scale on complex issues of geography. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0309132512448270">Adams (1996</xref>) investigates the way telecommunications form linkages across space and establish networks of relations rather than organized within a hierarchy of scales. The flows of CFfA do indeed involve dyadic (states) and multinodal (such as the World Bank) networks and this would be a practical application of how CFfA flows – that is, assuming that the hierarchies intrinsic to this process are ignored. CFfA distribution involves inherent hierarchies between donor and recipient, between state and region, and between those that are marginalized and those with government affiliations. CFfA is based upon a hierarchical distributive multiscalar system, rather than spontaneous and egalitarian networks.</p>

<title>III The current climate justice debate and the possibilities of CFfA</title>
<p>The subject of climate justice motivates research from numerous fields of study including: political philosophy, IR, Geography (political ecology and environmental justice), Economics, and international/domestic legal studies. Single disciplinary approaches have a tendency to produce research constrained by a single non-interactive scale. Further, theoretical and conceptual debates about what <italic>could</italic> and <italic>should</italic> be done to achieve climate justice are typically privileged over empirical analysis. When empirical analysis is attempted, there is an inclination towards context-specific case study investigations.</p>
<sec id="section4-0309132512448270">
<title>1 Conceptual, theoretical and single case study focus</title>
<p>A body of climate justice research approaches the subject through the development and application of conceptual ideas grounded in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0309132512448270">Rawls’ (1972)</xref> distributive justice. Political philosophers extend abstract notions of distributive justice to include future generations potentially subject to climate changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr119-0309132512448270">Vanderheiden, 2008</xref>). Issues of responsibility attribution are expanded through notions of equal share and burdens. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0309132512448270">Page (2007</xref>) argues that ideas of justice as fair reciprocity generate duties of environmental conservation now, regardless of compensation owed to future generations. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0309132512448270">Grasso (2010</xref>) derives a definition of fair and equitable adaptation funding by exploring the ethical basis of distributive and procedural justice.</p>
<p>Adaptation scholars apply conceptual frameworks of social justice to current climate change adaptation policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0309132512448270">Adger et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0309132512448270">Paavola and Adger, 2006</xref>). From this analysis, the responsibility for climate change impacts, and the level of burden sharing for adaptation funding across vulnerable countries are only rhetorically acknowledged by the present climate change regime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0309132512448270">Paavola and Adger, 2006</xref>). The ecological economist Paul <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0309132512448270">Baer (2006</xref>) explores who <italic>should </italic>carry the costs of adaptation to climatic changes. Legal scholarship seeks to approach climate justice through investigating the <italic>potential</italic> application of the tort legal framework to climate change adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0309132512448270">Grossman, 2003</xref>), or the important role legal institutions and instruments <italic>will play</italic> in climate change adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0309132512448270">McDonald, 2011</xref>). Conceptual and theoretical approaches that attempt to locate the ‘optimally just’ method and hypothetical practicalities of distribution are ubiquitous within the literature. While this has utility for designing policy, ideas of justice are superseding empirical analysis of past and present distributive actions, which constrains the potential scope of knowledge about climate justice.</p>
<p>When empirical analysis is attempted, case studies of local level vulnerability to climate change dominate the literature. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0309132512448270">Kelman (2010</xref>) recognizes the marginalized sites of climate change to discern whether the local voices of small island states are integrated into climate change policy. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0309132512448270">Dulal et al. (2010</xref>) focuses on the adaptive capacity of people living in the Koshi Tappu region in Nepal. An analysis of people’s capital assets (human, social, natural, physical and financial assets) examines their ability to cope with ever-increasing flooding in the area. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0309132512448270">Paavola (2006</xref>) investigates the predicted climate change impacts and probable future vulnerabilities of mainland Tanzania and the intrinsic justice issues involved in national adaptation planning. These approaches provide vital context-specific knowledge of climate justice issues. In isolation, this form of analysis has shortcomings when knowledge of global climate justice relationships is required. Single case study empirical analysis therefore produces partial answers for climate justice. The only exception to be found in the literature is the quantitative research undertaken by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0309132512448270">Roberts and Parks (2007</xref>) who take ratification of environmental and climate change treaties as a proxy measure of climate justice.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0309132512448270">
<title>2 Scale</title>
<p>Single scale analysis runs contrary to the subject of climate justice with numerous actors across scales. Climate change is expected to threaten nation states, societies and communities across the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0309132512448270">Mearns and Norton, 2010</xref>). IR scholars recognize climate justice in terms of interstate negotiations. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0309132512448270">Paterson (2001</xref>) outlines <italic>retributive </italic>justice between states; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0309132512448270">Albin (2001</xref>) shows the application of the ‘no harm’ principle in international fora; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0309132512448270">Fermann (1997</xref>) explains the <italic>polluter-pays-principle</italic>, whereby polluting states bear the costs of abatement efforts. However, the state as an entity is itself not the primary actor vulnerable to climate change. Likewise, the adaptation literature has a tendency to privilege local level analyses, often centred on ground level actors in the developing world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0309132512448270">Adger et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0309132512448270">Dulal et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0309132512448270">Kelman, 2010</xref>). International law literature inclines towards an intrastate view of climate change adaptation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0309132512448270">Glicksman (2011</xref>) explores the optimal climate change adaptation decision-making arrangements within the federal system of governance of the United States. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0309132512448270">Grossman (2003</xref>) argues for the utility of tort litigation for potential cases of climate change damage within the United States. In essence, the framework of analysis needs to complement the subject matter of concern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0309132512448270">Cummings et al., 2006</xref>). Multiple interacting scales are required to begin to locate the numerous relationships for a more comprehensive analysis of climate justice.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0309132512448270">
<title>3 The potential solution of CFfA</title>
<p>What exactly is CFfA? These originate as financial transfers either made through dedicated climate change funds, such as the AF, or arrive through ODA. Eventually funds work through various distribution channels to become local level climate change adaptation or resilience projects. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0309132512448270">Ayers and Huq (2009</xref>) provide a definition of adaptation that signifies the process these projects are aiming to facilitate: ‘adaptation to climate change describes the adjustment in natural or human systems in response to actual or expected climatic stimuli or their effects, which moderates harm or exploits beneficial opportunities’. These include livelihood diversification strategies, water conservation projects, disaster management projects (i.e. disasters refer to those associated with the direct and indirect effects of climate change) and post-disaster relief aid, to name but a few. In short, all such projects aim to lessen the vulnerabilities for those exposed to climate change.</p>
<p>There now exists a burgeoning literature and data on CFfA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0309132512448270">Ackerson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0309132512448270">Barnett, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0309132512448270">Dessai, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0309132512448270">Greene, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0309132512448270">Hicks et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-0309132512448270">Roberts and Peratsakis, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr121-0309132512448270">Weaver and Peratsakis, 2011</xref>). CFfA offers one means of developing a tangible and measurable proxy for the analysis of climate justice. The reasons are as follows. First, during negotiations of the United Nations Framework Convention for Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 1992, developing countries stressed the implementation of obligations by them, including adaptation measures, would depend on new financial commitments by developed states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr120-0309132512448270">Verheyen, 2002</xref>). Indeed, since the pledges made during the Copenhagen Accord (2009) and the Cancun Adaptation Framework (2010), CFfA is now recognized as the primary means through which the developed countries can compensate the least developed and most climate vulnerable countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr115-0309132512448270">UNFCCC, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr116-0309132512448270">2010</xref>). Within the climate justice literature, there are several scholars that have been explicit about the role of CFfA as a means of compensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0309132512448270">Baer, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0309132512448270">Mace, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0309132512448270">Paavola and Adger, 2006</xref>). Second, unlike mitigation funding where benefits are systemic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-0309132512448270">Turner et al., 1990</xref>), CFfA is a private good in that only those who receive the finance will benefit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0309132512448270">Barr et al., 2010</xref>). Third, since publication of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0309132512448270">Blaikie et al.’s (1994)</xref> seminal work on disasters, the concepts of vulnerability and adaptation have become the dominant paradigm on local level climate change action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0309132512448270">Adger, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0309132512448270">Agarwal and Perrin, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0309132512448270">Ayers, 2009</xref>). This approach is one clear example where theory has been transferred into practice. Within government agencies and NGOs working across the developing world, the vocabulary of adaptation and adaptive capacity has been internalized and is now brought into consideration when designing and implementing climate change related policy.</p>
<p>The final reason is one of empirical utility. CFfA data is becoming available through sources such as the AidData Project, the Climate Change and African Political Stability Project (CCAPS) and Climate Funds Update website. In particular, the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-0309132512448270">Roberts and Peratsakis (2011</xref>) provides the first attempt to isolate international transfers of CFfA from the broader development aid data. Further, research is beginning into the multiscalar dynamics of this data. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr121-0309132512448270">Weaver and Peratsakis (2011</xref>) have worked with the Ministry of Finance of Malawi to locate and geocode where climate finance is being allocated within the country. In addition to this research, new data on national level and disaggregated climate vulnerability mapping are becoming available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0309132512448270">Busby et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr122-0309132512448270">Wheeler, 2011</xref>). Crucially, this body of research enables the multiscalar analysis of climate justice through the geospatial and statistical relationship between CFfA distribution and climate vulnerability.</p>

<title>IV A multiscalar analysis of climate justice</title>
<p>Inequality is a ubiquitous concept within the climate justice discussion. To summarize: some human activities have induced changes in global weather patterns; divergent effects have been/will be felt through different communities, which is itself a function of regionally based physical exposure, the extent of reliance on land-based productive methods, the capacity of national and domestic political institutions, and the available assets and endowments of individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0309132512448270">Adger, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-0309132512448270">Sen, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-0309132512448270">Smit et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr123-0309132512448270">Wisner et al., 2004</xref>). The distribution of CFfA is a means for the developed world to facilitate adaptation and adaptive capacity in the developing world for the inequalities associated with responsibility for, capabilities in responding to, and the variation of experiences regarding the adverse physical effects of climate change. This section focuses on: (1) the identification of the primary sites and actors to analyse the flows of interstate and intrastate CFfA distribution and its ultimate effectiveness on the ground; (2) the location of the most suitable perspective to analyse CFfA flows across scales, whereby the actualization of climate justice is in terms of ‘distribution’ according to climate vulnerability and ultimate ‘effectiveness’ in lessening climate vulnerability.</p>
<p>This analysis understands climate justice as an accumulative multiscalar <italic>process</italic>. The following provides the basis of a framework to determine whether the flows of CFfA are distributed to climate vulnerable states, are then distributed to climate vulnerable domestic regions, and finally whether this distribution eases climate vulnerabilities for those actors on the ground with the greatest exposure to climate change.</p>

<title>1 Global scale – International Relations/international development</title>
<p>The constitutional sites of analysis are interstate transfers of CFfA. This is the commencement of CFfA flows. The objective of present funding instruments is the operationalization of developed world material capabilities in order to mitigate the risk experienced by developing states exposed to climate change. Aside from the Kyoto Protocol’s AF and the International Climate Initiative, all funds to date are replenished through ODA voluntary contributions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0309132512448270">Le Goulven, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0309132512448270">Muller, 2008</xref>). States either transfer funds bilaterally or multilaterally via aggregated state-funded international adaptation financing NGOs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0309132512448270">Osbahr et al., 2008</xref>). The principal mechanism has historically been the UNFCCC’s Global Environmental Facility (GEF). By the Conference of the Parties 9 in 2003, the GEF dominated international adaptation funding by managing the three UNFCCC funds – the Special Priority Fund, the Least Developed Countries Fund and the Special Climate Change Fund. However, more recently established funds, including the UNFCCC AF, are independent of the GEF. The European Commission’s Climate Change Alliance (2007), the International Climate Initiative (2007) and the Pilot Programme for Climate Resilience (2008) are instead governed by state-based boards or committees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0309132512448270">Le Goulven, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>As either direct or indirect donors, states are central to the emergence of CFfA flows. Differential state risk and variation in state capabilities determine how states are positioned as donors or recipients of CFfA – how much influence they have in bodies such as the governing GEF Council or the directing committee of the Pilot Programme for Climate Resilience. Analysis of intergovernmental organizations has typically been the purview of IR. Climate change governance has long been conceived of within IR in terms of states as the primary and differentially powerful actors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0309132512448270">Dimitrov, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0309132512448270">Keohane and Levy, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0309132512448270">Meyer et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-0309132512448270">Thomson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr113-0309132512448270">Trittin, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr126-0309132512448270">Young, 1999</xref>). The only body of literature that gives an independent determining effect to international organizations is the supranational governance literature, which was specifically designed for the European Union, and in particular the European Commission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-0309132512448270">Stone Sweet and Sandholtz, 1997</xref>). The subject of CFfA further reinforces the primacy of states and hierarchies of power, which is aptly demonstrated through two facets of adaptation funding. First, adaptation funding is a private good, in the sense that actions only benefit recipients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0309132512448270">Hasson et al., 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0309132512448270">Muller (2008</xref>) explains how CFfA is perceived as a ‘cost on developed states’ to make amends for climate risk experienced by developing states. Second, according to the World Bank and United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), projected costs of adaptation in developing states are estimated to reach US$75–100 billion per year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0309132512448270">Barr et al., 2010</xref>). No other institutions, or non-state funding mechanisms, currently exist that retain this degree of material capability to commence a program of risk mitigation on such a magnitude.</p>
<p>The utility of the state-based approach has been contested by some climate change governance scholarship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0309132512448270">Auer, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0309132512448270">Betsill and Bulkeley, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0309132512448270">Rabe, 2007</xref>). However, these arguments are developed within the specific context of mitigation. Non-state actors, such as the CCP network, are deemed central to any comprehensive analysis of mitigation efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0309132512448270">Betsill and Bulkeley, 2006</xref>). This same argument cannot be transferred into the CFfA framework. The object of analysis at the global scale is the establishment of CFfA flows from one state, or group of states within a multilateral agreement, to a recipient state within the developing world. This acknowledges states as the <italic>dominant </italic>actors within multilateral multilateral funding mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0309132512448270">Klepak, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0309132512448270">Nielson and Tierney, 2003</xref>). For instance, one of the largest multilateral donors of CFfA is the World Bank’s International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0309132512448270">Hicks et al., 2010</xref>). The IBRD is classified as a non-state body. Nevertheless, this overlooks the fact that World Bank policy is determined by unequal voting rights in favour of developed states – United States (15.85%), Japan (6.84%), Germany (4.00%), United Kingdom (3.75%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr125-0309132512448270">World Bank, 2010b</xref>). Indeed, empirical research has shown the consistent influence of United States preferences as a key determinant in the allocation of development assistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0309132512448270">Fleck and Kilby, 2006</xref>). Conversely, the UNFCCC’s AF is argued to overcome the state donor ‘domestic revenue problem’ (funds raised from state taxes on domestic citizens are perceived as domestic revenue, which thus inhibits distribution of CFfA) by raising funds through a 2% levy on the Clean Development Mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0309132512448270">Ayers, 2009</xref>). This fails to recognize that the AF governing board is composed of 10 developed, four developing and two transition states. If consensus cannot be reached, decisions are taken with a two-thirds majority of participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0309132512448270">Le Goulven, 2008</xref>). States are the primary actors, while developed states are the pre-eminent actors at the initiation and direction of CFfA flows.</p>
<p>The core issue is retaining the requisite conceptual tools to explain the distribution of CFfA. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0309132512448270">Ackerson et al. (2011</xref>) provide a first attempt with a descriptive analysis of the distribution of CFfA within Africa. Under particular categorizations of what constitutes CFfA, they find Ethiopia the largest recipient of CFfA and the United Nations Development Programme and Canada the largest donors. At the time of writing, no research exists into the determinants of interstate distribution of CFfA.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, an established international development literature does exist that explores the determinants of standard ODA distribution. One debate within this literature is the construction of models that compare explanations of ‘recipient need’ with ‘donor interest’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0309132512448270">Alesina and Dollar, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0309132512448270">Berthelemy, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0309132512448270">Chandrasekhar, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0309132512448270">Feeny and McGillivray, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0309132512448270">Hayter, 1971</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0309132512448270">1981</xref>). The general conclusion to be drawn is that measures of donor interest have a tendency to supersede those of recipient need. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0309132512448270">Alesina and Dollar (2000</xref>) explore the reasons states distribute aid in order to understand whether the objective of state distribution is economic need and effectiveness in reducing poverty. They find that political and strategic concerns determine interstate distribution – ‘an inefficient, economically closed, mismanaged non-democratic former colony, politically friendly to its former colonizer, receives more foreign aid than a country with a similar level of poverty, superior policy stance, but without a past as a colony’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0309132512448270">Alesina and Dollar, 2000</xref>: 33). In short, political factors are often dominant. These models are transferable into the analysis of climate justice through interstate CFfA distribution: the relationship between the interstate distribution of CFfA and climate vulnerability. When applying the dependent variable of CFfA distribution, ‘recipient need’ becomes the recipient’s ‘vulnerability to climate change’, while ‘donor interest’ remains the primary alternative explanation for distribution. This perspective and application facilitates the determinant of the initial stage of the multiscalar climate justice process.</p>
<p>Why not, for instance, apply legal approaches to the interstate distribution of CFfA instead? (1) Climate change law has yet to establish a means of approaching the distribution of CFfA; (2) legal research remains of a hypothetical and exploratory nature; and (3) there is a tendency to focus on climate change adaptation for those affected within developed states. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr120-0309132512448270">Verheyen (2002</xref>) notes the vague language regarding climate change adaptation legal obligations of developed states contained within the UNFCCC Convention and the Kyoto Protocol. Indeed, Articles 4(3) and 4(4) of the UNFCCC call for the developed world to provide ‘new and additional’ funding but, due to significant categorization issues, what constitutes even the baseline for ‘new and additional’ funding is an ambiguous and contentious debate almost two decades on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-0309132512448270">Stadelmann and Roberts, 2010</xref>). Conversely, there remains a hypothetical and exploratory nature of climate change adaptation litigation literature. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0309132512448270">Abate (2010</xref>) suggests that a foundation for international climate justice <italic>may</italic> be possible through public nuisance litigation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0309132512448270">Grossman (2003</xref>) evaluates the <italic>possibility</italic> of applying the tort litigation framework to climate change adaptation via damage to property. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0309132512448270">Barcelos et al. (2010</xref>: 193) insists the application of international and domestic law <italic>will be</italic> central in addressing the ‘massive human and humanitarian crises ignored by technical market solutions to climate change, moderate political reforms, and stalled treaty efforts’. This is the aspiration, not the observable measure attempted through the analysis of CFfA. In regard to the final point, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0309132512448270">Glicksman (2011</xref>) is indicative of the legal literature in focusing on issues of climate change adaptation within the developed world and in particular the United States. The problems applying litigation to climate change adaptation continue: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0309132512448270">McDonald (2011</xref>) outlines the main barriers as: (1) high levels of uncertainty; (2) the context-specific nature of impacts; (3) the timelag between emissions and impacts; and (4) the interaction between the physical impacts of climate change and the other social and economic stressors.</p>
<p>In summation, the global scale is the site of the initiation of CFfA flows. The perspectives within IR and the related international development literature offer a suitable framework to identify international CFfA transfers by states acting alone, or as primary actors within multilateral organizations, and then locate determinants for that distribution. These perspectives facilitate the initiation of climate justice analysis as an accumulative multiscalar <italic>process</italic>. If the interstate transfers of CFfA are being distributed to states with a high vulnerability to climate change, this begins the process towards climate justice actualization. In isolation this is not climate justice, but rather an initial and necessary substantiation that climate justice as an accumulative multiscalar <italic>process</italic> has begun. The next stage of this process is the destinations of CFfA flows at the national scale – developing world states.</p>

<title>2 National scale – political geography/developing world Political Science</title>
<p>The destinations of interstate transfers of CFfA are the government ministries or government-appointed agencies in the developing world. Each transfer of CFfA must pass through the conduit that is the ‘state’ in the developing world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0309132512448270">McGray et al., 2007</xref>), or at least such transfers require assistance, or at minimum, government consent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr125-0309132512448270">World Bank, 2010b</xref>). For instance, there is now some research into the climate finance landscape within Ethiopia. They find the Ministry of Agriculture, Water and Energy the primary institution for absorbing funds, while the government-appointed Environmental Protection Agency works with and manages donors on climate change issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr117-0309132512448270">Usher, 2010</xref>). Both institutions also coordinate directly with the Office of the Prime Minister. Even if funds bypass the state and arrive directly at the country office of the NGO (for instance, USAID), there still exists some relationship between the given NGO and the various levels of government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0309132512448270">Kharas, 2007</xref>). A recent report from the IBRD stresses that an association with, and assistance from, a willing and able government institution is imperative to the effectiveness of CFfA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr124-0309132512448270">World Bank, 2010a</xref>). Often governments establish adaptation programs of, for instance, micro-finance and livelihood diversification which is directly funded by NGO’s or developed states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0309132512448270">Osbahr et al., 2008</xref>). This makes the recipient state the primary site of analysis as the flows of CFfA arrive at the national scale.</p>
<p>The ‘state’ is central to the analysis of CFfA, but remains a contested concept in developing world research. Political geography/developing world Political Science scholars incorporate the dynamics common <italic>within </italic>developing world states that determine domestic distribution of CFfA. Fundamentally, these actors are not monolithic entities. Many do not retain consistent authority across their territory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0309132512448270">Boone, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0309132512448270">Herbst, 2000</xref>), which has implications for the distribution of CFfA. There are ‘degrees of statehood’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0309132512448270">Clapham, 1998</xref>), whereby sovereignty has an <italic>internal</italic> and an <italic>external</italic> dimension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0309132512448270">Biersteker, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0309132512448270">Clapham, 1996</xref>). Internally, sovereign regimes are considered legitimate and the sole rulers of their territory. This is largely absent in places such as Sudan, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Somalia where several competing domestic regional powers exist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0309132512448270">Clapham, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0309132512448270">1998</xref>). Such states are often dependent on foreign aid to sustain their existence and foreign powers to protect their territory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0309132512448270">Easterly, 2010</xref>). These states retain ‘external sovereignty’ – other states recognize them by acknowledging the governments that provide the façade of authority, regardless of their capacity to control their own territory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0309132512448270">Biersteker, 2002</xref>). The implications for CFfA are obvious: developing world states often have intrinsic structural deficiencies as conduits for the domestic distributional flows of CFfA.</p>
<p>The concepts relevant to national level distribution of CFfA are ‘ethno-regional clientelism’ and ‘political authority’. Ethno-regional clientelism involves the asymmetrical distribution of government allocated goods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0309132512448270">Lemarcha, 1972</xref>). Many developing states engage in neopatrimonial politics whereby the distribution of these goods is determined by each group’s ethno-regional affiliation to the government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0309132512448270">Arriola, 2009</xref>). As explained by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0309132512448270">Ayers (2009</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0309132512448270">Eriksen and Lind (2009</xref>), there is often a failure to base distributive efforts on climate change vulnerability. Further, the degree of political authority underwrites all CFfA distribution efforts. Even for powerful regional/ethnic groups, fluidity in political authority inhibits the consistent delivery of aid from the core to peripheral areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0309132512448270">Londregan and Poole, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-0309132512448270">Rotberg, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The core issue is explaining the intrastate distribution of CFfA. A subnational aid distribution literature exists that once again identifies a ‘recipient need’ versus ‘donor interest’ model. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0309132512448270">Jayne et al. (2002</xref>) find an asymmetrical distribution of food aid within rural Ethiopia towards the government-affiliated region of Tigray, while poverty is not a significant factor. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr127-0309132512448270">Zhang (2004</xref>) discovers that the distribution of World Bank development aid within China is also primarily determined by government affiliations rather than need. Conversely, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0309132512448270">Morris and Wodon (2003</xref>) find the distribution of disaster relief aid in Honduras after Hurricane Mitch associated with the degree of damage a household suffered.</p>
<p>A literature has recently emerged scrutinizing distributional issues directly in relation to CFfA. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0309132512448270">Eriksen and Lind (2009</xref>) point to CFfA distributional imbalances within Kenya as an inhibiting factor in their adaptation to climate change. Solutions identified include the distribution of resources to marginal drylands in Kenya. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0309132512448270">Ayers (2009</xref>) stress that achieving adaptation for the poorest and most vulnerable requires working with these communities and their respective groups. Within the context of urban areas, she observes that the most vulnerable to climate change often live and work in illegal settlements that governments often refuse to engage with or even recognize. Again, politics appears the primary determinant of CFfA distribution.</p>
<p>Crucially, researchers have begun to geocode subnational climate change adaptation projects within Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr121-0309132512448270">Weaver and Peratsakis, 2011</xref>). These data, when combined with disaggregated data on climate vulnerability (for instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0309132512448270">Busby et al., 2011</xref>, measure vulnerability across Africa using an indicators approach; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0309132512448270">Deressa et al., 2008</xref>, conduct a similar study specifically within the context of Ethiopia), offer a means to establish a measure of subnational climate justice based on the outcome of the derived ‘recipient need’ versus ‘donor interest’ model.</p>
<p>In summation, CFfA flows to developing world government ministries or government-appointed agencies. The perspectives of political geography/developing world Political Science offer an appropriate framework to identify the recipient state in the developing world as a fragmented entity, which find the distribution of CFfA according to climate vulnerability contrary to political culture. The identification of a culture of neopatrimonial politics is one of the primary factors. These perspectives therefore facilitate continuity for climate justice analysis as an accumulative multiscalar <italic>process</italic>. If intrastate transfers of CFfA are being used to establish adaptation or adaptive capacity building projects in domestic regions highly vulnerable to climate change, this continues the process towards climate justice actualization. In isolation, or in combination with the previous interstate distributional relationships, this is not climate justice. Rather this represents an additional and necessary substantiation that climate justice as an accumulative multiscalar <italic>process</italic> remains in motion. The final stage of this process is the ultimate destinations of CFfA flows – on the ground in the developing world.</p>

<title>3 Local scale – political ecology</title>
<p>CFfA has a final destination in ground level projects which facilitate climate change adaptation or build adaptive capacity in the developing world. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0309132512448270">Ayers and Forsyth (2009</xref>: 26) state that ‘community-based adaptation … addresses the locally and contextually specific nature of climate change vulnerability, because it takes place at local levels where people encounter impacts, build adaptive capacity and respond’. These include climate finance projects that have a clear association with either the direct or indirect effects of climate change – projects directed at flooding, drought, land management, water management, livelihood diversification, and crop resilience, to name a few. For instance, US$150 million was given to India in 2009 by the World Bank International Development Association (IDA) towards the Rajasthan Livelihood/Watershed project to improve livelihood opportunities for the poor in the drought-prone southern and eastern regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0309132512448270">AidData, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The adaptation literature, evolved from the intellectual grounding of political ecology, is the basis of the local level vulnerability approach. This is the dominant perspective and vocabulary for all practitioners and academics engaged in the ground level climate change response. The primary actors are climate vulnerable individuals, households, villages and communities in the developing world. ‘Places, ecosystems and people are all vulnerable to the threats imposed by climate change’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0309132512448270">Adger et al., 2006</xref>: 5). These actors are understood as the focal point of climate justice analysis, as those immediately exposed to the direct and indirect effects of climate change. Some of these actors are natural-resource dependent rural households (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0309132512448270">Agarwal and Perrin, 2009</xref>). Others operate within normally extreme climates such as the Igloolik community located in the Northern Foxe Basin in the Canadian territory of Nunvut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0309132512448270">Ford, 2009</xref>). Some communities grow crops on floodplain areas of the Gaibandha district in northern Bangladesh (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0309132512448270">Ayers and Forsyth, 2009</xref>). The ability to identify these actors engaging in adjustments with their changing environments is central to analysis of CFfA destinations at the local level.</p>
<p>The basis of the adaptation literature is a vulnerability framework that has the capacity to determine CFfA effectiveness. This framework operates through a synthesis of physical, political, economic and social vulnerabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0309132512448270">Blaikie, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0309132512448270">Blaikie et al., 1994</xref>). The framework is novel in its capacity to provide clear, practical and policy-relevant advice to disadvantaged people in the developing world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0309132512448270">Forsyth, 2008</xref>). According to the perspective, CFfA must facilitate each actor’s capacity to adapt to climate change, which itself may be a function of numerous and compounded vulnerabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0309132512448270">Adger, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0309132512448270">Brooks et al., 2005</xref>). The framework determines the role of CFfA in lessening the relative risk experienced by local level actors to adverse climatic changes – their ability to anticipate, cope with, resist and recover from disaster. Several interdependent vulnerabilities may be present at once. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-0309132512448270">Sen (1983</xref>) stresses economic vulnerabilities through an actor’s endowments (means of producing or owning resources) or entitlements (access to income). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0309132512448270">Raleigh (2010</xref>) discusses political vulnerabilities, such as how variation in access to state infrastructure (roads, hospitals, schools, etc.) shapes the ability of local communities to adapt to external change. How local level actors react is a function of the severity of the change, and their particular vulnerabilities, available assets and strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0309132512448270">Raleigh and Jordan, 2010</xref>). These vulnerabilities combine with the physical hazards associated with climate change to determine the risk exposure of actors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0309132512448270">Blaikie et al., 1994</xref>). The effectiveness of CFfA is determined through its ability to provide release from these pressures by facilitating climate change resilience/response.</p>
<p>A literature is developing that measures local level vulnerabilities and will enable the determination of CFfA effectiveness. The most common method is the indicator approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0309132512448270">Adger, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0309132512448270">Deressa et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0309132512448270">Hahn et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-0309132512448270">Sullivan and Meigh, 2005</xref>). This involves taking different socio-economic and biophysical characteristics as indicators of climate vulnerability and applying these to determine the comparative degree of exposure. A second approach is the multiple stressor vulnerability assessment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0309132512448270">Casale et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0309132512448270">O’Brien et al., 2004</xref>). This approach aims to identify how stressors, with climate change being just one, shape long-term vulnerability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0309132512448270">Patt, 2009</xref>). This is what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0309132512448270">Füssel and Klein (2006</xref>) depict as the ‘vulnerable system’ approach, whereby multiple stressors threaten a system, instead of a focus on the multiple effects of a single stress factor. Finally, the participatory approach facilitates the inclusion of households and local communities in determining what they perceive as their climate vulnerabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0309132512448270">Care International, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0309132512448270">Fazey et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0309132512448270">Nakalevu, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0309132512448270">Pelling, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr118-0309132512448270">Van Aalst, 2008</xref>). This context-specific approach aims to create information synergies between NGO implementing agencies and local communities to produce practical knowledge about where climate vulnerabilities are <italic>perceived</italic> to exist. Overall, this climate justice approach has a means of analysis: the extent to which those exposed have their vulnerabilities to climate change lessened by CFfA projects determines the degree of climate justice.</p>
<p>Why not apply environmental justice or human rights approaches to elucidate CFfA at the local scale instead? Environmental justice scholars are concerned with the unequal distribution of environmental pollution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0309132512448270">Anderton et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0309132512448270">Daniels and Friedman, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0309132512448270">Downey et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0309132512448270">Helfand and Peyton, 1999</xref>). The environmental justice framework is formulated specifically for disadvantaged communities in the <italic>developed world</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0309132512448270">Helfand and Peyton (1999</xref>) model the situating of environmental hazards in close proximity to poor or minority communities exclusively within the developed world. There is an assumption within this framework of a functioning civil society, which is often not present in the developing world. Some environmental justice scholars have quantitatively located the primary variables that cause environmental injustice – race, income, to name but a few (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0309132512448270">Anderton et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0309132512448270">Daniels and Friedman, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0309132512448270">Downey et al., 2008</xref>). However, an analysis of domestic spatially determined pollution inequality is futile for the objectives of CFfA research. The aim here is to discern the specific role of CFfA in mitigating vulnerabilities within the developing world and not proximity to pollutants within another context. Conversely, human rights approaches are primarily concerned with influencing <italic>future</italic> policy, not evaluating <italic>existing </italic>CFfA distributive efforts. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-0309132512448270">Robinson and Miller (2010</xref>) advocate the need to incorporate the human rights framework when designing strategies and institutions for climate change mitigation and adaptation. None of these approaches retain the same degree of conceptual applicability to elucidate CFfA as exhibited by the adaptation literature.</p>
<p>In summation, the ultimate destinations for CFfA are local level adaptation or adaptive capacity building projects in the developing world. The crucial point is the elucidation of sites and actors to determine the degree of climate justice in terms of the ultimate effectiveness of CFfA projects in lessening climate vulnerability. The adaptation literature has the capacity to perceive these entities and eventualities through the vulnerability framework and its assessment literature. This perspective supports the conclusion of climate justice analysis as an accumulative multiscalar <italic>process</italic>. If implementation of CFfA results in the lessening of climate vulnerabilities for local level actors, this concludes the process towards climate justice actualization. However, in isolation, this finding does not necessarily indicate that multiscalar climate justice has been done. CFfA may have been effective in lessening the climate vulnerabilities of households and communities within regions and states <italic>not vulnerable to climate change</italic>. For the process to be complete and for climate justice to be done, interstate CFfA distribution must be determined according to climate vulnerability, then intrastate CFfA distribution must be directed towards climate vulnerable domestic regions, which then must lessen the climate vulnerabilities for households and communities on the ground.</p>

<title>V The necessity of a multiscalar analysis of climate justice</title>
<p>The central objective of this article is to provide a means to follow CFfA in order to determine climate justice as a multiscalar process. Hitherto climate justice analyses have typically been normative, single scale or based on case study analysis. A multiscalar analysis with quantitative capabilities works in accordance with several characteristics intrinsic to the subject matter of climate justice.</p>
<p>First, the framework approach begins to recognize the breadth of the actors involved and the socio-economic and sociospatial related impacts of climate change. There is consistent recognition within the climate change literature of the merits within such an approach. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0309132512448270">Cash and Moser (2000</xref>) discuss the problems with assessing and managing climate change on the international scale, when the effect is felt at local scales. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0309132512448270">Ostrom (2010</xref>) acknowledges that while the effects of climate change are global, the causes operate on lower scales. Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-0309132512448270">Thomas and Twyman (2005</xref>) identify the dominance of international scale analysis on issues of climate change equity and justice and call for greater inclusion of subnational investigations.</p>
<p>Second, there is a need to address the complex nature of climate justice issues with new methods of analysis that move beyond the constraints of particular disciplines. Single discipline research has a tendency to privilege particular actors operating on a single scale. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0309132512448270">Roberts and Parks (2007</xref>: xi) state in the opening of their work <italic>A Climate of Injustice</italic>: ‘this book … has shifted from a sociological analysis of the complex problem of climate change, to one that incorporates insights from international relations, development economics, geography and other fields’. This is recognition that when the aspiration is an analysis of climate justice with a degree of analytical depth, there is a requirement for an inductive approach. The analysis requires the elucidation of multiple actors operating in different sites and on different scales.</p>
<p>Third, the multiscalar analysis of CFfA facilitates a new approach of incorporating quantitative methods into the study of climate justice. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0309132512448270">Roberts and Parks’ (2007)</xref> research represents the first attempt to quantify climate justice efforts through the prism of state ratification of environmental and climate change treaties. The approach in this article builds on this. It proposes the use of CFfA to quantitatively research general relationships between relevant actors operating on multiple scales as an accompaniment to the context-specific knowledge of the adaptation literature.</p>
<p>Fourth, the most important reflection to be made concerns the approach to climate justice as a multiscalar <italic>accumulative process</italic>. The driver of the perspective is a simple question: who exactly suffers the adverse effects of a changing climate? The answer according to economic modellers is that Africa will experience a loss of welfare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0309132512448270">Mendelsohn et al., 2000</xref>) and that existing subnational asymmetries of income will primarily determine the extent of climate change impact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0309132512448270">Anthoff et al., 2009</xref>). According to the disaster literature, it is the poor and marginalized households and communities in the developing world with their compounded vulnerabilities to climate change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr123-0309132512448270">Wisner et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>A comprehensive analysis of climate justice requires the means to locate CFfA relationships from interstate donations, all the way down to the ground level actors that will experience climate change. States, as in the bureaucratic structures that receive CFfA, are themselves not vulnerable to climate change. Domestic regions, as in the geographic locations where CFfA is distributed, are themselves also not vulnerable to climate change. However, if the distribution of CFfA is not made to climate vulnerable states, the possibility of a realization of climate justice terminates there. Likewise, if the intrastate distribution of CFfA is not made to climate vulnerable regions, the possibility of a realization of climate justice ends there. This framework recognizes the poor, marginalized and climate vulnerable households and communities in the developing world as the primary and defining actors within climate justice analysis. The core determination is whether CFfA has a meaningful impact on climate vulnerabilities of these actors. The inter- and intrastate distributions alone hold little meaning if CFfA is not effective in lessening the climate vulnerabilities of these ground level actors in the developing world. However, the realization of climate justice is contingent upon prior distribution, as CFfA must be present within climate vulnerable localities before a determination can be made according to its capacity to lessen climate vulnerabilities. In short, the necessity of a multiscalar analysis of climate justice is based on its capacity to recognize the process that results in the lessening of climate vulnerabilities for the primary actors in the subject of climate justice.</p>

<title>VI Conclusion</title>
<p>To conclude, this article suggests a multiscalar and interdisciplinary construct is required to analyse climate justice as an appraisal of the distribution of CFfA. Several inequalities intrinsic to the problem of climate change are identified. The case is made for CFfA as an observable, tangible and measurable proxy for climate justice, through its application as a form of compensation to actors experiencing climate vulnerability. By following CFfA through multiple scales, and using different disciplinary perspectives to elucidate the primary sites, actors and practices, it is possible to construct an analysis of climate justice as an accumulative process. The article identifies CFfA as flowing through three scales of analysis: at the global scale, there is an interstate distribution of CFfA. Particular perspectives within IR and the international development literature have an ability to identify states as the primary actors and whether climate vulnerability is a primary determinant in their distribution of CFfA; at the national scale, there is an intrastate distribution of CFfA. Political geography/developing world Political Science have an aptitude to understand the state in the developing world as a fragmented entity and the potential difficulty it has in distributing CFfA to regions that are climate vulnerable. In particular, there is an identification of ethno-regional clientelism as a primary cause for the asymmetrical distribution of CFfA; at the local scale, the ultimate destinations of CFfA are local level adaptation or adaptive capacity building projects in the developing world. Perspectives from the political ecology/adaptation literature elucidate households and communities as the primary actors and facilitate an assessment of the ultimate effectiveness of CFfA projects in lessening climate vulnerability. The actualization of climate justice rests on the outcome of CFfA lessening climate vulnerabilities for local level actors. Nevertheless, in isolation, this finding does not necessarily indicate that climate justice has been done. CFfA may have been effective in lessening the climate vulnerabilities of households and communities within states and regions <italic>not vulnerable to climate change</italic>. For the multiscalar process of climate justice to be done, interstate CFfA distribution must be determined according to climate vulnerability – then intrastate CFfA distribution must be directed towards climate vulnerable domestic regions – which then must lessen the climate vulnerabilities for households and communities on the ground. The necessity of a multiscalar analysis of climate justice is derived from its aptitude to analyse the subject as an accumulative process.</p>
