<p>Synthetic nerve guides are occasionally used to repair nerve defects. The aim of the present work was to analyse the results of Neurolac™ use in a series of 23 patients. We operated on 28 nerve lesions located on various sites: arm (<italic>n</italic> = 1), elbow (<italic>n</italic> = 5), forearm (<italic>n</italic> = 4), wrist (<italic>n</italic> = 2), palm (<italic>n</italic> = 5), fingers (<italic>n</italic> = 11). Defects averaged 11.03 mm and were repaired using Neurolac™. After an average of 21.9 months’ follow up (3–45 months), subjective criteria (pain, cold intolerance, Quick DASH) and objective criteria (strength, Weber and Semmes–Weinstein sensitivity tests) were compared with the contralateral side. Average pain score was 2.17/10. Cold intolerance was reported in fifteen cases. Quick DASH averaged 35.37/100. Grip strength averaged 64.62% of the contralateral side. As regards sensitivity, the difference between the two sides was 18.89 on Weber’s test, and 46.92 on Semmes–Weinstein. Defect size did not affect the outcomes. We observed eight complications the most serious being two fistulizations of the Neurolac™ device close to a joint and one neuroma. Neurolac™ presents some advantages (resorption, semi-permeability, emergency use, tenseless repair) like other synthetic guides used for nerve regeneration and its transparency constitutes an added benefit. However, some difficulty in its handling and its expensiveness represent real disadvantages. Our results are not in favour of its use in repairing hand nerve defects.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The first attempt to repair nerve defects may be attributed to Gluck who proposed, in 1881, the use of decalcified long bones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1753193411422685">Ijpma et al., 2008</xref>). Numerous techniques have been proposed since then that may be classified in two categories depending on the material used: nerve tissue or tubular conduit. At present, the gold standard remains the autologous nerve transplant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1753193411422685">Millesi, 1967</xref>), but results are still inadequate. The limited availability and the disadvantages posed by the donor site have promoted the development of alternative solutions. Among these, many techniques were described, including veins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193411422685">Chiu et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1753193411422685">Tang et al., 1993</xref>), muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753193411422685">Hall, 1997</xref>), combined filled veins and muscular fragments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193411422685">Brunelli et al., 1993</xref>), or synthetic guides for nerve regeneration. The latter are the modern version of Lundborg’s silicone chambers for nerve regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1753193411422685">Lundborg et al., 1982</xref>).</p>
<p>Among the latter, many products have been developed recently. They are characterized by their composition (polyglycol acid polymers, lactide-ε-caprolactone co-polymers, type I and/or type III collagen of bovine or porcine origin) and their biophysical and biochemical properties. They share a restriction: their application only for nerve defects ≤3 cm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1753193411422685">Meek and Coert 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The aim of the present work was to analyse the clinical results of the synthetic guide bioresorbable copolyester poly(DL-lactide-ε-caprolactone) Neurolac™ for nerve regeneration in a series of 28 nerves from 23 patients.</p>

<title>Patients</title>
<p>Between May of 2007 and June of 2009, 24 patients presenting with 29 nerve lesions of the upper limb were admitted to our department for nerve repair using a guide for nerve regeneration. One patient was lost to follow up. Consequently, our series included 28 nerve lesions from 23 patients who constituted a population aged 39.35 years in average, with only three females (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1753193411422685">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>In 21 patients the causal mechanism was a trauma that motivated an emergency visit (lesions caused by glass, circular saw or chain saw). In the two other cases, it was a neuroma from a previous ballistic injury (patient #18) and a schwannoma of the musculocutaneous nerve (patient #23). There were associated lesions in 16 cases, predominantly lesions of the flexor tendons (<italic>n</italic> = 12) and arterial lesions (<italic>n</italic> = 10) of which six patients had more than two associated lesions. Seven patients were current smokers.</p>
<p>Lesions were located on the arm (<italic>n</italic> = 1), elbow (<italic>n</italic> = 5), forearm (<italic>n</italic> = 4), wrist (<italic>n</italic> = 2), palm of the hand (<italic>n</italic> = 5), and fingers (<italic>n</italic> = 11). After debridement, nerve defects averaged 11.03 mm with a range of 2 to 25 mm.</p>

<sec id="section4-1753193411422685">
<title>Operating technique</title>
<p>All patients were operated on by senior surgeons under locoregional anaesthesia and a tourniquet inflated at the level of the arm. The surgical technique was a three-step procedure: preparation of the nerve ends, reconstruction of the defect, and postoperative care.</p>
<p>Following surgical incision adapted to both the location of the nerve lesion and the extent of wound contusion, the first step consisted of debridement of the nerve ends, with the adjacent joints in a neutral position. A bioresorbable copolyester poly(DL-lactide-ε-caprolactone) nerve conduit for guiding nerve regeneration (Neurolac® Ascension™) was selected according to both the extent of the nerve defect (maximal length 25 mm) and the nerve diameter (1.5 to 4 mm) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1753193411422685">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<p>Repair consisted of bridging the defect with the regeneration guide secured to the nerve stumps using nylon (6/0 to 10/0) U-shaped stitches. The threads crossed successively the guide (through an orifice located 3 mm from its end), the epineurium (at about 3 mm from its section surface without penetrating the nerve tissue), and once more the guide (through a second orifice located a few millimetres from the first one). The technique of needle passage differed depending on the suture used. Prior to the use of 6/0 and 7/0 sutures, the Neurolac™ guide was plunged into 37°C saline solution for one minute in order to soften it and facilitate the needle passage through its wall. This technique was not applicable when using 8/0 to 10/0 sutures due to their fragile needles. For these sutures a 25 gauge trocar was used to make the needle holes in the Neurolac™ wall. Whatever the technique of needle passage, about 3 mm of each nerve end was inserted inside the guide and heparin saline solution (1000U/100 ml) was injected to fill the space.</p>
<p>As postoperative care, immobilization of the joints for 3 weeks, in a position dependent on the associated lesions, was performed after which motor and sensation rehabilitation was initiated.</p>

<sec id="section5-1753193411422685">
<title>Assessment methods</title>
<p>At the final follow up, subjective and objective criteria were evaluated by an independent ergotherapist.</p>
<p>Subjective criteria were pain as assessed on a VAS graded 0 (no pain) to 10 (maximal imaginable pain), the potential existence of cold intolerance, and the upper limb Quick DASH functional score rated 0 (no discomfort) to 100 (unusable upper limb).</p>
<p>Objective criteria were grip strength as assessed by the Jamar™ dynamometer, Weber’s two-point tactile discrimination static test, and the Semmes–Weinstein monofilaments test, as compared with the healthy contralateral side. With respect to the Weber and Semmes–Weinstein tests, when the nerve lesion involved more than one hemipulp (median or ulnar nerve), the results were expressed in the form of average of the values of all the fingers affected.</p>
<p>Comparisons between the affected side and the healthy contralateral side as assessed by the Weber and Semmes–Weinstein tests were carried out using Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test for paired samples. Comparisons between nerve defects of less or more than 5 mm as assessed by the Weber and Semmes–Weinstein tests were carried out using the Mann–Whitney test.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Mean follow up of our series lasted 21.9 months (range 3–45 months).</p>
<p>In terms of subjective results, mean pain score was 2.17/10 with range of 0 to 8. Cold intolerance was observed in 15 patients out of 23, and mean Quick DASH score was 35.37/100 with range of 2.27 to 79.55.</p>
<p>As for objective results, mean grip strength was 64.62% of contralateral side with range 0 to 130.</p>
<p>Weber’s tactile discrimination two-point static test showed a mean result of 24.96 mm on the affected side (from 6 to &gt;30 mm) vs. 6.07 mm on the healthy side (from 4 to 30 mm). Mean difference between the two sides was 18.89 mm; this value was statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). As regards the comparison of nerve defects (&lt;5 mm or &gt;5 mm) no significant difference was found.</p>
<p>Semmes–Weinstein’s monofilaments test showed a mean result of 47.27 g on the affected side (from 0.2 to &gt;75 g) vs. 0.35 g on the healthy side (from 0.027 to 0.7 g). Mean difference between the two sides was 46.92 g; this value was statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). As regards the comparison of nerve defects (&lt;5 mm or &gt;5 mm) no significant difference was found (<italic>p</italic> = 0.574).</p>
<p>We observed eight complications, three of which were not specific, comprising two with type 1 complex regional pain syndromes and one who had delayed healing following a hemi-amputation of the forearm with devascularization (patient #13).</p>
<p>Specific complications consisted of two fistulizations of the Neurolac™ guide. In both cases, the device had been positioned on the palmar face of a digital joint, an interphalangeal thumb joint (patient #3) and a metacarpophalangeal joint (patient #16). These two patients had their Neurolac™ removed and reconstruction of the residual nerve defect by nerve grafting was carried out in only one patient since the other one (#3) refused secondary nerve grafting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753193411422685">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1753193411422685">4</xref>). Patient #7 complained of ulnar nerve irritation at the repair site with no sign of sensation or motor recovery observed but as this patient was insufficiently disciplined and had a history of full section of the wrist median nerve with complete anaesthesia of the three first fingers, a decision was made not to re-operate on him.</p>

<p>Patient #20 had stiffness with flexion of the thumb MCP joint limited to 20° that did not recover despite rehabilitation. Patient #4 finally recovered from limited mobility of the index PIP after more than 1 year.</p>
<p>Seventeen of 28 cases had no recovery of sensation (Weber test result &gt;30 and Semmes–Weinstein test result at 75 or more). No progression of Tinel sign was observed in three cases (patients #2 #7 and #16). Clinical failure consisted of 17 of 28 cases, i.e. 61% of the nerves repaired.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The level of evidence of our retrospective study is IV, as in most reported works in the field of synthetic guides for nerve regeneration. In fact, it appears difficult to report large comparative series of homogeneous sites of nerve defects with sufficient duration of follow up. In this regard, our series is comparable to others. However, only one series have used the Neurolac™ device, reporting a multicentre comparative, randomized study with a level of evidence II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193411422685">Bertleff et al., 2005</xref>). Nevertheless, it remains justified to compare our results to those of this study, not only because other authors reported some years later less optimistic results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753193411422685">Hernández-Cortés et al., 2010</xref>) but also because Meek himself published several articles in which he questioned the quality of the results in the initial series (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1753193411422685">Meek, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1753193411422685">Meek and Jansen, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>This initial series of Bertleff and Meek included 34 nerve lesions in 30 patients with 1 year follow up (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193411422685">Bertleff et al., 2005</xref>). The group with Neurolac™ included 21 nerve reconstructions (17 patients) and the control group 13 nerve reconstructions (13 patients). We believe there is a selection bias in the control group where repair consisted either of direct suture or nerve graft depending on the defect length as assessed peroperatively. The authors claimed comparable distance in the two groups between the lesion and digital pulp, but no statistical analysis was shown in the article. With the absence of nerve defect, although functional results were quite identical in the two groups, the authors underline the simplicity of the surgical technique and absence of any tension with Neurolac™. We believe these arguments insufficiently justify using Neurolac™ rather than direct suture with physiological tension especially because of the significant cost of the Neurolac™ device (&gt;1000€). In the case of a nerve defect &lt;2 cm, the authors themselves lack conclusive arguments favouring the use of Neurolac™ and they recommend further complementary studies.</p>
<p>In addition to Bertleff and Meek’s randomized study, only <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1753193411422685">Weber et al. (2000)</xref> carried out a randomized study that compared a group with Neurotube™ to a group undergoing nerve repair by direct suture. Results were better in the Neurotube™ group as regards the sensibility as assessed by Weber’s two-point discrimination test. However, in both groups, the authors had to treat nerve defects of 7 mm in average, probably with excessive tension in the group undergoing direct suturing. In fact, Millesi has shown that excessive tension in direct repair considerably compromises the quality of clinical outcome in nerve reconstruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1753193411422685">Millesi et al., 1972</xref>).</p>
<p>Another problem exists with Neurolac™ resorption. From a chemical point of view, Neurolac™ is a copolyester poly (D/L lactide-ε-caprolactone). Its resorption results from two steps: hydrolysis and enzymatic degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1753193411422685">Meek and Den Dunnen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1753193411422685">Schlosshauer et al., 2006</xref>). During hydrolysis, an inflation of the wall may be observed followed by a collapse that results in tube obturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1753193411422685">Meek and Den Dunnen, 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753193411422685">Hernández-Cortés et al. (2010)</xref> reported a clinical case of failure in relation to Neurolac™ collapse. One of the final products resulting from the enzymatic degradation is lactic acid, which is responsible for an inflammatory reaction of the soft tissues that surround the tube (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1753193411422685">Schlosshauer et al., 2006</xref>). Our two cases of fistulization (patients #3 and #16) could be caused by the reaction to a foreign body. The duration of the resorption process is approximately 16 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1753193411422685">Meek et al., 2008</xref>) but small fragments of Neurolac™ have been found up to 24 months after implantation in a rat, resulting in a persistent clear reaction to foreign body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1753193411422685">Jansen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1753193411422685">Meek and Jansen, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>At a mechanical level, Neurolac™ differs from other tubes in its transparency and its hardness. Its transparency is an advantage since it permits controlling the adequate positioning of the nerve ends and the exclusion of a potential blood clot which could block nerve regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1753193411422685">Meek et al., 2008</xref>). Its hardness is a disadvantage especially when the device is used close to a joint that induces a risk of joint stiffening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1753193411422685">Meek, 2007</xref>). We observed two cases of joint stiffness in our series (patients #4 and #20). In patient #4, it cannot be confirmed that this stiffness was directly related to the Neurolac™ since this patient also had tendon lesions. The hardness of the device wall also makes it difficult to use microsurgical threads since their extreme fragility prevents penetrating the wall. On many occasions we have used 6/0 and 7/0 sutures to reduce this difficulty (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1753193411422685">Table 2</xref>). In fact, microsurgical threads appear useless in nerve defect repair using a guide for nerve regeneration, since the two nerve ends are not in direct contact with each other.</p>
<p>The reduction of procedure duration is a frequently used argument when promoting devices for guiding nerve regeneration. Indeed they do not necessitate optic magnification but in our experience, the hardness of the Neurolac™ wall complicated and slowed its fitting.</p>
<p>Contrary to Bertleff the results of our series are not in favour of Neurolac™ utilization whatever the extent of nerve defect. In fact, we found no significant difference between defects of less or more than 5 mm. we obtained satisfactory results only in six cases of which five occurred at the level of the hand and one at the level of the forearm median nerve (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1753193411422685">Table 2</xref>). Our results are modest when compared to those reported in the two previous publications. In the first one, the authors report no benefit at all 40 months after plantar nerve reconstruction using Neurolac™ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1753193411422685">Meek et al., 2006</xref>). In the more recent one, four reconstructions of digital nerves using Neurolac™ resulted in a bad outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753193411422685">Hernández-Cortés et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Lastly, the rate of complications we found in our study (eight out of 23 patients) is very high. Among them, five may be directly attributable to Neurolac™ use, the most important being the guide fistulization. Bertleff also observed two similar cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193411422685">Bertleff et al., 2005</xref>), and Meek reported a third case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1753193411422685">Meek and Jansen, 2009</xref>). For these reasons, we believe that the use of Neurolac™ should not be recommended in hand nerve defect reconstruction.</p>
<p>Neurolac™ presents the same advantages (resorption, semi-permeability, use in emergency, tenseless direct nerve repair) and disadvantages (theoretically, utilization only for nerve defects &lt;2 cm, and cost) as other synthetic guides for nerve regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1753193411422685">Hudson et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1753193411422685">Meek et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1753193411422685">Kostopoulos et al., 2010</xref>). Unlike other guides, it presents the advantage of its transparency but also the disadvantage of its mechanical hardness. It remains difficult to form an opinion regarding synthetic guides for nerve regeneration on the basis of the literature since the number of comparative randomized studies is limited and insufficient.</p>
