<title>Conclusions:</title>
<p>In literature there are many references to the apprehension of the other in terms of a mirror image of the self. The difficulty of grasping the other is described in a passage by the author Ian McEwan as ‘the unbearable idea of other minds’. The notion that this difficulty can in part be overcome through both spoken and written language is also salient in the novels examined here. The concept of an entrapment within one’s image of oneself was elaborated by Freud in his notion of narcissism. Lacan further developed this notion as foundational in one’s relation to the other, but clarified that such mirroring relations to others are always imbued with jealousy and rivalry. Lacan’s notion of “paranoid knowledge”, an imagined knowledge of what the other is thinking, is precisely a ‘theory of mind’ that is able to account for the way one subject attempts, and ultimately fails, to read the mind of another.</p>

<p>In the previous two papers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1039856212458330">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1039856212458330">2</xref></sup> in this series, I have endeavoured to examine the epistemological underpinnings of the notion of ‘theory of mind’. I have also attempted to more closely examine the experimental situation from which ‘theory of mind’ has been expounded in order to discern some fundamental difficulties with this notion and to examine various critiques that have been raised against it. However, in order to not remain at the level of critique, one must strive to say what might be conveyed by this notion, as well as to offer some other approach to the phenomena involved.</p>
<p>I will attempt to do this in two ways. Firstly, it is often said that much more can be learned in our clinical professions about the human psyche from reading a good novel than from numerous textbooks of psychiatry. Indeed, psychiatry textbooks themselves refer at points to various works of literature. The contribution of literature to psychiatry has also been the object of serious study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1039856212458330">3</xref></sup> Antonio Damasio<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1039856212458330">4</xref></sup> claims that the insights of the psychologist William James have been rivalled only by Shakespeare’s and Freud’s, already a tribute to the contribution of great literature as well that of psychoanalysis (p. 129). Bennett and Hacker<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1039856212458330">5</xref></sup> (p. 211), however, in the work mentioned in the first paper of this series,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1039856212458330">1</xref></sup> counter this claim regarding William James with their view that such praise would be more properly directed towards his brother Henry, the novelist. Thus, in their view, it is the novel that is able to convey more than the field of psychology.</p>
<p>Here I would like to take this adage seriously by drawing upon a selection of novels that I have recently read that I believe illuminate this question in a useful and poignant manner. My selection is fortuitous but nonetheless draws upon modern novels from three different countries written in three different languages.</p>
<p>Secondly, I would like to draw upon psychoanalysis in order to provide a counterpoint to the notion of ‘theory of mind’. We will see that psychoanalysis has already long elaborated upon the phenomena described by the notion of ‘theory of mind’, but in a manner, I shall argue, that gives a clearer account and perceives the interaction in a rather different way. For those who might question the need for and usefulness of this approach, we might cite Gallagher′s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1039856212458330">6</xref></sup> comment: ‘we find that the mind works in ways that are more complex than common sense or even experimental psychology might suggest’ (p. 254). We have already argued that the reduction to an academic and cognitive psychological approach might not only skew the phenomena involved, but, moreover, may lead to spurious conclusions.</p>
<p>The two approaches of literature and psychoanalysis are not of course mutually exclusive since psychoanalysis, like psychiatry, has always drawn upon the works of the world’s great writers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1039856212458330">7</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="section3-1039856212458330">
<title>The novel and ‘theory of mind’</title>
<p>In Ian McEwan’s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1039856212458330">8</xref></sup> novel <italic>Atonement</italic>, a young woman named Briony observes an interaction between two people and comes to a completely wrong conclusion about what they are thinking and therefore what has taken place. The author describes ‘how easy it was to get everything wrong, completely wrong’, which is described as ‘the strangeness of the here and now, of what passed between people’ (p. 39). What we are putting forward in this paper is precisely that the attributions or speculations regarding what the other is thinking is so often wrong in this way. McEwan, in fact, takes this further and proposes that what impedes the ability to read the other’s mind is what he calls ‘the unbearable idea of other minds’ (p. 41). This unbearable idea is precisely what we can call the Otherness of the other, an Otherness or foreignness that <italic>cannot</italic> be grasped. I am proposing that this is a type of gap between oneself and the other that cannot be spanned. According to this idea, the minds of others are not able to be grasped as such, but one can only speculate according to what one imagines them to think. Hence what is initially taken as the ability to read the minds of others is effectively one’s own thoughts that are reflected back from the other.</p>
<p>McEwan gives a fine description of this psychopathology of everyday life which seems to be overlooked by academic psychology. He notes: ‘It wasn’t only wickedness and scheming that made people unhappy, it was the confusion and misunderstanding; above all, it was the failure to grasp the simple truth that other people are as real as you’. It was precisely the moment of failure of a type of ‘theory of mind’ that led to the realization by the character in the novel, which was ‘the moment when she became recognizably herself’ (p. 41).This apperception of ‘the unbearable idea of other minds’ was what allowed this protagonist to later become a great novelist. And she was able to become a novelist because it was ‘only in the story could you enter these different minds and show how they had an equal value’ (p. 40). It was only in the writing of the story that the illusions of ‘theory of mind’ could be dispelled and something else could be propounded. In other words, it is precisely this ability that is the faculty of a great novelist, an ability that is out of reach in the interactions of our everyday lives.</p>
<p>The French novelist Muriel Barbery,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1039856212458330">9</xref></sup> through the character of the girl Paloma in her work <italic>The elegance of the hedgehog</italic>, also recognizes the difficulty that we have to be able to apprehend the other, other than as a reflection of ourselves. Paloma expresses the hope that this might be different: ‘I implore fate to give me the chance to see beyond myself and truly meet someone’ (p. 141). This difficulty of seeing beyond ourselves is expounded at some length by Paloma:<disp-quote>
<p>We never look beyond our assumptions and, what’s worse, we have given up trying to meet others; we just meet ourselves. We don’t recognize each other because other people have become our permanent mirrors. If we actually realized this, if we were to become aware of the fact that we are only ever looking at ourselves in the other person, that we are alone in the wilderness, we would go crazy (pp. 140–141).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>McEwan and Barbery concur in their description of the difficulty we have in apprehending the other. When taken at the level of the image it remains mere reflection. We can say that this difficulty is due to the ‘unbearable idea of other minds’. According to Barbery we are only able to apprehend the other as a type of mirror of ourselves. Literally, to be able to grasp the other in his or her Otherness would make us go mad. Madness then would be to encounter the Otherness of the other, unmediated by the image or the word.</p>
<p>A further difficulty with the inability to encounter the other, except as a reflection of ourselves, is that we are not aware of this mirroring illusion since we truly believe that what we encounter <italic>is</italic> the other, when it is but a reflection of ourselves.</p>
<p>So if what we encounter through the image is this reflection of ourselves in the other, how then is it possible to encounter the other at all, and through what medium? What might allow us to go beyond the mirror image in our social relations is, according to Barbery,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1039856212458330">10</xref></sup> language: ‘Language and the uses to which it is put, this wealth of Man and the elaboration of the social community, are sacred works’ (p. 132, my translation).</p>
<p>As we have seen, for McEwan it is also through language, in particular through writing, that it is possible to go beyond ourselves. Language thus functions to mediate social discourse; it is what differentiates us from other species and hence socializes and humanizes us.</p>
<p>I would also like to briefly mention the novel <italic>Blindness</italic> (as a counterpoint to Baron-Cohen’s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1039856212458330">11</xref></sup> book <italic>Mindblindness</italic>), by the recently deceased Portuguese writer José Saramago,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1039856212458330">12</xref></sup> who was the recipient of the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1998. This novel is a tale of a mysterious disease that sweeps the world causing almost universal blindness. This blindness, however, is an allegory of our inability to truly perceive others: ‘It is a great truth that the worst blind person was the one who did not want to see’ (p. 18). This inability to see others is imbued, in Saramago’s account, with all the difficulties associated with what we have referred to as the psychopathology of everyday life, in particular the conflict and rivalry that permeate our relations with the other:<disp-quote>
<p>…with common sense, there would be no more complaints, these constant arguments that are driving me mad would cease, you have no idea what it is like to watch two blind people fighting, Fighting has always been, more or less, a form of blindness… (p. 127)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This social blindness is also, with Saramago, an effect of our inability to see beyond ourselves, leading not only to the interpersonal difficulties we all experience, but also to the problems of society:<disp-quote>
<p>With the passing of time, as well as the social evolution and genetic exchange, we ended up putting our conscience in the colour of blood and in the salt of tears, and, if that were not enough, we made our eyes into a kind of mirror turned inwards… (p. 18)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In this novel it is the ability of the two central protagonists to reach out and be able to encounter each other, which leads to the resolution of the crisis. These two people, an odd couple, are able to encounter each other precisely because they are blind, since the difficulties of appearances and self-image no longer get in the way. And it is words that mediate this transformation:<disp-quote>
<p>The difficult thing isn’t living with other people, it’s understanding them, said the doctor. … here one can see that the true eternal return is that of words… (pp. 284–285)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>If, as Baron-Cohen asserts, the function of ‘theory of mind’ is to be able to mind-read the other’s mind, then the weight of the revelations of the writers discussed here would mitigate against this position. We find here, in this brief discussion of the attempt to apprehend the other, that we are limited by the tendency to see the other by the measure of a reflection of ourselves. When we meet someone our tendency is to discover what we have in common with the other person, in other words the way in which the other reflects my knowledge of myself. The other who does not reflect me is an ‘unbearable idea’, and the basis of our interpersonal rivalries and conflict. On a social level it is also the basis of racism, xenophobia, and all forms of mistrust and discrimination of those who do not resemble us. Despite our apparent wish to know the other, we succumb to the illusion of knowing others when we in fact confirm our own pre-existing knowledge through the other as a mirror. As we have discerned above, it is only language, whether spoken or written, that might allow us to go beyond this.</p>

<title>The contribution of psychoanalysis</title>
<p>Shaun Gallagher,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1039856212458330">13</xref></sup> in reviewing Peter Hobson′s book <italic>The cradle of thought: Exploring the origins of thinking</italic>, notes that the psychoanalyst ‘sets up an unusual situation that allows him to observe things that would otherwise remain hidden’ (p. 253). ‘Theory of mind’ sets out to explore a psychic phenomenon that only exists in, and in regard to, a subjective relation. Thus it is nominally the task of ‘theory of mind’ to examine an aspect of this relation. However, because of the bias of academic research psychology, which I<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1039856212458330">14</xref></sup> have elsewhere called an ‘evidence<italic>-biased</italic> approach’ (p. 322), it eliminates what it considers to be subjective or converts this into objectified data, or ‘an objectified domain’ as Gipps<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1039856212458330">15</xref></sup> describes it.</p>

<title>Freud and narcissism</title>
<p>‘Theory of mind’ has also been referred to as ‘theory of theory’ or ‘theory theory’ (p. 199).6 Thus it is a theory regarding the theory that a subject elaborates regarding another’s theory. It has also been called ‘beliefs about beliefs’ (p. 103).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1039856212458330">16</xref></sup> What I would like to stress in this is the echo or mirroring of these words ‘theory’ and ‘belief’ through the notion of ‘theory of mind’. Such a reflection is also conveyed by the authors cited above in reference to one of the ways by which we endeavour to apprehend the other.</p>
<p>This mirroring of one’s own image is the structural characteristic of the concept of narcissism, as introduced by Sigmund Freud.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1039856212458330">17</xref></sup> Freud described narcissism, drawing on classical mythology as recounted in literature such as Ovid’s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1039856212458330">18</xref></sup> <italic>Metamorphoses</italic>: ‘That which you behold is but the shadow of a reflected form and has no substance of its own’ (p. 155). Narcissus, of course, does not fall in love with himself: he falls in love with an <italic>image</italic> of himself that is reflected back from the pool of water. This image is literally already an <italic>other</italic> for him. It is his fascination with this image that prevents him from knowing or loving another being: ‘I am charmed, and I see; but what I see and what charms me I cannot find’ (p. 155).</p>
<p>Such a description of the relation with the other at the level of the image is in keeping with that of the accounts of the mirroring relation by the authors above. It is this aspect of narcissism that I wish to highlight here, that of the reflection of oneself, of one’s pre-conceived knowledge, in a certain mirror image, by virtue of which one sees in the other that which is already in oneself. This is precisely what Lacan described as being “the individual’s fundamental alienation”.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1039856212458330">19</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1039856212458330">
<title>Lacan and ‘the mirror stage’</title>
<p>Jacques Lacan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1039856212458330">20</xref></sup> in his paper <italic>The mirror stage</italic>, further refined Freud’s theory of narcissism with his concept of the ‘mirror stage’, a structure rather than a developmental stage, in which each of us participates. Whilst this is not the place to expound at length upon this complex notion, suffice it to say that for Lacan one of the functions of the ego, whose structure is defined by this ‘mirror stage’, is that of a certain alienation. Lacan, in reference to the discussion of the chimpanzee and language in the first of the papers of this series, compares the two in order to differentiate them:<disp-quote>
<p>The child, at an age when he is for a time, however short, outdone by the chimpanzee in instrumental intelligence, can nevertheless already recognize as such his own image in a mirror. […] This act, far from exhausting itself, as in the case of the monkey, once the image has been mastered and found empty, immediately rebounds in the case of the child in a series of gestures in which he experiences in play the relation between the movements assumed in the image and the reflected environment, and between this virtual complex and the reality it reduplicates − the child’s own body, and the persons and things, around him (p. 1).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This is an alienation from oneself since one first forms an image of oneself through the eyes of an <italic>other</italic>, the mother in particular, and <italic>others</italic> in general. The child’s image of him or herself is formed in a reflection of the people and things around him. Thus the image that one forms of oneself is fundamentally other, or alienated. Lacan refers to this as ‘the assumption of the armour of an alienating identity’ (p. 4). It is this alienated and defended position, we assert, that leads to the ‘unbearable idea of the other’.</p>
<p>In the same paper, Lacan also speaks of this position as foundational of a type of paranoia, based on a relation of rivalry of everyday relations with others, that is, of ordinary social relations. This is a ‘paranoic alienation, which dates from the deflection of the specular <italic>I</italic> into the social <italic>I</italic>’ (p. 5), the ‘specular’ being that which pertains to the mirror relation. Thus the rivalry generated by the mirror relation determines both the paranoia and the conflict in ordinary social relations.</p>
<p>This foundational relation is marked by what Lacan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1039856212458330">21</xref></sup> calls ‘paranoid knowledge’ (p. 39), a concept that he had already developed in the 1930s. In the French, he uses for ‘knowledge’ the word <italic>connaissance</italic>, a familiar or already-known knowledge that is derived from the mirror relation. This differentiates it from <italic>savoir</italic>, a different word for knowledge, in this case the unknown knowledge derived from the unconscious. He proposes that: ‘All human knowledge [<italic>connaissance</italic>] stems from the dialectic of jealousy, which is a primordial manifestation of communication’ (p. 39). It is in this dialectic of Sally’s search for her marble that Anne has hidden that we might recognize the function of ‘theory of mind’. Lacan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1039856212458330">21</xref></sup> goes on to propose that:<disp-quote>
<p>The said paranoid knowledge is knowledge founded on the rivalry of jealousy, over the course of the primary identification I have tried to define by means of the mirror stage. This rivalrous and competitive ground for the foundation of the object is precisely what is overcome in speech insofar as this involves a third party (p. 39).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Our ‘theory of mind’ regarding what the other is thinking inevitably generates a type of suspicion, hostility or paranoia of the motives of the other, imbued as it inexorably is in a dual relation of rivalry. This is the basis of what we have developed here by using Freud’s term <italic>the psychopathology of everyday life</italic>, the fact that our social and interpersonal relations are permeated by the perpetual misunderstandings and conflicts that rupture the illusions of clear and concise communication.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1039856212458330">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>We can put forward that ‘theory of mind’, as it is proposed in the experimental situation developed by Baron-Cohen, is a test of the ability of both the child and the examiner to be able to identify with each other, each to see the other reflected back as an image of oneself. ‘Theory of mind’, then, attempts to find an adequation between one’s own thoughts (about what Sally is thinking, for instance, in the experimental situation) and what the other is actually thinking. That is, the subject’s response is gauged against what the examiner determines the child <italic>should</italic> be thinking, in other words, what is deemed to be normal. It is thus the examiner who identifies with Sally’s search for her marble and expects the child to do the same. If this two-way street is ruptured by the child not being able to identify with what the examiner expects of the child, then the child will fail the test of ‘theory of mind’.</p>
<p>We could also describe such a failure as a failure of empathy. ‘Theory of mind’ endeavours to test the way in which the child might identify with the examiner’s knowledge of Anne’s transfer of the marble, and thus empathize with the examiner’s belief regarding where Sally should look for it. Some children are not able to take up this position, something which might be quite different to a failure of cognitive theorizing regarding Sally’s belief. Indeed, for these children, we might consider this to be akin to Jaspers’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1039856212458330">22</xref></sup> notion of the <italic>ununderstandable</italic> which he applies to aspects of thought process in psychosis. For instance, he states that: ‘understanding halts before the reality of organic illness and psychosis, before the elementary nature of these facts’ (p. 363). Similarly, understanding may halt before certain children with autism, with whom empathy fails, like with the patient with psychosis in Jaspers’ account. He proposes elsewhere in <italic>General psychopathology</italic> that:<disp-quote>
<p>Speculative elaboration of extra-conscious mechanisms through empathic understanding is a sheer waste of time and the literature is far too full of such attempts (p. 305).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>We could say that ‘theory of mind’, as a metarepresentational endeavour, is such a speculative elaboration regarding this failure of identification and empathy of, and with, the autistic subject.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, ‘theory of mind’ promotes, at least for those of us who are not autists, the ideal of a limpid communication regarding which all of us fall short. As we have endeavoured to demonstrate, the failure of ‘theory of mind’ is ubiquitous, not just in the patient or in the autistic subject, but in the psychopathology of everyday life of each one of us. The recent vogue, in management circles at all levels, of the promotion of transparency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1039856212458330">23</xref></sup> of governance in all sorts of organizations, has been similarly shown to promulgate even more obfuscation. ‘Theory of mind’, we can propose, by defining narrow parameters for its study, chooses to ignore that which does not conform to it, and therefore participates in another form of blindness.</p>
<p>Certainly we all endeavour to produce a ‘theory of mind’, in order to try to ascertain what the other is thinking, but this is our <italic>wish</italic> to read the minds of others. This wish is inevitably imbued with the suspicion and hostility of everyday relations, leading to inevitable conflicts. Such conflicts require the use of speech and language in order to be resolved. Furthermore, we can propose, we cannot know what the other is thinking and feeling unless we know what they desire, a dimension that is absent from the notion of ‘theory of mind’. But to know what someone desires, we need to hear what they say, we need to listen to their words.</p>
<p>From some quarters, namely the sociopathic, there can also be a malicious intent to the supposed mind-reading: that of being able to anticipate, control and manipulate the other. And indeed, for the psychotic patient, the notion of mind-reading takes on the status of thought-broadcasting, thought-insertion and other associated psychotic phenomenon.</p>
<p>The ideas of telepathy and mind-reading are usually relegated to the realm of wishful thinking whereas with ‘theory of mind’ they are cloaked in an apparently serious clinical mantle.</p>
<p>The stakes are high in this domain of the theory of knowledge, of epistemology, all the more so since it is one of the bases of the notion of mentalization which has also experienced a recent vogue. ‘Theory of mind’, we propose, is not a theory of knowledge. Or, if it is a theory of knowledge, it is a false theory of knowledge. What can be known through ‘theory of mind’ is what is already known, that is, an image of oneself that one sees reflected in the other.</p>
