<abstract>
<p>This research project uses the constructive-developmental tradition, in the self-authorship framework of intercultural maturity (King &amp; Baxter Magolda, 2005), to examine the extent to which 12 specific educational experiences may be associated with international undergraduates’ learning, development, and perception of campus climate. The study uses multiple regression analysis of a stratified random sample of international student respondents to the Global Perspective Inventory (GPI; <italic>n</italic> = 437). The results suggest that international students who participate in leadership programs, interact with others from their own culture, and take courses where professors facilitate intergroup dialogue, report more positive perceptions of campus climate. International students who participate in leadership programs, community service, and campus-organized diversity discussions, interact with people from diverse cultural backgrounds, and take courses with materials on race and ethnicity report greater levels of learning and development.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>More universities are expanding foreign student enrollments to internationalize their campuses, diversify their student bodies, and bring in extra tuition revenue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1028315311426783">Chow &amp; Marcus, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1028315311426783">Fischer, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1028315311426783">Open Doors, 2010</xref>). Due to the rising number of international undergraduates on their campuses, many higher education institutions are reconsidering where to invest limited resources to create educational environments that support international students’ adjustment to the social and academic demands of college life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1028315311426783">Schweitzer, Morson, &amp; Mather, 2011</xref>). Research on the factors that influence international students’ academic performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1028315311426783">Wei Chen &amp; Duanmu, 2009</xref>) and language-related problems in academic studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1028315311426783">Moores &amp; Popadiuk, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1028315311426783">Zhang &amp; Mi, 2009</xref>) has certainly contributed to our understanding of the ways American universities can create positive learning environments for international students. However, few studies have examined whether specific educational experiences may be positively associated with learning and development for international undergraduates.</p>
<p>This research project uses the constructive-developmental tradition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1028315311426783">Baxter Magolda, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1028315311426783">Kegan, 1994</xref>), in the self-authorship framework of intercultural maturity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1028315311426783">King &amp; Baxter Magolda, 2005</xref>), to more closely examine the extent to which 12 specific educational experiences may be associated with international undergraduates’ learning, development, and perception of campus climate. Reflecting the cognitive, intrapersonal, and interpersonal dimensions of self-authorship, respectively, the current study examined the extent to which these 12 educational experiences were associated with greater degrees of (a) thinking with complexity, taking into account multiple perspectives; (b) forming a unique sense of self that is value-based and authentic; and (c) relating to others with respect and openness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1028315311426783">Braskamp, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1028315311426783">King &amp; Baxter Magolda, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The research questions that guide this study are as follows:</p>

<list-item><p><italic>Research Question 1</italic>: What types of educational experiences are associated with learning, development, and positive perceptions of campus climate for international undergraduates?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Research Question 2</italic>: What variations exist within international student subgroups regarding the types of educational experiences associated with learning and development?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Given the growth of international student enrollment, there are compelling reasons to more closely examine the extent to which specific educational experiences may be associated with their learning, development, and perception of campus climate. First, this knowledge could assist campus leaders in understanding the developmental and educational impact of their internationalization programs. It would allow campus leaders to be more intentional in choices of what programs to offer that support learning for the international students on their campuses. Second, as undergraduates enter higher education from increasingly diverse cultural backgrounds, it is important to better understand the conditional effects of campus internationalization initiatives on various international student subgroups. Although some studies have researched the types of educational experiences that are positively associated with learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1028315311426783">Moores &amp; Popadiuk, 2011</xref>) and perception of campus climate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1028315311426783">Fischer, 2011</xref>), no national, multi-institution studies have examined both of these issues together.</p>

<title>Conceptual Framework</title>
<p>The primary focus of this study is on the extent to which 12 educational experiences may be associated with learning, development, and perception of campus climate for international students. This section will outline the conceptual framework used in the design of this research project. The conceptual framework locates the international student in relation to the three types of educational experiences: curricular educational experiences, cocurricular educational experiences, and community educational experiences (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1028315311426783">Figure 1</xref>). After briefly outlining international student enrollment trends in American higher education, this section will explore existing research on educational experiences associated with learning and development.</p>

<title>International Student Enrollment Trends in American Higher Education</title>
<p>Undergraduates enter higher education from increasingly diverse cultural backgrounds and a broader social base. The majority of undergraduates are women and the proportion of ethnic groups has increased with more African Americans, Latinos, and Asian Americans enrolled in American higher education institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1028315311426783">Dey &amp; Hurtado, 2005</xref>). The number of international students has dramatically increased due, in part, to institutions actively recruiting them as part of their campus internationalization plans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1028315311426783">Olson, Evans, &amp; Shoenberg, 2007</xref>). Although overall international student enrollment at American colleges and universities increased by 7% from the 2007-2008 academic year, international undergraduate student enrollment increased to 20.4% from the 2007-2008 academic year and 37% since the 2004-2005 academic year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1028315311426783">Open Doors, 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>Learning and Development</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1028315311426783">Robert Kegan (1994)</xref> first advanced the concept of self-authorship—defined as the capacity to define one’s beliefs, identity, and social relationships—as a necessary foundation to meet the demands of adult life. An increasing number of scholars have used the self-authorship framework in research across cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1028315311426783">Baxter Magolda, Creamer, &amp; Meszaros, 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1028315311426783">King and Baxter Magolda (2005)</xref> argue that learning is an integrative, ongoing process that involves the inherent interconnectedness of the cognitive, intrapersonal, and interpersonal dimensions of development:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Demonstrating one’s intercultural skills requires several types of expertise, including complex understanding of cultural differences (cognitive dimension), capacity to accept and not feel threatened by cultural differences (intrapersonal dimension), and capacity to function interdependently with diverse others. (interpersonal dimension; p. 574)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Reflecting the three dimensions of self-authorship, the current study defines learning as the capacity for a person (a) to think with complexity, taking into account multiple perspectives; (b) to form a unique sense of self that is value-based and authentic; and (c) to relate to others with respect and openness, especially with those who are not like her (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1028315311426783">Braskamp, 2010</xref>). This definition specifically frames learning and development as a <italic>multidimensional,holistic process developed through various types of social interaction</italic>.</p>
<p>Cognitive development is centered on students gaining knowledge, in addition to understanding of what is true and important to know. It includes both cultural knowledge and personal epistemology. <italic>Cultural knowledge</italic> is evidenced by an understanding and awareness of various cultures and their impact on our global society as well as proficiency in more than one language. <italic>Personal epistemology</italic> is evidenced by the complexity of one’s view of the importance of cultural context in judging what is important to know and value. It includes viewing knowledge and knowing with greater complexity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1028315311426783">Hofer, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1028315311426783">Hofer &amp; Pintrich, 2001</xref>) and taking into account multiple cultural perspectives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1028315311426783">Hofer, 2008</xref>). Reliance on external authorities to have absolute truth gives way to commitment in relativism when making commitments within the context of uncertainty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1028315311426783">Baxter Magolda, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1028315311426783">King &amp; Kitchner, 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1028315311426783">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1028315311426783">Perry, 1970</xref>).</p>
<p>Intrapersonal development focuses on one becoming more aware of and integrating one’s personal values and self-identity into one’s personhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1028315311426783">Chickering &amp; Reisser, 1993</xref>). It includes both identity development and affective development. <italic>Identity development</italic> is evidenced by an awareness of an authentic sense of self that involves the acceptance of the ethnic, racial, and gender dimensions of identity. It includes students’ sense of self-direction and purpose in their lives, becoming more self-aware of one’s strengths, values, personal characteristics, and sense of self, and viewing student development in terms of their self-identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1028315311426783">Chickering &amp; Braskamp, 2009</xref>). <italic>Affective development</italic> is evidenced by respect for and acceptance of cultural perspectives different from one’s own and degree of emotional self-assurance in one’s encounters with other cultures. It incorporates integrating different and often conflicting ideas about who one is while actively engaging in an increasingly multicultural world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1028315311426783">Noddings, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1028315311426783">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1028315311426783">Rifkin, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Interpersonal development is centered on one’s willingness to interact with persons with different social norms and cultural backgrounds, acceptance of others, and being comfortable when relating to others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1028315311426783">Bennett &amp; Bennett, 2004</xref>). It includes social interaction and social responsibility. <italic>Social interaction</italic> is evidenced by engagement with others who are different from oneself, which is considered critical to effectively engaging a diverse global society (Association of American Colleges and Universities [AAC&amp;U], 2007; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1028315311426783">Braskamp, Braskamp, &amp; Merrill, 2009</xref>). <italic>Social responsibility</italic> is evidenced by a sense of social interdependence and concern for others demonstrated through practical action in the world. It includes being able to view others differently and relating to others in terms of moving from dependence to independence to interdependence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1028315311426783">Johnson &amp; Johnson, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Although traditional views of human development were highly individualistic, contemporary understandings stress that learning is inextricably bound by the opportunities and values presented through social interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1028315311426783">Rogoff, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1028315311426783">Rogoff &amp; Lave, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1028315311426783">Vygotsky, 1978</xref>). Students develop through social interactions with others as members of groups, organizations, communities, or cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1028315311426783">Love &amp; Guthrie, 1999</xref>). Contemporary perspectives on human development emphasize how self and cultural context are inextricably connected, mutually shaping, and necessary to consider in human learning and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1028315311426783">Gjerde, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1028315311426783">Markus &amp; Kitayama, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1028315311426783">Wainryb, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Consideration of culture has offered new perspectives, challenges, and variations of existing models in the development of self-authorship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1028315311426783">Baxter Magolda, Creamer, &amp; Meszaros, 2010</xref>). A brief overview of the empirical research using the self-authorship framework across cultures illustrates some of the unique questions raised by this perspective. For example, the self-authorship framework suggests that experiences that promote development prompt students to figure out what to do or think without an external formula (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1028315311426783">King, 2010</xref>); however, a study of Chinese university students found that they moved from more independent thinking to greater reliance on external authorities—the inverse of what has been found in studies of university students in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1028315311426783">Zhang, 1999</xref>). Conversely, studies of South Korean females followed the same general developmental directions of students in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1028315311426783">Creamer, Lee, &amp; Laughlin, 2006</xref>). These conflicting findings highlight the potential variation in the ways educational experiences may affect diverse international student subgroups.</p>
<p>Furthermore, research on the factors that stimulate dissonance has demonstrated sources of variation across student subgroups. For example, when Asian American and European American students were placed in scenarios where they had to chose from a number of options, where some options that required the subjugation of personal goals, European American students reported dissonance more so than Asian American students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1028315311426783">Hong, Morris, Chiu, &amp; Benet-Martinez, 2000</xref>). The study also found that students who were identified as bicultural experienced more dissonance than students who were strongly identified as Asian. Although research has traditionally focused on cognitive dissonance as the primary catalyst for development, this research leaves open the possibility that the factors that create dissonance may vary across and within cultures. Therefore, it is possible that international students respond to campus initiatives designed to foster learning and development differently than their American counterparts.</p>

<title>Educational Experiences Associated With Learning and Development</title>
<p>Several national studies have identified educational experiences that are associated with enhancing students’ learning and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1028315311426783">AAC&amp;U, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1028315311426783">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1028315311426783">Association for American Higher Education [AAHE], 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1028315311426783">Chickering &amp; Gamson, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1028315311426783">King, Magolda, Barber, Brown, &amp; Lindsay, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1028315311426783">Kuh, Kinzie, Schuh, &amp; Whitt, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1028315311426783">Swaner &amp; Brownell, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1028315311426783">Taylor &amp; Haynes, 2008</xref>). The current study identified 12 educational experiences and placed them within three broad groupings: curricular, cocurricular, and community. Each is briefly reviewed below. The three groupings are intended to broadly categorize different educational experiences by the locations for student learning during college. Higher education researchers have called for research designs that specifically focus on the conditional effects of such educational experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1028315311426783">Pascarella, 2006</xref>). Therefore, to the extent possible, the current study seeks to understand the variation in the relationship of educational experiences associated with learning, development, and perception of campus climate among various international student subgroups.</p>
<sec id="section6-1028315311426783">
<title>Curricular</title>
<p>Curricular educational experiences, in this study, involve collective inquiry primarily within an academic context. Studies of 1st-year seminars that draw on multicultural content to facilitate structured cross-group interactions have demonstrated students who take these courses exhibit significantly more growth in cognitive complexity, multicultural awareness, and commitment to social justice than peers without this experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1028315311426783">Engberg &amp; Mayhew, 2007</xref>). A strong empirical base supports a wide range of positive outcomes, including critical thinking and increased perspective taking, for courses involving intergroup dialogue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1028315311426783">Gurin, Dey, Hurtado, &amp; Gurin, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1028315311426783">Gurin, Nagda, &amp; Lopez, 2004</xref>). Intergroup dialogues are designed to promote student interaction that enables students to understand how socially constructed group distinctions are played out in everyday social interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1028315311426783">Zúñiga, Nagda, Chesler, &amp; Cytron-Walker, 2007</xref>). Academic service learning provides structured opportunities for students to interact across cultural difference and is advocated as a high-impact pedagogy that promotes the cognitive, intrapersonal, and interpersonal development needed for a diverse, global society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1028315311426783">Chickering, 2008</xref>). Multicampus studies have demonstrated that service learning courses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1028315311426783">Eyler &amp; Giles, 1999</xref>) as well as sustained cocurricular service learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1028315311426783">Keen &amp; Hall, 2008</xref>) contribute to greater levels of social responsibility and civic behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1028315311426783">Hurtado, 2007</xref>). For this study, curricular educational experiences are expected to be associated with cognitive, intrapersonal, and interpersonal development.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1028315311426783">
<title>Cocurricular</title>
<p>Cocurricular educational experiences, in this study, involve exchanges of experience or learning outside a classroom context. High-quality community educational experiences help students choose lives that express their moral and civic commitments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1028315311426783">Knefelkamp, 2008</xref>). Community service activities that allow students to engage in positive interactions with diverse peers also foster learning and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1028315311426783">Pascarella &amp; Terenzini, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1028315311426783">Youniss &amp; Yates, 1997</xref>). Likewise, leadership programs that stress social interdependence, collaboration, and teamwork, including disciplinary, religious, and political clubs, are associated with students’ moral and civic growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1028315311426783">Colby, Ehrlich, Beaumont, &amp; Stephens, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1028315311426783">Colby &amp; Sullivan, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1028315311426783">Johnson &amp; Johnson, 2005</xref>). Research also suggests that students who engage in high-quality undergraduate research with a faculty member develop complex thinking and integrative problem-solving skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1028315311426783">Boyer Commission, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1028315311426783">Hu, Schwartz, Gayles, &amp; Li, 2008</xref>). For this study, cocurricular educational experiences are expected to be primarily associated with intrapersonal and interpersonal development.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1028315311426783">
<title>Community</title>
<p>Community educational experiences, in this study, involve shared or different cultural activities outside a classroom context. There is strong evidence that one of the most important ways colleges contribute to students’ development is by providing high-quality experiences that expose students to a diversity of intellectual, social, and cultural perspectives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1028315311426783">Pascarella &amp; Terenzini, 2005</xref>).

Students may also benefit from participating in religious or spiritual activities that support their meaning-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1028315311426783">Tisdell, 2008</xref>) and provide a focal point for academic dialogue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1028315311426783">Astin, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1028315311426783">Speck, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1028315311426783">Zajonc, 2003</xref>).

<title>Method</title>
<p>This study examines the extent to which 12 specific educational experiences may be associated with international undergraduates’ learning, development, and perception of campus climate. Quantitative data were collected and analyzed from undergraduate students who responded to the Global Perspective Inventory (GPI). The GPI contains 5 demographic items, 4 curricular items, 4 cocurricular items, 4 community items, and 40 items associated with six developmental scales. The GPI was administered to 29,404 undergraduates attending 55 American colleges and universities in the 2010-2011 academic year. Participating institutions recruited students based on their interest in assessing global learning on their campuses. In response to the question, “Are you an international student or foreign national?” 1,992 students (6.8%) self-identified as international students. Researchers took a stratified random sample of international student respondents reflecting the most recent Open Doors data on country of origin, gender, and enrolling institution type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1028315311426783">Open Doors, 2010</xref>; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1028315311426783">Table 1</xref> for demographic information).</p>

<title>Educational Experience Variables</title>
<p>All curricular, community, and cultural educational experiences were determined by the self-reported number of terms students indicated participating in the educational experience, indicating either zero terms, one term, two terms, three terms, or four or more terms. Curricular experiences included self-reported number of terms students participated in courses that included opportunities for intensive dialogue among peers with different backgrounds and beliefs; courses that included materials or readings on race and ethnicity issues; a 1st-year seminar with a multicultural emphasis; and courses that included service learning opportunities. Cocurricular experiences included self-reported number of terms students participated in undergraduate research with a faculty member; community service activities; leadership programs that stressed collaboration and teamwork; and internship programs. Community experiences included self-reported number of terms students participated in campus-organized discussions on diversity issues; events or activities sponsored by groups reflecting a cultural heritage different from their own; events or activities sponsored by groups reflecting their own cultural heritage; and religious or spiritual activities.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1028315311426783">
<title>Developmental and Climate Variables</title>
<p>The developmental variables represented the three dimensions of self-authorship with each dimension of self-authorship—cognitive, intrapersonal, and interpersonal—having two scales (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1028315311426783">Table 2</xref> for item wording, factor loadings, and scale reliabilities). The GPI survey items all load significantly on their proposed factors (<italic>t</italic>-ratios above 3.92, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Reliabilities were moderately high with Cronbach’s alphas for the Knowledge (α = .710), Epistemology (α = .687), Affect (α = .724), Identity (α = .690), Social Interaction (α = .700), and Social Responsibility (α = .709) scales, respectively. Correlations between factors were moderate (.461-.626), which suggests the factors are related, but distinctly defined. In addition, an overall index score was calculated using the average of the six scales.</p>

<title>Limitations</title>
<p>This section identifies three limitations of the current study and how each was addressed. First, the GPI relies on student self-reported data associated with their own learning and development. The credibility of such data is dependent on the capacity of the students responding to the survey to indicate their authentic responses to each item. Students taking the GPI do not have reason to present themselves in a positive light because the GPI is not a selection instrument. Researchers constructed a list of several hundred items and eliminated any items where students might feel compelled to respond in a socially desirable manner.</p>
<p>Second, although students self-identified as either international or domestic students, no items in the GPI measured other possible sources of variation within international student subgroups. For example, the GPI does not include an item about how long the international student has been in the United States, an item where students indicate their country of origin, or an item where students identify reasons they chose to attend an American college or university. The GPI is currently being revised to include these items.</p>
<p>Third, the current study does not purport to be an extensive study of all the possible types of educational experiences that are positively associated with international students’ learning and development; rather, it focuses on the association of 12 specific educational experiences with dimensions of intercultural maturity within the self-authorship framework. Nonetheless, the results of this study can be used to identify areas for higher education researchers and campus leaders to consider when evaluating the types of educational experiences most closely associated with learning, development, and perception of campus climate for international students.</p>
<p>Finally, the GPI survey instrument was constructed within the particular sociocultural context of the United States. Due to role of language in the construction and interpretation of any survey item, the use of the GPI in contexts outside of the United States is limited. If researchers extended this analysis to other cultural contexts, it is recommended that they use factor analysis to identify survey items that use context-specific language mapped to each of the three dimensions of self-authorship.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Research questions were answered by conducting a stepwise multiple regression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1028315311426783">Agresti &amp; Finlay, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1028315311426783">Ott &amp; Longnecker, 2001</xref>). The dependent variables for all regressions were the overall index, including the six developmental scales (i.e., Knowledge, Epistemology, Affect, Identity, Social Interaction, and Social Responsibility) as well the Campus Climate Scale. For gender and ethnicity interactions, the between-subject test was not significant, Wilks’s Lambda = .933, <italic>F</italic>(7, 14) = 2132.000, <italic>p</italic> = .850, and therefore conditional effects of gender and ethnicity are reported separately. Results are reported below for each of the three types of educational experiences (i.e., curricular, cocurricular, and community) with each section following the order: overall international student results for all six developmental scales followed by international student subgroup conditional effects for the overall scale (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1028315311426783">Tables 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1028315311426783">4</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results from this study add to a growing body of research on the educational experiences associated with international undergraduates’ learning, development, and perception of campus climate. Findings from this study compliment and extend prior work concerning educational experiences that promote self-authorship (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1028315311426783">King et al., 2009</xref>; Magolda &amp; King, 2004; Meszaros, 2007) and self-authorship across cultures (Magolda et al., 2010).</p>
<p>Theorists in college student development have recognized the importance of designing learning environments that both challenge and support students in moving to higher levels of cognitive, intrapersonal, and interpersonal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1028315311426783">Pascarella &amp; Terenzini, 2005</xref>). Learning environments that combine both challenge and support intentionally structure and sequence educational experiences to assist undergraduates in adapting to the challenges they encounter in college. The findings of the current study both compliment and extend this work by identifying specific educational experiences that provide both support and challenge for international students in particular. Specifically, the educational experiences that provided support in this study included access to activities sponsored by the students’ own culture, classroom contexts where faculty facilitated intergroup dialogue among students, and collaborative work in cocurricular leadership programs. The educational experiences that provided challenge in this particular study included coursework that involved active engagement with readings on race and ethnicity, community service, leadership programs, campus-sponsored diversity discussions, and engagement with students from diverse cultural backgrounds (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1028315311426783">Table 5</xref>). Although notable variation occurred among international student subgroups, this study is careful not to make broad claims that might suggest or imply essentialist tendencies for particular subgroups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1028315311426783">Gjerde, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1028315311426783">Wainryb, 2004</xref>). Rather, this variation suggests that further qualitative analysis is necessary to illuminate the qualities and characteristics of educational experiences that are positively associated with learning and development for various international student populations.</p>

<p>With the increasing enrollment of international students in American colleges and universities, there has been a growing interest in exploring the factors that influence perceptions of positive campus climate for incoming international students. Many international students experience extreme challenges without adequate support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1028315311426783">Moores &amp; Popadiuk, 2011</xref>). Researchers have highlighted the need to create positive campus conditions that support international student adjustment to academic and social demands of college life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1028315311426783">Schweitzer, Morson, &amp; Mather, 2011</xref>). International students face many demands, including navigating different social and cultural norms, language difficulties, building friendships, and challenges associated with distance between their home cultures and their host culture (Mori, 2000). This study provides evidence of the types of educational experiences that may help international students negotiate these transitions successfully. The current study suggests three particular experiences that are associated with creating positive campus environment for international students: courses where faculty facilitate intergroup dialogue among students, leadership programs, and the availability of activities sponsored by the international student’s home culture (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1028315311426783">Table 5</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section18-1028315311426783">
<title>Curricular</title>
<p>This study underscores the fact that international student experiences in the classroom matter. Just because a student attends a foreign institution does not mean he or she necessarily has a meaningful international experience. It is not enough to simply assume meaningful cross-group dialogue that occurs because the demographic makeup of the student body is more diverse. Courses where international students engage content related to cultural and ethnic diversity foster development across the cognitive, intrapersonal, and interpersonal dimensions of self-authorship. Existing research on self-authorship across cultures suggests intrapersonal development may stimulate cognitive and interpersonal development in the context of structured opportunities to reflect on and discuss issues of identity, ethnicity, and culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1028315311426783">Torres, 2003</xref>). Such courses need not be limited to general education requirements. For example, an advanced-level course in business management might integrate diversity-related topics to prepare students to enter into the global business environment.</p>
<p>The current study suggests that structuring dialogue into purposeful curricular experiences is necessary, particularly in terms of creating a positive campus climate for international students. Surprisingly, intergroup dialogue courses were positively associated with only one of the six developmental scales for international students overall and only for the male, European/White, and multiracial international student subgroups. Research on domestic students suggest that European/White males who participate in intergroup dialogue courses are less likely to subscribe to dominant perspectives, even years after the course (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1028315311426783">Gurin, Peng, Lopez, &amp; Nagda, 1999</xref>). Intergroup dialogue courses contribute to reversing attitudes and behaviors from being socialized in a larger societal context of racial or ethnic inequality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1028315311426783">Zúñiga et al., 2007</xref>). One possible explanation of the current study’s findings is that the male and European/White international student subgroups may have been especially affected by the experience of intergroup dialogue. Conversely, the multiracial international student subgroup may have benefited from an educational context purposefully designed to promote interactions that acknowledge the social construction of identity. Given the variation across international student subgroups, the contribution of intergroup dialogue courses to international students’ learning and development is one area in need of additional research.</p>
<p>The analysis provides no evidence that 1st-year seminars, service learning courses, internships, or undergraduate research opportunities are especially positive educational experiences for international students. Contrary to expectations, none of these experiences were positively associated with any of the dimensions of self-authorship, positive perceptions of campus climate, or the overall index for any of the international student subgroups. The negative association of internships with learning and development for the female and African/Black international student subgroups was a particularly troubling finding. As the educational quality of such experiences varies depending on how well they are designed, more research is necessary. Most research on these educational experiences comes from studies of domestic undergraduates at American higher education institutions, and thus researchers might consider studies specifically designed to examine the qualities of these experiences that support learning and development for international students in particular.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1028315311426783">
<title>Cocurricular</title>
<p>The findings of the current study support research that links international student adjustment with social interaction with students from other cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1028315311426783">Kashima &amp; Loh, 2006</xref>). In addition to the generally positive effects of social interaction through courses with materials on race and ethnicity, this analysis provides evidence that leadership programs and community service activities contribute to learning and development, albeit affecting different dimensions of self-authorship. Although community service activities facilitated intrapersonal and interpersonal development as expected, leadership programs were much more strongly associated with cognitive development than originally hypothesized. Cocurricular leadership programs contributed to greater cultural understanding and epistemological development with comparable effect sizes to courses where students purposefully engage materials on ethnic diversity. Scholars examining self-authorship across culture have specifically cited the need to better understand how different experiences affect progression along the different dimensions of self-authorship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1028315311426783">King, 2010</xref>). In this study, cross-group social interaction, whether formally structured in a course or through leadership programs involving collaboration and teamwork, facilitated progression across all three dimensions of self-authorship and across international student subgroups.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-1028315311426783">
<title>Community</title>
<p>Although international students already perceive themselves as participating in a different culture by nature of their enrollment at an American college or university, deliberate engagement with other cultures was associated with development along all three dimensions of self-authorship. Engaging in activities reflecting a cultural heritage different than one’s own increased international students’ comfort in relating to others and awareness of their strengths, values, and personal characteristics. International students who attended campus discussions on diversity issues exhibited more sophisticated knowledge of other cultures and a sense of personal identity development. At the same time, engaging in activities reflecting one’s own cultural heritage was strongly associated with perceptions of a supportive campus climate. A balance of social interactions with peers from similar and different cultural backgrounds is important.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>With the dramatic rise of international student enrollments, it is imperative for higher education institutions to carefully consider where to invest limited resources to provide meaningful social and academic experiences for incoming international students. The findings from this national study offer practical guidance to campus educators and leaders as they design learning environments to support international students’ cognitive, intrapersonal, and interpersonal development. The results suggest that international students who participate in leadership programs, interact with others from their own culture, and take courses where professors facilitate intergroup dialogue report more positive perceptions of campus climate. International students who participate in leadership programs, community service, campus-organized diversity discussions, interact with people from diverse cultural backgrounds, and take courses with materials on race and ethnicity report greater levels of learning and development.</p>
<p>The findings of this study may inform the programs, practices, and activities institutional leaders employ to support the international students arriving on their campuses. Although each educational experience has characteristics and qualities that distinguish it from the others, they are not mutually exclusive. It may be more appropriate to think of these educational experiences as multiple opportunities for social interaction that support learning and development for international students. The distinctions this study draws are useful for the purpose of helping institutional leaders be intentional in the choices of what programs to offer. At the same time, it highlights that multiple interactions that take place in multiple contexts, as a whole, contribute to international students’ learning and development. Multiple educational experiences weave together to support various dimensions of international students’ learning and development.</p>
