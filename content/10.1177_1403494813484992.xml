<p><italic>Background</italic>: Antonovsky’s idea of sense of coherence (SOC) is related to wellbeing and is of importance for individuals in public health care. SOC in parents with healthy children has not previously been studied. The objectives of this study were (1) to describe the SOC of first-time parents during the first 8 years of their child’s life, (2) to describe gender differences in regards to SOC, and (3) to describe covariates with SOC in the parents’ life situations. <italic>Methods</italic>: The study was longitudinal comprising three cross-sectional studies conducted when the first child was 6 months (T1), 4 years (T2), and 8 years (T3) of age. A sample of 258 mothers and fathers answered a questionnaire on the experienced quality of their partner relationship (QDR36) on all three occasions. SOC was measured using the SOC-13, and psychosocial variables were included at T2 and T3. Descriptive, comparative statistics and multiple regression analyses were performed. <italic>Results</italic>: SOC decreased for both genders at T2 and increased again at T3. At T1 and T2 the fathers’ SOC was statistically higher than that of the mothers, but at T3 this difference could no longer be statistically secured. Covariates at T2 were QDR index, social support, experience of parenthood, strained economy, and health. Covariates at T3 were experience of parenthood and social support, QDR index, and strained economy. <bold><italic>Conclusions</italic>: SOC in first-time parents decreased at 4 years, especially in mothers, and social support can be of significance for parents of young children to be able to experience health.</bold></p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Antonovsky [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494813484992">1</xref>] describes an individual’s sense of coherence (SOC) as being of importance when coping with stressors in life. The interrelated components of SOC are defined by Antonovsky as comprehensibility, manageability, and meaningfulness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494813484992">1</xref>]. SOC has the greatest chance of being affected during childhood and early adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1403494813484992">2</xref>]; however, SOC is also described as a continuously changing process throughout life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1403494813484992">3</xref>]. Antonovsky described SOC as relatively stable in adults, but he did not exclude the possibility that major changes in the life situation of the individual may change the SOC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494813484992">1</xref>]. Becoming a parent usually involves happiness and development, but it can also constitute a great strain on the individual and the partner relationship [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1403494813484992">4</xref>]. SOC in parents with healthy children over time has not yet been described, and therefore the present study provides valuable information.</p>
<p>A Finnish study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1403494813484992">5</xref>] investigated the confidence of parents in their parenting role 1 week after delivery and the results showed that mothers were more confident in their parenting role than fathers. Age, education, and civil status did not correlate with their experienced self-confidence, but parity did. This study showed that first-time mothers had lower confidence than multiparity mothers in their parenting role. Social support is of significance for first-time parents of young children. Covariates of their experienced marital quality were good communication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1403494813484992">4</xref>], experience of parenthood, and social support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494813484992">6</xref>].</p>
<p>A study of parents living in the Nordic countries related chronic illness in children to low SOC in parents without showing a difference between the sexes. Poor SOC was found to be more common in the lower social classes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494813484992">7</xref>].</p>
<p>SOC, socioeconomic conditions, and health were investigated in Swedes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1403494813484992">8</xref>]. Educational levels could not be related to SOC; however, occupations could, and it was found that a higher salary gave a higher SOC. In another Swedish sample of women aged between 40 and 50 years, psychosocial factors such as unemployment, lack of social support and social affiliation, or psychologically demanding work outside the home correlated more with low SOC than experiences from childhood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1403494813484992">9</xref>].</p>
<p>Stress deriving from strains in daily life, couple relationships, and private economy correlated most with SOC in a Canadian study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1403494813484992">10</xref>]. The results showed, in contrast with the Swedish study of women mentioned above [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1403494813484992">9</xref>], that traumatic life events from childhood were of greater significance than traumatic life events experienced as adults. Factors such as social support, relying on someone, and the feeling of being loved as adults decreased the effects of stress experienced in childhood. All kinds of social support had a positive effect on SOC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1403494813484992">10</xref>].</p>
<p>Low SOC has been associated with lack of social and emotional support, and also poor health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1403494813484992">11</xref>], and lower SOC implying more symptoms of ill health is also stated in one of the studies mentioned above [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1403494813484992">8</xref>]. Here psychological symptoms affected SOC more than physical ones, and were more strongly related for women. SOC over a 5-year period has been studied with regard to health, sickness, and psychosocial changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1403494813484992">12</xref>]. Generally, in this sample of men and women, SOC had also decreased among those with good health in contrast with other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1403494813484992">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1403494813484992">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1403494813484992">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1403494813484992">14</xref>], which all describe SOC increasing with age. Regarding gender differences, it is found that SOC varies with age and gender. Older men had a higher SOC than older women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1403494813484992">13</xref>]. Other studies mentioned above [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1403494813484992">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1403494813484992">14</xref>] also describe a significantly lower SOC in women than men.</p>
<p>Thus, age, gender, and experienced health and strains as well as social support are all factors which affect SOC. The ways in which parenthood affects SOC has not previously been studied, which is why this study is of particular interest. The objectives of the present study were: (1) to describe the SOC of first-time parents during the first 8 years of their child’s life, (2) to describe gender differences in regards to SOC and (3) to describe covariates with SOC in the parents’ life situations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1403494813484992" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>The study was longitudinal comprising three cross-sectional studies in parents when the first child was 6 months (T1), 4 years (T2), and 8 years (T3) of age.</p>
<sec id="section3-1403494813484992">
<title>Measurements</title>
<p>In this study, the validated version of SOC with 13 items was used (SOC-13). It is one unitary Likert scale, ranging from 1–7 points. The total range is 13–90 points, with a maximum of 35 points for comprehensibility (5 items) and 28 points for manageability and meaningfulness (four items each). A high score indicates a strong SOC. Antonovsky did not define any exact value for high, low, or normal SOC scores, but comparisons of SOC scores have been presented in other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1403494813484992">15</xref>]. A SOC score under 66 points has been defined as low in a study group of 589 Swedish men and women of age cohorts between 20 and 80 years of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1403494813484992">13</xref>].</p>
<p>Participants in the study also answered the quality of dyadic relationship (QDR36) with the following five dimensions: dyadic consensus (11 items), dyadic cohesion (4 items), dyadic satisfaction (11 items), dyadic sensuality (5 items), and dyadic sexuality (5 items). It has been developed in first-time parents and validated in different groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1403494813484992">16</xref>].</p>
<p>Psychosocial variables added in the questionnaire to complement QDR36 at T2 and T3 were: experience of household work, experience of parenthood and social support, experienced strains in relationships with child, economy, health, and work outside the home. They were considered also as covariates to SOC.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1403494813484992">
<title>Ethical concerns</title>
<p>This study was performed in the same manner at all three times of measurement. Participants were informed of guaranteed anonymity when they received the questionnaire. The local ethics committee of the medical faculty at the University of Gothenburg approved the study in 2002 (Ö 584-01).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1403494813484992">
<title>Participants and procedure</title>
<p>The inclusion criteria at all three times of measurement were the following: (1) first-time parents (the mother’s and the father’s first child together); (2) cohabiting parents (at the time of all three measurements); (3) Swedish speaking (to ensure comprehension of the questionnaire); and (4) healthy child (to avoid the extra strain caused by an ill child). At T1 there were 820 respondents (response rate 65%). The analysis unit of this longitudinal study was 258 responding mothers and fathers remaining at T3 (response rate 62%), i.e. those who answered all three questionnaires (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1403494813484992">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Procedure</title>
<p>The procedure for data collection was conducted as follows: at T1, primary care nurses at healthcare centres in the Gothenburg region, Sweden distributed the self-reporting questionnaires to the participants consecutively to all first-time parents with inclusion criteria during a period of spring and autumn in 2002 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1403494813484992">4</xref>] and at T2 and T3 the questionnaires were mailed by post to the participants’ homes. At T3 participants could also answer on the internet. Two reminders were sent at all three times of measurement.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1403494813484992">
<title>Non-respondents</title>
<p>Between T1 and T2 the non-respondents (40%) could be analysed. Comparisons of background variables between the respondents and the non-respondents at T2 were carried out. Among the non-respondents the education level was lower and there were more fathers than mothers. The SOC index at T1 did not differ significantly between the respondents and non-respondents at T2.</p>
<p>At T2, however, 20% of the 306 who did not respond (<italic>n</italic>=61) were living at different addresses, indicating that they were probably separated and therefore had a valid reason for not responding to the questionnaire. Separated parents were not to be included in further analysis.</p>
<p>At T3 there was a non-response rate of 38% and here 4% of the 159 non-respondents (<italic>n</italic>=7) were living at different addresses. The groups at T3 had no significant differences in SOC at T2, but they differed in regard to their economical situations (<italic>p</italic>=0.04). This was the only significant difference between the groups.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1403494813484992">
<title>Statistical analyses</title>
<p>To describe the parents’ SOC over time, one-way repeated measures ANOVA was computed and post hoc tests between T1 and T2, T2 and T3, and T1 and T3 were conducted. The Bonferroni method was applied to correct for multiple comparisons errors.</p>
<p>Differences between mothers and fathers in SOC were analysed using a t-test. Multiple regression analyses were performed to find covariates to SOC at 4 years and 8 years after the birth of the first child.</p>
<p>A high internal consistency of the SOC-13 was found at all three times of measurement. (T1: <italic>r</italic>=0.85, T2: <italic>r</italic>=0.87, T3: <italic>r</italic>=0.83). This was measured with Cronbach’s alpha coefficient.</p>

<p>The respondents which separated after 2006 showed significantly lower values of SOC compared with the respondents still living with their partners; 69.95, 60.71, and 62.86 compared with 69.95, 67.11, and 68.97.</p>
<p>Concerning the specific items, the parents cared more and more over time about what happened around them (item 1) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1403494813484992">Table II</xref>). On the other hand, the parents experienced an increasing disappointment from people close to them (item 3) and that daily activities gave less pleasure especially at T2 (item 7). Mixed-up feelings became more frequent over time (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05) and did not follow the U-curve as most other items did.</p>
<p>In regard to gender differences, the SOC of the fathers was higher than that of the mothers, and was statistically secured (T1: p=0.001 and T2: p=0.002, respectively). On the third occasion, T3, the SOC values between genders did not differ significantly (p=0.120) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1403494813484992">Table III</xref>).

<p>Gender differences in single items were found. The results showed that at T1 the mothers had more ambiguous feelings and thoughts (item 8) and a higher tendency to over/underestimate things (item 11) (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001). This remained the same at 4 years (T2), and over/underestimating things was more common in mothers also at T3. Feelings that cannot be controlled (item 13) were more common in mothers on all three occasions (p&gt;0.01), and having unwanted feelings (item 9) was also more common in mothers at T1 and T2. The mothers felt to a higher degree than the fathers that people around them had disappointed them (item 3) at T2 and they were also more surprised by the behaviour of people close to them (item 2) at T1 (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01). Finally, the situation described as Not caring about what goes on around you, (item 1), changed over time from mothers caring less than fathers at 6 months to caring more than them at 8 years (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01).</p>
<p>As the index of quality of dyadic relationship varied in the same way as SOC, resulting in a U-curve over time between T1 and T3, it was put into regression models together with psychosocial variables. Covariates of SOC at 4 years, explaining 45%, were the following: QDR index, social support, experience of parenthood, and strained economy and health (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1403494813484992">Table IV</xref>).</p>

<p>At 8 years after the birth of the first child, the covariates were: experience of parenthood, social support, QDR index, and strained economy; however, this model explained only 23%. A model with predictors at T2 for SOC at T3 explained only 17%, and the significant ones were strained health, strained economy, and experienced social support (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05)</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The mean values of the SOC index were approximately 70, 67, and 69 in the parents at T1, T2, and T3. These figures are comparable with another Scandinavian sample, where the participants, who were around 30 years of age, had a SOC mean of 70 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1403494813484992">13</xref>].</p>
<p>The decrease seen at T2 could be explained by the everyday challenges of parenting a 4-year-old and in 75% of the families a new baby was also demanding attention. This intensive period could be demanding and difficult, often at the expense of the relationship. Swedish statistics from 2008 show a rather high separation rate (17%) in parents of 4-year-old children and even higher (30%) when the first child is 8 years of age.</p>
<p>The significance of social support for parents of young children during this intensive period cannot be underestimated and it also correlated strongly with the parents’ SOC both at T2 and T3. This is supported by a study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1403494813484992">10</xref>] stating that all kinds of social support have a positive effect on SOC. All informal contact with relatives and friends are important forms of social support for parents. Practical help and babysitting are of great importance as they give partners the opportunity to experience some sensual and sexual cohesion.</p>
<p>Poor SOC was more common in the lower social classes according to some studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494813484992">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1403494813484992">9</xref>]. A strained economical situation was one covariate of SOC in the present study supporting this. Most studies have shown an increase of the SOC means as age increases. In the present sample SOC was higher again when the parents were 8 years older than when their baby was born, now at T3 being 38–40 years of age. The increase in their SOC probably depends on more than age. Parents are more used to parenthood and the children have become more autonomous, which could have made their life situations easier.</p>
<p>Becoming a parent is a major life event. SOC affects the effect of the life event on the individual. If SOC is high, the effect of the life event is experienced as milder and SOC scores remain stable, while for people with a low SOC, the life event may decrease the SOC further [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1403494813484992">17</xref>].</p>
<p>The results show that the fathers had higher SOC than the mothers on all three occasions. This is supported by studies showing that men on a group level had higher SOC than women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1403494813484992">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1403494813484992">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1403494813484992">14</xref>]. However, mothers were more self-confident than fathers 1 week after delivery, according to one study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1403494813484992">5</xref>]. In the present study the first measurement was made at 6 months after delivery, and it seems like first-time mothers needed several years to become comfortable in the parental role and still showed lower levels of SOC than the fathers. Single items, e.g. over/underestimating things and mixed-up feelings, indicate a strong emotional involvement in parenthood for mothers.</p>
<p>When it comes to other single items, the parents, in particular the mothers, experienced increasing disappointment in people close to them (item 3). Daily activities gave less pleasure especially at T2 (item 7). The daily activities of parents with young children were experienced as very tiring and this could impair the quality of the dyadic relationship [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494813484992">6</xref>] and the total wellbeing of the family. Relief in the form of social support is therefore needed, also in the form of professional support in parenthood to increase the manageability and total SOC score in parents. A balance of underload/overload could make life meaningful and satisfying at an individual, group (in this case parents), and society level as described in the model of Lindström and Eriksson [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1403494813484992">2</xref>]. A public health challenge is to promote health in parents and wellbeing in families at a society level.</p>
<sec id="section12-1403494813484992">
<title>Methodological considerations</title>
<p>Longitudinal studies often have high participation attrition, due to individuals being followed for a long period in life. In this case the period in which the study was conducted involved great changes as participants had all recently become parents, which is an intensive and demanding adjustment. This could explain why answering a questionnaire might not be given priority. That the questionnaire was personal and sensitive could also contribute to an unwillingness to answer it. According to Asch et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1403494813484992">18</xref>] the mean response rate was approximately 60% in mail surveys published in medical journals and Hager et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1403494813484992">19</xref>] reported a general mean response rate in mail surveys of 52%. The response rate in this study was at T1–T3 above the reported mean response rate.</p>
<p>The risk of selection bias is not great as the outcome variable SOC did not differ significantly between respondents and non-respondents at T2 and at T3. The separated couples were not included in further analysis as the inclusion criteria were adapted to measure the intimate relationship of parents living together. The results might have been different if there had been a higher response rate or other inclusion criteria. Considering how the non-respondents differed, these results can be generalised to parents, primarily in Scandinavia, living under similar circumstances, i.e. rather well-educated parents without serious economical problems who are living together.</p>
<p>In the study, the well-validated SOC-13 was used. It has been tested in many samples in different countries and cultures. Here it was tested by parents of young healthy children for the first time, and the reliability measured with Cronbach’s alpha was high. However, the validity for some items could be questioned on this sample of first-time parents (e.g. item 1, Not caring about what goes on around you). Low points can be very relevant 6 months after delivery, when it is perhaps natural for the parents to focus on the baby and each other rather than their surroundings. Having mixed-up and unwanted feelings (items 8 and 9) can be quite natural when there are some moments of happiness and other moments of strain and distress depending on the baby’s behaviour, the parent’s own personality, and social factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1403494813484992">20</xref>].</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section13-1403494813484992" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In this sample of parents, the SOC index varied significantly over time, with a decrease from when the first child was 6 months (T1) to 4 years of age (T2) and a further increase again at 8 years (T3) after the birth of the first child. Mothers had lower SOC than fathers, being defined as low at T2, but at 8 years (T3) this difference was no longer statistically secured. Covariates of SOC were experience of parenthood, social support, QDR index, and strained economy at both T2 and T3. Giving social support can be one way to facilitate everyday life in parents, helping them to keep a high sense of coherence and thus promoting health at individual, group, and society level. More research is needed when describing SOC and wellbeing in parents.</p>
