<title>Background</title>
<p>Gender identity disorder and the process of transitioning involve both mental and physical health, yet there is virtually no discussion of transgender health care in occupational therapy.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Purpose</title>
<p>This study draws on interviews with primary-care nurses and physicians about their experience with transgender health care, extending the insights gleaned there to make suggestions for occupational therapy practice with this population.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Method</title>
<p>Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 primary care nurses and 9 physicians who had clinical experience with lesbian, gay, and bisexual patients.</p></sec> 
<sec>
<title>Findings</title>
<p>Participants felt uncertain about transgender care, wanting more specialized knowledge. Collaborating with patients, acknowledging stigma, ensuring inclusive systems and procedures, navigating health care, and providing holistic care emerged as key elements for best practice. Advocacy was a crucial part of care provision.</p></sec> 
<sec>
<title>Implications</title>
<p>Suggestions are provided for therapists to ensure that space and interactions are welcoming to transgender clients as well as suggestions for occupational therapy intervention in the transitioning process.</p>

<title>Description</title>
<p>
Le trouble de l’identité de genre et le processus de transition affectent la santé mentale et physique et pourtant, il n’y a pratiquement aucune discussion portant sur la prestation de soins de santé aux transgenres en ergothérapie.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>But</title>
<p>Cet article est basé sur des entrevues effectuées auprès d’infirmières en soins de santé primaires et de médecins pour discuter de leur expérience face aux soins de santé offerts aux transgenres. À partir des réflexions recueillies lors des entrevues, les auteurs ont fait des suggestions en vue de promouvoir la pratique de l’ergothérapie auprès de cette population.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Méthodologie</title>
<p>
Des entrevues semi-structurées ont été effectuées auprès de 12 infirmières en soins de santé primaires et de 9 médecins ayant déjà travaillé en clinique avec des patients gais, lesbiennes ou bisexuels.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Résultats. </title>
<p>
Les participants éprouvaient des incertitudes face aux soins à prodiguer aux transgenres, et ils souhaitaient faire l’acquisition de connaissances spécialisées. Les éléments clés suivants ont été ciblés comme étant favorables à une pratique exemplaire : collaborer avec les patients, reconnaître les préjugés, veiller à ce que les systèmes et procédures soient favorables à l’intégration, savoir naviguer dans l’ensemble du système de santé et proposer des approches globales. La défense des intérêts représentait une composante déterminante de la prestation de soins.</p></sec>
<sec>
<title>Conséquences</title>
<p>
Parmi les suggestions proposées aux ergothérapeutes, citons celles de veiller à ce que les espaces et les interactions soient propices aux clients transgenres et d’offrir des interventions ergothérapiques pendant le processus de transition.</p>

<body>
<p>Gender identity disorder (GID), or gender dysphoria, is a psychiatric diagnosis that means there is significant mismatch between biological sex and the individual’s internal sense of his or her own gender. For example, someone who is born with male genitals and XY chromosomes yet has a deep knowledge of himself as a girl or woman may be diagnosed with GID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0008417413484450">World Professional Association for Transgender Health [WPATH], 2011</xref>). Individuals with GID often identify as transgender. Some transgender people accept the incongruence, seeing themselves as a kind of “other” gender, while others take steps toward harmonizing body and gender identity, a process called “transitioning.” Transitioning can involve dressing and grooming to alter gender appearance, taking hormones to alter one’s body, or concealing or surgically removing breasts and/or genitals. Transgender individuals may take any, all, or none of these steps.</p>
<p>GID is a mental health diagnosis, and transitioning can involve significant physical health interventions, yet there is almost no mention of transgender issues in the occupational therapy literature. Nonetheless, therapists in larger cities will most certainly work with transgender clients, and in smaller communities, they may do so unknowingly. This study begins to address that gap in occupational therapy literature, drawing on interviews with primary-care nurses and physicians who self-identified as working with lesbian/gay/bisexual/transgender/queer (LGBTQ) patients or clients about their experiences working with trans-patients. We extend that analysis to make suggestions for occupational therapy practice with transgender clients. While it would be extremely valuable to explore the frontline experiences of occupational therapists, as detailed below, this study is based on data drawn from a larger study that did not include occupational therapist participants.</p>

<title>Literature Review</title>
<sec id="section2-0008417413484450">
<title>Transgender persons and occupations</title>
<p>Research on occupational therapy with transgender persons is nonexistent. Yet there is growing awareness that transgender identity significantly affects occupations. In occupational science, a study with five transgender individuals found that they faced occupational deprivation, marginalization, and injustice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0008417413484450">Beagan et al., 2012</xref>). Social gender norms demanded that they engage only in gender-appropriate occupations. Particular occupations were avoided, or engaged in secretly, so as to convey convincing gender displays. Participants deliberately used occupations to convey gender, for example, choosing male-dominated employment to demonstrate masculinity. During and after transitioning, the same individual might use grooming, dressing, and self-care to convey femininity. Transitioning brought its own required occupations, such as navigating the health care system and managing relationships and identity disclosures. Transitioning brought both occupational gains and losses.</p>
<p>The study from occupational science builds on an emerging body of research in other disciplines with congruent messages. Studies have repeatedly shown that transgender status negatively affects productive occupations, such as employment and schooling (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0008417413484450">Doan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0008417413484450">McGuire, Anderson, Toomey, &amp; Russell, 2010</xref>). One large survey in San Francisco noted that discrimination prevents many trans-people from obtaining satisfactory employment; consequently, 80% of their sample had been involved in sex trade work or survival sex, that is, exchanging sex for food, shelter, or protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0008417413484450">Clements-Nolle, Marx, Guzman, &amp; Katz, 2001</xref>). In Canada, most trans-people live below the poverty line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0008417413484450">Bauer et al., 2010</xref>); one study undertaken in British Columbia with 10 trans-participants found 1 was a sex trade worker, while 9 were on income assistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0008417413484450">Schilder et al., 2001</xref>). Not surprisingly, transgender persons move to jobs where they feel safer, such as LGBTQ centres or help lines, the arts and music industries, or self-employment, or may even delay disclosure or transitioning until after retirement or job loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0008417413484450">Hines, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Occupations of dressing and grooming are significant means of projecting identity. For some, dressing in opposite-gender clothing (i.e., cross-dressing) may be a secret occupation, performed privately as an outlet for transgender identity. Others use clothing and grooming for public displays of gender identity or to disrupt or complicate societal gender assumptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0008417413484450">Connell, 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0008417413484450">Doan (2010</xref>) provides a moving account of her first trip to the mall as a woman: “In preparation for the excursion, I donned my favorite dress, put on two pair of hose to cover my not yet shaven legs and took extra care with my makeup (to cover evidence of my male beard)” (p. 645). Overdressed for the mall and with a body type unconventionally large for a woman, she did not pull off an entirely convincing display of femininity, drawing stares and whispers. When safety and acceptance are attached to convincing gender displays, dressing and grooming may become highly consequential occupations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0008417413484450">Connell, 2010</xref>). Before, during, and after transition, trans-people face potential harassment, violence, and sexual assault in public spaces, such as restrooms, elevators, and public streets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0008417413484450">Connell, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0008417413484450">Doan, 2010</xref>). In one survey in Philadelphia, more than half of the transgender respondents had been sexually or physically abused or assaulted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0008417413484450">Kenagy, 2005</xref>).</p>

<title>Transgender encounters with the health care system</title>
<p>When trans-people choose to transition, taking medical steps toward aligning their bodies with their felt gender requires significant engagement with the health care system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0008417413484450">Beagan et al., 2012</xref>). For example, they may require a family physician to refer to endocrinology for hormone prescriptions. If surgery is desired, the person must first undergo psychotherapy for an extended period of time. Multiple surgeries may be required, including possible facial reconstruction and vocal chord surgery. In preparation for medical interventions, transgender persons engage in extensive information seeking, researching health care providers around the world and the accounts of others who have transitioned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0008417413484450">Beagan et al., 2012</xref>). Trans-people routinely educate professionals about trans–health care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0008417413484450">Bauer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0008417413484450">Dewey, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite their educational efforts, trans-people often face inadequate and unpleasant health care encounters. They are frequently denied care when they present at hospitals or clinics (Bauer et al., 2009; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0008417413484450">Dewey, 2008</xref>). Health care providers often refer trans-patients elsewhere, assuming that another practitioner may be better equipped to address trans–health concerns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0008417413484450">Bauer et al., 2009</xref>). This referral may be interpreted by patients as unwillingness to access information that will adequately address their concerns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0008417413484450">Bauer et al., 2009</xref>). When care is provided, it is often marred by administrative processes that erase trans-existence. For example, hospital staff may not know which gender-segregated ward to put trans-patients in, health insurance requires patient names to match gender assigned at birth, getting prescriptions in the correct name is a constant struggle, and receptionists are often confused when gendered name and bodily presentation are at odds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0008417413484450">Bauer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0008417413484450">Dewey, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0008417413484450">Hussey, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0008417413484450">LGBT Health Program, 2009</xref>; Schilder et al., 2001). Health care workers frequently convey with tone of voice and nonverbal communication that trans-patients are perceived as oddities who disrupt business as usual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0008417413484450">Dewey, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0008417413484450">Hussey, 2006</xref>).</p>

<title>Health care encounters with transgender patients/clients</title>
<p>While occupational therapy has been largely silent on trans-care, other fields have begun tentative discussion. Overwhelmingly, the available literature focuses on the basics of care, definitions of transgender vocabulary, medical options for transitioning, and suggestions for trans-sensitive care provision (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0008417413484450">Burrows, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0008417413484450">Carroll, Gilroy, &amp; Ryan, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0008417413484450">Feldman &amp; Goldberg, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0008417413484450">Goldberg, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0008417413484450">Gooren, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0008417413484450">LGBT Health Program, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0008417413484450">Polly &amp; Nicole, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0008417413484450">Robinson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0008417413484450">Williams &amp; Freeman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0008417413484450">WPATH, 2011</xref>). Very few published articles approach the concerns or hesitations health professionals experience when working with trans-people.</p>
<p>Given that most health care providers receive little or no education concerning trans-health (American Psychological Association, Task Force on Gender Identity and Gender Variance, 2008; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0008417413484450">Sanchez, Rabatin, Sanchez, Hubbard, &amp; Kalet, 2006</xref>), they are left guessing at how to make their care strategies welcoming and competent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0008417413484450">Coren, Coren, Pagliaro, &amp; Weiss, 2011</xref>). Providers also struggle with the stigma attached to transgender status (“transphobia”), with their own fears and biases, and with concern about not fully grasping the complexities of trans-care. Not surprisingly, most providers do not discuss gender identity with patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0008417413484450">Kitts, 2010</xref>), and as many as 50% of trans-people do not voluntarily inform their family physicians that they are transgender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0008417413484450">Bockting, Robinson, Forberg, &amp; Scheltema, 2005</xref>). Obviously, this can impede quality health care provision.</p>
<sec id="section5-0008417413484450">
<title>Occupational therapy with transgender clients</title>
<p>Nicola <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0008417413484450">Jessop (1993</xref>) presented a clinical case report on a 22-year-old male-to-female (MTF) client she called “Miss M,” the only published account of occupational therapy with a trans-client. Jessop argues that occupational therapy can make significant contributions given the mandatory requirement that trans-people live successfully in their chosen gender for a lengthy period of time to qualify for surgery. Jessop worked with Miss M. to improve her ability to successfully present as a woman through focusing on occupations of self-care, particularly, skin care, makeup, hairstyling, and wardrobe choices. Miss M. also required guidance with gait related to walking in high heels. She identified goals of leaving her male-dominated field of work and improving skills in typically feminine domestic occupations (cooking, cleaning, laundry). As Miss M. expanded her social circle, the therapist raised awareness of safer sex practices. A referral was made to speech therapy to assist Miss M. with her ability to speak in a feminine manner through vocal modulation and practice expressing thoughts and feelings. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0008417413484450">Jessop (1993</xref>) concludes, “Occupational therapy has a major role to play in assisting new transsexuals to adjust to their chosen gender role” (p. 324).</p>
<p>The only other occupational therapy article addressing trans-care is an opinion piece about informed choice and client decision making, specifically concerning dressing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0008417413484450">Pope, Davys, &amp; Taylor, 2008</xref>). One of the clients described is a transgender MTF who was concerned about being stared at in public, yet wore—in the therapist’s opinion—too much makeup and inappropriate clothes. The authors describe the tension between remaining client-centred by supporting the client’s appearance choices and helping the client to understand the social, political, and cultural context in which women’s clothing and appearance convey complex messages about femininity and sexuality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0008417413484450">Pope et al., 2008</xref>). This is an important comment that hints at a potential role for occupational therapy in working with transgender clients to recognize and understand societal gender roles and expectations, including negative aspects, such as sexism.</p>
<p>This study extends the emerging discussion within occupational therapy about practice with transgender clients. We draw upon our qualitative interviews with primary-care nurses and physicians to explore their experiences with transgender care and extend the insights gleaned from these health care professionals to occupational therapy, examining recommendations concerning best practice and how to apply these to occupational therapy.</p>

<title>Research Design</title>
<p>This study is based on data from a larger qualitative study of health care for LGBTQ women, in which we sought to examine how routine practices perpetuate or transform marginalization within the health care system. This larger study drew on interpretive or hermeneutic phenomenology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0008417413484450">Moustakas, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0008417413484450">van Manen, 1997</xref>), in particular, queer phenomenology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0008417413484450">Ahmed, 2006</xref>), which retains the detailed explication of concrete experiences but incorporates specific attention to that which is relegated to background, those aspects of the social world that are unconscious because they are deemed irrelevant or impossible or have never been noticed. In addition to interviews with LGBTQ women (<italic>n</italic> = 19), that study included in-depth, face-to-face interviews with family physicians (<italic>n</italic> = 9) and registered nurses (<italic>n</italic> = 12) in Halifax, Nova Scotia, who self-identified as having any work experience with lesbian/gay/bisexual/queer (LGBQ) patients.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0008417413484450">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Following research ethics approval from Dalhousie University, purposive and snowball sampling were used to recruit participants through advertisements, posters, letters to clinics, and word of mouth. Among the 12 nurse participants, 11 identified as women and 1 as a man. Each had bachelor’s or master’s training and had practiced for 10 to 30 years in various settings. Eight of the physician participants identified as women and one as a man. They worked in clinics and private practice and had practiced for 10 to 40 years. None of the participants identified as transgender.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0008417413484450">
<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>After receiving informed consent, in-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted with participants by the first author and three research assistants. Interview questions asked participants to describe how they experienced primary health care practice with LGBTQ women. Interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Field notes were recorded by the interviewers directly into the audio file. Pseudonyms were assigned to each participant. In this article, individuals are identified by pseudonym and profession.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0008417413484450">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>For the current article, to attend specifically to how participants experienced working with transgender patients, we reviewed the 21 participant transcripts and field notes again in full. Transcripts were coded thematically, using an iterative process that moved back and forth among transcripts, comparing and contrasting as well as looking closely at outlying cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0008417413484450">Boyatzis, 1998</xref>). Identified themes and subthemes were coded by a team of researchers using AtlasTi software (Version 6.0). Coded segments were interpreted both in the context of the larger interview and in comparison with the other transcripts. To enhance rigour and trustworthiness, initial coding of all data was begun only after the research team thoroughly discussed several interview transcripts. A code list was developed by consensus and was open to revision throughout the study. Each transcript was then coded by an individual team member with weekly discussions to ensure consistent interpretation of data and coding. At several points, five or more team members coded the same transcript to check for consistency. Differences in coding were thoroughly discussed until consensus was reached.</p>

<title>Findings</title>
<p>Despite their experience with LGBQ patients, six nurses and two physicians had no experience of knowingly working with transgender patients. Three nurses and four physicians had worked with a limited number of trans-patients, while three nurses and three physicians had considerable trans-patient populations. Not everyone who works with gay, lesbian, or bisexual patients also works with transgender patients. Here we examined participants’ experiences working with transgender patients. Below, we discuss the results of our analyses in four main themes: lack of knowledge, learning about transgender care, elements of quality care in trans-health, and advocacy.</p>
<sec id="section12-0008417413484450">
<title>Lack of Knowledge</title>
<p>Except for two nurses with extensive experience with trans-patients, participants routinely expressed concern about lacking knowledge to provide quality care. Even when they were comfortable with LGBQ care, working with trans-patients specifically raised uncertainties. For example, one person who worked with many LGBTQ patients said, “It’s the transgender that makes me uncomfortable” (Bruce, physician), which he explained was due to his lack of knowledge. Similarly, a nurse said, “Gay is one thing. Okay, that’s fine. That’s just who you have sex with. But, trans? Like, what does that even mean? I don’t know what that anatomy is supposed to even look like. I have no idea” (Kathy, nurse). Lia’s first trans-patient highlighted a range of uncertainties:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Policies, procedures, surgeries, how does it all work? No idea. We’re working through this together. What’s covered health care–wise, what isn’t? How do you handle this in the work context? When do you change your ID card to say you’re male? Which washroom do you use? I hadn’t had the opportunity to think about the full process before, ’cause I had never come across it. (Lia, nurse)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Several nurses specifically mentioned their uncertainty concerning the use of gendered pronouns: “You always are trying to be aware of what you say, and what you’re doing. But, you’re not always 100%” (Faith, nurse). Faith found it particularly challenging when the body she was treating did not align with the patient’s gender identity, such as changing post-mastectomy dressings on someone who identifies as a man.</p>
<p>For most of the physicians, unfamiliarity with the medical care required for trans-patients was particularly daunting. As Debbie (physician) said, “I’m not prepared to give hormones first of all because I don’t know enough about them.” This was particularly challenging given that physicians play a gate-keeping role concerning patient access to other health care services and medications. Some felt considerable responsibility for decisions that have significant and permanent implications. For example, Bruce (physician) felt inadequately prepared to assess someone’s candidacy for sex-realignment surgery.</p>
<p>Shannon (nurse) noted that health professionals are often uncomfortable with not knowing what to do, and this uncertainty may be read by patients as judgment or resistance: “Sometimes, some of the resistance that you will read nonverbally from a practitioner is from, ‘Oh my God, I have no idea what to say or do.’” Liza (physician) summarized the current state of knowledge among most family physicians concerning trans-health: “You have to hustle to learn, you really have to want to learn.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0008417413484450">
<title>Learning About Transgender Care</title>
<p>Most participants accepted their lack of knowledge and set about reading and researching about trans-health, seeing the seeking of information as current best practice. As Kira (nurse) said, “Okay, I don’t know everything. But I know I can go and look for the resources. And I’m very good at that.” Lia (nurse) spoke of the learning process as collaboration with her client: “I had to do research. It didn’t make me feel incompetent. It was almost empowering, like let’s see what we can do with this, if you want to, I’ll work with you.” Another participant described her role when she encountered unfamiliar territory with trans-patients as doing “the legwork”:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>When I don’t know something, the person in the chair across from me is the expert in it. That’s the bottom line. I do the legwork that I can, and find out as much as I can. And then I give them that information. (Shannon, nurse)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Many participants spoke about learning from patients. One nurse had learned simply from observing and participating in a patient’s step-by-step transition process. While this was extremely helpful for the nurse, it is not clear how helpful it was for her patient. As one physician warned, trans-people may be bothered by providers’ lack of knowledge and the need to always be experts on their own care: “They can be frustrated. This guy was always frustrated with me ’cause [my lack of knowledge] was a total inconvenience” (Liza, physician).</p>
<p>Some participants had learned about trans-health from more personal sources, such as family members and friends. The advantage was that they learned as much about the lived transgender experience as they did about health care. Several participants had attended a recent local conference on trans-care, and many had learned through professional networks that included more experienced colleagues popular with trans-patients. Most participants knew the names of the four to five local health professionals who work extensively with the trans-community and turned to them for information. Participants also sought information from networks across Canada, especially in Vancouver and Toronto, often being directed there by patients.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0008417413484450">
<title>Elements of Quality Care in Trans-Health</title>
<p>A number of subthemes emerged as constituting quality care for trans-patients: collaborating, acknowledging stigma, inclusive systems and procedures, navigating health care, and holistic care. A key element was <italic>collaborating with patients</italic>, given that patients often knew more about trans-health than did their providers. On this subject, Kira (nurse) said, “In most situations, I would say ‘Let’s go look for [information] together.’” Practitioners typically brought information to patients for collaborative decision making. One physician had learned to book double-length appointments with trans-patients to give her adequate time to discuss options. A nurse who specialized in hormone injections focused on teaching patients to self-administer hormone injections to enhance autonomy and avoid work disruptions. Through collaboration, she aimed to maximize client self-management.</p>
<p>Participants emphasized the importance of <italic>acknowledging the stigma</italic>, the marginalization and oppression transgender persons typically face, and the provision of nonjudgmental care. They explicitly recognized that trans-patients may encounter health professionals who are not “trans-friendly” or even tolerant. Gerry (nurse) described “equal care” as “where there’s safety and where LGBT don’t have to be in the closet, if they don’t want to be. But they can be themselves.” Recognizing transphobia, she went on to say, “There’s all kind of inequities, isn’t there?” Liza (physician) spoke of patients coming in with “their torn-ness.”</p>
<p>Many participants discussed the importance of <italic>ensuring systems and procedures were not exclusionary</italic>, specifically regarding the information obtained and language used on intake forms. One clinic had expanded the gender options beyond male/female, adding a choice for “other.” A nurse from that clinic noted that this still implied marginalization, as in something other than what is expected or “normal.” Another clinic offered male, female, and transgender as options. A physician who thought the intake forms at her practice were still traditional and exclusionary talked through the forms with patients, allowing her to express things verbally in less exclusionary ways. Liza (physician) asked all patients about sexual orientation by routinely inquiring about sexual relations with men, women, or both yet recognized that this excludes trans-patients who may identify as both or neither: “There is a male/female bias in that. And I can’t quite wrap my head around how not to do that, to make it more trans-positive.” One participant detailed the complexity of name use:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>The fear of identification in going to the lab, and staff call out their name, and when they walk up to the desk staff go, “No, I called out a woman’s name,” and they fear that someone in that room has just heard that. (Carole, nurse)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>For patients still in transition, one physician used an individual’s legal name for health insurance billing, but office forms allowed a “preferred” name to be used everywhere else.</p>
<p>Participants also reflected on <italic>navigating the health care system</italic> to optimize care for trans-patients. For some, this meant reporting their billing in particular ways to ensure patients were covered. Given that patients need a diagnosis of GID before any medical transitioning can begin, both nurses and physicians helped trans-patients find mental health professionals skilled in assessment. One participant described using the assessment to help patients access services yet conveyed to individuals that it was a bureaucratic requirement rather than misgiving about their mental health: “We have to refer you to psychiatry, you know there’s nothing wrong with you, mental health–wise, but we have to have the official diagnosis” (Lia, nurse).</p>
<p>The most consistently identified element of quality trans-care was <italic>providing holistic care</italic>, which involved recognizing that transitioning and transphobia can affect someone’s well-being broadly, including employment, housing, family, and leisure. As one participant said, “Just going through the whole transformation I think in itself causes all sorts of social and psychological challenges” (Fiona, physician). Participants (both doctors and nurses) spoke about working with patients on issues related to workplace disclosures, navigating strained family dynamics, coping with stress from harassment and stigma, navigating safety in sexual relations and everyday life, and even suggesting travel destinations where trans-people may be least at risk. Sometimes holistic care meant connecting with other health and social service professionals. Often it meant listening well and building relationships. Jeannette (nurse) described her approach with one of her first trans-patients:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>She was male to female and was being beaten up every day as soon as she stepped foot outside her house. Was living on social assistance, but just couldn’t afford so much of what she needed. Didn’t know how to access health care, so was getting one of her friends to get her birth control pills as her estrogen source, but it’s not the proper estrogen. Couldn’t get employment, because she wanted to work as a female, but every place she’d go, they just wanted to pigeonhole her into, “Well, no, you’re a guy.”</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Jeannette’s nursing role was unusual in that her job positioned her specifically to work with LGBTQ patients in community. She worked with this woman to find safer housing and connected her with an agency that finds supportive work situations for persons with mental illness, arguing that she might as well take advantage of her GID diagnosis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0008417413484450">
<title>Advocacy</title>
<p>Though clearly a component of quality care, advocacy stood out as a critical part of best practice, a theme on its own. Advocacy for trans-patients routinely involved screening specialists before making referrals, ensuring that providers were trans-positive (or at least did not have a reputation for overt intolerance). As Jeannette (nurse) said, “There’s still some doctors out there that aren’t queer-/trans-friendly.” Advocacy also meant assistance to secure health care coverage. Lia (nurse), who worked for a major employer, fought for funding approval for a trans-patient each step of the way: “I actually got approval from [the employer] to pay for top surgery. We were really quite pleased. We said this is medically necessary surgery, this is not cosmetic surgery.” Given the exorbitant cost of surgeries, and the absence of clearly outlined coverage policies from insurers, such advocacy is often crucial.</p>
<p>A few participants spoke about advocacy in terms of educating others in their practice setting. For example, when Anna (nurse) had an appointment with a trans-woman at the women’s hospital, she did her best to smooth the way: “I actually went to admitting and told them this person is coming to the women’s clinic, they’re male but just, it’s all cool, let them in.” She also spoke with the clinic staff, hoping they would not do or say anything to offend. Anna was very aware that even coming to a women’s hospital was a challenge, because by definition, the space was already gendered in a binary way, and she wanted to help the patient avoid any hostile, shocked, or confused reactions.</p>
<p>Two of the physicians used their authority to reduce negative staff reactions to trans-patients. When interviewing staff for clinic positions, Jennifer (physician) made sure she asked about their comfort with LGBTQ patients. She also worked to educate staff: “We make it clear about pronouns, which name to use, and things like that.” Alice (physician) addressed and educated staff if an incident arose where a trans-patient was treated disrespectfully: “I do approach the topic immediately you know. I do that because I feel my patients should be treated well from the front staff.” This type of advocacy is critical because poor treatment is often more about ignorance than intolerance, yet regardless of origin, it is hurtful to patients and may add to an already significant burden of exclusion, marginalization, and ill treatment experienced by trans-people in health care.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>While we were not able to conduct interviews with occupational therapists for this study, which is a limitation, it became evident from the analysis of our interviews with primary care nurses and physicians that the findings offer valuable insights for occupational therapists, particularly as some of these participants were clearly engaged in enabling occupation. All of these professions share similar ethical commitments to patient- or client-centred care, justice, and equitable care. All have the potential to engage with clients or patients in ways that exceed the narrow limits of biomedical reductionism.</p>
<p>Among our participants, fears about inadequate knowledge to provide quality health care loomed large. Participants emphasized their openness to learn from patients, colleagues, experts, and literature and their willingness to seek out information for patients. Our other interviews with LGBTQ patients, and other studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0008417413484450">Bauer et al., 2009</xref>), suggest that patients appreciate health professionals who acknowledge when they simply do not know something and are willing to learn, while at the same time, patients become frustrated with always having to educate health professionals.</p>
<p>According to our study participants, quality care for transgender patients involves collaborating with the patient, understanding their experienced social stigma and exclusion, a willingness to challenge exclusionary processes, engagement in holistic care that recognizes how marginalization affects health, and advocacy for patients well beyond finding appropriate referrals. It is likely that occupational therapists would encounter similar challenges and strive to implement quality practice in similar ways to those described by our sample. The identified key elements of care fit well with the Canadian Model of Client-centred Enablement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0008417413484450">Townsend, Polatajko, Craik, &amp; Davis, 2007</xref>), particularly with its emphasis on client-centred enablement through advocacy, collaboration, and engagement within a framework of person, environment, and occupation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0008417413484450">Polatajko et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0008417413484450">Townsend, Beagan, et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Occupational therapists may encounter transgender clients in two distinct contexts: (a) individuals referred to occupational therapy for occupational performance issues unrelated to the fact that the client is transgender or (b) individuals referred for occupational performance issues concerning transitioning. While in the latter instance, therapists would need to assess performance issues and enable occupations connected to transition specifically, in all instances, it would be important to create an inclusive, trans-positive environment during client-therapist interactions.</p>
<sec id="section17-0008417413484450">
<title>Creating Trans-Positive Environments and Interactions</title>
<p>Our participants understood quality care for trans-patients as addressing stigma, ensuring inclusive systems, helping people navigate bureaucracies, and practicing collaboratively and holistically. Their understandings of best practices, supported by published recommendations for creating trans-positive health care environments (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0008417413484450">Bauer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0008417413484450">Coren et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0008417413484450">Feldman &amp; Goldberg, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0008417413484450">Polly &amp; Nicole, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0008417413484450">Robinson, 2010</xref>; WPATH, 2011), can be extrapolated and applied to occupational therapy settings. To enhance trans-positive care, therapists should ensure that intake forms and pronoun use in clinical settings respect client self-identity, client wishes are respected concerning team communication and occupational performance, and clinical settings are welcoming for clients of any gender identity. More detailed suggestions are provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0008417413484450">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

</fig>
<p>Trans-positive interactions are enhanced by what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0008417413484450">Goldberg (2006</xref>) identifies as core competencies of sensitivity and awareness: “Understanding and awareness of transgenderism, [ability] to respond appropriately if patient discloses transgender identity. [Ability] to provide referrals” (p. 221). Therapists and other clinic staff should be educated regarding transgender issues. In particular, they should be aware of differences between sex, gender, and sexual orientation; be familiar with the range of diverse gender identities and gender expressions; be accustomed to transgender vocabulary; and acknowledge the authenticity of transgender identity and lived experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0008417413484450">Feldman &amp; Goldberg, 2006</xref>). Taking responsibility for initiating discussions of trans-issues is valuable, given this is uncharted territory for many health professionals. Ideally, clinic staff will express attitudes that are respectful, accepting, validating, and affirming. As is expected of any occupational therapy interaction, therapist and client should collaboratively identify goals and plans.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0008417413484450">
<title>Occupational Performance Issues of Transitioning</title>
<p>The most common concern raised by participants was lack of knowledge, particularly about aspects of care when clients are transitioning. Interestingly, the approach to care described by participants is exactly what occupational therapists are accustomed to providing: addressing mental health and physical health; discussing leisure, safety, housing, financial supports, self-care, and employment; and understanding the institutional, cultural, and societal constructs and policies that may have an impact. Occupational therapy’s focus on the whole spectrum of person, environment, and occupation can significantly benefit trans-clients in occupations required for transitioning.</p>
<p>It was widely perceived among participants that transgender care requires specialized knowledge. While this may be accurate for some physicians who are prescribing and monitoring hormones, for most of the primary care providers in our study, best practice for trans-patients means extending best practice as usual. Given our results, it is important for occupational therapists to realize that quality care for clients who are transitioning is not “specialized” practice, as it employs elements consistent with all occupation-based quality care. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0008417413484450">Table 1</xref> outlines some anticipated areas of focus based on the interviews with nurses and physicians, supported by existing literature. We want to emphasize that these elements of occupation-based enablement could fit with almost any area of occupational therapy practice.</p>

<p>Adequate gender presentation—presenting as indisputably masculine or feminine—will be at the centre of many transgender occupational issues. Gender performance is learned behaviour and can be taught (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0008417413484450">West &amp; Zimmerman, 1987</xref>). In many ways, gender transitioning involves occupational transitions. Occupational therapists are particularly skilled at breaking performance down into components amenable to intervention (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0008417413484450">Polatajko, Mandich, &amp; Martini, 2000</xref>). In contrast to typical occupational therapy interventions, clients are not relearning or adapting occupations. They are learning gendered occupations that may not have been taught to them before (although some self-taught trans-persons may have been performing them for considerable time). Recall that in her work with Miss M., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0008417413484450">Jessop (1993</xref>) focused on clothes shopping, dressing, skin care, makeup, laundry, cooking, and sexual practices to enhance gender display. Therapists should be sensitive to the possibility that trans-clients face difficult relationships with their own bodies, having spent years in bodies that do not match their gender identity.</p>
<p>Work-related occupational issues are also a likely focus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0008417413484450">Beagan et al., 2012</xref>). Several of the current participants had advocated for patients around employment. Trans-clients may need support concerning opportunities for employment, employment insurance applications, employability self-assessment, developing skills for gendered work, career exploration and decision making, job searching, and résumé writing to manage gender transition. Many trans-clients will need support concerning how to disclose their gender identity at work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0008417413484450">Beagan et al., 2012</xref>). Occupational therapy expertise in mental health and vocational rehabilitation may be great assets for trans-clients in these areas of transition.</p>
<p>Our participants noted that many trans-people face family ruptures and lose social networks once they begin transitioning, resulting in considerable isolation (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0008417413484450">Beagan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0008417413484450">Williams &amp; Freeman, 2007</xref>). Some of our participants helped transgender clients connect with new social networks, a potential role for occupational therapists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0008417413484450">Carroll et al., 2002</xref>). Involvement in LGBTQ communities may be an effective approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0008417413484450">Jessop, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, our participants suggested that advocacy is crucial to quality care with trans-people—a key enablement skill in the Canadian Model of Client-centred Enablement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0008417413484450">Townsend, Polatajko, et al., 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0008417413484450">Holman and Goldberg (2006</xref>) warn that health professionals should always contact any referrals in advance to screen for trans-sensitivity and educate where needed. They note that advocacy may be needed with schools and workplaces to address discrimination, bullying, and harassment; with private or public health insurance for coverage of particular procedures; with government agencies concerning legal identification; with residential services and social assistance concerning appropriate and safe housing; and with residential facilities, such as prisons and long-term care facilities, concerning safety and access to washrooms. This is particularly pertinent for occupational therapy due to the profession’s widespread engagement in communities, homes, worksites, and care, forensic, and educational facilities.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This study is a preliminary step in addressing how occupational therapy might effectively engage with transgender clients. Drawing on literature from other professions and interviews with primary care nurses and physicians, we have outlined some of the challenges faced as well as elements of quality care for trans-people. Occupational therapy’s commitment to social justice and equity should compel us as a profession toward increased understanding of this underserved and marginalized population. It is encouraging to note that many identified elements of quality care correspond with core competencies of occupational enablement as well as with the broad scope of practice, and more specifically, occupation-based practice, of the occupational therapy profession. Unquestionably, more occupational therapy–specific research is needed to help ensure that the transgender community can access appropriate, safe, and competent care. Meanwhile, it is noteworthy that making small changes based on the findings of this study can make a significant difference to the safety and dignity of clients.</p>
