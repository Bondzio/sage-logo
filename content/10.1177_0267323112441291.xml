<p>This is the second edition of Gerstlé’s work, originally published in 2004 under the same title. It is largely the same in form and content, but updated to include discussions of the 2007 French presidential election and use of the Internet.</p>
<p>The book is divided into two parts, the first essentially theoretical and the second consisting of analyses of electoral campaigns and political communication in non- electoral periods. However, the separation of theory and practice is not as sharp as this structure suggests: discussion of theories of political communication is illustrated with examples, and the second part applies the analytical tools explored to specific case studies. Indeed, a central characteristic of Gerstlé’s approach is to view political communication as perennial and ubiquitous, intrinsic to politics and an integral part of strategic positioning – and not as mere form or embellishment.</p>
<p>To argue this point, the first part of the book considers what Gerstlé refers to as four competing conceptions of political communication. The first of these he calls ‘instrumental’ (pp. 12–13) because of the focus on the technological means at the disposal of modern politicians: modern mass media, opinion polls and marketing techniques. Gerstlé sees this as reductionist, considering only the means of communication which needs to be viewed holistically. The second he calls an ‘ecumenical’ conception (pp. 13–14). This sees political communication as a three-way exchange between politicians, media and public, which Gerstlé criticizes for insufficient attention to varying levels of power and legitimacy of the different actors. To this he prefers a third notion: communication as competitive (p. 14), in which various actors compete to create and impose meaning. Finally, the fourth concept is that of participatory democracy, an idea which Gerstlé embraces, as evident in the closing lines of the book, where – a little optimistically, perhaps? – he appears to assimilate this to authentic, rationalized deliberation in counterpoint to the simulacra and competition for dominance of other forms of political communication (p. 227). Having presented these four conceptions, Gerstlé argues that the error of these approaches lies in considering communication separately from politics, whereas in fact the tryptic ‘publicization, politicization and polarization’ show that they are consubstantial (pp. 15–19).</p>
<p>To the four ways of conceiving of political communication correspond four approaches to studying it: the behaviourist approach (pp. 28–31), the structural-functionalist approach (pp. 31–32), the interactionist approach (pp. 32–34) and the dialogic approach (pp. 35–37). Through this categorization, Gerstlé succeeds in presenting an overview of the history of political communications research which goes beyond a mere chronological account to provide a critique of the merits of each type of study and ways in which they overlap or diverge. Here, and indeed throughout the text, Gerstlé draws on his extensive, in-depth knowledge not only of the main authors in the field in France, or even – the next port of call for French academics – the United States, but also of leading specialists from Britain, Germany, the Scandinavian countries and elsewhere. For, if it is more common for French researchers to be familiar with work from outside their borders than for the converse to be true (linguistic hegemony of English <italic>oblige</italic>!), Gerstlé is one of the leaders in France for his international expertise. He is also a master of interdisciplinarity, drawing on the works of anthropologists, sociologists, linguisticians and discourse analysts, political scientists and media historians, to name but some of the disciplines which inform this work.</p>
<p>The target reader of such a book is clearly the French scholar, since it brings to bear the literature from the English and French speaking worlds to phenomena which prevail in France (with occasional incursions into American, British or Scandinavian politics by way of comparison). The text is peppered with English expressions, such as ‘spin control’ or ‘kite flying’, which are explained to the French readership. However, in its synthesis of the main theories and approaches which have gained currency on the international scene, and its incisive appraisal of them to develop a holistic approach to the study of political communication, it deserves to be read by any specialist in the field.</p>
<p>In line with this international approach the development of modern political communication in France – marketing, opinion polls, advertising and the financing of electoral campaigns – is compared and contrasted with practices elsewhere to bring out the closely regulated nature of the French communications environment, with its official periods of campaigning (pp. 66–70) and its attempts to cap electoral spending (pp. 71–77), though there is little on ways in which these regulations are bypassed or even flouted. The author shows how phenomena which are often seen as American imports into the French scene have their own precedents and are adapted and incorporated into French political institutions. For the study of French electoral periods, the book focuses primarily, though not exclusively, on the presidential elections of 1988 and 2007, to illustrate the strategic interdependence of candidates (in line with the competitive model), the structural and intertextual elements of any campaign and the impact of so-called ‘background’ news (a subject which Gerstlé has gone on to examine in greater depth in his more recent work on Nicolas Sarkozy and news on the economy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0267323112441291">Gerstlé and François, 2011</xref>]). He also goes on to discuss the political impact of a campaign <italic>after</italic> the election, examining questions such as issue salience, the impact of memory and the knowledge gap.</p>
<p>For the discussion of political communication in non-electoral periods, Gerstlé focuses on national executives, enabling him to make comparisons with both presidential and parliamentary regimes, including a short section on ‘divided government’ in the US and its particular French manifestation in periods of ‘cohabitation’, when the presidents of the two nations find themselves in competition with a hostile legislative body for the allegiance of public opinion. A final sections deals with the public, not as receivers of messages (discussed in Part 1), but as actors in a decentralized communications environment via the Internet and social networking. In conclusion, Gerstlé identifies three major characteristics of modern political communication: the greater impact of media reporting and evaluation of a politician than his or her own image-building; the importance of cognitive short-cuts, by association of ideas and images, in the public’s evaluation of politicians; and third, the absolute necessity for coherence between all aspects of a candidate’s communication and behaviour if he or she is to gain political credibility.</p>
<p>This overview is necessarily brief and cannot do justice to the richness of Gerstlé’s text. If the synopsis above reads rather like a list, this is because there is an attempt on the part of the author to leave no stone unturned in his presentation and analysis of both the production and impact of political communication, and even he uses the term ‘inventory’ on one occasion (p. 180). He is interested primarily in the mechanisms at work, and this is true not only of the initial section which focuses on political communication as an object of study, but also of the second part which examines the contemporary French scene: throughout, the focus is the processes of communication, while the events and actors (who won which election, for example), remain subordinate. This is manifest in the index, where one can find ‘Capital politique’ (political capital), but not, for example, Chirac. Nevertheless, although this is not its prime purpose, the book can serve as a useful source for interesting facts and figures as they relate to Chirac or other prominent French politicians, the elections cited above, French media consumption and the rules of the game. As a study of political communication as intrinsic to politics, this is a classic, and it is no surprise that this new edition has been published, with its updated examples.</p>
