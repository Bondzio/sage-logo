<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Since the 1980s, policy makers, educators, and analysts have discussed teacher quality and its relationship to the condition of education. With the onset of No Child Left Behind (NCLB), the Bush administration mounted a plan to ensure that every Title I child has a highly qualified teacher. A growing body of research confirms the importance of good teaching for student learning (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0013124510392568">Ferguson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0013124510392568">Goldhaber, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0013124510392568">Goldhaber, Brewer, &amp; Anderson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0013124510392568">Rivkin, Hanushek, &amp; Kain, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0013124510392568">Rockoff, 2004</xref>) and that effective teachers are capable of inspiring greater learning gains in their students. Researchers have quantified teacher quality by the contributions they make to the academic gains of their students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0013124510392568">Rivkin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0013124510392568">Sanders &amp; Horn, 1994</xref>) and have gathered evidence that further emphasizes the measurable influence that teachers have on student performance. While these findings confirm the intuitively obvious, researchers have been challenged to identify specific observable attributes or credentials of teachers that are associated with teaching effectiveness.</p>
<p>Both at the federal and state levels, policy makers and educators are struggling to address the low academic achievement of many K-12 students. Most of the low-performing schools and students are in urban districts where poverty is high, where large proportions of students have limited English proficiency and where students perform poorly on achievement tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0013124510392568">Jacob, 2007</xref>). Moreover, urban districts face numerous challenges, including attracting teachers to their schools and optimizing their hiring, transfer, and retention policies so that they bring the best available teachers to the classroom setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0013124510392568">Jacob, 2007</xref>). As indicated above, recent research has emphasized the link between teachers and student outcomes. What’s now needed is an understanding of how schools differ on the qualifications of their teachers and the mechanisms driving these differences. In this article, we use the Detroit metropolitan region as a case study in order to (a) determine whether there is teacher sorting across schools and districts, and (2) identify which schools and districts have the least qualified teachers.</p>

<sec id="section2-0013124510392568">
<title>The Detroit Metropolitan Region</title>
<p>Three counties make up the Detroit metropolitan region—Wayne, Oakland, and Macomb, and contain more than 4,012,766 people, fully two fifths of the state’s total population of 10,003,422. Detroit, situated in Wayne County, is the region’s and the state’s largest city with a current population of 912,062—down substantially from its peak population of 1,849,568 in 1950. The major downturn in the city’s population began in the aftermath of the Detroit riots of 1967, which saw White citizens begin to flee Detroit in large numbers to surrounding suburbs in Macomb and Oakland counties. And that downturn continues to the present day, driven on by the virtual collapse of the auto industry and continued devastation of Michigan’s economy. The current national economic recession, while it followed the period of this study, has only added to the economic and social problems of the city. And these problems are not limited to Detroit, for the problems of the city also cast their dismal shadow on the region as a whole.</p>
<p>Wayne is the largest of the three counties by far, with its population of slightly more than 1,949,929 citizens, including the 871,121 citizens who live in Detroit. Oakland County comes in second at 1,202,174. Macomb is the smallest of the three counties with a total population of 860,663 citizens, smaller than the total population of Detroit. In addition to population differences, there are stark contrasts among the three counties in social, economic, and educational characteristics such as race, marital status, unemployment rates, poverty rates, and educational attainment as depicted in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0013124510392568">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<p>Detroit, which for years far exceeded the minimum enrollment requirement of 100,000 pupils for designation as a First Class school district, lost that designation in 2008-2009 when its enrollment dipped to some 88,500 pupils. This dip was the culmination of a long downward trend in Detroit public school enrollments, best exemplified by the losses over the 10-year period from 1998 through 2008. In the 1998-1999 school year, Detroit enrolled 175,653 pupils; by the 2007-2008 school year its enrollment had dropped to 106,164—a loss of some 69,489 pupils. By the fall 2009-2010 it had dropped another 17,000 to the aforementioned 85,690—a total loss of 51% of its pupil population over the full period. In contrast, over the entire state for the shorter 10-year period from 1998 through 2008, total pupil enrollments in Michigan dropped from 1,720,365 to 1,661.417—a loss 48,948 or 3%.</p>

<title>Defining Teacher Quality</title>
<p>Defining teacher quality is a complex task for which there is no consensus on a comprehensive definition. <italic>Teacher quality</italic> implies that there is a set of inputs (such as certification, test scores, etc.) that serve as indicators of successful teaching in the classroom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0013124510392568">Goe, 2007</xref>). However, teaching quality implies that it is not what teachers have in terms of certification and training, but rather what they do in the classroom that indicates quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0013124510392568">Goe, 2007</xref>). For the purposes of this article, teaching quality and teacher quality is focused on the outcomes of student learning. Hence, we draw on the framework of previous studies for determining teacher quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0013124510392568">Fenstermacher &amp; Richardson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0013124510392568">Goe, 2007</xref>). This framework consists of four interrelated ways of examining teacher quality that are grouped into three categories, namely: inputs (teacher qualifications, teacher characteristics), processes (teacher practice), and outputs (teacher effectiveness). Operating within this framework, we use the terms <italic>teacher qualifications</italic> and <italic>teacher characteristics</italic> to refer to the inputs that influence the output, <italic>teacher effectiveness</italic>.</p>
<sec id="section4-0013124510392568">
<title>NCLB and Highly Qualified Teachers</title>
<p>Current federal education policy uses proxy measures of teacher quality. The Bush administration defined a highly qualified teacher as having full certification, a bachelors degree, and “demonstrated competence” in subject knowledge and overall teaching. “Demonstrated competence” might consist of a subject matter major, an advanced degree or credential, or passing a state certification test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0013124510392568">Hill, 2007</xref>). This criterion was somehow overlooked for experienced teachers as states and schools struggled to meet these requirements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0013124510392568">Keller, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0013124510392568">Sack, 2005</xref>), but new teachers are required to have subject matter expertise.</p>
<p>The provisions of NCLB also stipulate that students be taught by highly qualified teachers or that high-poverty and affluent students be taught by unqualified teachers in roughly the same numbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0013124510392568">Hill, 2007</xref>). There is evidence suggesting that well-prepared teachers are unevenly distributed across populations with White and affluent students receiving the best-prepared teachers and minority students or those living in poverty receiving the lesser prepared. Using nonrandom samples of elementary teachers, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0013124510392568">Hill and Lubienski (2007)</xref> found a statistically and substantially significant negative correlation between teacher knowledge and student poverty. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0013124510392568">Ferguson (1991)</xref> found lower teacher scores on certification tests in districts with high proportions of minority students. When it comes to credentials, many studies have documented that low-income, minority students are more likely to have inexperienced teachers, teachers who have failed a certification exam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0013124510392568">Loeb &amp; Reininger, 2004</xref>), and teachers certified outside their expertise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0013124510392568">Strutchens, Lubienski, McGraw, &amp; Westbrook, 2004</xref>). This is particularly relevant for a city such as Detroit where the African American student population exceeds 90%. Clearer understanding of the issues surrounding teacher qualification is needed particularly for the Detroit metropolitan region.</p>
<p>Proxy measures as well as direct measures of teacher qualification must be used along with random samples when investigating what teachers know and do not know. Comparisons of proxy and direct measures are critical, and patterns of distribution of teachers across students need to be examined carefully and traced to actual schools. In this article, we address these issues. We rely on the literature to identify characteristics associated with effective teaching. Our quantitative analysis will follow <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0013124510392568">Koski and Horng (2007)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0013124510392568">Lankford, Loeb, and Wyckoff (2002)</xref>, in using several proxy measures of teacher quality: percent credentialed teachers, percent experienced teachers (&gt; 2 years), percent highly qualified, and percent who graduated from most competitive and least competitive undergraduate schools.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0013124510392568">1</xref></sup> While college competitiveness is a proxy measure, it is useful for gathering richer detail on teachers and has often found effects on student outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0013124510392568">Ehrenberg &amp; Brewer, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0013124510392568">Ferguson, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0013124510392568">Ferguson &amp; Ladd, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Researchers and policy makers agree that teacher quality is a pivotal issue in education reform. However, there is considerable disagreement surrounding which teacher attributes signal quality and how to better invest resources to provide quality teachers for all students. We hope to provide information useful to policy makers, educators, and others in a position to influence the recruitment, education, and training of teachers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0013124510392568">
<title>Link Between Teacher Qualifications and Teacher Effectiveness</title>
<p>Teacher effectiveness is quickly becoming a topic of great interest to policy makers and researchers as teacher contribution to their students’ learning is an important measure in assessing overall teacher quality. Value-added measures are the most prominent and commonly used method to assess teacher effectiveness in the research studies outlined in the literature. However, as a whole, these studies are not able to arrive at convincing conclusions about teacher qualifications or characteristics that contributed to differences in teacher effectiveness.</p>
<p>Existing research shows that having an instructor who was rated 2 standard deviations above the mean in quality (as determined by value-added scores) could add 25% to 45% of an average school year’s growth to a student’s mathematics score (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0013124510392568">Aaronson, Barrow, &amp; Sanders, 2003</xref>). They also found that variation in paper qualifications may matter little (with the exception of the undergraduate major, particularly when mathematics is being taught). Hence, it may be that what high-quality teachers do in their classrooms may be more important than their initial qualifications.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the single largest predictor of student achievement was the student’s prior test score in the content area, followed by prior achievement in other subject areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0013124510392568">Noell, 2006</xref>). This author went on to identify and rank teacher preparation programs according to estimates of effectiveness. Despite the author’s finding of a relationship between teacher preparation programs and teacher effectiveness, there were large overlapping confidence intervals meaning that the relationships could not be reliably determined with the data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0013124510392568">Noell, 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0013124510392568">Rivkin et al. (2005)</xref> found that observable teacher characteristics have small but significant effects on student achievement gains, but most of teacher effectiveness is due to unobserveable differences in instructional quality. Their study also determined that teacher effectiveness increased during the first 3 years but leveled off after the third year.</p>
<p>Other research shows that while teachers are certainly contributing to student learning, it may be difficult to measure teachers’ contributions with a high degree of certainty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0013124510392568">Thum, 2003</xref>). Although many teachers had students who gained at least 5% in language arts, mathematics, and reading on the SAT 9 test, the confidence intervals were too wide to determine whether the gains could be attributed to the teacher, to other sources, or to chance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0013124510392568">Thum, 2003</xref>). Another study wanted to determine the actual degree of teacher effects on student achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0013124510392568">Nye, Konstantopoulos, &amp; Hedges, 2004</xref>). After controlling for student demographics, class size, and school fixed and random effects, they defined teacher effects as the portion of student achievement that remains unaccounted for. In order to examine achievement gains, the authors also controlled for lagged test scores. They found all between-classroom effects on achievement gains significant, but their examination of teacher experience and education revealed that the effects were not significant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0013124510392568">Nye et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0013124510392568">
<title>Measuring Teacher Qualifications and Teacher Characteristics</title>
<p>Researchers have often relied on teacher attributes as proxies for quality (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0013124510392568">Phelps &amp; Addonizio, 2006</xref>). The use of proxy indicators is relatively common in education production function literature since teacher quality is somewhat difficult to measure directly. However, growing “teacher effects” research literature confirms that teachers do influence student achievement and suggests that classroom teachers vary considerably in their effectiveness. Researchers have been challenged, however, to identify observable teacher characteristics that are consistently associated with effective teaching. Lacking direct evidence of teaching effectiveness, researchers have relied on inputs such as certification credentials, years of experience, and academic degrees. Still, the most commonly used attributes—whether or not the teacher holds a graduate degree, years of teaching experience, and whether or not the teacher is certified—have not been found to consistently influence student learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0013124510392568">Hanushek, 1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0013124510392568">1997</xref>). Some studies have correlated teacher test scores on basic skills and college entrance exams with student scores on standardized tests and have found that high scoring teachers are more likely to obtain significant gains in student achievement than their lower-scoring peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0013124510392568">Ferguson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0013124510392568">Ferguson &amp; Ladd, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0013124510392568">Strauss &amp; Sawyer, 1986</xref>).</p>
<p>Deep content-area knowledge is also an attribute of some significance that has a positive impact on student achievement. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0013124510392568">Monk (1994)</xref> found that in models controlling for math and math education coursework there was no effect of math majors but positive effects for math coursework. Moreover, Monk found that no additional positive effect appeared beyond five undergraduate math courses. A review of research done by the Education Commission of States found some evidence to support the notion that teachers be well versed in their subjects. However, the review does point out that the research is not detailed enough to indicate how much subject matter is pivotal for teaching specific course grades or levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0013124510392568">Allen, 2003</xref>). Furthermore, the review found that although courses focused on how to best teach a particular subject that may contribute to effective teaching, less evidence exists to support the significance of pedagogical coursework or field experiences for teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0013124510392568">Allen, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Teaching experience is another attribute that seems to have an influence on student achievement. Evidence does indicate that teachers’ experience levels are positively related to student outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0013124510392568">Betts, Rueben, &amp; Danenberg, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0013124510392568">Rivkin et al., 2005</xref>). Teachers with less teaching experience typically produce smaller learning gains in their students than those with more experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0013124510392568">Fetler, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0013124510392568">Murnane &amp; Phillips, 1981</xref>). Yet as these studies point out, the benefits of experience level off after the first 5 years of teaching.</p>
<p>Teacher certification is also an attribute used to measure teacher qualification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0013124510392568">Betts et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0013124510392568">Darling-Hammond, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0013124510392568">Goldhaber, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0013124510392568">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0013124510392568">Goldhaber &amp; Brewer, 2000</xref>), but it conveys much less consensus than previous attributes mentioned. Some reports claim that uncertified teachers are no better or worse in practice than certified teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0013124510392568">Abell Foundation, 2001</xref>), while others indicate that certification is an important step in insuring teacher quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0013124510392568">Darling-Hammond, 2002</xref>). It has been found that certification in a particular subject area may result in more effective teaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0013124510392568">Wayne &amp; Youngs, 2003</xref>). A fairly recent study found that students of certified teachers outperformed students of uncertified teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0013124510392568">Laczko-Kerr &amp; Berliner, 2002</xref>), but reviews have called into question the methodology and results of the study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0013124510392568">Freedman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0013124510392568">Imai, 2002</xref>). Moreover, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0013124510392568">Goldhaber (2007)</xref> found that North Carolina teachers who earn certification from the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards (NBPTS) are more effective at raising student achievement than both average teachers in the state and teachers who apply to NBPTS but fail to obtain certification.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0013124510392568">2</xref></sup> Thus, while there is mounting evidence that teaching substantially affects student outcomes, there is less agreement on the specific teacher characteristics that are related to student outcomes. Other important teacher attributes that appear in the literature include general academic and verbal abilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0013124510392568">Ferguson &amp; Ladd, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0013124510392568">Hanushek, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>Boyd, Goldhaber, Lankford, and Wycoff propose that certification can improve the quality of teachers in the classroom by establishing a floor on quality. In other words, it can keep the worst teachers from entering the classroom. Yet as the authors pose, certification can fail to meet its goal in two ways. First, it may not distinguish good teachers from bad ones. Second, it may dissuade potentially good teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0013124510392568">Boyd et al., 2007</xref>). The certification process itself may prevent good teachers from pursuing a teaching career thereby lowering the overall quality of teachers despite screening out the worst ones. There is little research that illuminates how any element of certification affects classroom teaching. Effective policy must address a variety of issues that goes beyond certification and encompasses teacher preparation, working conditions, and the distribution of teachers across geographic areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0013124510392568">Ladd, 2007</xref>).</p>

<title>Research Questions</title>
<p>The condition or process to be studied in this article is the extent of the variation in teacher attributes across schools in the Detroit Metro area. This study was guided by three overarching research questions:</p>
<list id="list1-0013124510392568" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Research Question 1</italic>: How much variation exists in the distribution of teacher qualifications within and across public schools and within school districts located in Wayne, Oakland, and Macomb counties?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Research Question 2</italic>: Based on the distribution of these qualifications, which types of schools and districts have the least and most qualified teachers?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Research Question 3</italic>: Based on student academic performance measures, to what extent are these qualifications correlated with output, that is, teacher effectiveness? Which types of schools and districts have the least and most effective teachers?</p></list-item>
</list>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0013124510392568">
<title>Data and Method</title>
<p>While it is widely accepted that teacher quality is an important school-based factor influencing student learning, there is no clear consensus on which dimensions of teacher quality matter most (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0013124510392568">Goe, 2007</xref>). As we noted above, teacher quality studies of the past focused on teacher inputs such as education, certification, or experience while some research has defined teacher quality by outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0013124510392568">Goe, 2007</xref>). The models employed in this investigation utilize a combination of variables as a means of determining teacher quality as well as variations in student performance. Our sample consists of the 803 elementary and middle schools in the tri-county Detroit metropolitan area, including 708 traditional (i.e., district-based) schools and 86 charter schools (i.e., “public school academies).</p>
<sec id="section9-0013124510392568">
<title>Teacher Qualifications</title>
<p>The State of Michigan collects data on public school personnel through two systems: the Register of Education Personnel (REP) and the personnel licensing system (L2K). Each system assigns a unique personal identifier to each employee, and the state provided us with a crosswalk to match cases across the systems.</p>
<sec id="section10-0013124510392568">
<title>Register of Education Personnel (REP)</title>
<p>The REP records each employee’s race/ethnicity; place of employment (i.e., school, local district, and intermediate district—generally a county); date of hire and termination; undergraduate institution; highest degree; major, minor, subject teaching assignment; status under the “highly qualified” provisions of <italic>No Child Left Behind</italic>; and professional development activities.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0013124510392568">
<title>Personnel Licensing System (L2K)</title>
<p>These data identify each Michigan teacher’s license, or certification credential, including any secondary licenses, along with date of birth and gender. Michigan’s licensing system entails a somewhat bewildering array of 47 classifications. We focus, however, on the major categories, including provisional, professional, and permanent certification at the elementary and secondary levels, and a set of teacher permits issued to schools or districts that cannot find appropriately certified teachers to fill vacancies or need to fill day-to-day substitute teaching assignments. These permits, which are valid only for the school year for which they are approved, are classified as full year, emergency, and “Section 1233b,” the section of the Michigan School Code that allows the employment of noncertified, nonendorsed teachers in mathematics, foreign language, and the sciences. A more detailed description of Michigan’s major teacher certification categories is provided in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0013124510392568">Appendix A</xref> and <xref ref-type="app" rid="app2-0013124510392568">Appendix B</xref>.</p>

<sec id="section12-0013124510392568">
<title>Student Characteristics and School Resources</title>
<p>The Michigan Department of Education annually collects information from local school districts on the number of students eligible under the federally sponsored National School Lunch Program for free and reduced price lunches. We use this information as the proxy measure for low-income students. The department also collects and publishes annually, in Bulletin 1014, revenue and expenditure data for each local school district in Michigan. These data include the state equalized valuation of all homestead property in each Michigan school district. We use this as a proxy measure for local district wealth.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0013124510392568">
<title>Student Achievement: The MEAP Data Set</title>
<p>A third major question we address in this article centers on the variation in student academic performance measures across the districts and schools, given the variation in teacher qualifications. That is, based on student academic performance measures, which types of schools and districts have the most qualified teachers? Which types have the least qualified teachers? In addressing this question, we draw on the Michigan Educational Assessment Program (MEAP) data files available through the Michigan Department of Education, for the 2005-2006 school year.</p>
<p>MEAP data files provide annually for all public school districts and schools in Michigan individual pupil scores in several subject areas and at several grade levels. At Grades 4 and 7, individual pupil scores are available in English language arts and math. At Grade 5, scores are available in science and social studies. At Grade 8, scores are available in math, science, and social studies. Subjects covered at Grade 11 are English language arts, math, science, and social studies. The individual pupil scores are aggregated at both school and district levels to provide the number and percent of pupils scoring at each of four levels—1, 2, 3, and 4. Pupils who score at Levels 1 and 2 are those who “met/exceeded expectations.” They are considered “proficient” in the subject tested. Pupils who score at Levels 3 and 4 are those who “did not meet expectations.” They are not considered “proficient.” For our analysis, in those schools that contained both Grades 4 and 7, we selected two measures: percent of pupils who were “proficient” in English language arts at Grades 4 and 7, and the percent of pupils who were “proficient” in Math at Grades 4 and 7. In those schools that contained only a Grade 4 or a Grade 7, we also selected the same two measures but included only those pupils in either Grade 4 or Grade 7.</p>

<sec id="section14-0013124510392568" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>We define “teacher sorting” as the nonrandom distribution of teacher quality across students, schools, and districts. Accordingly, the analysis relies primarily on descriptive statistics to assess the variability in our proxy measures of teacher quality and school and district characteristics across the region and Pearson correlation coefficients to test for evidence of sorting. Specifically, we estimate correlations between a set of teacher quality proxies and measures of educational resources and student achievement at the school and district level across the region and within each of the three large constituent counties. Of course, the correlation coefficient indicates only whether or not the two variables move in the same or opposite directions and the degree of linear association. It does not indicate by how much one variable changes as the other one changes. This information is obtained by a regression coefficient, at the cost of a more restrictive assumption, namely, that a causal relationship exists between the variables. Here, we assume that teacher quality is the dependent variable; that is, teacher quality is a function of school and community characteristics and resource levels. The hypothesized relationship between student achievement and teacher quality is certainly debatable, but we will hypothesize that TQ = f (ach.), consistent with our sorting hypothesis.</p>
<sec id="section15-0013124510392568">
<title>Constructing School-Level Aggregates</title>
<p>The Register of Education Personnel (REP) and personnel licensing databases contain records on all public school employees in Michigan. We identified active classroom teachers by screening the cases two ways: First, we identified all personnel working in the schools during the 2005-2006 academic year, the most recent for which data are available, who held any one of the five teaching certificates or four teaching permits used by the state<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0013124510392568">3</xref></sup>; second, because many administrators and instructional support staff (e.g., psychologists, counselors, etc.) hold teaching credentials but do not teach, we selected those personnel whose salary and benefits were recorded with accounting codes that identified them as instructional personnel for 2005-2006.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0013124510392568">4</xref></sup> In this way, we identified 23,123 elementary and middle school classroom teachers in Michigan. Next, we sorted the classroom teachers by their school codes and calculated the following school-level proxies for teacher quality:</p>
<sec id="section16-0013124510392568">
<title>Percent of certified teachers</title>
<p>This measure, PERCERT, is the percent of classroom teachers who hold a teaching certificate rather than a teaching permit. PERCERT is the sum of the percent of classroom teachers who hold a provisional or professional license, the highest credentials currently issued to new and veteran teachers, respectively, in Michigan and the percent of teachers who hold a “permanent” license, the highest credential issued by Michigan prior to the adoption of the current credentialing system. Teachers holding the “permanent” certificate are grandfathered under the current system.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0013124510392568">
<title>Percent of teachers who are substitutes</title>
<p>The second credential-based proxy measure of teacher quality is PCTSUB, the percentage of teachers in each school who are working with a “substitute” permit.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0013124510392568">
<title>Percent of teachers who graduated from a competitive undergraduate college</title>
<p>The REP identifies each teacher’s undergraduate college for those teachers who graduated from Michigan institutions. (For graduates of out-of-state colleges, only the state in which the college is located is reported.) For the graduates of Michigan institutions, each teacher’s college was ranked according to Barron’s 9-point system. Schools with a ranking between 1 (<italic>most competitive</italic>) and 5 were classified as <italic>competitive</italic>, while schools ranked 6 through 9 (<italic>least competitive</italic>) were classified as <italic>uncompetitive</italic>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0013124510392568">
<title>Percent of new teachers</title>
<p>This proxy for teacher quality is the percent of teachers in each school with less than 3 years of teaching experience. This measure is based on several studies reported above, including <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0013124510392568">Rivkin et al. (2005)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0013124510392568">Betts et. al. (2000)</xref>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-0013124510392568">
<title>Percent of separated teachers</title>
<p>This figure is the percent of teachers who left the school in 2005-2006.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0013124510392568">5</xref></sup> While not a proxy for teacher quality, this measure is intended to capture the working conditions, climate, and stability in the tri-county schools.</p>
<p>We then selected those public schools located in Wayne, Oakland, and Macomb counties, the Detroit metropolitan area. This tri-county sample consists of 794 public elementary and middle schools and 23,123 classroom teachers, accounting for approximately 19% of Michigan’s classroom teachers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-0013124510392568">
<title>Percent of pupils who are low income</title>
<p>This measure, PCTFREEREDL, reflects the percent of pupils in the school who are eligible for free and reduced price lunches.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-0013124510392568">
<title>Evidence of Sorting</title>
<p>Teacher sorting, or the systematic matching of more qualified teachers with students of relatively high socioeconomic status and achievement levels, could exist at varying levels across the Detroit metropolitan region. That is, evidence of teacher–student matching could be detected across schools or districts throughout the region or within counties, and across schools within districts.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0013124510392568">6</xref></sup> Sorting across and within counties could arise from the workings of the teacher labor market, with more affluent communities able to attract more qualified teacher candidates through a combination of higher compensation, more exacting hiring practices, and superior working conditions, while sorting within local districts may result from provisions of the local collective bargaining agreement, with more senior teachers maintaining the right to select their school assignments.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-0013124510392568">
<title>Findings</title>
<p>We begin by measuring the variability of our proxy measures for teacher quality across the Detroit metropolitan region. Descriptive school-level statistics for the entire region are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0013124510392568">Table 3</xref> and separately for each county in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0013124510392568">Tables 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0013124510392568">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0013124510392568">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0013124510392568">7</xref> for the city of Detroit. To test for evidence of teacher sorting, we estimate a set of Pearson correlation coefficient matrices relating our school-level proxies for teacher quality (TQ)—<italic>percent fully certified, percent substitutes, percent graduates of a competitive college</italic>, and <italic>percent new to teaching</italic>—to measures of student characteristics, school resources, and student achievement also aggregated to the school level.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0013124510392568">7</xref></sup> Each observation (school) is weighted by the number of classroom teachers in the school.</p>

<p>Separate matrices are estimated for the entire tri-county region, for each of the counties, and for the Detroit Public School (DPS) District.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0013124510392568">8</xref></sup> As discussed above, we define teacher sorting as the nonrandom distribution of these four teacher-quality proxies across communities (i.e., school districts), schools, and students. Evidence of sorting would be given by significant nonzero Pearson correlation coefficients relating our teacher quality (TQ) proxies to our community, school, and student characteristics. Our findings are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-0013124510392568">Tables 8</xref> through <xref ref-type="table" rid="table12-0013124510392568">12</xref>.</p>

<title>Results at the Regional Level</title>
<sec id="section25-0013124510392568">
<title>Teacher certification status</title>
<p>The percent of teachers who are fully certified (permanent or professional) shows a moderate positive correlation with both <italic>percent ELA proficient</italic> and <italic>percent math proficient</italic> (.22 and .26, respectively, both significant at the .01 level). These coefficients provide evidence of teacher sorting across the region. The causal relationship between this TQ proxy and student achievement is ambiguous, but these findings are intuitively consistent with teacher sorting: Teacher quality is positively associated with student achievement.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section26-0013124510392568">
<title>Other TQ proxies</title>
<p>Other findings are also consistent with the sorting hypothesis at the regional level. The coefficients relating the <italic>percent graduates of a competitive college</italic> to student achievement are moderately high, significant at the .01 level, and have the expected positive sign (.21 and .24 for <italic>percent ELA proficient</italic> and <italic>percent math proficient</italic>, respectively). Furthermore, the coefficients relating <italic>percent teacher leavers</italic> and both achievement measures are consistent with the sorting hypothesis, with both coefficients negative, moderately strong, and significant at the .01 level. The coefficients relating <italic>percent new to teaching</italic> and the achievement measures are also substantial (.31 for <italic>percent ELA proficient</italic> and .30 for <italic>percent math proficient</italic>) and significant at the .01 level, but positive in sign. At first blush, the signs may seem counterintuitive. However, a school’s proportion of new teachers (i.e., having less than 3 years of teaching experience) may reflect a growing student population, a characteristic of an attractive and prosperous community. This hypothesis is supported by the .28 correlation between the new teacher measure and <italic>district residential property wealth</italic> per pupil.</p>
<p>At the regional level, the percent of teachers who hold substitute teacher credentials is unrelated to either of the two student achievement measures or to <italic>district residential property wealth</italic> or to the poverty measure, <italic>percent low-income pupils</italic>. Similarly, teachers’ <italic>starting salary</italic>, a variable measured at the district level, is virtually unrelated to student achievement. However, salary levels for teachers with a masters degree and 10 years of teaching experience—<italic>MA plus 10</italic>— is positively and significantly (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) associated with <italic>percent ELA proficient</italic> and <italic>percent math proficient</italic>, with coefficients of .31 and .29, respectively. Again, the causal relationship between this TQ proxy and student achievement is ambiguous. Does teacher quality produce higher student achievement or do schools with higher-achieving students and offering high salaries to experienced teachers attract teaching talent? The correlation between veteran teacher salary level, that is, <italic>MA plus 10</italic>, and <italic>district residential property wealth</italic> per pupil is moderately strong (<italic>r</italic> = .30, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) and has the expected positive sign, while the correlation between this TQ proxy and <italic>percent low-income pupils</italic> is negative and also moderately substantial (<italic>r</italic> = −.33, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), as expected.</p>
<p>Thus, it appears that, across the region, affluent school districts offer high salaries to experienced teachers, employ teachers with strong credentials, and boast high levels of student achievement. These findings are consistent with our sorting hypothesis. However, the correspondence between the TQ proxies, student achievement, student poverty, and community property wealth varies across counties. We turn now to these county-level results.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section27-0013124510392568">
<title>Results in Wayne County</title>
<p>The estimated correlations between the TQ proxies and student achievement are strongest in Wayne County. First, the percent of teachers who are fully certified is positively and strongly associated with <italic>ELA proficient</italic> and <italic>math proficient</italic> (.31 and .37 for ELA and math, respectively). Second, the correlations between the <italic>percent graduates of a competitive college</italic> and student achievement are stronger yet (.36 and .42 for <italic>ELA proficient</italic> and <italic>math proficient</italic>, respectively). Furthermore, <italic>district residential property wealth</italic> is positively associated with both of these TQ proxies (.32 for <italic>percent fully certified</italic> and .38 for <italic>percent graduates of a competitive college</italic>) and also with salary levels for experienced teachers, that is, <italic>MA plus 10</italic> (<italic>r</italic> = .28, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0013124510392568">9</xref></sup> The percent of teachers leaving their school also demonstrates a relatively strong negative association with student achievement, −.28 for <italic>ELA proficient</italic>, and −.29 for <italic>math proficient</italic>. While these inverse relationships are found in each county, they are strongest in Wayne. Taken as a whole, these results reveal a nonrandom distribution of teacher characteristics across schools and districts, that is, strong evidence of sorting in Michigan’s most populous county.</p>
<sec id="section28-0013124510392568">
<title>Detroit Public Schools</title>
<p>Wayne County is home to the Detroit Public Schools (DPS) and the teacher-weighted school-level results for the county are heavily influenced by DPS circumstances. We now turn to these DPS findings. As expected, these results mirror the corresponding findings for Wayne County, with one notable exception. As with the county, two positive TQ proxies—<italic>percent fully certified</italic> and <italic>percent graduates of a competitive college</italic> are positively and significantly related to student achievement. However, unlike the findings for the region and Wayne County, the association between the <italic>percent new teachers</italic> and student achievement is negative for both <italic>ELA achievement</italic> and <italic>math achievement</italic> (−.21 and −.27, respectively). In view of Detroit’s severely declining enrollment, which fell by half from the mid-1990s to 2008-2009, the presence of new teachers is surely not an indicator of financial strength associated with rising enrollments. Rather, the negative correlations between inexperienced teachers and student achievement likely reflect DPS’s teacher assignment rules, which allow more senior teachers to choose schools with higher achieving students. According to the DPS contract,</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>In order to implement the balanced staff concept when filling vacancies and/or when a school’s staff is increased or decreased, appropriate assignments or transfers will be made . . . giving priority to the balanced staff concept elements in the following order are necessary to teach such as grade level, race, experience and sex.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0013124510392568">10</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Furthermore, low student achievement is also associated with the use of substitute teachers in DPS schools, with coefficients of −.26 and −.29 for <italic>ELA proficient</italic> and <italic>math proficient</italic>, respectively. This moderately strong inverse association is unique to DPS.</p>
<p>Again, the causal relationship between the TQ proxies and student achievement is somewhat ambiguous in this cross-sectional analysis; furthermore, we are unable to estimate correlation coefficients relating our proxies to <italic>district residential property wealth</italic>, since it is a measure with zero variability at the district level. We do find <italic>percent low-income pupils</italic> positively but weakly associated with <italic>percent fully certified</italic> (<italic>r</italic> = .09, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) and negatively but weakly correlated with the remaining TQ proxies—<italic>percent substitutes</italic> (<italic>r</italic> = −.08), <italic>percent graduates of a competitive college</italic> (<italic>r</italic> = −.13), <italic>percent new to teaching</italic> (<italic>r</italic> = −.10), and <italic>percent teacher leavers</italic> (<italic>r</italic> = −.10). Nevertheless, regardless of the causal relationships between the TQ proxies and the student achievement measures across DPS schools, the prevalence of inexperienced and substitute teachers in Detroit’s low-achieving schools is cause for concern.</p>

<title>Results in Oakland County</title>
<p>Results for Oakland County, by far the wealthiest of the three, are for the most part consistent with expectations. All correlations between the four nonsalary TQ proxies and the two student achievement measures are significant at the .01 level and of the expected signs. The relationships, however, are generally weak, with coefficient absolute values never exceeding .13.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0013124510392568">11</xref></sup> However Oakland County is characterized by comparatively strong correlations between the teacher salary measures and student achievement, with coefficients between <italic>starting salary</italic> and <italic>ELA proficient</italic> and <italic>math proficient</italic> of .50 and .47, respectively. For salary at the <italic>MA plus 10</italic> level, the correlations with <italic>ELA proficient</italic> and <italic>math proficient</italic> are .47 for both subjects. Again, the causal relationships between teacher attributes and student achievement are ambiguous. However, both teacher salary measures—<italic>starting salary</italic> and <italic>MA plus 10</italic>—are also highly correlated with <italic>district residential property wealth</italic>. These coefficients are .60 and .44, respectively. The former statistic is much higher for Oakland County districts than for Wayne, Macomb, or the region as a whole, while the latter is moderately high for Wayne and the entire region. These correlations between teacher compensation and both local property wealth and student achievement are clear evidence of teacher sorting across districts and schools in Oakland County. Furthermore, the evidence involving veteran teacher salaries, student achievement, and local property wealth provide confirmation of teacher sorting across the entire tri-county region.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0013124510392568">12</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section30-0013124510392568">
<title>Results in Macomb County</title>
<p>Results for Macomb County are less intuitive and more idiosyncratic than for Wayne and Oakland counties. For example, while coefficients relating <italic>percent fully certified</italic> to the two student achievement measures are positive and significant for Oakland and Wayne, and for DPS and for the region as a whole, they are negative and significant for Macomb schools. Similarly, while coefficients relating <italic>percent substitutes</italic> to the two student achievement measures are uniformly negative and significant for Oakland and Wayne counties, and for DPS, they are positive, significant, and moderately strong for Macomb (.27 and .21 for <italic>ELA proficient</italic> and <italic>Math proficient</italic>, respectively). Furthermore, while <italic>percent graduates of a competitive college</italic> is positively and significantly associated with student achievement throughout the region, the association is weakest in Macomb County (and considerably weaker than in Wayne County). Macomb is also an outlier with respect to correlations between <italic>percent fully certified</italic> and both <italic>district residential property wealth</italic> and <italic>percent low-income pupils</italic>, with unintuitive coefficients in both cases (–.25 for <italic>percent fully certified</italic> and <italic>district residential property wealth</italic>, and .28 for <italic>percent fully certified</italic> and <italic>percent low-income pupil</italic>s).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0013124510392568">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>The puzzle is why is Macomb so unlike the rest of the region? In examining <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0013124510392568">Table 1</xref>, which describes the tri-county region in terms of selected social, economic, and educational characteristics, we do see a substantial difference in the racial characteristics of Macomb County compared to Wayne County. Macomb County is almost 90% White with only about 6% African American population. In Wayne County, on the other hand, only 53% of the population is White and 42% is African-American. However, Macomb is not all that different from Oakland County in which some 81% of the population is White and 12% is African American. And Macomb and Oakland counties are almost identical in the makeup of their households, with both being substantially different than Wayne County. In terms of educational characteristics, the populations in Macomb and Wayne are quite similar, and taken together, quite different than the population in Oakland County. For example, in Oakland County, the percent of the population that holds bachelor or graduate degrees approaches 42%, twice as high as the figure in either Macomb or Wayne counties. This suggests that Oakland County may be recruiting teachers with higher educational backgrounds than the other two counties. As expected, given Oakland’s higher levels of education, income, and residential wealth.</p>

<title>Discussion and Concluding Remarks</title>
<p>As we stated earlier, the nonrandom matching of higher-qualified classroom teachers with higher-achieving students in more highly resourced schools may occur at several administrative levels in a public school system. We noted that such sorting may occur across counties within a regional labor market and across local school districts within a county. Furthermore, evidence of this phenomenon may be detected through district- or school-level observation. When such evidence is found, as in this analysis of the tri-county Detroit metropolitan region, questions arise as to the likely causes of teacher sorting. Possibilities include disparities in teacher compensation and working conditions, which could stem from differences in district residential property wealth, demographics, and other socioeconomic characteristics of local communities. Sorting across schools within local districts, on the other hand, may arise from district personnel policies and provisions of local collective bargaining agreements. That is, within a local school district the assignment of teachers to particular local schools is not determined so much by the workings of the teacher labor market as by the rights of assignment and transfer conferred to management or labor by the local collective bargaining agreement. For example, as noted in the case of the Detroit Public School District, teacher experience is a consideration in teacher assignments and helps explain the negative and significant association between teacher experience and student achievement.</p>
<p>A growing “teacher-effects” literature confirms the importance of good teachers and good teaching for student learning. However, while findings based on measures of student achievement confirm the intuitively obvious, researchers have been challenged to identify observable teacher characteristics or credentials that are associated more broadly with effective teaching. This question is an important one. Presently, school administrators, parents, and others must identify effective teachers without benefit of ex-post analysis of student achievement gains. Instead, they have to rely on teacher qualifications and characteristics such as certification status, teaching experience (if any), undergraduate institution, and the candidate’s major and minor areas of preparation.</p>
<p>Our present research has examined administrative records of public school personnel in the tri-county Detroit metropolitan region and identified a set of teacher qualifications and characteristics that have been associated with teacher effectiveness. Individual personnel records were aggregated to the school level and matched with data sets detailing pupil achievement at the school level, pupil characteristics at the school level, and district-level financial data. Pearson correlation analysis was then employed to detect patterns of teacher sorting across public schools in the tri-county region. School aggregates were examined for each of the counties in the region and for the region as a whole. The region’s largest local school district, Detroit, was also examined separately.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, as demonstrated in our findings, fully certified teachers are more heavily concentrated in schools located in relatively wealthy communities and enrolling relatively high-achieving students. An inner-city district, such as Detroit, faces an enormous challenge as it appears to receive less qualified teachers than its suburban counterparts. Unfortunately, inner-city districts contain the schools most in need of the highly qualified teachers who hold promise of improving student learning. Although these districts may have recruitment and retention policies in place, along with incentives to attract teachers into the profession, many do not target low-performing schools. Without targeted policies aimed at ameliorating the disparities in teacher qualifications across schools, there will be little change in current sorting processes.</p>
<p>Even though the definition of <italic>teacher quality</italic> is constantly in flux, there may be some factors future policy makers could take into account in order to develop a more comprehensive definition. First, teachers should have an initial set of qualifications linked to the subject matter and grade level being taught prior to entering the classroom. Second, some would suggest that mechanisms should be developed for evaluating teaching effectiveness in producing student learning. And these should not be just traditional achievement measures linked to a single test score. An evaluation strategy for determining teacher quality could encompass a combination of peer evaluation, portfolios, and value-added assessments. Using a sole determinant of teacher quality, such as pupil achievement scores, is impractical and not sound empirically, but combining the above-mentioned measures may result in strengthening the professional field and, more important, may affect student learning.</p>
<p>In the context of teacher policy, it makes sense to turn to the existing evidence on which teacher qualifications and characteristics are related to teacher quality in order to guide policy decisions about hiring, compensation, and teacher distribution. But it also makes sense to continue to pursue further research and develop further empirical evidence regarding teacher quality. Such evidence not only can inform current practice but can also guide state efforts in the struggle with NCLB compliance and provide direction for future teacher policy.</p>
<p>Still, the enhancement of teacher quality is likely to be expensive. Many local districts have introduced induction and mentoring programs to address high attrition rates and improve the practice of their inexperienced teachers. Many states and local districts are attempting to raise teacher salaries and improve working conditions in an effort to curb early departures. Hence, a clear sense of which teacher attributes really do lead to improved educational outcomes would guide these important investment decisions. In a climate of limited resources, difficult policy choices must be made, and wherever possible empirical evidence should be used to guide these decisions.</p>
<sec id="section32-0013124510392568">
<title>Need for Future Research</title>
<p>This present analysis provides a foundation for further work by documenting the extent and characteristics of teacher sorting in the tri-county Detroit metropolitan region. Future research could expand this effort to the entire state, focusing on sorting between and among counties, districts, schools, and even classrooms. Moreover, teacher movement across schools and districts over time and changes in teacher distribution is a source for further study. It is our hope to pursue this line of inquiry in subsequent papers.</p>
<p>There also is a related line of research that is much needed, namely, to learn more about what motivates teachers to enter the teaching profession. What are the deciding factors that motivate and lead individuals to become teachers? How do new teachers decide which schools they will teach in? How do districts determine where they assign teachers? Would changes in the salary structure alter the current sorting of teachers? What policies could be implemented to attract and retain high-quality teachers in low-performing urban schools such as Detroit? In terms of future research, policies that aim to improve teacher quality must also examine classroom practice through observations and case studies. Understanding how quality affects teacher behavior is fundamental to improving student outcomes. These and a good many other related questions remain to be answered.</p>

<title>Michigan’s Teacher Certification System</title>
<sec id="section34-0013124510392568">
<title>Provisional certificate</title>
<p>This is Michigan’s initial teaching certificate, issued following the successful completion of an approved elementary or secondary teacher preparation program, including student teaching. This certificate is issued after the candidate has passed all components of the Michigan Test for Teacher Certification (MTTC), including a basic skills test in reading, writing, and mathematics, subject area examinations for prospective secondary level teachers, and an elementary examination for prospective elementary grade teachers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section35-0013124510392568">
<title>Professional certificate</title>
<p>This is Michigan’s advanced teaching certificate. It requires completion of 18 semester hours of study following provisional certification, along with 3 years of successful teaching experience. This certificate is valid for up to 5 years and renewable through the completion of continuing education credits.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section36-0013124510392568">
<title>Permits</title>
<p>A permit is issued to a school or district that cannot find an appropriately certified teacher to fill a vacancy or for day-to-day substitute teaching assignments. A permit is valid only for the school year for which it is approved. Michigan issues four types of permits:</p>
<list id="list2-0013124510392568" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Full</italic>-<italic>year permit</italic>: This permit authorizes a school or district to employ a noncertified person in a long-term assignment of more than 90 days in the same classroom. The person must have a bachelors degree.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Emergency permit</italic>: This permit allows a school or district to hire a person lacking a bachelors degree for a long-term assignment. The candidate must be currently enrolled in college and have completed more than 90 credit hours.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Substitute permit</italic>: This permit allows a school or district to employ a person who does not hold a valid Michigan teaching certificate as a substitute teacher on a day-to-day basis when the regular teacher is temporarily absent. This permit is not valid for long-term teaching assignments. The substitute teacher must have completed 90 credit hours of study a one accredited college or university.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Section 1233b permit</italic>: This permit authorizes the employment of a noncertified teacher in Grades 9-12 in computer science, foreign language, mathematics, biology, chemistry, engineering, physics, and robotics. The candidate must have a bachelors degree in the subject to be taught and 2 years of recent occupational experience.</p></list-item>
