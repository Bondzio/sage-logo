<abstract>
<p>In this study, the authors explored the effect of prereading skills at the start of kindergarten and change in skills during kindergarten on response to Tier I (universal) Schoolwide Positive Behavior Support in Grade 5. A longitudinal data set of 473 students, including <italic>Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills</italic> measures at the start, middle, and end of kindergarten and office discipline referrals in Grade 5, was used to determine whether reading skills at school entry or change in reading skills over the course of kindergarten were more predictive of chronic problem behavior in Grade 5. Results of logistic regression analyses indicated that low initial phonological awareness predicted problem behavior, but including skill growth in the model resulted in significantly improved and more accurate prediction. Results are discussed in terms of early screening and intervention and reducing risk for problem behavior through quality Tier I reading instruction in kindergarten.</p>

<p>There is now compelling evidence that preventive interventions to support prosocial behavior are most effective in reducing behavior problems in schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1098300711403153">Institute of Education Sciences, 2008</xref>). Early identification of students requiring additional support is also critical, as without support, problem behavior may become severe and spread to multiple areas, including academic competence, emotional stability, and peer and family relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1098300711403153">Dishion, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1098300711403153">Fox, Dunlap, &amp; Powell, 2002</xref>). Although it is common to wait until the problem becomes serious (e.g., school failure, involvement with law enforcement), signs of future challenges are present early in school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1098300711403153">Hamre &amp; Pianta, 2001</xref>). For students at greatest risk, support becomes drastically less effective when it is delayed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1098300711403153">Sprague &amp; Walker, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>One technology to prevent problem behavior is School-wide Positive Behavior Support (SWPBS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1098300711403153">Horner, Sugai, Todd, &amp; Lewis-Palmer, 2005</xref>). SWPBS is a systems-level approach for improving school climate and reducing problem behavior to achieve social and academic success for all students. Common Tier I (universal) SWPBS practices include defining, teaching, and acknowledging prosocial behavior, providing consistent, instructional consequences for problem behavior, and redesigning the physical environment to make prosocial behavior more likely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1098300711403153">George, Kincaid, &amp; Pollard-Sage, 2009</xref>). The growing research base for SWPBS, including multisite randomized control trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1098300711403153">Bradshaw, Mitchell, &amp; Leaf, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1098300711403153">Horner et al., 2009</xref>), suggest that it is an evidence-based practice for treating and preventing social behavior problems.</p>
<p>However, even when implemented with fidelity, not all students will respond to the Tier I level of SWPBS, and these students will need access to targeted and intensive levels of SWPBS. Waiting for students to display elevated levels of problem behavior may be viewed as a reactive practice, even if preventive systems are in place. Hence, early intervention is critical, and it is a key task for practitioners and researchers to identify factors that elevate a student’s risk for nonresponse to Tier I support (D. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1098300711403153">Fuchs, Fuchs, McMaster, Yen, &amp; Svenson, 2004</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section1-1098300711403153">
<title>Academic Skill Level as a Risk Factor for Problem Behavior</title>
<p>One potential cause of nonresponse to Tier I behavior support is academic skill deficits. Researchers have identified a link between low academic skills and chronic problem behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1098300711403153">Fleming, Harachi, Cortes, Abbott, &amp; Catalano, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1098300711403153">Hinshaw, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1098300711403153">McIntosh, Horner, Chard, Dickey, &amp; Braun, 2008</xref>). As context influences student behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1098300711403153">Hamre &amp; Pianta, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1098300711403153">Thomas, Bierman, Thompson, &amp; Powers, 2008</xref>), research suggests that the link between academic skills and problem behavior may be due to differences in students’ relative learning environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1098300711403153">Merton, 1968</xref>). A student with lower academic skills than her classmates faces a considerably less hospitable school experience than a student with average or high academic skills. The student who struggles academically is asked to complete aversive tasks more often, has less access to positive reinforcement (in the form of teacher praise and good grades) for correct academic responding, and more exposure to corrective feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1098300711403153">Wehby, Lane, &amp; Falk, 2003</xref>). It is predictable that a student might respond to continual aversive academic requests with aggression or withdrawal, creating a cycle of escape-maintained problem behavior, which reduces access to the curriculum and inhibits skill development even further (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1098300711403153">McIntosh, Horner, et al., 2008</xref>). As such, behavioral function plays a critical role in the relation between academic skills and problem behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1098300711403153">Filter &amp; Horner, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1098300711403153">Preciado, Horner, &amp; Baker, 2009</xref>). These studies have demonstrated a causal link between academic skills and problem behavior, as academic task demands evoke use of problem behavior to escape the task. This evidence also suggests that low academic skills are a risk factor for nonresponse to SWPBS.</p>

<sec id="section2-1098300711403153">
<title>Kindergarten Reading Skills as Potential Predictors</title>
<p>Given the documented relationship between academic deficits and problem behavior, it may be possible to screen students for additional behavior support through prereading scores at the start of kindergarten. The domain of reading holds distinct promise because it is a foundational skill for future academic performance, particularly as students progress through elementary school. It is generally in Grade 3 and beyond that the focus of schooling shifts from “learning to read” to “reading to learn,” and reading skills are increasingly needed in other subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1098300711403153">Heath, 1980</xref>). For students with low reading skills, this time point represents a dramatic shift in their environment. In primary grades, these students might only experience challenges in one period of the day. But starting in Grade 3, the entire day becomes flooded with reading tasks, potentially evoking problem behavior to escape the tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1098300711403153">McIntosh, Horner, et al., 2008</xref>). Hence, kindergarten challenges in reading that are not corrected by Grade 3 can lead to chronic behavior challenges across settings that develop by the end of elementary school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1098300711403153">McIntosh, Horner, Chard, Boland, &amp; Good, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>With early detection as an important goal, the start of kindergarten represents a promising point for screening, but only if results are accurate. Research on the accuracy of reading screening at the start of kindergarten has produced disagreement in the field. Although researchers agree that early screening and identification of reading difficulties is essential, differing views exist on how and when difficulties can be detected reliably. Some researchers have suggested that valid and reliable one-time kindergarten screening tools do exist, if they are based on established models of reading development and accurately classify students based on risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1098300711403153">Foorman &amp; Ciancio, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1098300711403153">Pennington &amp; Lefly, 2001</xref>). Others emphasize that assessing reading skills solely at school entry has questionable validity and reliability, and ongoing assessment and evaluation (i.e., examining reading growth rates) is also necessary (L. S. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1098300711403153">Fuchs &amp; Fuchs, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1098300711403153">Speece, 2005</xref>). The resulting implication is that students’ response to reading instruction may be a stronger indicator of student risk.</p>

<title>Preventing Problem Behavior Through Academic Support</title>
<p>An encouraging aspect of identifying challenges in reading and prereading skills is the clear evidence that they are malleable through intervention for the vast majority of students, even those with reading disabilities (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1098300711403153">Simos et al., 2007</xref>). Such positive outcomes in reading may also yield complementary effects in disruptive behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1098300711403153">Lane et al., 2002</xref>). Some research has shown that academic interventions alone can improve social behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1098300711403153">Filter &amp; Horner, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1098300711403153">Lee, Sugai, &amp; Horner, 1999</xref>). In these studies, improving academic skills made problem behavior less likely to occur, thus improving student outcomes in both areas simultaneously. This research indicates how quality Tier I academic instruction might prevent future problem behavior: When student academic skills are improved, they may experience more success, reducing the aversiveness of classroom instruction and removing the need for problem behavior.</p>

<title>Assessing Kindergarten Reading Screening Measures to Predict Nonresponse to SWPBS</title>
<p>So can kindergarten prereading measures predict future problem behavior, and which is more predictive: initial skill level or growth? <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1098300711403153">McIntosh, Horner, and colleagues (2006)</xref> assessed the power of prereading and behavior screening in kindergarten to predict office discipline referrals during the final year of elementary school. Office referrals received in kindergarten were not significant predictors, but a phonological awareness measure at the end of kindergarten was a significant predictor of multiple office discipline referrals in Grade 5, an indicator of nonresponse to Tier I SWPBS. In fact, students who were identified at the highest reading risk level were nearly twice as likely to receive multiple referrals as those identified as on track for positive reading outcomes. The authors suggested that assessment at the end of kindergarten was more predictive than at school entry because it represented response to a year of instruction. However, initial level and growth were not compared, so this hypothesis was not tested.</p>
<p>The results of the study lead to an essential and important question of whether prereading skill level is a fixed or malleable risk factor for problem behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1098300711403153">Hinshaw, 1992</xref>). Perhaps low academic skills at school entry are markers of more serious behavior problems, ones that are not easily moderated through Tier I academic instruction, or some unknown, underlying factor that causes problems in both academics and behavior. If so, low academic skill may indicate a fixed risk factor, and such skills are only predictors of future challenges. However, if low academic skill is a malleable risk factor, it can be altered to reduce risk, and hence represents an important variable for intervention in addition to identification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1098300711403153">Biglan, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The authors set out to extend the findings of McIntosh and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1098300711403153">McIntosh, Horner et al., 2006</xref>) in a different school district by assessing the utility of commonly used reading screening measures at the fall of kindergarten to predict nonresponse to SWPBS in Grade 5. Grade 5 was selected because it occurs after the shift from learning to read to reading to learn, allowing for the measurement of problem behavior that may have been caused by early academic deficits. It also represents a logical summative point for evaluating how well behavior needs were supported throughout elementary school. In addition, the authors tested the hypothesis that response to Tier I academic instruction also predicted problem behavior. The present study assessed two related questions: (a) Do prereading skills at the start of kindergarten predict multiple office discipline referrals in Grade 5, and (b) does change in prereading skills moderate this risk?</p>

<sec id="section6-1098300711403153">
<title>Setting</title>
<p>The study took place in a midsized urban school district adjacent to a large, metropolitan city in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. At the time of the study, the district had a total enrollment of approximately 12,500 students, with 16 schools, including 10 elementary schools. Six of the 10 elementary schools received Title I funding, and the percent of students receiving free or reduced-price lunch services in each school ranged from 7% to 62%. Ten percent of students were identified for special education services, and 13% of students were categorized as English-language learners. The majority of students (70%) were identified as European American, and the next largest group (25%) were identified as Latino/Latina.</p>
<p>The school district implemented an integrated schoolwide reading and behavior support initiative over the course of this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1098300711403153">Sadler &amp; Sugai, 2009</xref>). In the 2001–2002 academic year (the year after the participants were in kindergarten), district personnel added a Schoolwide Reading Improvement Model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1098300711403153">Simmons et al., 2002</xref>) to an existing SWPBS system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1098300711403153">Sugai, Horner, &amp; McIntosh, 2008</xref>) to create an integrated three-tiered response to intervention model. The result was a system in which school personnel implemented universal preventive practices in both areas and assessed fidelity of implementation, screened and monitored all students in the district, and provided a continuum of support for students not responding to universal support. Fidelity of implementation data for the reading improvement model were not collected during 2000–2001, but data for SWPBS were assessed through the <italic>Schoolwide Evaluation Tool</italic> (SET; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1098300711403153">Sugai, Lewis-Palmer, Todd, &amp; Horner, 2001</xref>), a research-validated measure of fidelity of implementation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1098300711403153">Horner et al., 2004</xref>). Five of the nine elementary schools received SET scores above the 80% overall criterion in 2001–2002 (mean = 79%; range = 50% to 92%), and seven of nine received scores above the criterion in 2005–2006 (mean = 86%; range = 73% to 98%).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1098300711403153">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>The study’s participants (<italic>n</italic> = 473) were all Grade 5 students in the district in the 2005–2006 school year who were enrolled for the entire Grade 5 and kindergarten years. Because of the nature of the research questions, students who transferred into the district after kindergarten or out of the district before Grade 5 were excluded from the study, but students who transferred out and back between these grades were included. Students who transferred between schools within the district were included. To determine if students who were excluded from the study had significantly different numbers of office discipline referrals, a <italic>t</italic> test was conducted. The mean scores were equal, and no significant results were found.</p>
<p>The sample was 78% European American, 13% Asian/Pacific Islander, 7% African American, 1% Latino/Latina, and 0.2% Native American. When compared to district demographics, the lower prevalence of students from Latino/Latina backgrounds was due to the higher rate of mobility of this population in the district. Fifty-five percent of participants were female.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section9-1098300711403153">
<title>Reading skill</title>
<p>Kindergarten prereading skills were assessed through <italic>Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills</italic> (DIBELS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1098300711403153">Good &amp; Kaminski, 2002</xref>). DIBELS is a set of standardized, research-validated measures that assess prereading and reading skills. DIBELS measures are individually administered three times per academic year (fall, winter, and spring) to monitor student progress toward positive literacy outcomes and identify those who require additional support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1098300711403153">Kaminski, Cummings, Powell-Smith, &amp; Good, 2008</xref>). DIBELS provides criteria for placing students into one of three categories of support needed (<italic>low risk, some risk</italic>, and <italic>at risk</italic>), based on research-validated benchmarks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1098300711403153">Good, Simmons, Kame’enui, Kaminski, &amp; Wallin, 2002</xref>). Students whose scores meet or exceed benchmark scores have a high likelihood (80% or higher) of becoming established readers by the end of Grade 3, and those with scores below the benchmarks require additional support to ensure their success. In a three-tiered model, <italic>low risk</italic> indicates that Tier I (universal) support may be sufficient, <italic>some risk</italic> indicates that Tier II (supplemental/targeted) support may be required, and <italic>at risk</italic> indicates that Tier III (intensive) support may be required.</p>
<p>In fall of kindergarten, two DIBELS measures are administered—Initial Sound Fluency (ISF) and Letter Naming Fluency (LNF). In ISF, students are provided with orally presented words (accompanied by picture representations) and asked to identify the first sound of each word. ISF assesses phonological awareness, the understanding of and ability to manipulate sounds in words (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1098300711403153">Adams, Foorman, Lundberg, &amp; Beeler, 1998</xref>). It is an important prereading skill that acts as a foundation for and significant predictor of future reading skills for both native English speakers and English-language learners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1098300711403153">Chiappe, Glaeser, &amp; Ferko, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1098300711403153">Lesaux &amp; Siegel, 2003</xref>). In LNF, students read aloud as many upper- and lowercase letter names as possible in 1 minute. LNF is a measure of rapid letter naming, assessing a student’s reading of letter names with speed and accuracy. Its role in the development of reading is unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1098300711403153">Pennington &amp; Lefly, 2001</xref>), though it is commonly considered as either a representation of underlying processing ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1098300711403153">Bowers, Sunseth, &amp; Golden, 1999</xref>) or an indicator of home exposure to print and a proxy for school readiness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1098300711403153">Wagner et al., 1997</xref>). Both of these constructs might be considered to be underlying, difficult-to-remediate variables that might give rise to challenges in both reading and behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1098300711403153">Hinshaw, 1992</xref>). Unlike phonological awareness, teaching letter names does not lead to direct improvements in reading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1098300711403153">Adams, 1990</xref>). However, rapid letter naming has been found to be predictive of future reading success, particularly for students at school entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1098300711403153">Nelson, Benner, &amp; Gonzalez, 2003</xref>). Alternate, equivalent forms of both ISF and LNF are administered in the winter of kindergarten to assess progress toward positive reading outcomes, and LNF is administered a third time at the end of the year. ISF and LNF measures show moderate to strong evidence of reliability and validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1098300711403153">Good et al., 2004</xref>), including adequate predictive validity from measures in one benchmark period to the next and performance on high stakes achievement tests (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1098300711403153">Ditkowsky &amp; Koonce, 2010</xref>) and treatment utility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1098300711403153">Hagans, 2008</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1098300711403153">
<title>Response to reading instruction</title>
<p>Response to reading instruction was measured by calculating change in reading risk status between the first and last administration of each DIBELS measure in kindergarten (ISF: fall to winter; LNF: fall to spring). These variables were categorical, dividing students into specific groups by initial and final risk status on each measure (e.g., <italic>low risk</italic> to <italic>low risk, low risk</italic> to <italic>some risk, low risk</italic> to <italic>at risk</italic>). These risk status categories are based on research-validated criteria, developed through receiver operating characteristic curve analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1098300711403153">Good et al., 2002</xref>). Change in risk level was used in place of raw scores to capitalize on criteria indicating meaningful changes in risk for reading failure, as small changes at the bottom of the distribution are more important than small changes at the top.</p>

<sec id="section11-1098300711403153">
<title>Level of problem behavior</title>
<p>Student problem behavior in Grade 5 was measured using total office discipline referrals (ODRs). ODRs are used to document serious incidents of problem behavior and provide an indicator of both individual student behavior and overall levels of problem behavior in the school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1098300711403153">Sugai, Sprague, Horner, &amp; Walker, 2000</xref>). School personnel issue ODRs to students for a defined set of severe behavior violations, such as physical aggression or harassment. In reality, an ODR represents a behavioral chain, including (a) the problem behavior, (b) observation of the behavior by school personnel, (c) determination whether the behavior meets criteria for an ODR, and (d) completing the ODR form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1098300711403153">Sugai et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>There is a growing body of evidence that when the process and specific behaviors are operationally defined, ODRs can be a valid and reliable indicator of behavior. Irvin and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1098300711403153">Irvin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1098300711403153">Irvin, Tobin, Sprague, Sugai, &amp; Vincent, 2004</xref>) present data in support of adequate construct validity of ODRs for individual decision making, particularly in elementary school settings. Concurrent validity evidence has been documented through moderate to strong correlations between ODRs and events of disruptive behavior in schools, student and teacher perceptions of behavior, and diagnoses of behavior disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1098300711403153">Irvin et al., 2004</xref>). In addition, ODRs possess strong predictive validity, with significant prediction of both future ODRs and negative school outcomes, such as suspension and dropout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1098300711403153">McIntosh, Flannery, Sugai, Braun, &amp; Cochrane, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1098300711403153">McIntosh, Frank, &amp; Spaulding, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1098300711403153">Tobin &amp; Sugai, 1999</xref>). Nevertheless, some caution must be used in interpreting ODRs. ODRs are indirect measures of behavior, and confounds such as teacher bias and poorly defined criteria may compromise their validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1098300711403153">Kern &amp; Manz, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1098300711403153">Nelson, Benner, Reid, Epstein, &amp; Currin, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The fidelity of use of ODRs in the district was indicated through the SET’s Monitoring subscale, which assesses the standardization of the ODR form, use of a system for collecting and summarizing referrals, and use for decision making. The average percentage of implementation for this subscale was 93%, with a range of 75% to 100%.</p>
<p>The criterion used for determining nonresponse to SWPBS (i.e., elevated levels of problem behavior) was receiving two or more ODRs in a single school year. Only ODRs for major offenses (e.g., fighting, vandalism) were used. According to SWPBS logic, if students receive multiple ODRs in a year, they are not being adequately supported by Tier I support and require additional intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1098300711403153">Horner et al., 2005</xref>). Two recent studies have validated this two or more ODRs cut point by demonstrating statistically significant differences in ratings of problem behavior on the <italic>Behavior Assessment Scale for Children 2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1098300711403153">Reynolds &amp; Kamphaus, 2004</xref>) and <italic>Social Skills Rating System</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1098300711403153">Gresham &amp; Elliott, 1990</xref>) between students with zero to one ODR and two or more ODRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1098300711403153">McIntosh, Campbell, Carter, &amp; Zumbo, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1098300711403153">Walker, Cheney, Stage, &amp; Blum, 2005</xref>). In the former study, students with two or more ODRs had mean externalizing behavior ratings that were one standard deviation higher (and in the clinically significant range) than those with zero to one ODRs.</p>
<p>To identify whether there were differences in reading skills between students with two or more ODRs and students with zero or one ODRs in Grade 5, scores on the state’s Grade 5 reading achievement test were used. Results of a <italic>t</italic> test indicated statistically significantly lower reading achievement for students with two or more ODRs, <italic>t</italic>(471) = 4.55, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001.</p>

<title>Design and Analyses</title>
<p>The design included repeated measurement of DIBELS ISF and LNF (level and change) in kindergarten as predictor variables and ODRs in Grade 5 as the outcome measure. Logistic regression was selected as the most relevant and instructionally useful analysis for this study. Logistic regression is a type of multiple regression in which multiple predictor variables are tested, but the outcome variable is dichotomous (i.e., students receiving either zero to one or two or more ODRs in Grade 5). Logistic regression is advantageous when (a) variables have a nonnormal distribution, (b) the outcome variable divides students into meaningfully different groups, and (c) it is useful to know the conditional probabilities of the outcome given particular scores on the predictor variables. The data set and design met all three of these criteria. First, Grade 5 ODRs had a strong positive skew and violated the assumption of normality. This data pattern has been documented in other studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1098300711403153">McIntosh, Frank, et al., 2010</xref>), and analysis using traditional multiple regression is ill advised. Second, as described above, it is important for school teams to discriminate between students who require additional behavior support and those who are being supported adequately by universal systems. Third, conditional probabilities, especially as early as kindergarten, can be used to predict and prevent negative individual outcomes.</p>
<p>Two logistic regression analyses were conducted and compared. The first analysis included prediction of multiple ODRs from two reading scores (DIBELS ISF and LNF) in September of kindergarten (i.e., school entry). The second analysis included the two initial predictors and added two change in reading risk status variables (one for each measure). Both analyses were completed using a backward stepwise likelihood ratio method, in accordance with previous studies using logistic regression analyses of ODR data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1098300711403153">McIntosh, Horner, et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1098300711403153">Tobin &amp; Sugai, 1999</xref>). With a backward stepwise method, all predictor variables were entered at the first step and removed if they did not meet the cutoff criterion (set at α = .05). Additional steps were computed and variables were removed if they did not meet the criterion at any step. The final step was indicated when no variables were removed from the model. The level of statistical significance was set at α = .01. Once the final models were computed for each analysis, the two models were then compared based on (a) model fit (χ<sup>2</sup> statistic), (b) percentage of variance explained by the predictors in the model (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> statistic), and (c) accurate prediction of the outcome (log likelihood ratio) using a χ<sup>2</sup> test for model improvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1098300711403153">Kline, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Because change in risk status was a categorical variable, it was necessary to examine the data set before the second analysis to identify and exclude empty cells (i.e., categories in which no participants received multiple ODRs). Logistic regressions cannot be computed with empty cells, and the commonly accepted solution is to exclude these categories from the analysis and note any patterns of empty cells when reporting results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1098300711403153">Simonoff, 1998</xref>).</p>

<title>Missing Data</title>
<p>Within the data set, all students had complete data for initial reading scores and the outcome measure. Overall, more than 90% of participants had complete data, and the missing data included 54 reading scores in winter and spring (&lt;3% of total cells). Visual analysis suggested that the data were missing at random, as the majority of students with missing data had only one score missing in kindergarten and intact scores in later grades. To avoid the challenges associated with listwise deletion, we used multiple imputation procedures, a method of predicting missing data values based on patterns in the data set. Multiple imputation provides a more accurate model of data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1098300711403153">Baraldi &amp; Enders, 2010</xref>). We used the multiple imputation program NORM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1098300711403153">Schafer, 1999</xref>) and set a lower bound of zero for imputed values.</p>

<title>Prediction From Initial Scores</title>
<p>The first logistic regression analysis assessed the prediction of multiple ODRs from DIBELS ISF and LNF scores at the start of kindergarten. Both DIBELS ISF and LNF were retained in the model and were statistically significant predictors of multiple ODRs (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001 and .01, respectively). Results from the model fit analysis (χ<sup>2</sup> = 365.87, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) were statistically significant. The high percent of variance explained by the model (72%) indicated that the predictor variables explained a large degree of variance of the outcome. Finally, the high log likelihood ratio (<italic>LL</italic> = 289.95) indicated that although prediction was statistically significant, the prediction was only moderately accurate.</p>

<p>Before the second set of analyses could be completed, it was necessary to remove categories with empty cells. Two change in reading risk categories for ISF (<italic>some risk to low risk</italic> and <italic>high risk to low risk</italic>) and one category for LNF (<italic>high risk to low risk</italic>) contained no students who received multiple ODRs in Grade 5, meaning that all students who moved from a higher risk category (at the start of the year) to meeting the benchmark (in the middle of the year) had one or fewer ODRs.

<p>The second analysis assessed both DIBELS ISF and LNF scores at the start of kindergarten and change in risk status for both variables.

DIBELS ISF and change in ISF risk status were retained in the model and were statistically significant predictors (both at <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study explored how results from prereading screening measures at school entry and change in scores through kindergarten predicted problem behavior in Grade 5, indicating nonresponse to Tier I SWPBS. DIBELS measures at the start of kindergarten were used to predict multiple ODRs in Grade 5, and then change in skills (presumably as a result of instruction) was added to the model. Results of the first analysis indicated that initial level of DIBELS Initial Sound Fluency (ISF) and Letter Naming Fluency (LNF) both significantly predicted multiple ODRs, but when change in risk was included in the model, initial level and growth of ISF were significant predictors, but LNF was not. Including change in skills in the model resulted in significantly stronger and more accurate prediction of response to Tier I SWPBS.</p>
<sec id="section21-1098300711403153">
<title>Initial Reading Level as a Risk Factor</title>
<p>Reading skill at school entry was a statistically significant predictor of nonresponse to SWPBS 6 years into the future. These results confirmed those of McIntosh and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1098300711403153">McIntosh, Horner et al., 2006</xref>) that a phonological awareness fluency measure predicted multiple ODRs in Grade 5. Yet this study predicted the same distal outcomes from earlier measures, at the point of school entry, as opposed to the end of kindergarten. At the start of kindergarten, both phonological awareness and rapid letter-naming skills predicted unique variance in behavior outcomes. Results demonstrate that students’ literacy skills at school entry contribute to future behavior challenges.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-1098300711403153">
<title>Change in Reading Level as a Risk Factor</title>
<p>When considering change in skills, not only did prediction significantly improve but ISF (level and change) became the sole predictive measure. LNF no longer contributed unique variance and fell below criteria for inclusion in the model. These results show that the developmental models for risk in both literacy and behavior are remarkably similar. Consistent with previous research regarding prediction of reading skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1098300711403153">Pennington &amp; Lefly, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1098300711403153">Torgesen, Wagner, Rashotte, Burgess, &amp; Hecht, 1997</xref>), comparing the two models indicates a shift through kindergarten from rapid letter naming to phonological awareness as the strongest predictor of problem behavior, providing support for a skill-deficit model of risk factors for behavior challenges. Moreover, results show that risk factors are not fixed and that individual response is an important variable to measure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1098300711403153">Simos et al., 2007</xref>). Rapid letter-naming measures are often perceived to mark either a fixed trait (processing speed) or exposure to print before school entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1098300711403153">Pennington &amp; Lefly, 2001</xref>). Including change in the model removed these factors as the most likely explanations and left level and growth in a more malleable skill—phonological awareness—as the sole predictor.</p>
<p>As such, these results are encouraging to those seeking to improve outcomes in behavior through early academic instruction. The second, more powerful model lends support to the academic skills deficit pathway to problem behavior, in which low academic skills occasion problem behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1098300711403153">McIntosh, Horner, et al., 2006</xref>), but remediating these skill deficits through academic intervention can result in improved social behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1098300711403153">Filter &amp; Horner, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1098300711403153">Preciado et al., 2009</xref>). These results suggest that quality classroom instruction in literacy skills, in kindergarten, may prevent future problem behavior.</p>
<p>Further support for this conclusion comes from analyzing patterns of empty cells. Missing cells in logistic regression analyses do not necessarily indicate inadequate sample size; if the patterns match hypotheses, such results may indicate powerful prediction of the outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1098300711403153">Simonoff, 1998</xref>). In this case, the only empty cells were in the multiple ODR outcome for students who moved from either <italic>at risk</italic> or <italic>some risk</italic> to <italic>low risk</italic> in ISF. Each student who moved from a higher risk level in September to the low risk level in January had fewer than two ODRs in Grade 5. As such, a strong change (i.e., response to reading instruction) substantially mitigated risk in behavior, even for students who entered kindergarten with the highest reading risk. Even with the removal of these categories from the statistical analyses (and loss of power from the removal of 28 students), results for change in risk were still statistically significant, and the model explained 77% of the variance in the outcome.</p>
<p>The conditional probabilities shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1098300711403153">Table 2</xref> illustrate important points of the change in risk as students acquire (or do not acquire) early literacy skills. In addition to the reduction in risk associated with complete reduction of reading challenges, there was a pattern of incremental reductions in risk based on the level of response to instruction. Students who started <italic>at risk</italic> but moved down one tier to <italic>some risk</italic> had their risk cut in half, indicating that even improving students’ academic skills to some extent (even if not completely to criterion) may reduce students’ risk for behavior challenges considerably. An opposite but expected effect was observed for students whose initial ISF level indicated <italic>low risk</italic> for reading challenges. Students who started kindergarten at <italic>low risk</italic> in phonological awareness and remained at <italic>low risk</italic> had only a 3% probability of receiving multiple ODRs in Grade 5. However, those students who started at <italic>low risk</italic> but were at <italic>high risk</italic> in January were nearly 6 times more likely to receive multiple ODRs. Hence, those students who started on track but with minimal growth in skills were at the highest level of risk, higher than students who started <italic>at risk</italic> and remained <italic>at risk</italic>. These results may be explained in part by examining those students’ individual classroom experiences. It is possible that perceiving other students’ skills improving while grade-level tasks become more and more aversive puts students at high risk for chronic problem behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1098300711403153">McIntosh, Horner, et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1098300711403153">Figure 1</xref> sheds additional light on the phenomenon. The abrupt increase in rate of ODRs coincides with the shift in Grade 3 from learning to read to reading to learn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1098300711403153">Heath, 1980</xref>). Because of these challenges, these students may have increasingly encountered aversive task demands across all domains of instruction, evoking both problem behavior from the student and decreased opportunities to respond from teachers, limiting access to reinforcement for correct responding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1098300711403153">Carr, Taylor, &amp; Robinson, 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>In sum, the difference in predictive accuracy between the two models reflects that some students who enter kindergarten with lower skills may respond to early kindergarten instruction and are therefore inaccurately classified (false positives) when only considering initial skills. Meanwhile, students who start on track but fall behind—the students at greatest risk—were also inaccurately classified (false negatives). In other words, screening students for reading at school entry paints a potentially useful but incomplete picture: It identifies initial need but not necessarily need after receiving instruction. These results suggest that this response to preventive academic instruction directly predicted response to preventive behavior support.</p>

<sec id="section23-1098300711403153">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>There are a number of key limitations to this study. First, the only variables tested in these models were screening measures and did not include complete assessment of all factors that could contribute to the development of problem behavior. For example, unmeasured behavior challenges in kindergarten may have accounted for lack of response to both reading and behavior intervention, indicating that the academic intervention delivered did not include a sufficient behavior support component. Second, because the quality of literacy instruction in kindergarten was not assessed, the results do not show that quality instruction changed trajectories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1098300711403153">Algozzine &amp; Algozzine, 2009</xref>)—only that for those whose trajectories changed, their outcomes were improved. Changes in scores could have been due to exposure to any kind of literacy instruction (even low quality) or measurement error. Future research should document how the quality of instruction may affect risk for problem behavior. Third, results should be interpreted with caution because ODRs are extant data and use can vary across teachers. Although SET results indicated that the ODR systems were implemented with fidelity, variability in use cannot be ruled out.</p>

<title>Implications</title>
<p>These results show the importance of both early <italic>and</italic> ongoing literacy assessment in kindergarten. This study provides evidence that contrary to some stances, scores at school entry do indeed signal risk that needs to be addressed as early as possible. Measuring literacy skills at school entry seems prudent for early intervention. However, it is clear from these findings that risk factors are not fixed, and that risk can change as a result of instruction. As such, systems that combine early schoolwide screening and progress monitoring show the best promise for improving student outcomes (L. S. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1098300711403153">Fuchs &amp; Fuchs, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Although screening and progress-monitoring systems are important, student outcomes are only enhanced through high-quality instruction. Research in the district studied documents the effects of implementing a schoolwide reading support system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1098300711403153">Sadler &amp; Sugai, 2009</xref>). At the start of the current study (and before implementing the system), the total proportion of kindergarten students <italic>at risk</italic> in phonological awareness was reduced from 18% in fall to 8% in spring. By the end of this study (after systems were implemented), the number of kindergarten students <italic>at risk</italic> was reduced from 21% in fall to 3% in spring. Risk was reduced through quality kindergarten instruction.</p>
<p>These results are consistent with research showing that quality classroom instruction can simultaneously ameliorate academic and social behavior problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1098300711403153">Ialongo, Poduska, Werthamer, &amp; Kellam, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1098300711403153">Lane &amp; Menzies, 2003</xref>). Quality kindergarten instruction is a more effective approach than waiting until students show clear signs of challenges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1098300711403153">Snow, Burns, &amp; Griffin, 1998</xref>). Student academic success can be facilitated before chronic academic failure leads to chronic problem behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1098300711403153">Merton, 1968</xref>). In this study, the difference in behavior outcomes for these students was affected by their reading skill growth from September to January of kindergarten. This time frame leads to a critical message: If schools do not teach literacy skills from the start of kindergarten, negative trajectories may be harder to change.</p>
<p>Another important implication is the integration of existing data. To conduct this research, the authors merged two separate data sets. Creating integrated databases with academic and behavior data presents promise for school personnel. Examining both types of data together allows for more effective screening, particularly in kindergarten, when ODRs are more susceptible to false negatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1098300711403153">McIntosh, Horner, et al., 2006</xref>). Accessing existing DIBELS data may allow behavior teams to flag students requiring behavior support more quickly.</p>
<p>But beyond simply sharing data, there has been an increase in interest in integrated systems in reading and behavior support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1098300711403153">McIntosh, Goodman, &amp; Bohanon, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1098300711403153">Stewart, Benner, Martella, &amp; Marchand-Martella, 2007</xref>). Research on integrated models has often shown improved results in both reading skills and social behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1098300711403153">Lane et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1098300711403153">Lane, O’Shaughnessy, Lambros, Gresham, &amp; Beebe-Frankenberger, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1098300711403153">McIntosh, Chard, Boland, &amp; Horner, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1098300711403153">Sadler &amp; Sugai, 2009</xref>). Given these results and the many shared features of academic and behavior support systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1098300711403153">Algozzine &amp; Algozzine, 2009</xref>), it seems prudent to research exactly how systems can be integrated efficiently and effectively.</p>
