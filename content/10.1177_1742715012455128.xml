<p>This article argues that engaging support staff in leadership is likely to develop their role informally and complement teacher leadership. To this end, I examined the views of a group of teaching assistants (TAs) and higher level teaching assistants (HLTAs) in the English Midlands on leadership, the barriers to participation in leadership and the ways to improve their role. It also examines the extent to which their levels of experience should be taken into account when engaging support staff in leadership. Two methods of data collection generating quantitative and qualitative data were used: a survey and follow-up semi-structured interviews. The findings indicated that leadership, among other things, should focus on creating an atmosphere conducive to fostering collaboration and participation in decision-making. Although the participants aspired to collaborate with teachers in leading classrooms, they faced a number of barriers. A number of suggestions were made on how to improve their role.</p>

<p>This article examines the views of teaching assistants (TAs) and higher level teaching assistants (HLTAs) on leadership, the barriers to participation in leadership and ways to improve their role. The article argues that engaging them in leadership is likely to develop their role informally and complement teacher leadership. In the 1960s and 1970s it was not common to find TAs in the mainstream schools in the UK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1742715012455128">Hryniewicz, 2008)</xref>, unlike in the USA where the role is well recognised and referred to as ‘para-educator’ or ‘para-professional’, with national statistics showing over 525,000 para-educators employed across the USA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1742715012455128">NCES, 2000</xref>). Although there is lack of TAs in schools in other countries like China, their important role in addressing student learning difficulties and the impact they could have on teacher practice have been acknowledged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1742715012455128">Tan, 2006</xref>). In Spain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1742715012455128">e-Include, 2011</xref>) and Ireland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1742715012455128">Rose and O'Neill, 2008</xref>) their role seems to be more related to promoting inclusive education. There were 177,000 TAs in England in 2008 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1742715012455128">BBC, 2008</xref>) and the value and support which they can offer was acknowledged by the previous Labour government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1742715012455128">Balshaw and Farrell, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The job titles of support staff vary depending on their role in schools. For example, they may work as learning support assistants; special needs assistants or non-teaching assistants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1742715012455128">Balshaw and Farrell, 2002</xref>). In this research, I focused on those who were employed as TAs and HLTAs. TAs’ contribution to teaching and learning is mainly within the classroom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1742715012455128">Drake et al., 2004</xref>). In 2002 an educational role for support staff was introduced and within six years over 21,000 TAs had acquired the new HLTA status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1742715012455128">Townsend and Parker, 2009</xref>). Unlike TAs, their role may change after they gain the HLTA status as they work outside classrooms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1742715012455128">Drake et al., 2004</xref>) and they become more autonomous, although they may not be offered a new post (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1742715012455128">Townsend and Parker, 2009</xref>). Despite these changes, the classroom teacher still needs to supervise and guide TAs and HLTAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1742715012455128">Hryniewicz, 2008</xref>). Bearing in mind the limitation of their role, would it be important to engage TAs and HLTAs in leadership? If yes, how could leadership be incorporated into their roles? It must be noted that support staff must understand leadership if they wish to have leadership responsibilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1742715012455128">Kamen, 2008)</xref>, which is why this article examines their views on leadership. Support staff leadership seems to be an uncharted territory, and the fact that support staff were often not consulted in previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1742715012455128">Hancock and Collins, 2005</xref>) highlights the significance of this aspect of research. The article also examines whether or not length of experience should be taken into account when engaging support staff in leadership; few studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1742715012455128">Balshaw and Farrell, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1742715012455128">Gerschel, 2005</xref>) indicate that leadership might be assigned to experienced TAs.</p>
<sec id="sec2-1742715012455128"><title>Leadership as a means of informal professional development</title>
<p>Professional development is ‘the process whereby people’s professionalism and/or professionality may be considered to be enhanced’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1742715012455128">Evans, 2008</xref>). The importance of continuing professional development (CPD) is widely recognised for all professionals to sustain their competence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1742715012455128">Muijs and Lindsay, 2008</xref>) and develop their professionalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1742715012455128">MacDonald and McGinley, 2010)</xref>, and this obviously includes TAs and HLTAs. Research has shown that developing the role of TAs through training improved their ‘competence and confidence, and led to better management of them within the school and by teachers in the classroom’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1742715012455128">HMI, 2002</xref>: 5). According to this HMI report, ‘a few schools are beginning to encourage teaching assistants to compile portfolios of their qualifications and experience […] making the most of such abilities should certainly not threaten the professionalism of teachers; rather, it should be encouraged and developed to the full’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1742715012455128">HMI, 2002</xref>: 15, 18). In addition to the formal professional development, the engagement of TAs and HLTAs in leadership could be seen as an <italic>informal</italic> way, as this article argues, to expand the use of their skills and develop their role. Another reason to make the most of their skills through leadership is that training is not always available. Although gaining HLTA status might have a positive impact on TAs, it might be an unaffordable option, as funding to attain the status has been withdrawn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1742715012455128">Garner, 2010</xref>). In addition, the shift in the responsibilities of TAs after gaining their HLTA status seems to focus mainly on teaching whole classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1742715012455128">Burgess and Shelton Mayes, 2009)</xref>, which might not cater for their <italic>other</italic> skills. The need for para-educators in the USA to have a specific plan to engage them more effectively in schools as a form of CPD was stressed recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1742715012455128">Stocker, 2009)</xref>, hence the call for engaging them in leadership. However, a discussion of their potential role in leadership should not be isolated from teacher leadership<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1742715012455128">1</xref></sup> for two reasons. Firstly, support staff work under the guidance of teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1742715012455128">Hryniewicz, 2008</xref>). Secondly, leadership’s positive impact on teachers' professionalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1742715012455128">McCay et al., 2001</xref>) suggests that engaging support staff in leadership might have similar impact on their practice as well as complementing teacher leadership. So, how could TAs/HLTAs be engaged in leadership?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1742715012455128"><title>Support staff and leadership</title>
<p>It appears from the literature that HLTAs are more likely than TAs to be engaged in leadership, therefore, attention will be directed <italic>more</italic> towards the latter. Although the following examples indicate how leadership could be integrated in the roles of support staff, such opportunities are <italic>not</italic> always available to all TAs and HLTAs. Firstly, lead TAs (also referred to as Principal TAs) have shown their capability to lead effectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1742715012455128">Watkinson, 2006</xref>) other TAs and SEN departments in their school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1742715012455128">Townsend and Parker, 2009</xref>). Lead TAs lead TA teams in regular meetings, plan their professional development and maintain effective communication between their teams and other staff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1742715012455128">Gerschel, 2005</xref>). However, this might implicitly deprive team members, i.e. TAs who do not lead other TAs, from their entitlement to engage in leadership, especially if they have the desire and necessary skills. An example of engaging them in some form of leadership could be to assign the responsibility of running parents’ meetings to them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1742715012455128">Balshaw and Farrell, 2002</xref>). Secondly, in addition to supporting teachers in classroom management, TAs need to exercise some management skills, i.e. how to manage people, activities, resources and information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1742715012455128">Kamen, 2008)</xref>, if they wish to manage their teams effectively. Yet, these skills are not likely to be exercised if they are not responsible for leading other TAs. HLTAs, on the other hand, are likely to have some management responsibilities as part of their role, albeit management is not one of the HLTA standards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1742715012455128">Watkinson, 2005</xref>). Another example of engaging TAs/HLTAs in leadership might be through participation in collective decision-making. Unlike TAs, HLTAs are expected to engage in decision-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1742715012455128">Watkinson, 2003b</xref>). When asked about their perspectives on leadership one-third of the TAs in Layton’s study (2005) expressed their desire to have a role in school leadership/management. In fact, in order for them to be effective in managing other TAs, they must be engaged in school leadership and decision-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1742715012455128">Gerschel, 2005</xref>). However, the aim is to engage everyone in leadership, not just team leaders.</p>
<p>In addition to the above leadership practices, TAs/HLTAs could perform some of the practices of teacher leaders. The power of teacher leadership does not stem from being a teacher, but rather, the support that teachers offer to their colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1742715012455128">Donaldson, 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1742715012455128">Lemlech and Hertzog (1998)</xref> describe teacher leaders as those who work collaboratively and participate in additional and voluntary school activities. They tend to function both inside and outside classrooms. In classrooms, teacher leaders control students, create an appropriate classroom atmosphere and solve problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1742715012455128">Emira, 2010</xref>). Outside classrooms, they perform ‘additional tasks’, establish ‘wider knowledge’ and engage in ‘problem solving’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1742715012455128">Emira 2010</xref>: 603). They support colleagues in their classes, contribute to their professional development, engage in decision-making and share ideas and concerns about improving their practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1742715012455128">Donaldson, 2007</xref>). Although these teacher leader practices might raise the bar in terms of what support staff could do, there is a degree of overlap between such practices and what might be accessible already to some of them, i.e. Lead/Principal TAs. What might be required is to extend these leadership opportunities to <italic>all</italic> support staff through collaboration with teachers to complement what teachers do and expand support staff skills. So, how is leadership conceptualised in this research?</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1742715012455128"><title>The research conceptual framework</title>
<p>The conceptual framework is built on the concept of teacher leadership, where leadership is democratically and collectively shared by <italic>all</italic> school members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1742715012455128">Harris and Muijs, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1742715012455128">Watkinson, 2003a</xref>). It must be stressed that engaging TAs/HLTAs in leadership should be voluntary not compulsory. According to the research conceptual framework, leadership:

It is not bounded to certain situations/areas in schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1742715012455128">Emira, 2010)</xref>, nor does it divide between leaders and followers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1742715012455128">Bennis and Nanus, 1985</xref>).</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>However, participation in leadership is not without its difficulties, especially for support staff who experience low status in schools, lack of recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1742715012455128">Watkinson, 2004</xref>) and a number of other barriers.</p>
<sec id="sec5-1742715012455128"><title>Barriers to support staff leadership</title>
<p>Unlike HLTAs, who are more likely to engage in leadership, TAs are more prone to encounter a number of barriers. The first barrier is the negative attitude of teachers towards support staff. Although the remodelling of teachers’ work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1742715012455128">TDA, 2003</xref>) gave TAs the chance to expand and enhance their role in schools, lead classrooms and manage students, this was not welcomed by all teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1742715012455128">Hryniewicz, 2008</xref>). Teacher’s negative attitude towards support staff might be the result of seeing TAs as a threat to their own leadership. In spite of this improvement in a TA’s role as a result of the remodelling agenda, they should be aware of the limitation of their role and the fact that they <italic>must</italic> be led by their teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1742715012455128">DfES, 2000</xref>). This may vary depending on the school level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1742715012455128">Gerschel, 2005</xref>). This is why their potential role in leadership should be discussed in relation to teacher leadership to address such barriers.</p>
<p>The third barrier relates to the ambiguity of their role. Many TAs find it difficult to obtain a description of their responsibilities from their employer, let alone a detailed or a relevant one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1742715012455128">Nevin et al., 2008</xref>). The lack of clarity in a TA’s role was even expressed by school staff at different levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1742715012455128">Kerry, 2005</xref>). Moreover, the previous government’s aim of making TAs responsible for teaching in classes might have increased this lack of clarity by blurring the boundaries between the role of teachers and TAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1742715012455128">Gibson and Patrick, 2008</xref>). This lack of clarity may be further complicated by the fact that the views of TAs in general, let alone on leadership, are insufficiently represented in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1742715012455128">Hancock and Collins, 2005</xref>). HLTAs are not in a much better position either, as they also experience a lack of shared understanding of their different roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1742715012455128">Townsend and Parker, 2009</xref>). Support staff’s participation in leadership might be hindered also by the lack of recognition of their input, which is likely to have a negative impact on their confidence. It is worth emphasising here that the potential role in leadership is not intended to complicate further the unclarity of their role, or create substitute teachers. Rather, the aim is to develop support staff professionally, which will make a successful contribution to leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1742715012455128">Heardman, 2009</xref>). The question is, how could we improve their role?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1742715012455128"><title>The improvement of support staff role</title>
<p>Literature shows that the role of support staff can be improved in a number of ways. Firstly, by supporting their professional development both informally and formally. Informally, schools can facilitate the process of engaging support staff in leadership, as I argue in this article, to make the most of their skills and complement teacher leadership. Formally, schools should identify the needs of support staff and provide them with training opportunities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1742715012455128">Groom, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1742715012455128">Watkinson, 2006</xref>) funding permitting, a clear career progression strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1742715012455128">Hryniewicz, 2008</xref>) and clarify their role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1742715012455128">DfES, 2000</xref>) to make them effective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1742715012455128">Kamen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1742715012455128">Kerry, 2005</xref>). In addition to the role of school, TAs themselves need to identify ways to develop their ‘personal development objectives, professional development and training opportunities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1742715012455128">Kamen, 2008</xref>: 152). Keeping a professional development portfolio may become the basis for identifying their progress and their strengths and weaknesses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1742715012455128">DfES, 2000</xref>). What is more, by working as a team and exercising basic management skills, TAs can also enhance the development of their colleagues’ professional practice, i.e. sharing information, providing ‘learning opportunities’, ‘mentoring’ and supporting their ‘competence’ (Kamen: 156).</p>
<p>Secondly, another way in which the role of support staff can be improved is by maximising their existing skills. This could be done by assigning leadership responsibilities which match their own skills. TAs may have certain skills and strengths, and many have worked in sectors other than education. Identifying and employing these skills and strengths may indeed complement the educational process. Even if they do not have previous job experience, TAs will acquire over the years ‘hidden intellectual and practical knowledge’ by being members of the community of their school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1742715012455128">Burgess and Shelton Mayes, 2007</xref>: 390). For example, TAs who are familiar with the appraisal process could support other TAs who have not been assessed before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1742715012455128">Balshaw and Farrell, 2002</xref>). Bilingual TAs could work as a channel of communication with ethnic minority communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1742715012455128">DfES, 2000</xref>). Experienced TAs can even be involved in the professional development of novice TAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1742715012455128">Burgess and Shelton Mayes, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Thirdly, a TA’s role could be enhanced by encouraging them to perform additional roles which use their skills. The development of support staff’s practice requires them to view themselves as professionals, and this requires them to perform activities <italic>in addition to</italic> those defined in their job description (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1742715012455128">Watkinson, 2003b</xref>). One of these additional roles, as this article argues, is to engage in leadership through further collaboration with teachers. This is likely to complement teacher leadership and ultimately improve their role. Unless they feel that their contribution is valued, support staff should not be expected to work to their full capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1742715012455128">DfES, 2000</xref>). Therefore, fourthly, it is important to value their role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1742715012455128">Anderson and Finney, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1742715012455128">Dyer, 2001</xref>). One way of doing this is for stakeholders, colleagues and the school leadership to trust and believe in the skills, knowledge and experience of support staff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1742715012455128">Heardman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1742715012455128">Townsend and Parker, 2009</xref>). Sending out the message that TAs are valued is a necessary step to foster their confidence. Many TAs felt satisfied in their job when they had time to talk with teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1742715012455128">Pittman, 2009)</xref>, let alone being allowed to contribute and collaborate with them. TAs also play a role in building their own confidence by ‘looking at themselves as teaching assistants or learners, <italic>understanding how they can develop</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1742715012455128">Drake et al., 2004</xref>: 34, italics in original).</p>

<p>A mixed method approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1742715012455128">Tashakkori and Teddlie, 1998</xref>) generated both quantitative and qualitative data through a questionnaire survey and a series of semi-structured interviews. The survey used Likert scale and closed questions to collect quantitative data and achieve a breadth of coverage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1742715012455128">Kelley et al., 2003</xref>). The survey was piloted and specifically designed for this research. Participants were requested to complete the survey online, although hard copies were available and posted where necessary. The statistical tests used in the analysis of the quantitative data included the Kruskal-Wallis test as well as descriptive statistics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1742715012455128">Pallant, 2007</xref>). Issues identified by the survey were explored in greater depth in the follow-up semi-structured interviews. Qualitative analysis involved interpretive reading of the data. The qualitative data were then broken into units, and grouped together to find themes to look at the data from a macro level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1742715012455128">Coffey and Atkinson, 1996</xref>). The local authority (LA) was approached to gain access to the schools and help recruit research participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1742715012455128">Creswell, 1998</xref>). All the participants gave their consent prior to taking part in research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1742715012455128">Christians, 2000</xref>). After introducing the research aim to them, they were assured that they could withdraw from the research at any time and that any data collected would be treated anonymously.</p>
<sec id="sec8-1742715012455128"><title>Sampling and research sample</title>
<p>To achieve maximum variation in terms of participants’ roles (TA/HLTA) and levels of experience, a non-probability sampling strategy for heterogeneity was selected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1742715012455128">Tashakkori and Teddlie, 1998</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1742715012455128">Mason (2002)</xref>, this sampling strategy is most appropriate when examining abstract notions like leadership and investigating resemblances and dissimilarities in the data collected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1742715012455128">Mason, 2002</xref>). A link to the online questionnaire was sent by the LA to all the schools in the targeted borough in the English Midlands. All schools were reminded (by phone/email) to encourage their support staff to complete the questionnaire. They were also asked to forward the questionnaire to colleagues and other TA/HLTAs from their network. The survey was completed by all the participants in the sample (<italic>n</italic> = 58: 41 TAs and 17 HLTAs). The three males in the sample were all employed as TAs. All the participants worked in a range of schools in the English Midlands (43% in primary; 36% in secondary; 21% in special/other schools). It was not the aim of this research to investigate any similarities or differences between the school phases. This could be a potential area for future research. Participants’ length of experience (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1742715012455128">Table 1</xref>) varied from less than five years to over 10 years. Their age groups range from (19–24) up to (45 and over). Although it may not be possible to generalise from the findings due to the relatively small size of the sample, some suggestions could be made about how to engage support staff in leadership. Whether or not these suggestions can be put into practice this is something schools will decide in light of their needs and the context in which they work. Further research is required on a larger scale in this area.

<p>Researchers specialised in school leadership were consulted to assess the extent to which the questionnaire items measured what they were supposed to measure, i.e. ‘content validity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1742715012455128">Creswell, 2003</xref>). Cronbach’s Coefficient Alpha was used to measure the internal consistency of the questionnaire items, using The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS), which was 0.849. The closer the value to 1, the higher the reliability would be (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1742715012455128">Pallant, 2007</xref>). The Sig. value of the Test of Normality for scale of leadership was 000, suggesting a violation of the assumption of normality, which is common with such a small sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1742715012455128">Pallant, 2007</xref>). A sub-sample of the participants was interviewed and asked different types of questions including ‘probes’ to check the researcher’s understanding and interpretation of what they were saying. Each interview was followed by a period of reflection about what the participants said during the interview and they were contacted for further clarification, if necessary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1742715012455128">Patton, 1990</xref>). A comparison between the findings of the survey and those of the interviews, in a ‘triangulation technique’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1742715012455128">Fielding and Fielding, 1987)</xref>, was another method used to check the reliability of the findings.</p>

<p>For the sake of clarity, TAs and HLTAs who completed the survey are referred to as ‘respondents’ when discussing the survey findings. Those who were interviewed are referred to as ‘participants’ when discussing the interview findings.</p>
<p>The survey findings focus on their responses to a set of statements on leadership. The interview findings also explore the views of support staff on the barriers to participation in leadership and ways to improve their role. The respondents were given 11 statements on leadership (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1742715012455128">Table 2</xref>) in the survey and were asked to show how far they reflected their concept of leadership. The statements were scaled from five to one where the two ends of the scale represent strong agreement and strong disagreement respectively. The middle point gave the respondents the option to select ‘Unsure’ where they could not agree or disagree about a specific statement. The majority of their responses to most of the statements centred around ‘strongly agree’ or ‘agree’, as shown in the combined percentage column. The statements were ranked in descending order, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1742715012455128">Table 2</xref>.

<sec id="sec11-1742715012455128"><title>Support staff leadership</title>
<p>Responses to the questionnaire confirmed most of the points listed under the research conceptual framework of leadership. The following themes are based on the analysis of the survey and interview findings:</p>
<sec id="sec12-1742715012455128"><title>It is more about the conducive atmosphere to ‘collaboration’ and participation in decision-making</title>
<p>The three most important aspects of leadership (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1742715012455128">Table 2</xref>), which were agreed upon by over 90% of the respondents centred on the support received from workplace, colleagues and their engagement in decision-making. The strong emphasis placed on ‘creating an encouraging atmosphere for working’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1742715012455128">Fullan, 2001</xref>) can be seen through the respondents’ responses to this statement, which had the highest percentage (98.2%). The fact that ‘leadership is about leaders’ authority’ had the lowest percentage (48.3%), suggests they are in favour of non-traditional top-down or heroic leadership style. This was supported by their responses to the other statements. It may suggest that leadership, from their point of view, is much more bottom-up, which allows ‘collaboration’ ‘sharing authority’, ‘participation in decision-making’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1742715012455128">Harris and Day, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1742715012455128">Leithwood et al., 2003</xref>) and ‘appreciating their autonomy’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1742715012455128">Richmon and Allison, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1742715012455128">Tranter, 2006</xref>), and much less about ‘leaders’ authority’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1742715012455128">Emira, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1742715012455128">Harris and Muijs, 2002</xref>). This might suggest that the respondents are aware that leadership might take different forms, for example encompassing collaborative and individual leadership. Leadership does not seem to be associated exclusively with formal leaders who are ‘authorised’ to be as such (48.3%). This explains why 91.4% believed that leadership is about collaboration and 84.5% of the respondents strongly agreed/agreed that it is also about ‘sharing authority’.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that, as <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1742715012455128">Table 3</xref> indicates, the Kruskal-Wallis Test did not reveal significant differences between the TAs and HLTAs of different lengths of experience (Group 1, <italic>n</italic> = 26: Less than five years; Group 2, <italic>n</italic> = 22: 5–10 years; Group 3, <italic>n</italic> = 10: 10 years +) in nine out of 11 items about leadership. These findings might imply that TAs/HLTAs conceptualise leadership in a similar way and experience should not be the only criterion for engaging support staff in leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1742715012455128">Balshaw and Farrell, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1742715012455128">Gerschel, 2005</xref>). Understanding leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1742715012455128">Kamen, 2008</xref>) is more important than the length of support staff experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1742715012455128">Usher, 1993</xref>). However, a statistically significant difference was found in the remaining two items (no. 4 and 5, highlighted in bold): p values are ≤0.05 (rounded), 0.03 (rounded) respectively.

Despite these differences, the overall survey findings seem to suggest that length of experience might not have a major influence on the views of TAs and HLTAs on leadership.

<sec id="sec13-1742715012455128"><title>Follow-up interviews</title>
<p>Six individual follow-up semi-structured interviews were conducted with a sub-sample of six participants (three TAs and three HLTAs). They were selected according to their role and the length of their experience, i.e. less than/more than five years (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1742715012455128">Table 6</xref>). They were asked open-ended questions about their views on leadership, barriers to participation in leadership and ways to improve their role.

<p>The interview findings confirmed, to some extent, the survey findings. Most of the participants, regardless of their length of experience, related leadership to collaboration: ‘Helping other people’ and ‘Work[ing] together as a team’. Their rationale for advocating collaborative and shared leadership is related to the positive impact of ‘working together’ and the fact that leadership is the responsibility of the whole ‘team’: ‘Helping people do their work better’ and ‘I don’t think you can do it [leadership] all by yourself’. The fact that four out of the six participants mentioned collaboration confirmed the survey findings about this point (91.4%). In addition to the importance of ‘collaborative leadership’, other aspects of support staff leadership were highlighted.</p>
<sec id="sec14-1742715012455128"><title>Multi-faceted</title>
<p>In addition to the importance of collaboration, support staff leadership seems to be multi-faceted (i.e. has a moral purpose and vision). Half of the participants suggested that leadership has a moral purpose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1742715012455128">Day et al<italic>.,</italic> 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1742715012455128">Fullan, 2001</xref>), which is about establishing ‘mutual respect’, making ‘fair decisions’ and paying attention to the provision of ‘care’ to the children. Two HLTAs linked leadership to having a vision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1742715012455128">Day et al<italic>.,</italic> 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1742715012455128">MacBeath and Myers, 1999</xref>) and the ability to ‘guide others in the right direction’.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec15-1742715012455128"><title>‘Fluid’ but needs support</title>
<p>In contrast with the survey findings, very few participants talked about the importance of creating an encouraging atmosphere for working/self-expression values and the belief that leadership is not bounded to certain situations or areas in school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1742715012455128">Emira, 2010):</xref> ‘If I was a leader/manager, I would hope that everybody would be able to talk and I would back my staff’ and ‘Leadership is a fluid thing which can shift depending on who takes action and the initiative’. These two points together imply that leadership should be shared and is not confined to positional leaders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1742715012455128">Emira, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1742715012455128">Harris and Muijs, 2002</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec16-1742715012455128"><title>Less about leaders’ position and more about their characteristics</title>
<p>The cautious emphasis placed by one participant on the importance of having authority (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1742715012455128">Emira, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1742715012455128">Harris and Muijs, 2002</xref>) and certain characteristics seems to echo the responses to statements 9 and 11 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1742715012455128">Table 2</xref>), which are two of the statements the respondents least agreed with: ‘I think if you want to be a leader/manager you need to have a title to be seen, but it does not necessarily make you a leader. Leaders need to be approachable and to be able to make fair decisions’ (HLTA 1). The need to have a title might be linked to the low self-esteem of support staff, which is discussed below as one of the barriers to support staff leadership.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec17-1742715012455128"><title>Participants’ views on the barriers to participation in leadership</title>
<p>Two groups of inter-related barriers (teacher and pupil related and support staff related) were highlighted: teacher and pupil perception of the role of support staff; negative attitude of teachers and pupils towards support staff; support staff perception of teacher leadership and support staff low self-esteem.</p>
<sec id="sec18-1742715012455128"><title>Teacher and pupil perception of the role of support staff</title>
<p>The reluctance to take part in leadership is complicated by how teachers and pupils perceive the role of support staff, which participants thought ‘should be changed’: ‘They [teachers] are the leaders of the classroom, for them, they would think we should follow them as we are supporting them in the classroom’ and ‘People’s perception hinders our participation in leadership, which is the biggest barrier to validate the actions we take in a leadership sense’. This confirms research that found that changes in support staff’s role following the remodelling agenda were not welcomed by teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1742715012455128">Hryniewicz, 2008</xref>). This is complicated further by the lack of clarity about their role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1742715012455128">Gibson and Patrick, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1742715012455128">Kerry, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1742715012455128">Nevin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1742715012455128">Townsend and Parker, 2009</xref>): ‘It’s very much blurred for what we do’ (TA 3). Teachers who consider support staff to be simply ‘followers’ are likely to deprive them of their right to have their voice heard and contribute to the education process: ‘We are not given the voice that we need’. In fact, support staff are also unable to communicate and convey to the school management what they can do and ‘how much the parents rely on us rather than the teacher’ (HLTA 3). Such narrow perceptions are likely to shape teacher attitudes and eventually that of their pupils towards support staff.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec19-1742715012455128"><title>Negative attitude of teachers and pupils towards support staff</title>
<p>It may not be a surprise that all the participants experience negative attitudes of teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1742715012455128">Hryniewicz, 2008</xref>) and pupils in their school by showing ‘disrespect’ to support staff, ‘patronising and downgrading’ their views, not seeing them in ‘a more responsible role’ or excluding them from the ‘team’: ‘If people put you off by saying you are not a teacher, you are not a member of staff, which happens a lot of the time, this attitude from staff or other pupils will block you up’ (TA 2). This gives the impression that support staff are not valued equally by other members of staff. Excluding them from the ‘team’ is likely to make support staff feel isolated and unsupported by their colleagues: ‘In many situations we have to deal with the problems we face’ (HLTA 3). However, this ‘downgrading’ of their views seems to be exercised by senior teachers only: ‘The younger teachers appreciate our roles and support’ (HLTA 1).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec20-1742715012455128"><title>Support staff perceptions of teacher leadership</title>
<p>The way participants perceived teacher leadership was another barrier to participating in leadership. Unless this barrier is removed, it will be very difficult for support staff to complement what teachers do. For them, teacher leadership is mostly about teaching and being in control of the classroom: ‘They are leaders because they are expected to teach and plan’. This confirms the findings of a previous study, which indicated that teacher leadership is more about what teachers do inside the classroom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1742715012455128">Emira, 2010</xref>). Although this form of teacher leadership (classroom management) is a joint responsibility of the teacher and support staff: ‘I think both teacher and TA should be in control of the classroom’ and, the ‘teacher should be the person seen as number one in the classroom, [but] I am also willing to assert my leadership role of corrective behaviour’, most of the participants, regardless of experience, are reluctant to step in and support the teacher in this process: ‘you have got to be careful when stepping in when a pupil misbehaves’ and ‘sometimes you can see in teachers’ eyes they are asking for help when the class gets out of control without verbalising it’. Therefore, teachers and support staff should be involved when discussing the potential role of the latter in leadership and how they could contribute to teacher leadership. The negative attitudes of other members of staff towards support staff and support staff perception of teacher leadership could have a negative impact on their confidence.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec21-1742715012455128"><title>Support staff low self-esteem</title>
<p>The findings showed that the negative attitude of teachers and pupils has serious damaging effect on the self-esteem of support staff, regardless of their experience: ‘sometimes you feel your opinion does not matter’ and ‘I think we are dispensable’. A TA and HLTA made explicit reference to low self-esteem: ‘I feel embarrassed sometimes to say to people I am a TA… I have got low self-esteem’ and ‘Teachers and pupils need to give us some self-esteem’. It could be argued that the ‘lack of progression’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1742715012455128">Hryniewicz, 2008</xref>) and lack of status have also contributed to their low self-esteem: ‘The lack of progression in our role, once I gained my HLTA, there is absolutely nowhere for me to go’. This might imply the limitations of their role. It is implausible to have a clear route for progression when their role is blurred and their job description deemed irrelevant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1742715012455128">Hammersley-Fletcher et al., 2006</xref>). They believe this lack of progression is linked to other reasons: ‘They [the school] won’t cover the courses’ and the fact that ‘HLTA is not recognised as a qualification, which I suspect is for political and financial reasons’. Although the majority of the participants believe leadership is more about informal ‘collaboration’, the lack of status or ‘title’ might also contribute to their low self-esteem. The lack of status might reflect how their profession is perceived. TAs ‘are not recognised as a profession in their own right’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1742715012455128">Watkinson, 2004: 4</xref>), which might explain the low status that they experience in schools. In fact, there is inadequate attention paid to support staff in schools and especially to TAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1742715012455128">Hancock and Collins, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Therefore, status was considered to be important but not crucial to participating in leadership: ‘If you want to be a leader, you need to have a title to be seen, but it does not necessarily make you a leader’ (HLAT 1). This tentative importance associated with having a ‘title’ suggests that support staff do understand what leadership is. It is the series of the above barriers along with the school hierarchical structure that still advocate traditional top-down leadership styles and exclude those who do not have the so-called ‘title’ from the leadership hierarchy.</p>

</sec>
<sec id="sec22-1742715012455128"><title>Participants’ views on the improvement of their role</title>
<p>Developing the role of support staff will contribute to the success of leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1742715012455128">Heardman, 2009</xref>). The analysis of the interview findings suggests that their role could be improved at both micro and macro levels. At a micro level, there is a need to change the narrow perception of teachers and pupils of the role of support staff, and to engage support staff in teacher leadership and classroom management. At the macro level, there is a need to enhance support staff and teacher training and professional support from outside the school.</p>
<sec id="sec23-1742715012455128"><title>At a micro level</title>
<sec id="sec24-1742715012455128"><title>Changing the narrow perceptions of teachers and pupils of the role of support staff</title>
<p>The role of support staff is ‘as important as the teacher; we are taking some of the pressure off the teacher’ and therefore, the way teachers and support staff perceive their role ‘should be changed’. They should see support staff in ‘a more responsible role’ so that their actions will be ‘very effective’ (TA 2). This is not going to happen, as two HLTAs indicated, unless their voice is ‘heard a lot more’ and the management ‘listen to what they say’. There is ‘more’ that support staff can offer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1742715012455128">Emira, 2011</xref>) and the school management need to know how much they do and how much they can offer. By doing so, the role of support staff may become clearer (DfES, 2000) and more effective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1742715012455128">Kamen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1742715012455128">Kerry, 2005</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec25-1742715012455128"><title>Engaging support staff in teacher leadership (classroom management)</title>
<p>The interview findings confirm to some extent the established literature in the area. Unlike some of the TAs in Layton’s study (2005), who wanted to have a role in school leadership/management, it was two HLTAs who were keen to be engaged in management and decision-making: ‘I would say to be part of the decision-making and planning’. One hoped to see people other than teachers managing because ‘TAs have managerial skills’, which should be employed more effectively. Engaging support staff in classroom management is likely to change how their role is perceived by broadening what they can do (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1742715012455128">Watkinson, 2003b</xref>).</p>
<p>Another way of engaging support staff in teacher leadership and taking pressure off the teacher is through assigning specialist teaching and learning related responsibilities to them. Through such responsibilities, support staff can offer specialist learning groups like citizenship, focus on exams, and become ‘pastor and mentor’. For this to happen, support staff should feel that teachers and schools value their role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1742715012455128">Anderson and Finney, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1742715012455128">Dyer, 2001</xref>); otherwise they will not get the best out of them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1742715012455128">DfES, 2000</xref>). Support staff too need to have self-confidence in what they can do: ‘The more you get to work with a wide range of pupils, the more it helps you to improve the recognition of what you have got to offer’ (TA 2). Hopefully, assigning such responsibilities as a form of informal professional development will contribute to enhancing their competence and self-confidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1742715012455128">HMI, 2002</xref>) and complement teacher leadership.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec26-1742715012455128"><title>At a macro level</title>
<sec id="sec27-1742715012455128"><title>Enhanced support staff and teacher training</title>
<p>Participants were aware that support staff may not have high levels of qualifications and allowing them to have ‘proper qualification rather than just a status’ (TA 1) is likely to raise the low status of support staff. This confirms the literature’s emphasis on the importance of professional development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1742715012455128">Groom, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1742715012455128">MacDonald and McGinley, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1742715012455128">Muijs and Lindsay, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1742715012455128">Watkinson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1742715012455128">Wilson et al., 2007</xref>). However, it is likely to be even harder to increase professional development for support staff after recent cuts in funding training for support staff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1742715012455128">Garner, 2010</xref>). Therefore, proactive and <italic>informal</italic> means of professional development will be required. Two TAs suggested that the prospective teachers should be trained as TAs first and the role of TAs should be incorporated in teacher training. By doing so, teachers ‘will understand our role and utilise us better’. Although it was ‘junior’ teachers, as mentioned above, who were more likely to value the contribution of support staff, those teachers still did not seem to ‘utilise’ the skills of support staff efficiently, hence the call for incorporating the role of TA in teacher training.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec28-1742715012455128"><title>Professional support from outside school</title>
<p>Being faced by all these barriers, which are likely to make support staff feel excluded and isolated, highlights the need to establish a professional body or union that supports them and which they can turn to where necessary: ‘NUHLT, the only union for HLTAs, is geared towards teachers not HLTAs, we are partly covered by them. There is not even a union for HLTAs’ (HLTA 1). Although it may be justifiable for one of the HLTAs to ask that teachers and pupils ‘need to give us some self-esteem’, this will not happen overnight. Support staff will eventually have high self-esteem as the ultimate outcome of a joint process where all stakeholders, ideally at both micro and macro levels, exert genuine efforts to make this happen.</p>

<sec id="sec29-1742715012455128" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Further research on a large scale in this area is required, as the findings are based on the views of a relatively small sample. This article argues that engaging support staff in leadership is likely to develop their role informally and complement teacher leadership. For them, leadership is much more about creating a conducive atmosphere for collaboration and participation in decision-making. Based on the research findings, length of experience does not seem to have a major impact on how support staff conceptualise leadership. Although the majority of the participants would like to collaborate with teachers and complement what teachers do, they are reluctant and aware of the barriers they face in schools. Two groups of inter-related barriers (teacher and pupil related and support staff related) were highlighted: teachers’ and pupils’ perceptions of the role of support staff; negative attitudes of teachers and pupils towards support staff (such as ‘disrespect’); support staff’s perceptions of teacher leadership and support staff’s low self-esteem. The research sheds light on how to address the barriers to participation in leadership and ways to improve the role of TAs and HLTAs at both micro and macro levels. At a micro level, there is a need to change the narrow perceptions of teachers and pupils of the role of support staff and engage support staff in teacher leadership (classroom management) and assign specialist teaching and learning related responsibilities to them. At a macro level, it was suggested that support staff and teacher training should be enhanced and support staff should have professional support from outside school. Stakeholders need to trust and believe in the skills, knowledge and experience of support staff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1742715012455128">Heardman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1742715012455128">Townsend and Parker, 2009</xref>). It is important that schools provide them with the necessary training where possible, but support staff <italic>themselves</italic> have a core role to play in being proactive and identifying how they can develop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1742715012455128">Drake et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1742715012455128">Kamen, 2008</xref>) their practice ‘<italic>informally’</italic>.</p>
