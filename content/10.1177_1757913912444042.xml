<title>Healthy Cities are a reality: old cities with old ideas can offer a future</title>
<p>With the relentless tide of global urbanization can a city with a thousand year history offer a vision of a possible future? Modest yet self-confident, Muenster in the North Rhine Westphalia region of Germany has been the site of visionary innovations. The proto-democratic socialism of the Anabaptists of the 16th century and as the major site for the negotiations leading to the Treaty of Westphalia in the 17th century, which laid the foundations of international law, this city has demonstrated what can be achieved by small but significant shifts in perspective.</p>
<p>The registered population of 300,000, swelled by nearly 50,000 students, make more journeys by bicycle than by car to take the title of the most bicycle orientated city in bicycle-friendly northern Europe. There is barely a road in the city without a dedicated route for cyclists. There are flocks of cycles on every street huddling together like urban pigeons. Large portions of the city’s roads are used for cycle freeways displacing motor traffic as a second class inconvenience. Amongst the cycles are designs built for every need from ‘sit-up and beg’ reliables to new designs for every age and pocket.</p>
<p>Muenster has expanded around a radial distribution of access roads connected by dual carriageways and ring roads. These star-shaped corridors interdigitate with ‘green zones’ defined by trees and city natures which feature rabbits rather than foxes. No trams and no metro, but a reliable system of buses support the bicycles with security racks at bus stops promoting the use of both forms of transport for integrated journeys. In the background there is the gentle purr of huge barges carrying hundreds of tons of freight via the canal network that links the major river systems.</p>
<p>Although the flat northern European plain has promoted some of these features there is also the frequently mocked German sense of social responsibility and discipline. Cyclists can be subject to spot fines for simple misdemeanors and the permitted blood alcohol level for motorists also applies to two wheelers carrying equal disqualification points. Cycling is then, a respected part of the social fabric; it is neither viewed as deviant nor defiant.</p>
<p>Physical activity follows in the wake of this positive approach to undermining car dependency. With networks of dual use cycle-footpaths across the city’s hinterland, walking for pleasure is also a valued part of urban life with cafe-pubs never far away. The use of these routes is aided by ‘conservative’ Sunday Trading regulations designed to save Sundays from shopping and DIY. Other regulations restrict the use of lawnmowers and power tools, tacitly to reduce noise but again facilitating family interaction and recreation. Whilst these approaches might appear overly restrictive to some, their impact on physical and mental health are enormous.</p>
<p>Mass transport is one of the fundamental parameters by which a state’s attitude to sustainability can be judged. It is no surprise that Deutsch Bhan, the electrified German Railway system, remains an integrated network un-fractured by different providers. This integration links high quality, health supporting cities by efficient, high quality, integrated transport. The ideology of Healthy Cities found expression nearly thirty years ago, what has the UK achieved in comparison?</p>

<title>Hairdressers should be trained to check for skin cancer</title>
<p>According to US Doctors hairdressers are an untapped resource and should be used to detect possible signs of skin cancer.</p>
<p>There is currently no general screening programme in the UK, despite the fact that 100,000 new cases of skin cancer are diagnosed every year. Up to a fifth of cancers can affect the skin and neck and lesions can easily go unnoticed. Hairdressers are therefore ideal when it comes to spotting such lesions.</p>
<p>Hairdressers would not be expected to diagnose any lumps but instead be asked to point out any abnormalities to their client. Work carried out by Nottingham City Hospital NHS Trust, in a poll; found that most hairdressers were keen to take on this role.</p>
<p>Sarah Williams, from Cancer Research UK, said: “Spotting skin cancer early makes treatment more likely to be successful. So it’s important to raise awareness of the changes to look out for and encourage people to visit their GP if they notice anything unusual.”</p>
