<p>This collection of 17 papers was compiled from the 2008 Georgetown University Round Table in Languages and Linguistics conference. As Schiffrin and De Fina explain in their introduction, papers were chosen for their contribution to ‘the underlying themes: the moral order, remediation of a story, the ‘‘master discourses’’ of Western culture’ (p. 2) and for their ability to build bridges between language, narrative and social life. The papers represent a wide and engaging range of topics and methodologies within the fields of narrative studies and analysis of discourse (e.g. analysis of Anime comics, courtroom discourse, dialogue with Alzheimer’s patients, high school students’ conversational exchanges).</p>
<p>The first three chapters introduce themes under which the remaining chapters fit. Thus William Labov (Chapter 1) introduces the moral order theme and his particular discourse analysis perspective by examining the mental and linguistic paths to a suitable place for beginning a narrative concerning violent or eerie events – ‘Where should I begin?’ This theme and various approaches to discourse analysis are taken up and explored further in Chapters 4 (Harré), 5 (Hansen, Moissinac, Renteria and Razo), 6 (Cohen) and 13 (Mandelbaum). Each chapter focuses on aspects of different theories (e.g. positioning theory, interactional sociolinguistics) which are explored or refined usually through the analysis of data made in different contexts (e.g. interviews with a researcher, family ceremonial dinners). Researchers who want to think about how the choice of theory affects analyses will want to closely read these chapters in particular.</p>
<p>The second major theme of the book is introduced by Richard Bauman in Chapter 2. He examines the effects of media and remediation by examining how the introduction of new media (phonographic recordings of American folkloric tales) remediated the telling of oral stories. This theme is taken up and focused around issues of identity construction by Malavika Shetty in Chapter 8 and Michael Bamberg in Chapter 9. Shetty investigated an Indian call-in television show and, through analysis of the dialogue, argues that such a medium was a vehicle for identity construction and maintenance for the otherwise marginalized and silenced speakers of Tulu. Her argument is interesting, but the evidence quoted in support would benefit from more exploration and analysis. For example, a television moderator’s comment that a caller used ‘beautiful Tulu’ is analysed by Shetty as being ‘a conscious attempt to change the way Tulu is perceived’ (p. 106) and ‘a conscious attempt to promote the idea of Tulu as a language that is capable of being beautiful’ (p. 107). That may well be accurate, but other interpretations are possible (e.g. the moderator was in part reacting to the sound or other prosodic aspects of the speaker’s voice).</p>
<p>The effect of a chosen medium for telling a story is taken up again in Chapters 16 (Herman) and 17 (Nazakian) which analyse how aspects of stories trigger inferences about people. However, in these two chapters the people are characters in published stories. Both chapters highlight the question ‘to what extent would . . . texts cue different worldmaking strategies if the information were parcelled out differently?’ (p. 206).</p>
<p>Jerome Bruner (Chapter 3) introduces the third theme by questioning our understanding of what ‘narrative’ and ‘culture’ are, and arguing that the very existence of a culture and the individuals (and their identities) within it depend upon the day-to-day narratives told. Chapters 7–15 all focus on aspects of culture or identity work in different contexts. For example, Modan and Shuman (Chapter 7) analyse and discuss the importance of space and place for creating aspects of identity; Mildorf (Chapter 11) investigates psychologically and linguistically interesting aspects of an interview (identity work, context influences and lexical and prosodic choices) with a graffiti artist; Hydén and Örulv (Chapter 12) use stories gathered from an Alzheimer’s sufferer in different contexts to discuss the identity work being done when memory loss is significant; and Chapters 14 (Carranza) and 15 (Rosulk) analyse criminal legal proceedings to discuss the transformations wrought on participants’ stories (evidence) by court officials intending to create various assessments of those stories by the jury.</p>
<p>Every chapter in the book raises interesting and critical issues about how theorists and researchers are to identify, understand and delimit the complex, transactional event(s) they purport to study and report on. <italic>Telling Stories: Language, Narrative, and Social Life</italic> is an extremely engaging collection of diverse papers that I would highly recommend to anyone doing or considering doing research involving narrative, discourse analysis or text analysis. The individual chapters in this book are fully worth reading independently, and taken as a collection interconnected by the three underlying themes, the book itself is a valuable contribution to the field of narrative research and discourse analysis. Because the chapters are diverse and not always theoretically explicit or commensurate with each other, I suggest the book is better read by postgraduates who have a reasonable familiarity with the fields of narrative, discourse and text analysis.</p>
