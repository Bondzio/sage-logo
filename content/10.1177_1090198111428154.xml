<abstract>
<p>Two distinctly different denial-based threat orientations (avoidance denial and optimistic denial) were examined using a message about the future risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) for young adults. Participants (<italic>N</italic> = 101) completed measures of denial-based dispositional threat orientations, current eating, comparative risk, and objective risk for CVD. They then read a high-threat message about CVD and rated their reactions of threat, denial, and worry. One month later, eating patterns in the past month were assessed. Both types of dispositional denial processes were associated with more self-distancing denial, but showed distinctly different, sometimes opposite, patterns of relationships with perceptions of threat, worry, and optimistic self-risk for CVD. In addition, the two denial-based processes were driven by different factors. The implications of these two denial-based threat orientations for the development of theory on denial and health messages, as well as the design of messages to change behavior, are discussed.</p>

<p>Denial is a process of protecting oneself from unpleasant or frightening aspects of external reality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1090198111428154">Breznitz, 1983</xref>) by “neutralizing negative self-relevant information” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1090198111428154">Wiebe &amp; Korbel, 2003</xref>, p. 185). This neutralization process is of particular interest to health behavior educators and researchers because it is believed to undermine motivations and intentions to protect oneself from a potential health threat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1090198111428154">Sandfort &amp; van Zessen, 1992</xref>). In fact, considerable research has documented that denial is associated with continued risky behavior and lower intentions to engage in health protective changes. Examples can be found across a variety of health-related behaviors. Smokers who use self-exempting beliefs to deny the dangers of smoking are significantly lower in readiness to quit smoking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1090198111428154">Peretti-Watel, Halfen, &amp; Gremy, 2007</xref>). Cardiac patients with higher cardiac denial scores have longer delays in seeking treatment for acute coronary syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1090198111428154">Perkins-Porras, Whitehead, Strike, &amp; Steptoe, 2008</xref>). Denying the personal risk of HIV is associated with lower likelihood of current and future protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1090198111428154">Ben-Zur, Breznitz, Wardi, &amp; Berzon, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1090198111428154">Sandfort &amp; van Zessen, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>A good understanding of how denial works is essential for health educators because knowledge about this process can lead to more effective ways of encouraging attention to relevant threats and engagement in protective behavior. Many health behavior models do not include the concept of denial. One exception is the extended parallel processing model (EPPM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1090198111428154">Witte, 1992</xref>) that provides a theoretical framework to explain the role of fear appeals in provoking a denial response. In this perspective, a fear-arousing communication that is accompanied by a sense of efficacy leads to a danger control position in which adaptive changes are made to avoid the threat. However, a fear-arousing communication that is accompanied by a low sense of efficacy initiates a fear control process that results in denial of the threat and similar defensive reactions. Thus fear, accompanied by low efficacy, is the primary motivator of denial.</p>
<p>Although EPPM has contributed to our understanding of defensive reactions, recent research suggests that in addition to fear- or anxiety-motivated denial, there is a second route to denial that is not associated with fear, in fact, is related to low levels of anxiety and fear. Research on the threat orientation model has found that individuals have a dispositional tendency to deny or not deny the self-relevance or validity of messages about potential threats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1090198111428154">Thompson, Schlehofer, &amp; Bovin, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1090198111428154">Thompson &amp; Schlehofer, 2008</xref>). Relationships between dispositional measures of the tendency to use denial and defensive reactions to information have been found across a great variety of threats, including the dangers of bisphenol-A, which leaches from household plastics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1090198111428154">Thompson, Schlehofer, Gonzalez, &amp; Denison, 2011</xref>), cardiovascular risk for young adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1090198111428154">Thompson, Robbins, Payne, &amp; Castillo, 2011</xref>), and a graphic antialcohol message (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1090198111428154">Brown &amp; Locker, 2009</xref>). Those who are higher in a denial-based orientation to personal threat are more likely to show defensive reactions such as derogating the validity or relevance of the message or denying the self-relevance of the threat even when objective evidence would indicate that it is relevant.</p>
<p>Most important, two distinct denial orientations have been identified: optimistic denial and avoidance denial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1090198111428154">Thompson &amp; Schlehofer, 2008</xref>). Optimistic denial involves optimistic beliefs regarding one’s vulnerability to future threats and a tendency to downplay or deny the self-relevance of potential threats without making behavioral changes. In contrast, avoidance denial is associated with anxiety in response to threats that leads one to avoid, derogate, or deny the self-relevance of information that one is at risk and increases the likelihood of not engaging in protective action. For example, those who had a stronger avoidant denial propensity remembered less about a message regarding a health risk than those with a weaker avoidant propensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1090198111428154">Thompson et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, construct validity work on the denial-based orientations revealed two very different patterns of correlations with other dispositional tendencies. Even though the two orientations were not correlated, they showed opposite patterns of relationship with dispositional optimism and neuroticism: Optimistic denial orientation was positively correlated with dispositional optimism and negatively correlated with neuroticism, whereas avoidance denial orientation was negatively correlated with optimism and positively correlated with neuroticism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1090198111428154">Thompson &amp; Schlehofer, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>These two distinctly different denial responses indicate the complexity involved in researching and understanding how and why people deny the relevance of a health promotion message. Individuals who are high in either of the denial-based orientations may use the same denial strategies such as questioning the validity of the information or exempting themselves from the implications, yet their underlying motivations are different. Denial that has its roots in threat and anxiety in response to information about a threat may be very different from denial that is prompted by an overly optimistic perception of personal vulnerability. Research on these two types of multifaceted responses to a threatening message is important because failing to consider this distinction may lead to inconsistent or confusing results regarding denial, for example, whether or not denial is prompted by worry and concern. Furthermore, the strategies that would reduce denial are likely to be quite different for the two orientations.</p>
<p>Because this is a fairly recent distinction there has not been research specifically on understanding the distinction between these two types of denial orientations. In the present study, we examine reactions to a fear-arousing health threat message regarding the future threat of cardiovascular disease (CVD) for young adults. CVD is a good threat to examine for a college student sample because recent evidence suggests that many young adults manifest CVD risk factors such as overweight, high blood pressure, elevated cholesterol, and high-fat diets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1090198111428154">Franklin et al., 2001</xref>). Furthermore, prospective studies find that higher risk factors in young adults are associated with future CVD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1090198111428154">Carnethon et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1090198111428154">Klag et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1090198111428154">Navas-Nacher, Colangelo, Beam, &amp; Greenland, 2001</xref>). Thus, CVD represents a real threat with measurable risk factors for this age group (e.g., unhealthy eating) and with behavioral changes that can be measured in the month following receipt of the message. Furthermore, CVD is not currently an issue of concern for most young adults which allows for a clearer test of denial.</p>
<p>The study had three goals. The first goal was to demonstrate that although both denial orientations are associated with more denial of future CVD risk, other reactions to the threat of future CVD (i.e., threat, worry, optimistically biased self-risk judgments) will be dramatically different. The differences are expected because avoidance denial is associated with a high-anxiety response pattern, but optimistic denial is associated with low anxiety and an optimistic belief in low personal risk. The second goal was to demonstrate through mediational analysis that the bases for denial differ between the two denial orientations with anxiety (worry) being the impetus for denial for those high in avoidance denial and optimistic judgments of self-risk being the impetus for denial for those high in optimistic denial. The final goal was to examine the effects of denial orientations on behavior change in the month following the receipt of the message with the expectation that a higher level of either denial orientation will lead to less change because denial propensities will reduce the motivation to change.</p>

<title>Overview of the Current Study</title>
<p>This study used a prospective design. At Time 1, two denial-based threat orientations, objective levels of risk for CVD, comparative risk judgments, and dietary patterns of college student participants were measured. Participants then received a message regarding CVD that was found to be threatening in previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1090198111428154">Thompson et al., 2011</xref>). Reactions to the message, including perceived threat, worry about CVD, and two ways to deny the information in the message, that is, message derogation (questioning the validity of the information) and self-distancing denial (distancing oneself from the implications), were measured. Participants received diet change tips and periodic reminders over the next 3 weeks to increase the chances that behavior change, if attempted, would be successful. Four weeks later, eating behaviors in the past month were assessed (Time 2).</p>

<sec id="section10-1090198111428154">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>College students were recruited by flyers posted on campus and through introductory psychology courses to participate in a psychological study. The nature of the study was not revealed in the flyers. Of the 106 who participated at Time 1, all but 5 completed the study for a completion rate of 95%. The 101 participants (60% women, <italic>M</italic><sub>age</sub> = 19.5 years, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.9) were from the following ethnic groups: 55% Caucasian, 24% Asian American, 9% Hispanic, 9% Multiethnic or Other, and 4% African American.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1090198111428154">
<title>Measures and Materials</title>
<p>The message and most measures are based on ones used in our previous research with CVD risk in young adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1090198111428154">Thompson et al., 2011</xref>). Unless otherwise noted, all items were rated on 7-point Likert-type scales.</p>
<sec id="section12-1090198111428154">
<title>Denial threat orientations</title>
<p>Dispositional measures of threat orientations have been developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1090198111428154">Thompson et al., 2006</xref>). Validity studies using a large national probability sample found that the scales were reliable and valid across a variety of demographic groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1090198111428154">Thompson &amp; Schlehofer, 2008</xref>). Participants completed two 10-item scales: avoidance denial and optimistic denial threat orientations. Sample items are “I tend to avoid information that I may be at risk for health problems” (avoidance denial) and “I generally do not worry about threats to my personal safety” (optimistic denial). The end points of the response scale were <italic>Not at all like me</italic> and <italic>Very much like me</italic>. The scales had good reliability (avoidance denial, α = .83; optimistic denial, α = .83).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1090198111428154">
<title>Cardiovascular disease message</title>
<p>The high-threat/high-difficulty version of the message from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1090198111428154">Thompson et al. (2011)</xref> was used. The message stated that young adults need to exercise and eat a healthy diet now to avoid future CVD and included information about risk factors for developing the disease, the severity of CVD, usual symptoms experienced, and the importance of taking preventive measures as a young adult, as well information about the dietary changes necessary to mitigate the risk of CVD. Manipulation checks in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1090198111428154">Thompson et al. (2011)</xref> study showed that the high-threat version of the message was significantly more threatening than a low-threat version and the high-difficulty version was seen as significantly more difficult than a low-difficulty version.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1090198111428154">
<title>Cardiovascular disease risk</title>
<p>Risk for developing CVD in the future was measured with the Disease Risk Index (DRI), an online survey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1090198111428154">Washington University, 2007</xref>). This 25-item tool collects information on well-established risk factors for CVD, such as demographics, medical history, family history, diet, smoking history, and physical activity. DRI scoring was used to produce a total score of risk for future heart disease. No studies, as far as we know, have used the DRI to predict future CVD for young adults. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1090198111428154">McMahan et al. (2005)</xref> used the autopsy results for young adults who died from external causes to show that coronary disease factors such as cholesterol and blood pressure predict the extent of atherosclerotic lesions in coronary arteries even at an early age. Furthermore, as mentioned earlier, higher risk factors in young adults are associated prospectively with future CVD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1090198111428154">Carnethon et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1090198111428154">Klag et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1090198111428154">Navas-Nacher et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1090198111428154">
<title>Threat of message</title>
<p>The perceived threat of the message was measured with two items: (message was threatening, scary). The items were significantly correlated and were averaged for a measure of perceived threat in the message, α = .77.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1090198111428154">
<title>Message derogation denial</title>
<p>Message derogation denial was measured with four items: (message was exaggerated, misleading, manipulative, convincing—reversed). The items were averaged to create a message derogation denial score (α = .78).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1090198111428154">
<title>Self-distancing denial and worry factors</title>
<p>Similar to previous research, four self-oriented denial indicators were assessed: self-exempting beliefs, relevance of CVD to young adults, personal susceptibility to CVD, and worry engendered by the message. The self-exempting beliefs scale had 10 items such as “You are not at risk for CVD if you have only one risk factor” and “I won’t get CVD because that sort of thing does not happen to me” (α = .73). Relevance of CVD risk to young adults was measured with two items (How relevant is this message to young adults? How serious is CVD? α = .52). Personal relevance of CVD risk was measured with four items (α = .80), including “How concerned are you about CVD?” and “Is CVD something you should pay attention to?” Worry was measured with three items (The message made me feel: tense, worried, concerned; α = .90). Higher numbers on each scale, relative to lower numbers, indicate more denial for self-exempting beliefs and lower denial for the other three (relevance of CVD to one’s group, personal relevance of CVD, and worry).</p>
<p>Similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1090198111428154">Thompson et al. (2011)</xref>, the four self-distancing variables were factor analyzed. Two factors emerged, accounting for 37% and 33% of the variance. Interpretation of the varimax rotation was that the first factor reflected high endorsement of self-distancing beliefs, along with the perception that CVD was not relevant to young adults, named “Self-Distancing Beliefs.” The second factor reflected a response of low worry and concern, along with low personal susceptibility and was named “No Worry.” Given orthogonal rotation, the factor scores were not correlated.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1090198111428154">
<title>Optimistically biased self-risk perceptions</title>
<p>Perception of personal risk was measured with an item asking, “Compared to other college students of your gender, what is your risk of getting heart disease in your lifetime?” The 9-point response scale went from “Much less risk than average” to “Much greater risk than average” with the midpoint, 5, labeled as “Average.” A second variable, optimistically based self-risk, was calculated by combining the DRI with comparative risk using a procedure similar to previous research to calculate an unrealistic optimism variable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1090198111428154">Dillard, Midboe, &amp; Klein, 2009</xref>). Participants were placed in three categories for each of the two variables, using cutoffs of 0.5 <italic>SD</italic> above and below the mean. Those who were in the top third of actual risk in the sample, according to the DRI, received a “2” if they rated themselves at low comparative risk and a “1” if they rated themselves at medium risk. Those in the middle third of actual risk who rated themselves at low comparative risk received a “1.” All other possibilities received a “0.” Thus a “2” on biased self-risk refers to those who are actually at high comparative risk for CVD, but rate themselves at low comparative risk. A “1” refers to those who either actually are at high comparative risk and rate themselves at medium risk or actually are at medium comparative risk but rate themselves at low comparative risk. A “0” refers to those who are not optimistically biased in their comparative risk assessments.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1090198111428154">
<title>Healthy and unhealthy eating</title>
<p>Items on the DRI that referred to healthy (e.g., whole grains, fruits, and vegetables) and unhealthy (e.g., butter, red meat, whole milk) eating were used to measure eating at both Times 1 and 2. Participants were asked to indicate how many times a week they consumed each item. Time 1 referred to usual eating; Time 2 referred to consumption in the past month. Separate sums of healthy and unhealthy eating were calculated.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-1090198111428154">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>The study was approved by the Pomona College Human Subjects Review Committee. All responses were given via a computer and took approximately 30 minutes to complete at Time 1 and 10 minutes at Time 2. At Time 1, participants read and signed an informed consent form, and then completed threat orientations, the DRI, the comparative risk variable, and the eating measure. After reading the CVD message and completing the threat, denial, and worry measures, they received healthy eating tips. These included addresses for websites that help with behavior change (e.g., <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sparkpeople.com">www.sparkpeople.com</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fitday.com">www.fitday.com</ext-link>), tips for making healthy eating choices in the college dining hall, and how to set goals. For the next 4 weeks, participants received weekly e-mail messages with more behavior change tips and filled out brief online surveys of their current eating. The tips and the weekly surveys were included to provide an optimal setting for behavior change to occur. At the end of the 4 weeks (Time 2), participants completed a measure of eating in the past 4 weeks. They were then paid $30 for their participation, debriefed, and thanked.</p>

For the predicted relationships that met that test, mediation was tested with hierarchical multiple regression that examined the relationship between a denial threat orientation and denial before and after the proposed mediator was in the equation. Hypothesis 6 was analyzed with multiple regression so that Time 1 eating behavior could be controlled when examining the relationship between a denial threat orientation and Time 2 eating.</p>

<title>Hypothesis 2</title>
<p>As expected, avoidance denial was associated with higher perceptions of the message being threatening; optimistic denial was associated with lower perceptions of threat. Fisher <italic>z</italic> transformations revealed that the correlation between a dispositional denial orientation and threat (<italic>z</italic> = 4.4, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) differed significantly between avoidance denial and optimistic denial.</p>

<sec id="section25-1090198111428154">
<title>Hypothesis 3</title>
<p>As was predicted, avoidance denial orientation was associated with more worry regarding the CVD threat whereas the optimistic denial orientation was related to less worry and concern. These two correlations differed significantly (<italic>z</italic> = 4.3, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section26-1090198111428154">
<title>Hypothesis 4</title>
<p>Also as expected, those higher in optimistic denial, relative to those lower in optimistic denial, demonstrated an optimistically biased self-risk assessment (i.e., perceived themselves to be at less risk for CVD than was indicated by their DRI score). Avoidance denial was not correlated with the optimistically biased self-risk variable. Although the pattern of the two correlations was as expected, they did not differ significantly (<italic>z</italic> = 0.88, <italic>p</italic> = .19).</p>

<sec id="section27-1090198111428154">
<title>Hypothesis 5</title>
<p>Worry was tested as a mediator between avoidance denial and both message derogation and self-distancing denial. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1090198111428154">Table 1</xref>, the avoidance denial and worry result meets the significant correlations condition to test mediation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1090198111428154">Baron &amp; Kenny, 1986</xref>). Avoidance denial is significantly correlated with both worry and with message derogation; worry and message derogation are also significantly correlated. Using hierarchical multiple regression to analyze message derogation as a dependent variable, avoidance denial was first entered into the equation and made a significant contribution (β = .22, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .03). In the next step, when perceived worry was entered, the contribution of avoidance denial was no longer significant (β = .14, <italic>p</italic> = .19). The Sobel test for mediation was significant, <italic>t</italic> = 2.2, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. Thus, the degree of worry mediates the relationship between avoidance denial and message derogation. The worry and self-distancing beliefs variables are independent factors from a factor analysis, so they are not correlated and mediation could not be tested.</p>
<p>Turning to mediation regarding optimistic denial, the test involving the biased self-risk variable met the conditions for mediational analysis. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1090198111428154">Table 1</xref>, optimistic denial threat orientation was significantly correlated with both biased self-risk and self-distancing beliefs. Biased self-risk and self-distancing beliefs were also significantly correlated. In a hierarchical regression analysis, the contribution of optimistic denial was reduced from, β = .24, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .02, in the first step to, β = .20, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, in the second step.

<p>To examine protective dietary behaviors used in the month after receiving the CVD message, two simultaneous entry multiple regressions were done with avoidance denial as the independent variable and either healthy behaviors or unhealthy behaviors at Time 2 as the dependent variable.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Dispositional denial orientations in this study played an important role in reactions to a health-threat message regarding CVD. Young adults who were high in avoidance denial used more message derogation and self-distancing denial in response to the message, found the message more threatening, were more worried about it, and were less likely to reduce their unhealthy eating habits in the month following their exposure to the message. In addition, worry about the threat mediated the relationship between avoidance denial and message derogation. Those high in optimistic denial also used more self-distancing denial but, in contrast to the avoidance denial results, experienced less worry, and were more likely to have optimistically biased self-risk assessments for CVD, that is, to rate their risk lower than it actually was.</p>
<p>These findings add to the literature on reactions to health and safety threats in two ways. First, they support the proposition from the threat orientation model that there are dispositional differences in how people respond to a threat. In this study, dispositional measures of general propensities toward threat predicted differences in reactions to a specific threat, CVD. This adds to a growing body of research findings that threat orientation dispositions are related to reactions to a variety of threats such as bisphenol-A for adults (age 20-85 years; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1090198111428154">Thompson et al., 2011</xref>), flu, West Nile Virus, theft of possessions, and identity theft for college students (ages 18-24; Thompson, Ting, Gonzalez, &amp; Ryan, in press), and concern about terrorism for adults (ages 18-97; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1090198111428154">Thompson &amp; Schlehofer, 2008</xref>). It is clear that people are not influenced solely by the circumstances of a particular threat but they also have a consistent orientation with which to understand and react to threats.</p>
<p>The second contribution of these findings is that they clearly establish the existence of two very different denial-based reactions. Conceptual work on denial has proposed that denial can be achieved in a variety of ways such as message derogation, attention avoidance, and downplaying affective relevance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1090198111428154">Breznitz, 1983</xref>). The circumstances in which these various denial paths are used may differ, but they are seen as equivalent ways to achieve a single goal, reducing the threat of the information. The current findings go beyond this focus on ways to deny threatening information to show that there are two distinct denial processes. These two denial-based processes were related to denying the message, but they were associated with different, sometimes opposite, reactions to the threat, and were driven by different factors. Those high in avoidance denial seem to be motivated by worry and concern about the threat. Their levels of threat and worry were high and worry was found to mediate their engagement in message derogation denial. Avoidance denial orientation was not associated with perceptions of comparative risk or with unrealistic optimism. In contrast, high optimistic denial was associated with <italic>less</italic> worry and had no relationship to perceived threat. Those high in optimistic denial were more likely to underestimate their risk compared with their actual risk for CVD in comparison with those low in optimistic denial.</p>
<p>In addition to these expected results, some predictions were not supported. For example, biased self-risk did not mediate the relationship between optimistic denial threat orientation and self-distancing denial. It may be that biased self-risk assessments are just one reason why those high in optimistic denial exempt themselves from vulnerability to a threat. A variety of denial strategies have been identified in taxonomies of denial (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1090198111428154">Breznitz, 1983</xref>, or <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1090198111428154">Blumberg, 2000</xref>). It is possible that one or more of these other strategies not measured in this study were used by those high in optimistic denial.</p>
<p>It was also the case that optimistic denial was not associated with less change in eating in the month following the receipt of the message. Other studies have found that those high in optimistic denial have lower intentions to change (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1090198111428154">Thompson et al., 2011</xref>), so it is not clear why in this study no relationship to actual behavior was found. It is interesting to note that optimistic denial was not related to message derogation in this study. Perhaps if the message is not derogated, enough of it is accepted so that the self-distancing denial does not interfere with attempts to change behavior. More research is needed on CVD with young adults to see if these findings regarding behavior change are replicated and to test this suggestion.</p>
<sec id="section30-1090198111428154">
<title>Implications for Basic Understanding</title>
<p>These striking differences in denial-based responses to a threat are important for our basic understanding of how people respond to threat in several ways. First, because threat orientations are intended to capture a multifaceted approach to threat, they cannot be adequately captured with a single dimension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1090198111428154">Thompson &amp; Schlehofer, 2008</xref>). For example, avoidance denial involves not just anxiety in response to threat but also avoiding information, denial, and a low propensity to take protective action. Thus, the orientation is not adequately captured by measuring one component such as anxiety in response to threat. In fact, an anxious reaction is also associated with another and distinctly different threat orientation, heightened sensitivity. In heightened sensitivity, anxiety about threat is combined with overestimating one’s susceptibility to a threat and a strong propensity to take protective action. Research that measured only a strong threat reaction or anxiety about the threat would be misleading if a distinction was not made between anxiety as associated with an avoidance denial orientation and that associated with a heightened sensitivity orientation.</p>
<p>Similarly, although there is some overlap in optimistic denial and dispositional optimism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1090198111428154">Thompson et al., 2011</xref>), we would not expect dispositional optimism to capture the multifaceted concept of an optimistic denial threat orientation. A comprehensive study of risk perceptions done by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1090198111428154">Radcliffe and Klein (2002)</xref> is a good example. They measured dispositional optimism (Life Orientation Test; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1090198111428154">Scheier &amp; Carver, 1985</xref>), comparative optimism, and unrealistic optimism regarding heart attacks in a sample of middle-aged adults. Dispositional optimism showed an adaptive pattern of risk correlations in that it was not correlated with unrealistic optimism but was related to nondefensive reactions such as possessing more knowledge about heart attacks. Unrealistic optimism, on the other hand, was associated with a more defensive pattern. Given that those high in optimistic denial displayed more unrealistic optimism and denial of self-relevance in the current study, it would appear that the optimistic denial and dispositional optimism concepts may share a propensity for optimistic conclusions, but the two concepts are not describing the same approach to personal threat.</p>
<p>A second point is that these findings indicate that theories and models of health behavior change could be improved by incorporating individual differences in reactions to threat. Various models of engagement in protective health behaviors such as the health belief model, theory of reasoned action, and parallel processing model have been successful in explaining some of the variance in intentions and behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1090198111428154">Harrison, Mullen, &amp; Green, 1992</xref>), but it seems likely that their explanatory power could be improved by including individual differences in how the process works. For example, the optimistic denial orientation may be relevant to the use of theories such as the health belief model that include perceptions of personal susceptibility as core components. One study found that women have an optimistic bias for breast cancer risk and men for prostate cancer risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1090198111428154">Clarke, Lovegrove, Williams, &amp; Machperson, 2000</xref>), an unrealistic optimism that extended to all components of the health belief model. Future research should examine whether this positive biasing is associated with the optimistic denial threat orientation, indicating that biasing of components happens only for some individuals. Specifying the denial-based response that is relevant to a particular theory could improve the predictive ability of that approach. At the same time, addressing both denial orientations within the context of a theory could enhance its range and applicability.</p>
<p>These results also have implications for the EPPM that focuses on the role of fear control in provoking a defensive response to a potential threat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1090198111428154">Witte, 1992</xref>). The findings here suggest that in addition to fear, there is another route to defensiveness, one that is more likely to be used by those high in optimistic denial. This second path to denial is associated with low anxiety, positive views of the self, and an optimistic assessment of one’s vulnerability to various threats. For individuals high in this orientation, denial of the self-relevance of a threatening message is likely to be prompted by a positive self-assessment that rejects an association with negative consequences rather than a way of reducing overwhelming anxiety and fear. This suggests that the EPPM may be refined by adding a third type of response to a threatening message in addition to fear and danger control, one that reflects a positive, optimistic self-view. Alternatively, studies using the EPPM approach could include threat orientation measures to focus the fear control analysis on those high in avoidance denial who are most prone to anxiety and denial.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section31-1090198111428154">
<title>Implications for Applied Work</title>
<p>The perspective that there are two constellations of denial-based reactions to a threat also has implications for the public health task of promoting healthy behavior. A denial response can be a problematic reaction for behavior change because people who deny the self-relevance of a threat or argue with the message are not likely to take steps to protect themselves. Thus it is important for research on public health promotion to have a detailed and accurate understanding of the sources of the denial. The knowledge that one denial-based reaction is based on perceived threat and worry and the other on an unrealistically optimistic assessment of personal risk leads to interventions that can address both types of denial. One strategy that would target those high in avoidance denial is to circumvent threat and concern by techniques such as motivational interviewing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1090198111428154">Norman, Maley, Li, &amp; Skinner, 2008</xref>) or self-affirmation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1090198111428154">Reed &amp; Aspinwall, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1090198111428154">van Koningsbruggen, Das, &amp; Roskos-Ewoldsen, 2009</xref>) that have been found to decrease defensive reactions, presumably by reducing the threat to self-image or self-determination. In contrast, for those high in optimistic denial, an approach is needed that can reduce unrealistic optimism. Given that none of the four different strategies for reducing optimistic biases that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1090198111428154">Weinstein and Klein (1995)</xref> tested consistently reduced bias, this may not be an easy task. However, in more recent research, it has been found that having smokers focus on a negative view of self through the completion of a negatively tinged self-esteem scale increased the use of accurate information (number of cigarettes smoked daily) for assessing risk for lung cancer in the future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1090198111428154">Klein &amp; Monin, 2009</xref>). Thus, this is a promising intervention to test for reducing unrealistic optimism among those who are particularly prone to it. It also raises the intriguing possibility that a boost to self-esteem may reduce denial for those with an avoidance denial orientation, but a threat to self-esteem may be needed to reduce denial for those high in optimistic denial.</p>

<sec id="section32-1090198111428154">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>The generalizability of the results is limited to young adults who are college students. Although the concern of limited generalizability is somewhat mitigated by the fact that other threat orientation research has used samples of adults from the general population, it still is not known whether these particular findings would hold for non-college-attending young adults. However, given that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1090198111428154">Weinstein (1987)</xref> found that unrealistic optimism about health risks are found across all age, sex, educational, and occupational groups, it is possible that the denial results found here would apply to young adults in general.</p>
<p>A second generalizability issue concerns the threat that was addressed in this study. Any particular health or safety threat has features such as immediacy or probability of consequences, difficulty of making recommended changes, and societal image of being at risk. These and other characteristics of a particular threat can influence attention to the message, perceived susceptibility, likelihood that denial will be used, and the probability of making behavior changes. CVD for young adults is a threat with long-delayed consequences and most likely a low-to-moderate probability of experiencing the consequences. This raises the question of whether the findings in this study for CVD are likely to generalize to other health and safety threats with different features such as more immediate consequences or a stronger link between risky behavior and consequences. Although there is no question that features of the threat influence reactions, our research program has accumulated evidence that threat orientations predict reactions for threats that vary in a considerable number of ways. Dispositional threat orientations have shown predicted reactions such as perceived susceptibility, worry and concern, and intentions to engage in protection for threats as diverse as identity theft, West Nile virus, the flu, theft from dorm rooms, terrorist attack, and exposure to bisphenol-A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1090198111428154">Thompson &amp; Schlehofer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1090198111428154">Thompson et al., in press</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1090198111428154">Thompson et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, the main focus of this study was on denial and optimistically biased judgments of personal susceptibility which have been shown to also be relevant for threats with more immediate consequences such as sexually transmitted diseases. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1090198111428154">Kershaw, Ethier, Niccolai, Lewis, and Ickovics (2003)</xref> examined female adolescents who because of their behavior were at objective low, medium, or high risk for a sexually transmitted disease. Of those who were at high objective risk, 65% underestimated their risk. Thus, the denial results that were aroused by the threat of CVD in this study can also be relevant to a threat with more immediate consequences.</p>
<p>Another issue is the fact the participants had answered questions regarding their risk for CVD before they read the message at Time 1 and the questions may have aroused interest in the topic or preliminary denial to it before the message was received. This is an intriguing possibility but because the study was not set up to test that idea, we do not know if that might have occurred. At any rate, given past research that finds defensive reactions to a threat message when there is no forewarning of the topic (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1090198111428154">Thompson et al., 2011</xref>), it seems likely that the order of questions was not solely responsible for denial reactions. Furthermore, despite the fact that both those high and low in dispositional denial orientations answered questions about CVD risk before reading the message, higher levels of denial orientations were associated with more denial.</p>
<p>A final concern is the suitability of the DRI for young adults. It is clear that standard CVD risk factors in young individuals predict future incidence of CVD. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1090198111428154">Navas-Nacher et al. (2001)</xref> assessed major risk factors in a sample of more than 11,000 young men (aged 18-39 years) and found that 20 years later these early risk factors strongly predicted long-term CVD disease. However, although the DRI measures similar CVD risk factors, it has not specifically been used in a longitudinal study with young adults. Thus, its applicability has not been tested.</p>

<sec id="section33-1090198111428154">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The denial of health-related threats has important implications for health psychology theory, as well as practical application to behavior change programs. This study examined two distinct denial orientations, both leading to denial of information about CVD, but through different mechanisms. Future work is needed in several directions. A basic tenet of the threat orientation model is that, in addition to dispositional effects, orientations can be primed through situational circumstances. Research is needed on the situational circumstances that tend to provoke avoidance denial or optimistic denial in those who do not usually use denial-based orientations. Another important way to extent this work is to examine strategies for reducing denial that would be appropriate for each of these two orientations. The long-term goal is to establish an understanding of denial that can inform both theories about health behavior change and the design of programs and messages to enact change.</p>
