<p>This article aims to increase our understanding of family firms’ entrepreneurial risk-taking behavior by looking at the differences between family and nonfamily firms and by studying variations among family firms. We find empirical support for a positive influence of a nonfamily CEO on the family firm’s level of entrepreneurial risk taking during the initial years of his or her CEO tenure and a leveling out of entrepreneurial risk taking as the CEO tenure of the nonfamily CEO is extended. We build on the concept of psychological ownership to explain these new findings.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Recently, research has focused on the question of whether family ownership promotes or hinders risk-taking behavior in firms. Some researchers argue that the strong alignment of interests between firm and family that accompanies concentrated family ownership encourages a long-term perspective, an exploration of innovative ideas, and entrepreneurial risk taking (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0894486512469252">Astrachan, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0894486512469252">Litz, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0894486512469252">Zahra, 2005</xref>). However, others propose that the strong overlap between family welfare and firm wealth (which implies an undiversified investment position) may lead to conservatism, strategic inertia, and risk-avoiding strategies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0894486512469252">Hall, Melin, &amp; Nordqvist, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0894486512469252">Naldi, Nordqvist, Sjöberg, &amp; Wiklund, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0894486512469252">Short, Payne, Brigham, Lumpkin, &amp; Broberg, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0894486512469252">Schulze, Lubatkin, &amp; Dino, 2002</xref>). The mixed evidence has refocused the debate and launched a search for contingency variables that may lead family firms to be more likely to engage in entrepreneurial risk taking. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0894486512469252">Lim, Lubatkin, and Wiseman (2010)</xref> conceptually discuss the effects of family ownership structure on the risk-taking propensity of family firms and the contingent effects of three distinct forms of altruism on this relationship (parental, paternalistic, and psychosocial). Other researchers have examined the relationship between family CEO characteristics such as CEO tenure and entrepreneurial risk-taking behavior and found that these attributes have a significant influence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0894486512469252">Kellermanns, Eddleston, Barnett, &amp; Pearson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0894486512469252">Zahra, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>An important CEO attribute that is mainly missing in the current debate is the family kinship of the CEO. Indeed, not all private family firms are managed by a family CEO. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0894486512469252">Bennedsen, Nielsen, Perez-Gonzalez, and Wolfenzon (2007)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894486512469252">Bloom and Van Reenen (2007)</xref>; and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0894486512469252">Ward and Handy (1988)</xref> reported that a significant percentage of private family firms are managed by nonfamily CEOs. Moreover, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0894486512469252">Bennedsen et al. (2007)</xref> found significant differences in performance for family versus nonfamily CEOs. As firm performance is related to entrepreneurial risk taking (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0894486512469252">Lumpkin &amp; Dess, 1996</xref>), these findings raise the question of whether or not there is a difference in the entrepreneurial risk-taking propensity between a family and a nonfamily CEO.</p>
<p>This article addresses this important question by examining the direct relationship between the CEO type (family vs. nonfamily) and entrepreneurial risk taking and the moderating influence of CEO tenure, often considered as one of the most important CEO attributes related to entrepreneurial risk preferences (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0894486512469252">Kellermanns et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0894486512469252">Zahra, 2005</xref>). In developing our argument, we draw on agency theory and reconcile it with psychological ownership theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0894486512469252">Pierce, Kostova, &amp; Dirks, 2001</xref>) and the concept of socioemotional wealth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0894486512469252">Gómez-Mejía, Takács Haynes, Núñez-Nickel, Jacobson, &amp; Moyano-Fuentes, 2007</xref>). Agency theory proposes a positive influence on the level of risk taking when the family firm is led by a nonfamily member (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0894486512469252">Denis, Denis, &amp; Sarin, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0894486512469252">Eisenhardt, 1989</xref>). Since family owners are reluctant to distribute shares outside the family, nonfamily CEOs usually have no personal financial stake in the firm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0894486512469252">Lubatkin, Schulze, Ling, &amp; Dino, 2005</xref>). This lack of a financial burden and a desire to increase job security will increase risk willingness. In other words, a nonfamily CEO can become entrenched by engaging the family firm in new growth-orientated projects and investments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0894486512469252">Shleifer &amp; Vishny, 1989</xref>). An increase in CEO tenure is expected to strengthen this behavior as a result of the augmentation of the power of the CEO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0894486512469252">Ozkan, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0894486512469252">Ryan &amp; Wiggins, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>In this article, we challenge two aspects of this reasoning. First, it only takes into account financial ownership, although psychological ownership (i.e., a state of mind in which an individual feels that the target of ownership is theirs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0894486512469252">Pierce et al., 2001</xref>) is an equally important, often neglected, dimension of ownership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0894486512469252">Koiranen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0894486512469252">Pierce et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0894486512469252">Rantanen &amp; Jussila, 2011</xref>). Second, it implies that the conflict of interest between owners and managers remains unchanged over time. We argue that this assumption deserves to be questioned for private family firms led by a nonfamily CEO. Building on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0894486512469252">Pierce et al. (2001)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0894486512469252">Hernandez (2012)</xref>, we suggest that as the nonfamily CEO’s tenure increases, he or she will develop feelings of psychological ownership toward the family firm. Taking this evolution into consideration nuances traditional agency predictions of a nonfamily CEO’s influence on a family firm’s entrepreneurial risk taking. That is, in this article we theorize and find empirical support for the proposition that a nonfamily CEO has an initial positive effect on a family firm’s entrepreneurial risk taking but that this effect disappears as CEO tenure increases.</p>
<p>It is important to clearly define the type of risk that is researched when studying risk-taking behavior in a family business context. Business risk can be split up into two types: performance hazard risk and venturing or entrepreneurial risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0894486512469252">Gómez-Mejía et al., 2007</xref>). The attitude of family firms toward these two types of risk differs greatly. That is, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0894486512469252">Gómez-Mejía et al. (2007)</xref>, family firms will accept a higher level of performance hazard risk but are risk averse when it comes to venturing risk. Performance hazard risk implies the probability of failure or below-target performance. Venturing or entrepreneurial risk signifies the search for new opportunities to increase the firm’s performance, taking into consideration unexpected outcomes and performance variance. Because acceptance of entrepreneurial risk is needed to pursue an innovative and entrepreneurial orientated strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0894486512469252">D. Miller, 1983</xref>), we focus on this type of risk.</p>
<p>This article makes several contributions. First, we add to the growing literature on risk taking in family firms by not only making a comparison with nonfamily firms but by also studying the influence of a nonfamily CEO on the entrepreneurial risk-taking behavior of family firms. Second, we nuance the traditional agency theory lens on ownership and entrepreneurial risk taking by arguing that financial ownership is not the only aspect of ownership that should be considered. Building on psychological ownership arguments enhances our understanding of owner–manager relations. Third, we answer the call for more research on nonfamily management of family firms, as this is an important and underresearched topic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0894486512469252">Blumentritt, Keyt, &amp; Astrachan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0894486512469252">Chua, Chrisman, &amp; Sharma, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>In the following section, we review the existing literature and develop our hypotheses. Subsequently, we elaborate on the data and the methodology used to test our hypotheses. Thereafter, we present our results and discuss the implications of this research, as well as some limitations and suggestions for future research.</p>

<title>Literature Review and Theoretical Development</title>
<p>This section is built up in three stages. The first stage develops the baseline hypothesis on entrepreneurial risk-taking behavior of family firms versus nonfamily firms, which is grounded in agency theory and the concept of socioemotional wealth. The second stage builds on this logic and theorizes the influence of the CEO type (i.e., family vs. nonfamily) on family firms’ entrepreneurial risk-taking behavior, taking into account CEO entrenchment effects. The third stage adds the psychological dimension to the agency and the entrenchment notion of ownership to reassess the influence of the CEO type as CEO tenure increases.</p>

<title>Entrepreneurial Risk Taking in Family Firms Versus Nonfamily Firms</title>
<p>As yet, no consensus has been reached regarding whether family firms are greater entrepreneurial risk takers than nonfamily firms. Research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0894486512469252">Zahra (2005)</xref> concluded that family ownership promotes entrepreneurial risk taking. Also, other studies have suggested that family involvement fosters entrepreneurial behavior (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0894486512469252">Astrachan, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0894486512469252">Litz, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0894486512469252">Rogoff &amp; Heck, 2003</xref>), a dimension of which is entrepreneurial risk taking. However, the most common findings are that family firms are more averse to entrepreneurial risk than nonfamily firms (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0894486512469252">Jones, Makri, &amp; Gómez-Mejía, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0894486512469252">Naldi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0894486512469252">Short et al., 2009</xref>) and that family firms can suffer from strategic inertia over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0894486512469252">Schulze et al., 2002</xref>). The existence of such contradictory findings provides further justification for the research topic of the present article.</p>
<p>The theoretical foundation for family firms’ averseness to entrepreneurial risk is commonly found in agency theory. This theory states that a high level of ownership will negatively affect the degree of entrepreneurial risk taking because when wealth is highly concentrated in one firm (i.e., not diversified), only a few people bear the financial burden, which discourages risky investments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0894486512469252">Fama &amp; Jensen, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0894486512469252">Wright, Ferris, Sarin, &amp; Awasthi, 1996</xref>). As legal ownership is highly concentrated in most family businesses, projects with highly uncertain returns are expected to be avoided (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0894486512469252">Gedajlovic, Lubatkin, &amp; Schulze, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0894486512469252">Sharma, Chrisman, &amp; Chua, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0894486512469252">Zellweger &amp; Sieger, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, not only are family owners concerned with the financial consequences of their investments, they also tend to place a high value on the perseverance of their socioemotional wealth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0894486512469252">Berrone, Cruz, &amp; Gómez-Mejía, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0894486512469252">Gómez-Mejía et al., 2007</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0894486512469252">Gómez-Mejía et al. (2007)</xref>, socioemotional wealth encompasses several nonfinancial benefits, including the ability to exercise authority, satisfaction of needs for belonging and identification, perpetuation of family values and dynasty, and opportunity to be altruistic. Therefore, family firms tend to avoid projects with high outcome variance because such projects might increase the likelihood of the loss of their socioemotional wealth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0894486512469252">Gómez-Mejía et al., 2007</xref>). Hence, their desire to protect their socioemotional wealth causes family firms to avoid high variance investments, that is, to take less entrepreneurial risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0894486512469252">Gómez-Mejía, Cruz, Berrone, &amp; De Castro, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Moreover, owners of a family business might not only be concerned with their own wealth but also with that of future generations, as family owners commonly want the business to be passed on to their children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0894486512469252">Poza, 2007</xref>). Also, the failure of high-risk projects could damage the family’s name and reputation, both of which are of great importance to family business owners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0894486512469252">Dyer &amp; Whetten, 2006</xref>). Therefore, given the high ownership concentration and desire to maintain socioemotional wealth, family firms are less likely than nonfamily firms to take entrepreneurial risks. We propose the following baseline hypothesis:</p>

<title>Entrepreneurial Risk Taking in Family Firms: Family Versus Nonfamily CEO</title>
<p>Agency theorists suggest that involvement in risky activities is influenced by the ownership and management of a firm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0894486512469252">Fama &amp; Jensen, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0894486512469252">Jensen &amp; Meckling, 1976</xref>). In private family firms, the CEO has strategic control (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0894486512469252">Harris &amp; Ogbonna, 2007</xref>) and can therefore significantly influence the firm’s entrepreneurial risk-taking behavior. The influence of the CEO on the firm’s entrepreneurial risk taking can be clarified by discussing the two opposite situations of a sole owner-manager versus an outsider-manager (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894486512469252">Ang, Cole, &amp; Wuh Lin, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0894486512469252">Jensen &amp; Meckling, 1976</xref>). According to agency theory, the sole owner-manager’s high ownership stake causes low diversification of his financial resources, leading to a low preference for new projects with uncertain returns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0894486512469252">Jensen &amp; Meckling, 1976</xref>). At the other end, the outsider-manager with no ownership in the firm has a much lower financial burden and consequently is less averse to entrepreneurial risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0894486512469252">Tsai, Kuo, &amp; Hung, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>These ideas can be transferred to the family CEO versus nonfamily CEO distinction. Similar to sole owner-managers, family members tend to have a very high financial investment in the firm because their desire to maintain control makes them use little debt and choose low-risk capital structures (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0894486512469252">McConaughy, Matthews, &amp; Fialko, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0894486512469252">Mishra &amp; McConaughy, 1999</xref>). This again adds to low diversification of entrepreneurial risk, concentrating the burden within a small group of people in case an investment fails. Nonfamily members, on the other hand, generally have no or minimal legal ownership in the privately held family firm. Indeed, family owners are usually reluctant to distribute shares among nonfamily members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0894486512469252">Lubatkin et al., 2005</xref>). Moreover, ownership must be held within the family, since it is the goal of most family owners to pass on the firm to later generations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0894486512469252">Poza, 2007</xref>). Therefore, nonfamily CEOs will bear less financial burden than family CEOs.</p>
<p>Besides financial considerations, family CEOs and nonfamily CEOs also differ in the value they attach to the firm’s socioemotional wealth. A family CEO will likely be more concerned than a nonfamily CEO for the protection of the family’s socioemotional wealth. Moreover, watching over the family’s socioemotional wealth will benefit the family CEO’s job security, as maintaining the family’s ability to exercise control allows for appointing and favoring family members in the firm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0894486512469252">Gómez-Mejía et al., 2011</xref>). A nonfamily CEO, on the other hand, might have to find other ways to increase his or her job security. Indeed, the CEO can make himself or herself more valuable to the owners and costly to replace by investing in innovation and new projects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0894486512469252">Shleifer &amp; Vishny, 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>Consequently, the interests of family owners and nonfamily CEOs seem to differ. Family CEOs are motivated to reduce the family’s idiosyncratic risk, while it is in the nonfamily CEO’s interest that the firm pursues a higher risk investment strategy. Given that the CEO of a private family firm has a dominant influence on the strategic decision making in the firm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0894486512469252">Harris &amp; Ogbonna, 2007</xref>), we hypothesize the following:</p>
<list id="list2-0894486512469252" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 2</italic>: Family firms led by nonfamily CEOs take more entrepreneurial risk than family firms led by family CEOs.</p></list-item>

<sec id="section5-0894486512469252">
<title>Nonfamily CEOs, CEO Tenure, and Entrepreneurial Risk-Taking Behavior</title>
<p>According to entrenchment theory, a nonfamily CEO will engage in more entrepreneurial risk-taking behavior as his or her CEO tenure increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0894486512469252">Ozkan, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0894486512469252">Ryan &amp; Wiggins, 2001</xref>). The rationale behind this is that the longer a person is CEO of a firm, the more power he or she has to make decisions and hence become entrenched. We question this view and argue that as the nonfamily CEO’s tenure increases, the positive effect on the family firm’s entrepreneurial risk taking will level out. The entrenchment reasoning assumes that the interests of the nonfamily CEO stay constant over time, which is unlikely. A recent study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0894486512469252">Hernandez (2012)</xref>, building on the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0894486512469252">Davis, Schoorman, and Donaldson (1997)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0894486512469252">Fehr and Fishbacher (2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0894486512469252">2003</xref>), argues that an individual’s preferences and motivations in an organization evolve over time. Building on this idea, we suggest that although a nonfamily CEO is not likely to gain financial ownership of a family firm, he or she might still develop feelings of psychological ownership. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0894486512469252">Pierce et al. (2001</xref>, p. 299) define psychological ownership as “a state [of mind] in which individuals feel as though the target of ownership (material or immaterial in nature) or a piece of it is theirs.” To feel psychological ownership, one does not necessarily have to be a legal owner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0894486512469252">Pierce et al., 2001</xref>). The core of psychological ownership, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0894486512469252">Pierce et al. (2001</xref>, p. 299), is “the feeling of possessiveness and of being psychologically tied to an object.”</p>
<p>We argue that a nonfamily CEO can develop a sense of psychological ownership toward the family business as CEO tenure in the firm increases. We use the three routes to psychological ownership developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0894486512469252">Pierce et al. (2001)</xref> as a theoretical basis for this assertion. The first route presented by the authors involves the ability to control the target in that the greater the amount of control over the business, the higher the degree of feelings of ownership. This positive relationship between a person’s ability to exercise control and the development of psychological ownership is also empirically supported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0894486512469252">Liu, Wang, Hui, and Lee (2012)</xref>. The second route to psychological ownership, described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0894486512469252">Pierce et al. (2001)</xref>, stresses the importance of coming to intimately know the target. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0894486512469252">Pierce et al. (2001)</xref>, the more information and knowledge someone has about an object, the deeper the relationship and the stronger the feelings of ownership toward it. The last antecedent of psychological ownership is called <italic>investing oneself into the target</italic>. The investment of an individual’s time, effort, attention, and energy into an object, in this case the family business, causes a person to become one with the object and to develop feelings of ownership toward it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0894486512469252">Pierce et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>In private family firms, management is usually responsible for strategic and operational control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0894486512469252">Fama &amp; Jensen, 1983</xref>). A family CEO, especially when he or she is founder of the business, enjoys vast legitimacy and control in decision making. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0894486512469252">Harris and Ogbonna (2007)</xref> point out that nonfamily CEOs can also be given strategic and operational control while the family owners maintain ultimate control. This ability of the nonfamily CEO to exercise control will add to the feelings of psychological ownership toward the family firm (first route).</p>
<p>Moreover, nonfamily CEOs can also possess intimate knowledge of the family firm because they are usually recruited internally or through the family firm’s network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0894486512469252">Klein &amp; Bell, 2007</xref>). This makes them already knowledgeable about the firm before becoming CEO. Moreover, a nonfamily CEO can also gain a thorough understanding of the family values and culture that are intertwined with the business, as these are often common knowledge in a family firm and taught to new members in the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0894486512469252">Schein, 1985</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0894486512469252">Pierce et al. (2001)</xref>, the better the knowledge of an object, the deeper the relationship and the stronger the feeling of ownership toward it. Therefore, as a nonfamily CEO gathers deep knowledge of the family firm, he or she will develop feelings of psychological ownership toward the firm (second route).</p>
<p>Furthermore, the job of a nonfamily CEO is both complex and challenging. He or she must not only be able to meet business goals but should display excellent interpersonal skills to manage relationships with family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0894486512469252">Blumentritt et al., 2007</xref>). For a nonfamily CEO to successfully fulfill this complex job, he or she will need to invest himself or herself in the family firm. Investing oneself includes the investment of ideas, skills, time, and energy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0894486512469252">Pierce et al., 2001</xref>). Family owners will appoint a nonfamily member as CEO because this person has formal and generic skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0894486512469252">Dyer, 1989</xref>) that cannot be found in the limited pool of family-member candidates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0894486512469252">Le Breton-Miller, Miller, &amp; Steier, 2004</xref>). Therefore, a nonfamily CEO will be expected to bring new ideas and skills to the family firm. Moreover, the nonfamily CEO will likely need to invest a considerable amount of skills, time, and energy to achieve the required balance between business concerns and family objectives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0894486512469252">Blumentritt et al., 2007</xref>) (third route).</p>
<p>These feelings of psychological ownership toward the family firm will further develop as the CEO tenure of the nonfamily CEO increases. When the CEO’s tenure increases, the three routes to psychological ownership will be strengthened. First, when a CEO’s tenure increases, the ability to exercise control over the firm will increase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0894486512469252">Hill &amp; Phan, 1991</xref>), amplifying feelings of psychological ownership (first route). Second, the longer the period of time as CEO, the more knowledge is gathered about the firm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0894486512469252">Pierce et al., 2001</xref>). Hence, the nonfamily CEO’s feelings of ownership are strengthened (second route). Third, as nonfamily CEO’s tenure increases, so does time invested in the family firm. Therefore, the level of self-investment in the firm is amplified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0894486512469252">Pierce et al., 2001</xref>), enhancing feelings of psychological ownership toward the family firm (third route). In sum, when CEO tenure increases, the nonfamily CEO will increasingly develop feelings of psychological ownership.</p>
<p>Research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0894486512469252">Hernandez (2012)</xref> argues that when the CEO develops psychological ownership, he or she will behave more like a steward in the organization. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0894486512469252">Davis et al. (1997</xref>, p. 21) identifies this behavior as the extent to which “managers are not motivated by individual goals, but rather are stewards whose motives are aligned with the objectives of their principals.” Therefore, when the nonfamily CEO develops more psychological ownership and consequently behaves like a steward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0894486512469252">Hernandez, 2012</xref>), he or she will value the well-being of the organization more than the desire to entrench himself or herself by taking more entrepreneurial risks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0894486512469252">Davis et al., 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Moreover, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0894486512469252">Hernandez (2012)</xref> the target of ownership can extend beyond the organization to the group of beneficiaries (in this case the family owners). Therefore, the nonfamily CEO can feel that the family firm is his or her company, as well as increasingly acting as if the family owners are his or her family. Research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0894486512469252">Karra, Tracey, and Philips (2006)</xref> already introduced the concept of quasi-family, advocating the possibility of a non-biological-related person to create a family-like relationship with the firm-owning family. If the nonfamily CEO feels as if he or she belongs to the firm-owning family, it is likely that he or she will begin to share the same values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0894486512469252">Schein, 1990</xref>). Moreover, research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0894486512469252">Poza (2007)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0894486512469252">Blumentritt et al. (2007)</xref> states that a nonfamily CEO can only be successful if he or she develops high-quality relationships with the family owners and takes the family’s values into account. The task of a nonfamily CEO can then be described as a balancing act between business and family demands in which over time, as CEO tenure increases, the understanding and appreciation for the family values grows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0894486512469252">Poza, 2007</xref>). The nonfamily CEO will then increasingly protect what is valuable to the family including their financial objectives and their socioemotional wealth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0894486512469252">Gómez-Mejía et al., 2007</xref>). Again, this will lower willingness to pursue projects with more uncertain returns.</p>
<p>To sum up, as the nonfamily CEO’s tenure increases, he or she is likely to develop psychological ownership toward the family firm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0894486512469252">Pierce et al., 2001</xref>). These feelings result in a steward-like behavior, making him or her value the interests of the organization more than his or her own personal interests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0894486512469252">Davis et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0894486512469252">Hernandez, 2012</xref>). Moreover, development of psychological ownership goes beyond just the firm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0894486512469252">Hernandez, 2012</xref>), in that the nonfamily CEO becomes more and more connected with the family and their values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0894486512469252">Poza, 2007</xref>). This will make him or her increasingly attach importance to what is valuable to the family including their financial objectives and their socioemotional wealth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0894486512469252">Gómez-Mejía et al., 2007</xref>). Hence, the nonfamily CEO no longer wants to entrench himself or herself by taking more entrepreneurial risks, and the desire to protect what is valuable to the family results in the nonfamily CEO no longer wanting to influence the firm’s course toward more entrepreneurial risk taking. We therefore propose the following:</p>
<list id="list3-0894486512469252" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 3</italic>: The positive influence of a nonfamily CEO on the entrepreneurial risk taking of a family firm is moderated by the CEO’s tenure, such that the positive effect of a nonfamily CEO on entrepreneurial risk taking will decrease as the CEO’s tenure increases.</p></list-item>

<title>Methodology</title>
<sec id="section7-0894486512469252">
<title>Data</title>
<p>The empirical data used in this study were derived from a wider survey collecting data on general characteristics of the firms, as well as ownership structure, management, growth, and strategy topics. In 2001, the survey was mailed to the president, the CEO, or the financial director of 8,367 Belgian businesses. A total of 896 completed questionnaires were received, of which 57 were anonymous. We made use of BEL-FIRST, a publicly available financial database supplied by Bureau Van Dijk, to complete our data set with financial data. This database collects and structures information from the annual reports of Belgian firms. Using this database was advantageous, since our dependent variable (entrepreneurial risk taking) resulted from a database external to our survey, mitigating common method bias concerns. After excluding the missing values, we removed 15 outliers that had an entrepreneurial risk-taking level outside the range of three standard deviations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0894486512469252">Hair, Anderson, Tatham, &amp; Black, 1998</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0894486512469252">1</xref></sup> This resulted in 740 privately held firms to test our hypotheses, of which 555 were considered family firms. In line with commonly used classifications (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0894486512469252">Westhead &amp; Howorth, 2006</xref>), we categorize firms as being family firms when they identified themselves as a family firm and at least 50% of shares were owned by a member of a single family.</p>

<sec id="section8-0894486512469252">
<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section9-0894486512469252">
<title>Dependent variable</title>
<p>The dependent variable in our analyses was the firm’s entrepreneurial risk taking. Similar to previous research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0894486512469252">Bowman, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0894486512469252">Fiegenbaum &amp; Thomas, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0894486512469252">Gómez-Mejía et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0894486512469252">J. S. Miller, Wiseman, &amp; Gómez-Meíja, 2002</xref>), we used performance variability as a proxy for entrepreneurial risk taking since a large variance in firm performance can indicate that the firm has been pursuing new opportunities and was consequently willing to accept a greater variance in its performance outcomes. Performance variability measures are usually calculated using a 5-year time period (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0894486512469252">Bettis &amp; Hall, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0894486512469252">Fiegenbaum &amp; Thomas, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0894486512469252">K. D. Miller &amp; Bromiley, 1990</xref>). Therefore, we also used a 5-year period in calculating our dependent variable. However, from the survey data in our questionnaire we only have information about a possible change of CEO during a 3-year time period. It is important to verify that there is no change of CEO position during the time period for which the dependent variable is calculated. Indeed, such an event could, for example, imply that a family member CEO had been replaced with a nonfamily CEO or the other way around, which could bias our results. Therefore, we recalculated performance variability as the standard deviation of the return on assets for the 3-year period, that is, 1999 to 2001, and used this measure as main dependent variable in this study. In addition, results when using a 5-year period remain the same and can be found in the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0894486512469252">appendix</xref>.</p>

<sec id="section10-0894486512469252">
<title>Independent variables</title>
<p>The variable family owned was measured as a dummy variable, taking on a value of 1 if the firm met the two criteria above for being regarded as family firm. The variable nonfamily CEO was also inserted as a dummy variable coded with a value of 1 if the CEO was not a member of the owning family.</p>

<sec id="section11-0894486512469252">

<p>CEO tenure was a continuous variable indicating how many years the current CEO had been working for the business as CEO.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0894486512469252">
<title>Control variables</title>
<p>In this study, we controlled for firm size, industry, performance, board size, CEO duality, and CEO age. These variables were obtained from the aforementioned BEL-FIRST database. We included firm size as a control variable since larger companies might resist innovation and entrepreneurial risk taking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0894486512469252">Sathe, 2003</xref>). It was measured by the full-time equivalent of employees in the firm. We controlled for industry by grouping our sample into eight dummies. Based on their NACE codes, we identified each firm as belonging to the primary sector, the manufacturing sector, the construction sector, the retail sector, the wholesale sector, the hospitality sector (hotels and restaurants), the consumer services, or the public, social, and personal services industry. This control was needed because industries might differ in opportunities for entrepreneurial activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0894486512469252">Gómez-Mejía, Makri, &amp; Kintana, 2010</xref>). In line with previous studies, we also controlled for performance, measured in terms of return on assets, as this firm characteristic may also influence entrepreneurial risk taking (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0894486512469252">Gómez-Mejía et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0894486512469252">Jones et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, we controlled for the influence of the firm’s governance by adding two board characteristics, board size and CEO duality, as variables. These control variables are important in our models because it is possible that an empowered board can influence the entrepreneurial risk-taking level due to the family owners’ preferences. Board size was used as a proxy for an empowered board because a large number of board members increases the pool of critical guidance and resources and can be regarded as a prerequisite for board power in private companies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0894486512469252">Gabrielsson, 2007</xref>). Furthermore, a larger group of board members is less likely to engage in new risky projects, as project ideas have to be approved by more people before they can be accepted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0894486512469252">Sah &amp; Stiglitz, 1991</xref>). Moreover, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0894486512469252">Gabrielsson (2007)</xref> argues that a separation of CEO and board chairperson is a sign of greater board empowerment. As a less-empowered board could imply that the family owners have less power to influence the firm’s entrepreneurial risk taking, we added the control variable of CEO duality. We also controlled for the age of the CEO as this personal characteristic has been previously found to influence the CEO’s willingness to pursue entrepreneurial endeavors and accept the accompanied risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0894486512469252">Kellermanns et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0894486512469252">Steward, Watson, Carland, &amp; Carland, 1998</xref>). CEO age was measured as an ordinal variable identifying the age of CEO as belonging to one of following groups: 35 years and younger, 36 to 50 years old, 51 to 60 years old, and older than 60 years. In our total sample, each group included, respectively, 72, 408, 208, and 52 CEOs.

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0894486512469252">Table 2</xref> shows a negative, but not significant correlation between the variables entrepreneurial risk taking and family owned. Furthermore, correlations in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0894486512469252">Table 2</xref> suggest that family firms were significantly smaller, had smaller boards, and had less often separation between chairperson and CEO (CEO-duality) than nonfamily firms. Moreover, we found a significant negative correlation between board size and the level of entrepreneurial risk taking. This suggests that firms with larger boards tended to take fewer entrepreneurial risks. Moreover, it was less likely for large boards to have the function of chairperson fulfilled by the CEO, which is in line with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0894486512469252">Gabrielsson’s (2007)</xref> characteristics of an empowered board.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0894486512469252">Table 3</xref> shows the means, standard deviations, and correlations for the sample of family firms only. In this sample, a nonfamily CEO had an average CEO tenure of about 8.5 years with a maximum of 26 years. This was lower than the family CEO’s average CEO tenure of about 16 years with a maximum of 54 years. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0894486512469252">Table 3</xref> reveals that the variable nonfamily CEO was positively correlated with the firm’s level of entrepreneurial risk taking. However, the correlation was not significant.</p>

<p>Firm size was significantly positively related to board size and having a nonfamily CEO. A possible explanation could be that larger family firms tended to be more mature and therefore were more likely to professionalize by having a working board (characterized by more directors) and hiring a nonfamily CEO. Similar to the full sample just described, we found a significant negative correlation between board size and CEO duality. Moreover, family firms characterized by CEO duality also tended to have longer CEO tenures. CEO tenure was also negatively correlated with entrepreneurial risk taking. Furthermore, family firms that hired a nonfamily CEO had significantly larger boards, possibly as a result of a higher degree of professionalization. Similar to previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0894486512469252">Gómez-Mejía, Larraza-Kintana, &amp; Makri, 2003</xref>), we found a significant negative correlation between CEO tenure and having a nonfamily CEO, suggesting that CEO tenure of nonfamily members was significantly lower compared with family member counterparts.</p>

<p>Models 2, 3, 4, and 5 were tested on a sample only consisting of family firms. Model 2 contained just the control variables and showed a significant effect of firm size and board size on entrepreneurial risk taking. The negative effect of firm size was in line with previous findings (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0894486512469252">Gómez-Mejía et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0894486512469252">Jones et al., 2008</xref>) and confirmed the idea that larger firms are more resistant to entrepreneurial risk taking. Board size also had a negative effect on entrepreneurial risk taking in all models. This result was expected because large groups are less likely to engage in new risky projects, as more people must evaluate the project before it can be accepted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0894486512469252">Sah &amp; Stiglitz, 1991</xref>). Moreover, in the group of family firms, another explanation could be that more empowered boards could more easily impose the low-risk course of family owners.</p>
<p>Nonfamily CEO was entered as a variable in Model 3 but did not show a significant effect on entrepreneurial risk-taking propensity. Nonfamily CEO and CEO tenure were added to the control variables in Model 4, but no significant effect was observed. Hence, Hypothesis 2 does not seem to be supported by our regression results.</p>
<p>Model 5 reports the effects of nonfamily CEO, CEO tenure and the interaction term “Non-family CEO * CEO tenure” on entrepreneurial risk taking. This model revealed that a nonfamily CEO had a positive effect on the entrepreneurial risk taking of a family firm but that this effect was conditional on the CEO’s tenure. The positive effect of a nonfamily CEO on the firm’s entrepreneurial risk taking was leveled out when the CEO tenure increased, providing support for Hypothesis 3 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). The test of the moderating effect in Model 5 is an example of a multiplicative interaction model. The interpretation of these types of models is very different from linear-additive regression models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0894486512469252">Brambor, Clark, &amp; Golder, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0894486512469252">Kam &amp; Franzese, 2007</xref>). In an interaction model, the effect of an independent variable <italic>X</italic> (in this case, nonfamily CEO) on the dependent variable <italic>Y</italic> (risk taking) depends on the coefficients (betas) of <italic>X</italic> and the interaction term <italic>XZ</italic> (Nonfamily CEO * CEO tenure). Therefore, we calculated the derivative of regression Model 5 (∂Risk taking/∂Nonfamily CEO = β<sub>1</sub> + β<sub>3</sub>CEO tenure). The effect of a change in <italic>X</italic> on <italic>Y</italic> depends on the value of the conditioning variable <italic>Z</italic>, and can be negative as well as positive over ranges of the <italic>Z</italic> variable (CEO tenure in our model). This information is essential in correctly interpreting interaction models. There is no other way to deduce this information than to calculate the derivative for several relevant ranges of values of CEO tenure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0894486512469252">Brambor et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0894486512469252">Figure 1</xref> shows the graphical illustration of the marginal effect of the nonfamily CEO for different levels of CEO tenure.</p>

<p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0894486512469252">Figure 1</xref>, the full line shows how the effect of a nonfamily CEO on family firm entrepreneurial risk taking changed with an increase in CEO tenure. The dotted lines around this line represent the confidence intervals and allowed us to determine the conditions under which the effect was significant. Because the zero line was situated below the lower boundary of the confidence interval until CEO tenure reached 7 years, it can be concluded that a nonfamily CEO will have a significantly positive effect on the entrepreneurial risk taking of the family firm before this point. After about 7 years, the effect of the nonfamily CEO was no longer significant, suggesting that after a CEO tenure of 7 years there was no longer a significant difference between the effect of a nonfamily and a family CEO on the firm’s entrepreneurial risk taking. This confirmed that CEO tenure had a moderating influence on the effect of a nonfamily CEO on entrepreneurial risk taking, once more providing support for Hypothesis 3.</p>

<title>Robustness Tests</title>
<p>We also executed a set of robustness tests. We performed a first robustness test to exclude the possible alternative reasoning that the moderating effect of CEO tenure on the relationship between a nonfamily CEO and a family firm’s entrepreneurial risk taking was due to the nonfamily CEO’s acquiring of financial ownership instead of psychological ownership. There were nine cases in our sample in which the nonfamily CEO had some shares in the family firm. Therefore, we repeated our analyses on a sample that excluded these nine cases. The results of this additional test remained similar to our primary findings.</p>
<p>As a second robustness test, we repeated our analyses using three alternative proxies to measure the level of entrepreneurial risk taking. A first alternative proxy that we used was a dummy variable obtained from the questionnaire that had value 1 when respondents indicated that their firm wanted to grow faster than the competition and 0 otherwise. This variable was a valuable alternative proxy for entrepreneurial risk taking, as a firm indicating that it wanted to grow faster than colleagues would need to invest in projects with more uncertain returns, and thus accept a higher level of entrepreneurial risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0894486512469252">Aronoff &amp; Astrachan, 1996</xref>). Moreover, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0894486512469252">Bromiley (1991)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0894486512469252">Gómez-Mejía et al. (2007)</xref> indicate, entrepreneurial risk involves searching for new opportunities when the firm is unhappy with the status quo, and thus wants to grow. The logistic regression analyses confirmed our general findings. As a second alternative proxy for our dependent variable entrepreneurial risk taking we used the standard deviation of <italic>cash flow</italic> divided by total assets for the years 1999 to 2001. Previous research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0894486512469252">Anderson, Mansi, and Reeb (2003)</xref> argues that family firms have strong incentives to reduce their risk-taking measured by cash-flow variability. This additional test also confirmed our primary results. As a third alternative proxy, we calculated our dependent variable as the standard deviation of annual ROA from 1999 to 2003, thus adding two data points for each firm (2002 and 2003). Our results remained similar and can be found in the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0894486512469252">appendix</xref>. Recall that we use the results of the 3-year period in the main findings of the article because for this period we are sure that for the firms in our sample there had been no change in CEO. This is an important condition as a change in CEO could, for example, mean that a family CEO had been replaced with a nonfamily CEO or the other way around, which would bias our results.</p>
<p>As it is possible that the ownership structure of a firm influenced the level of entrepreneurial risk taking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0894486512469252">Lim et al., 2010</xref>), we added some additional ownership controls to our models as a third robustness test. For all our family firms, at least 50% of shares were owned by one family. However, there was additional ownership information for about one third (i.e., 164 cases) of our sample. Therefore, ownership dummies were included, grouping the sample into firms where no known people had more than 25% of shares, at least one known shareholder had between 25% and 50% of shares, and at least one known shareholder had more than 50% of shares. Adding these additional controls led to similar results.</p>

<sec id="section17-0894486512469252">
<title>Endogeneity</title>
<p>As for most studies using observational data, there was the possibility of an endogeneity problem. Making use of cross-sectional data, one could argue that the results could also be interpreted the other way around, namely, that family firms taking more entrepreneurial risk will be more likely to hire a nonfamily CEO. This would subject our analysis to an endogeneity problem of reverse causality. A commonly used technique to solve this is the use of instrumental variables (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0894486512469252">Wooldridge, 2002</xref>). A good instrumental variable is correlated with the possible endogenous regressor (i.e., nonfamily CEO) but uncorrelated with the error term. Based on results of previous studies, we selected two instrumental variables (“higher education” and “years worked for the family firm”) that are likely to meet these conditions and that have some dissimilarities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0894486512469252">Bascle, 2008</xref>). Research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0894486512469252">Bennedsen et al. (2007)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0894486512469252">Jorissen, Laveren, Martens, and Reheul (2005)</xref> points out that on average nonfamily CEOs are more educated than family CEOs. Although mixed evidence exists, which suggests there is a nonsignificant as well as a positive significant relationship between management education and innovativeness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0894486512469252">Finkelstein, Hambrick, &amp; Cannella, 2009</xref>), there is a significant time gap between the formal education of the CEOs in our sample and when entrepreneurial risk taking was measured in our study. Because of this time gap, we believe it is unlikely that the level of a CEO’s formal education has a significant impact on their current risk-taking behavior. This reasoning is supported by our empirical results, which confirm that there is no significant correlation between CEO education and entrepreneurial risk taking. The second variable (“years worked for the firm”) has been chosen as an instrument because family members usually start in the family firm at a young age doing summer jobs or part-time jobs, which makes it likely that family CEOs have been working longer in the family firm than nonfamily CEOs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0894486512469252">Cadieux, Lorrain, &amp; Hugron, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0894486512469252">Dyer, 2006</xref>). Family successors often start in functions where they are confined to do minor tasks and involved in very little decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0894486512469252">Handler, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0894486512469252">Longenecker &amp; Schoen, 1978</xref>). As a nonexecutive function does not allow a person to exercise control on the strategic decision making of the firm, it is unlikely that there is a correlation between the years worked for the firm and entrepreneurial risk taking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0894486512469252">Finkelstein &amp; Hambrick, 1990</xref>). Our empirical results confirm again this theoretical reasoning as there is no significant correlation between years worked in the firm and entrepreneurial risk taking. Notwithstanding these theoretical arguments, we formally tested whether our instruments were exogenous with two different tests of overidentifying restrictions. Based on the Sargan statistic (<italic>p</italic> value of .52) and the Hansen <italic>J</italic>-statistic (<italic>p</italic> value of .53), we could not reject the null hypothesis that our instruments were exogenous, which is a necessary condition for the use of the Hausman test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0894486512469252">Larcker &amp; Rusticus, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In the first-stage regression, we entered the two instrumental variables as independent variables in an equation to obtain estimated values for the variable nonfamily CEO. Higher education was a dummy variable that took on a value of 1 when the CEO had a master’s degree from a university or college. The variable of years worked in the firm was continuous and indicated how many years the CEO had already worked in the firm in any possible function. Our two instrumental variables were both significantly related to the presence of a nonfamily CEO, which increased confidence that they were good instruments. The signs of the estimated coefficients were also in line with previous studies. The <italic>F</italic>-statistic associated with our instruments in the first stage regression is 10.55. As this is more than the commonly used benchmark of 10.0 suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0894486512469252">Staiger and Stock (1997)</xref>, any concerns about weak instruments are alleviated. To test for endogeneity, we performed a Hausman test by adding both the observed variable “nonfamily CEO” and the predicted variable “nonfamily CEO” into the second-stage regression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0894486512469252">Larcker &amp; Rusticus, 2010</xref>). The predicted variable had no significant effect on entrepreneurial risk taking, which suggests that there was no endogeneity problem and that our OLS results were robust.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0894486512469252">3</xref></sup></p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Consistent with previous research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0894486512469252">Gómez-Mejía, Núñez-Nickel, &amp; Gutierrez, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0894486512469252">Hall et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0894486512469252">Naldi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0894486512469252">Short et al., 2009</xref>), we found that family firms generally take less entrepreneurial risks than nonfamily firms. Moreover, building on entrenchment theory, we hypothesized and empirically found that a nonfamily CEO will have a positive effect on a family firm’s level of entrepreneurial risk taking during the initial years of his or her CEO tenure. Family CEOs usually have a high ownership stake in the firm, leading to a low preference for projects with uncertain returns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0894486512469252">Jensen &amp; Meckling, 1976</xref>). Moreover, family CEOs benefit from protecting the family’s socioemotional wealth, which also discourages entrepreneurial risk taking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0894486512469252">Gómez-Mejía et al., 2007</xref>). Nonfamily CEOs, on the other hand, bear less financial burden and can entrench themselves by making more risky investments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0894486512469252">Shleifer &amp; Vishny, 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, in this article we theorize and find empirical support for the idea that, as CEO tenure increases, this difference between nonfamily and family CEO-led family firms levels out. As their CEO tenure increases, nonfamily CEOs develop feelings of psychological ownership toward the family firm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0894486512469252">Pierce et al., 2001</xref>), which causes them to portray more and more stewardship behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0894486512469252">Hernandez, 2012</xref>). As a result, a nonfamily CEO’s interests will become increasingly aligned with those of the family owners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0894486512469252">Davis et al., 1997</xref>), making him or her attach more importance to the well-being of the family firm and family values than to his or her desire to entrench himself or herself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0894486512469252">Davis et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0894486512469252">Poza, 2007</xref>). Therefore, the initial positive effect that he or she had on a family firm’s entrepreneurial risk taking will mitigate.</p>
<p>This study has several important implications for the literature. To start with, our findings suggest that the notion of ownership in agency theory must be extended to include the concept of psychological ownership. In traditional agency theory, an owner-manager is typically the zero-agency-costs base case, with the outside-manager situation at the other extreme, where the conflicting interests of principals and agents necessitate monitoring or incentive alignment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894486512469252">Ang et al., 2000</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0894486512469252">Schulze, Lubatkin, Dino, and Buchholtz (2001)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0894486512469252">Schulze, Lubatkin, and Dino (2003)</xref> have already nuanced these ideas, suggesting that in a firm that is owned and managed by a family—previously assumed to be a zero-agency-cost situation—parental altruism can actually cause high agency costs. In this study, by integrating psychological ownership into agency theory, we have also nuanced traditional agency theory. More specifically, we argue that because of the development of psychological ownership, a nonfamily CEO’s interests can be aligned with those of family owners without being legal owner.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the article adds to the growing literature on entrepreneurial risk taking in family firms by not only looking at the entrepreneurial risk taking of family firms in general but also by studying the influence of appointing a nonfamily member as CEO. We thereby answer calls made by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0894486512469252">Gómez-Mejía et al. (2010)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0894486512469252">Short et al. (2009)</xref> to study the influence of the CEO position on risk taking in family firms.</p>
<p>Moreover, this study answers recent calls for more research on nonfamily CEOs in family firms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0894486512469252">Blumentritt et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0894486512469252">Chua et al., 2003</xref>). Although research on nonfamily CEOs is regarded as a very important topic in the family business field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0894486512469252">Chua et al., 2003</xref>), the literature on the subject remains scant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0894486512469252">Blumentritt et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Our results also have important implications for practice. Family firm owners should keep in mind that appointing a nonfamily CEO will likely have an initial positive influence on the firm’s entrepreneurial risk taking. Therefore, if the goal is to increase the entrepreneurial activity of the firm, this could be a good decision. However, if the family owners prefer a more risk-averse strategy, they should discuss these preferences with the nonfamily CEO and regularly evaluate whether the firm is still following the preferred course. Moreover, our results also point out that this positive effect of a nonfamily CEO on the level of entrepreneurial risk taking will level out when the CEO tenure increases. Careful reflection on this process and evaluation of the results by comparing with the risk-taking objectives are necessary. Moreover, our results indicate that nonfamily CEOs can develop psychological ownership toward the family firm as their CEO tenure increases. Therefore, when the CEO feels like an owner, the interests of the family owners and the nonfamily CEO might be more aligned than expected. In this case, the use of agency contracts, referring to incentives and mechanisms of control to prevent agents from acting opportunistically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0894486512469252">Eisenhardt, 1989</xref>), will be counterproductive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0894486512469252">Davis et al., 1997</xref>). These findings can be linked to research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0894486512469252">Fong and Tosi (2007)</xref> suggesting that agents—in this case conscientious individuals—can have similar interests as principals, which makes monitoring and incentive alignment less necessary.</p>
<p>This study has some limitations that provide fruitful avenues for future research. To start with, our results are based on a sample of Belgian private family firms. This offers the advantage of having publicly available financial data on private firms, which is not the case for all countries. Future research could explore whether our findings can be generalized to other countries as well. Furthermore, this article has focused on the relationship between nonfamily CEOs and family owners because agency theory predicts that diverging interests will have an influence on risk taking. Studying other agency relationships might also form an interesting future research path. Based on distinct forms of altruism, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0894486512469252">Lim et al. (2010)</xref>, for example, conceptually discuss the effects of family ownership structure on the risk-taking propensity of family firms. Empirical verification of the impact of ownership structure on the level of family firm risk taking is called for. Another interesting avenue would be to further investigate psychological ownership development in family firms; this could, for example, add to the debate on family involvement, family essence, and family firm identity (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0894486512469252">Zellweger, Eddleston, &amp; Kellermanns, 2010</xref>). More specifically, the degree to which family members feel like the psychological owners of their firm could explain more about the level of family influence on a firm and hence the unique characteristics of family firms. Moreover, future research could also investigate whether psychological ownership can explain why some family firms behave more like nonfamily firms and why some nonfamily firms seem like family firms.</p>
<p>Finally, we have focused on the influence of CEO type (family vs. nonfamily CEO) on the entrepreneurial risk-taking behavior of family firms and how this influence is moderated by CEO tenure. However, future research could also investigate additional factors that might influence this effect. Situational factors or individual characteristics of the nonfamily CEO might be considered. For example, the current economic crisis might make nonfamily CEOs place a higher value on job security, which would increase the positive influence that he or she has on the firm’s entrepreneurial risk taking and potentially prolong the time it takes for the difference between nonfamily CEOs and family CEOs to level out. The personal tastes and preferences of the CEO toward risk might also moderate the effect of a non-family CEO on a family firm’s risk taking and could be taken into account in future research.</p>

<p>These 15 outliers comprised 5 family and 10 nonfamily firms. Repeating our analyses without omitting these outliers led to the same results.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn2-0894486512469252">
<label>2.</label>
<p>Although our regression models are significant, the <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> value is rather low. This is not uncommon and comparable with previous studies on family firms (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0894486512469252">Bonilla, Sepulveda, &amp; Carvajal, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0894486512469252">Schulze et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0894486512469252">Westhead, 2003</xref>). Dependent variables, such as performance or risk variables, are determined by a very wide range of potential determinants. Therefore, it is logical that the <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> in cross-sectional models is not very high.</p>

<p>The results from the two regression models and the Hausman test can be obtained from the authors.</p>
