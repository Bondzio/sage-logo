<abstract>
<p>Although supervision is recognized as a significant tenant of professional growth for counseling and psychotherapy students, the variability of the effectiveness, or ineffectiveness, of supervision has come under scrutiny in recent times. Our sample of 128 participants shed light on the most effective (e.g., encouraged autonomy, strengthened the supervisory relationship, and facilitated open discussion) and most ineffective (e.g., depreciated supervision, performed ineffective client conceptualization and treatment, and weakened the supervisory relationship) supervisor skills, techniques, and behaviors. Moreover, effective and ineffective behaviors, along with best and worst supervisors, were significantly differentiated based on the supervisory working alliance, supervisor style, supervisor self-disclosure, supervisee nondisclosure, and supervisee evaluation. Implications for supervision competencies and supervisor accountability are discussed.</p>

<p>Over the past decade, the empirical literature has pointed out that supervision, arguably with benevolent intentions, has also proven at times to be problematic, counterproductive, harmful, and unethical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0011000012442648">Ellis, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0011000012442648">Gray, Ladany, Walker, &amp; Ancis, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0011000012442648">Ladany, Lehrman-Waterman, Molilnaro, &amp; Wolgast, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0011000012442648">Nelson &amp; Friedlander, 2001</xref>). The competency-based supervision movement has, in part, attempted to begin to prevent or mollify the negative side of supervision (Falender, Burnes, &amp; Ellis, 2013; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011000012442648">Falender &amp; Shafranske, 2007</xref>). Some of the earliest empirical attempts to look at the influence of supervision on supervisees examined the extent to which supervision consisted of good versus bad events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0011000012442648">Worthen &amp; McNeill, 1996</xref>), best versus worst sessions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0011000012442648">Martin, Goodyear, &amp; Newton, 1987</xref>), best versus worst experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0011000012442648">Allen, Szollos, &amp; Williams, 1986</xref>), or successful versus unsuccessful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0011000012442648">Tracey &amp; Sherry, 1993</xref>). Methods typically employed were case studies or solely qualitative, or solely quantitative, and all focused on one supervision experience with supervisees in training. In general, these studies offered partial insight into some of the behaviors that supervisors exhibit that positively or negatively influence supervisees; however, few were methodologically sound investigations and most were conducted over a decade ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0011000012442648">Ellis &amp; Ladany, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>More recently, a few researchers have qualitatively examined primarily effective supervisor interventions or supervisory events. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0011000012442648">Jacobsen and Tanggaard (2009)</xref> investigated beginning Danish supervisees’ experiences of good and bad supervisory events. His findings indicated that beginning supervisees found supervisor guidance and support helpful; however, there were large individual differences with respect to what supervisees found unhelpful. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0011000012442648">Bang and Park (2009)</xref> in a qualitative study of Korean supervisors found that teaching and exploration of personal issues were believed to be uniquely helpful to supervisees. Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0011000012442648">Ancis and Marshall (2010)</xref> were able to identify theoretically based interventions (e.g., supervisor-focused personal development of the trainee) used by multiculturally competent supervisors.</p>
<p>The purpose of the present investigation was to extend the literature by using a mixed-method design, qualitative and quantitative inquiry, across multiple supervision experiences of the same participant supervisees. In addition, we were interested in supervisees who had experienced multiple types of supervisors over the course of their professional development. Specifically, we sought to identify supervisor skills, techniques, and behaviors that were deemed effective in facilitating supervisee growth versus those skills, techniques, and behaviors that were ineffective, or limited or hindered supervisee growth. We believed this level of specificity, in particular, would extend the literature to date, which tended to focus more on larger events in supervision. A second primary purpose of this investigation was to examine the relationship between effective and ineffective supervisor behaviors and supervision process and outcome, specifically the supervisory working alliance, supervisor style, supervisor self-disclosure, supervisee nondisclosure, and supervisee evaluation. A third and final purpose of our investigation was to determine the differences between the best and worst supervisors in relation to the supervisory working alliance, supervisor style, supervisor self- disclosure, supervisee nondisclosure, and supervisee evaluation. It was hypothesized that supervisors considered best/most effective, in comparison to those deemed worst/least effective, would have been perceived as having created a stronger working alliance, demonstrated more positive aspects of supervisor style, would have disclosed more, would have facilitated less supervisee nondisclosure, and would have developed a more favorable evaluation process. In sum, we believed that the effective and ineffective skills, techniques, and behaviors identified would form the basis for competency benchmarks in supervision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011000012442648">Falender &amp; Shafranske, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0011000012442648">Fouad et al., 2009</xref>). We anticipated that our data would offer evidence both in support and perhaps in contrast to the competency benchmarks.</p>

<title>Trainees</title>
<p>One hundred and eighty individuals initiated participation in this study. A total of 128 participants (100 female, 27 male, 1 unknown) averaging 35.4 years in age fully completed the study; the data of 52 participants were excluded because they did not complete the survey. The majority of participants (109, 85.2%) identified as European American/White; eight participants (6.3%) identified as Hispanic/Latino(a), five (3.9%) identified as African American/Black, three (2.3%) identified as Asian American or Pacific Islander, two (1.6%) identified as other race, and one did not specify race. Participants reported currently pursuing or having already received degrees from primarily (118) doctoral programs in clinical psychology (57.8%), counseling psychology (28.9%), school psychology (4.7%), and other related programs (8.6%). Participants described their experience as the beginning level of practicum (2.3%), advanced level of practicum (17.2%), internship (30.5%), postinternship (5.5%), or postdoctorate (42.2%), and 2.3% of participants did not describe their experience. For those participants who were currently still in training, they had been in their program on average for 4.36 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 1.52).</p>

<title>Best supervisors</title>
<p>Each participant reported one “best supervisor.” Thus, there were a total of 128 best supervisors described in the current study. In terms of race, the supervisors were White (109, 85.2%), Hispanic/Latino (5, 3.9%), African American (5, 3.9%), Asian American (4, 3.1%), other race (2, 1.6%), and unknown (3). More than half (56.3%) of the supervisors were female, while 41.4% were male. The majority of the supervisors (114, 87.6%) had a doctoral degree, while the remainder had master’s degrees in counseling or social work. The degrees of three supervisors were not identified. Within supervision, students were often evaluated based on a pass or fail basis (76, 59.4%), letter grade (25, 19.5%), or other system (24, 18.8%). Supervision was given in various sites: college counseling centers (44, 34.4%), community mental health centers (24, 18.8%), private hospitals (10, 7.8%), state hospitals (8, 6.3%), veterans hospitals (12, 9.4%), other (26, 20.3%), and unreported (4). These supervisors were employed at college counseling centers (33, 25.8%), hospital settings (31, 24.2%), academic settings (26, 20.3%), community mental health centers (17, 13.3%), and private practice (14, 10.9%). The best supervisor provided an average 1.5 hours per week for an average total of 48.9 sessions.</p>

<sec id="section5-0011000012442648">
<title>Worst supervisors</title>
<p>Each participant reported one “worst supervisor.” Thus, there were a total of 128 worst supervisors described in the current study. In terms of race, the supervisors were White (111, 86.7%), Hispanic/Latino (6, 4.7%), African American (3, 2.3%), Asian (3, 2.3%), and unknown (5). In terms of gender, about half of the supervisors were female (64), slightly less than half of the supervisors were male (60), and four supervisors’ genders were not identified. The majority of supervisors were identified as holding a doctoral degree (105, 82.0%), while the remainder had master’s degrees in counseling and social work. The degrees of five supervisors were not identified. In supervision, the majority of trainees were evaluated on a pass or fail basis (76, 59.4%), many received letter grades (30, 23.4%), some used another evaluation system (17, 13.3%), and five participants did not respond to the question. Supervision was given in college counseling centers (32, 25.0%), community mental health centers (32, 25.0%), private hospitals (13, 10.2%), state hospitals (10, 7.8%), veterans hospitals (10, 7.8%), and other sites (26, 20.3%), and five participants did not respond to the question. These supervisors were employed at hospital settings (32, 25.0%), academic settings (29, 22.7%), college counseling centers (20, 15.6%), community mental health centers (27, 21.1%), and private practice (10, 7.8%), and 10 participants did not respond to the question. The worst supervisor provided an average of 1.4 hours per week for an average total of 32.7 sessions.</p>

<sec id="section7-0011000012442648">
<title>Supervisee evaluation of supervisor form</title>
<p>A qualitative questionnaire was developed for utilization in this study to inquire about helpful and hindering behaviors of best/most effective and worst/least effective supervisors. Participants were instructed to report at least three supervisor skills, techniques, or behaviors that facilitated their growth as a supervisee. They were also asked to list at least three supervisor skills, techniques, or behaviors that limited, or hindered, their growth as a supervisee. Participants responded to this form, and thus reported helpful and hindering behaviors, for each supervisor.</p>

<sec id="section8-0011000012442648">
<title>Working Alliance Inventory/Supervision–Short Form (WAI/S-Short)</title>
<p>The WAI/S-Short is a 12-item self-report questionnaire utilized to assess the three constructs of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0011000012442648">Bordin’s (1983)</xref> working alliance model: agreement on the goals of supervision, agreement on the tasks of supervision, and an emotional bond between the trainee and supervisor. The Working Alliance Inventory (WAI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0011000012442648">Horvath &amp; Greenberg, 1989</xref>) and the Working Alliance Inventory–Short (WAI-Short; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0011000012442648">Tracey &amp; Kotovic, 1989</xref>) are widely utilized as measures of the therapeutic alliance. The Working Alliance Inventory/Supervision (WAI/S; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0011000012442648">Bahrick, 1989</xref>) and the WAI/S-Short are modified versions for supervision of the WAI and WAI-Short, respectively. The supervisory working alliance has been found to be one of the most robust supervision variables examined to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0011000012442648">Ladany &amp; Inman, in press</xref>). The internal consistency coefficients of the total WAI/S-Short, Goal subscale, Task subscale, and Bond subscale for the best supervisors were .85, .73, .64, and .78, respectively. The internal consistency coefficients for the worst supervisors were .84, .76, .64, and .77, respectively.</p>

<p>The SSI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0011000012442648">Friedlander &amp; Ward, 1984</xref>) is a 25-item self-report questionnaire. The scale assesses three constructs: Attractive (e.g., friendliness, warmth, supportiveness), Interpersonally Sensitive (commitment, therapeutic, perceptive), and Task Oriented (goal-oriented, thorough, focused). The internal consistency coefficients in this study were .84, .90, .86, and .78 for best supervisors. For worst supervisors, the internal consistency coefficients were .85, .91, .86, and .84.</p>

<p>The SSDI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0011000012442648">Ladany &amp; Lehrman-Waterman, 1999</xref>) is a nine-item self-report questionnaire that measures supervisors’ self-disclosure in the supervisory relationship. The items describe various types of self-disclosing statements (e.g., “My supervisor self-discloses information related to her or his present experiences”) made by their supervisors. The internal consistency coefficient of the SSDI in the current study was .83 for the best supervisors and .89 for the worst supervisors.</p>

<p>The TDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0011000012442648">Ladany, Walker, Pate-Carolan, &amp; Gray Evans, 2008</xref>) is a 13-item self-report questionnaire that measures the degree to which trainees withhold information in the supervisory relationship. The scale was rationally and theoretically constructed based upon nondisclosure types (e.g., negative reactions to supervisor, personal issues, and clinical mistakes) described in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0011000012442648">Ladany, Hill, Corbett, &amp; Nutt, 1996</xref>).

<title>Preliminary Analyses</title>
<p>To test for the potential confounding influence of the demographic variables on the primary variables in this study, a series of multivariate analyses were conducted. In each analysis, the demographic variable served as the independent variable, while the primary variables served as the dependent variables. The per comparison alpha coefficient was set to .001 to minimize Type I error and yet maintain a conservative estimate of potential confounding effects. Results indicate that none of the demographic variables (e.g., experience level) were significantly related to any of the primary variables.</p>

<sec id="section16-0011000012442648">
<title>Descriptive Analyses</title>
<p>Utilizing qualitative information obtained from the Supervisee Evaluation of Supervisor Form, discovery-oriented analysis was used to develop mutually exclusive categories for effective supervisor behaviors and ineffective supervisor behaviors. The effective supervisor behavior categories can be seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0011000012442648">Table 1</xref> and the ineffective supervisor behavior categories can be seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0011000012442648">Table 2</xref>. In general, trainees reported an average of 5.1 effective behaviors and 3.2 ineffective behaviors for “Best” supervisors. Trainees reported an average of 2.6 effective behaviors and 3.5 ineffective behaviors for “Worst” supervisors.”</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>A mixed-methods investigation invariably generates large swaths of data that can produce findings that are overwhelming and often unnecessarily complex. The purpose of our discussion is to summarize the results along two lines of findings or themes: (a) effective and ineffective behaviors and supervisor competencies and (b) salient variables for understanding supervision process and outcome. Along both themes, theoretical, empirical, and practical implications are offered.</p>
<sec id="section24-0011000012442648">
<title>Effective and Ineffective Behaviors</title>
<p>What did our participants tell us about effective and ineffective supervisor skills, techniques, and behaviors? First, the identified effective supervisor skills, techniques, and behaviors arguably can be seen as a primer for supervisor competencies. Across both the best and worst supervisors, a series of consistent behaviors were identified. Adding to the robust findings in the literature to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0011000012442648">Ladany &amp; Inman, in press</xref>) as well as current conceptualizations of supervision competencies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011000012442648">Falender &amp; Shafranske, 2007</xref>), the supervisory relationship seems to be a critical component and foundational competency on which to attend (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0011000012442648">Rodolfa et al., 2005</xref>). Hence, it seems that the relationship has an important influence on supervisee learning. Bringing to bear counseling skills, such as empathy and encouragement, into the supervision context arguably provides a foundation for the efficacy of additional supervisory interventions. One unique finding that has only received cursory attention in the theoretical and practical literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0011000012442648">Kaslow &amp; Bell, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0011000012442648">McWhirter &amp; McWhirter, 2007</xref>) is the recognition that <italic>empowering</italic> the supervisee via encouraging autonomy and facilitating openness to the supervisee’s ideas is valued by supervisees. Of course, much of these ideas can be traced back to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0011000012442648">Bordin (1983)</xref>, who encouraged supervisors to give supervisees the opportunity to self-direct in supervision. Ultimately, it seems that the participant supervisees offered an important variable to consider in understanding the interpersonal dynamics in supervision.</p>
<p>The supervisor as expert clinician also was identified as an effective supervisory skill. Specifically, supervisors who were able to demonstrate their clinical knowledge, that is, to self-disclose clinical information that was relevant to the supervisees presenting concerns and was in the service of the supervisee, seemed particularly helpful. This finding coincides with theoretical, empirical, and practical writings on supervisor self-disclosure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0011000012442648">Ladany &amp; Walker, 2003</xref>). Finally, feedback that was positive and challenging seemed to be uniquely beneficial to supervisees. Hence, these results suggest that supervisors would do well not to offer unbridled optimism about supervisees and recognize that supervisees can handle challenges, and in fact, may welcome challenges, especially within a positive supervisory relationship. One interesting aside is that the effective and ineffective supervisor skills, techniques, and behaviors did not seem to differentiate supervisees who were at different experience (i.e., developmental) levels. This lack of finding coincides with questions about developmental hypotheses discussed in the theoretical literature that to date have limited empirical support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0011000012442648">Ladany &amp; Inman, in press</xref>). Moreover, it calls into question a fundamental assumption about the competency benchmarks, that is, the assumption that there are developmental changes that should take place in the supervisor’s approach.</p>
<p>As the identified effective categories offer a primer for supervisor competencies, the identified ineffective categories perhaps offer a primer for supervisor incompetence. Results from our study coincide with findings from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0011000012442648">Magnuson, Wilcoxon, and Norem’s (2000)</xref> qualitative investigation of “lousy supervisors.” One of our more striking findings was how supervisors, at times, depreciated or devalued supervision. As has been found in the literature, supervision can be a place where supervisees are harmed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0011000012442648">Ellis, 2001</xref>). As can be seen in the examples, presumably what is clearly not acceptable in a counseling relationship (e.g., answering phone calls) was deemed acceptable in supervision. A weakening of the supervisory relationship was understandably problematic for supervisees. What is unclear, however, is if the weakening was a rupture in the supervisory alliance that was irreparable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0011000012442648">Ladany, Friedlander, &amp; Nelson, 2005</xref>). In supervision, it would be expected that, at times, supervisors would not perform expertly. The question remains whether the supervisory alliance was strong enough to withstand potentially problematic supervisor behaviors. In sum, the results related to ineffective supervisor skills, techniques, and behaviors speak to the challenges that many supervisors seem to possess and have implications for training sites that may offer little guidance or accountability of supervisor performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0011000012442648">Ladany, 2007</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section25-0011000012442648">
<title>Supervision Process and Outcome</title>
<p>A second overarching implication from the findings pertains to the importance relegated to the quantitative variables under study, specifically the supervisory working alliance, supervisor style, supervisor self-disclosure, supervisee nondisclosure, and evaluation. Best versus worst supervisors and, to a large extent by extrapolation, effective and ineffective supervisor behaviors were linked with these aforementioned quantitative variables.</p>
<p>Hence, if one were to ask what an effective or highly competent supervisor were to look like, the findings point to the following. First, the supervisor would work toward developing a strong supervisory alliance by working toward mutually agreeing with the supervisee on the goals and tasks of supervision. The supervisor would use basic counseling skills such as listening, reflection of feelings, and empathy to facilitate the development of an emotional bond. An effective supervisor would attend to and offer a balance of attractive or collegial interactions, interpersonal attentiveness, and task-oriented structure. Moreover, self-disclosure would be used judiciously and in the service of the supervisee. It would be anticipated that supervisees would offer less nondisclosures, thereby facilitating a more meaningful supervision experience. Finally, supervisors would attend specifically to the evaluation aspect of supervision by facilitating the setting of supervisory goals and providing both formative and summative feedback.</p>
<p>The significance found from these variables offers a foundation upon which to conduct additional investigations. For example, along with and beyond the quantitative variables found to be salient, future researchers would do well to study additional variables such as supervisor ethical adherence, supervisor training, supervisor theoretical approach to supervision, supervisor responsiveness, supervisor multicultural competence, and so forth, thereby adding to the multifaceted skills required for the best supervisory experiences.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section26-0011000012442648">
<title>Limitations and Conclusions</title>
<p>The findings must be considered in light of the limitations to the experimental design. First, participant recall likely influenced the content and manner in which the participants responded. It is possible that the salience or meaningfulness of a supervision experience, be it positive or negative, played a part in the types of recall that occurred. In a related fashion, the instructions that asked participants to first consider their best, then their worst supervisors could have subjected the results to anchoring effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0011000012442648">Kahneman, 2011</xref>). Recommended future investigative work may or may not offer support to the current findings if the variables examined were in the context of single ongoing supervisory experiences. Second, only the supervisees’ perspectives were considered. The extent to which supervisors actually engaged in these behaviors is unclear. Future work may want to consider assessing both members of the supervisory dyad, as well as objective raters, to determine the congruence with which they experience happenings in supervision. Finally, additional variables not studied may prove useful to determine the adequacy of the emerging model of variables based on the current investigation. For example, it may prove useful to consider effective or ineffective supervisor behaviors in relation to variables such as supervisee openness to learning, supervision setting, or supervisee anxiety. Moreover, particular kinds of outcomes, such as supervisee multicultural competence or supervisor and supervisee metacompetence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011000012442648">Falender &amp; Shafranske, 2007</xref>), may be linked to effective or ineffective behaviors yet to be identified.</p>
<p>In sum, this investigation offers insight into a variety of supervisor skills, techniques, and behaviors that help, stagnate, or hinder supervisee growth. Moreover, the results provide linkages to the relevance of the current trend of defining supervision competency benchmarks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0011000012442648">Fouad et al., 2009</xref>) both in relation to supporting some of the proposed competency benchmarks (e.g., importance of the supervisory relationship, goal setting) as well as not supporting other competency benchmarks (e.g., salience of developmental level).</p>
<p>Given the number of supervision experiences counseling students receive and given the number of ineffective supervisory experiences reported, counselor educators would do well to consider supervisor accountability in relation to an adequate training model. Specifically, supervisor accountability in terms of demonstrating proficiency has received virtually no recognition in the literature. At best, some state boards are requiring that supervisors receive training, but the content and efficacy of this training has been largely unstudied. To that end, we encourage supervisor trainers and researchers to seriously attend to evaluating supervisor behaviors in the same fashion given to counselor and psychotherapist evaluation to date.</p>
