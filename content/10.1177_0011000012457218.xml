<abstract>
<p>Female student athletes often desire a muscular body to be successful in sport, but this body type does not conform to traditional cultural norms of femininity. In this study, the authors qualitatively examined the experiences of female intercollegiate volleyball players to better understand their beliefs about their bodies—both as athletes and as women outside of sport—in addition to whether perceptions about their revealing sports uniforms were related to body image. Results indicated that body image among female student athletes is a multidimensional construct. Participants reported conflicting messages about their bodies in regard to how they look on the court and how they are supposed to look off the court. In addition, results suggested that revealing uniforms contributed to decreased body esteem, and these uniforms also distracted players and impacted on-court performance. Results are interpreted within the framework of objectification theory, and implications for psychologists working with female student athletes are provided.</p>

<p>Female student athletes at the National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I (NCAA DI) level face numerous expectations and pressures during their quest to excel in academics, athletics, and life. Specifically, the high pressure performance demands required of NCAA DI student athletes may create a sense of conflict for women who desire a muscular, athletic body that may not conform to the socially desired body type for women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0011000012457218">Cole, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0011000012457218">Greenleaf, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0011000012457218">Krane, Waldron, Michalenok, &amp; Stiles-Shipley, 2001</xref>). With this in mind, it is not surprising that female athletes have acknowledged the importance of being muscular and report feeling empowered by their strong bodies, yet also want to avoid being perceived as being too muscular for fear of violating societal norms of traditional femininity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0011000012457218">Krane, Waldron, et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0011000012457218">Greenleaf, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0011000012457218">Steinfeldt, Zakrajsek, Carter, &amp; Steinfeldt, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to female athletes having to navigate dual—and often conflicting—feminine and athletic roles, “athletics provide a unique environment that places the physical body on <italic>center stage</italic> . . . in which their bodies are evaluated not only based on performance, but on appearance” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0011000012457218">Greenleaf, 2002</xref>, p. 63). Past research has also suggested that female athletes who are required to wear revealing sports uniforms report higher levels of body image concerns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0011000012457218">Feather, Ford, &amp; Herr, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0011000012457218">Reel &amp; Gill, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0011000012457218">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0011000012457218">Thompson &amp; Sherman, 2010</xref>). Subsequently, this study intended to investigate female student athletes’ thoughts and feelings related to their bodies within the high-pressured athletic environment of intercollegiate athletics. Specifically, this study sought to examine female volleyball players’ thoughts and feelings about their bodies—both as athletes and as women outside of sport—in addition to whether perceptions about their revealing spandex uniforms were related to their body image.</p>

<title>Body Image Among Female Student Athletes</title>
<p>Body image refers to perceptions and attitudes about one’s body, particularly physical appearance, and has been described as a complex social construct shaped by context and gender socialization experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0011000012457218">Cash, Thériault, &amp; Annix, 2004</xref>). In recent years, sport psychology researchers have paid increasing attention to understanding the gender role socialization experiences of female athletes, including how athletic and social contexts shape perceptions, thoughts, and feelings about body image (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0011000012457218">Steinfeldt, Carter, Benton, &amp; Steinfeldt, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0011000012457218">Steinfeldt, Zakrajsek, et al., 2011</xref>). Unique to female athletes is the conflicting pressure to conform to Western culture body ideals while also meeting sport body ideals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0011000012457218">Cole, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0011000012457218">Greenleaf, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0011000012457218">Krane, Choi, Baird, Aimar, &amp; Kauer, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0011000012457218">Petrie, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0011000012457218">Pirinen, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0011000012457218">Steinfeldt, Carter, et al., 2011</xref>). The socially desirable body type and the athletic body type often conflict, as evidenced by female athletes reporting the need to be strong, muscular, and powerful for their sport, yet also wanting to fit the societal ideal by avoiding being perceived as too muscular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0011000012457218">Greenleaf, 2002</xref>). This societal ideal has been described as a series of contradictions—“firm but shapely, fit but sexy, strong but thin” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0011000012457218">Markula, 1995</xref>, p. 424). Although female athletes have acknowledged that the societally ideal body is unrealistic and have expressed pride in their athletic bodies, they have also expressed dissatisfaction with their bodies and have been quick to point out flaws: This discrepancy and perceived incompatibility between female athletes’ beliefs about their athletic body and the societally desired female body type are negatively related to their body image attitudes and concerns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0011000012457218">Krane et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0011000012457218">Krane, Waldron, et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>As female athletes are socialized into and through an environment (e.g., sport) that values traditional masculine traits (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0011000012457218">Beal, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0011000012457218">Wellard, 2002</xref>), they are also exposed to Western culture’s emphasis on dualism that dichotomizes the gendered body as being either masculine or feminine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0011000012457218">Clasen, 2001</xref>). In past research, female athletes reported their perception that being athletic was equated with being masculine, and participants found it easier to describe femininity by identifying what it was not (e.g., being sweaty, being aggressive, and lifting weights are not feminine; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0011000012457218">Krane et al., 2004</xref>). Although female college student athletes have been found to conform to the same level of traditional feminine norms as their nonathlete female peers, female student athletes have also reported conforming to more traditional masculine norms related to sport participation (i.e., winning, risk taking). Furthermore, conformity to these traditional gender norms predicted body esteem (i.e., self-evaluative perceptions of one’s body parts and functions) among these female student athletes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0011000012457218">Steinfeldt, Zakrajsek, et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to gender norms, appearance-related norms and type of sport can influence female athletes’ beliefs concerning body image. Past research has demonstrated that when compared to female athletes in refereed sports (e.g., basketball), female participants in judged (i.e., aesthetic) sports (e.g., gymnastics) may be at a greater risk for negative body image and disordered eating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0011000012457218">Davison, Earnest, &amp; Birch, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0011000012457218">Zucker, Womble, Williamson, &amp; Perrin, 2000</xref>). Across sports, Western culture’s conception of femininity emphasizes physical appearance wherein dominant images of thin bodies and subsequent pressure to conform to appearance-related norms have been found to affect body satisfaction and weight control behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0011000012457218">Green, Davids, Skaggs, Riopel, &amp; Hallengren, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0011000012457218">Leavy, Gnong, &amp; Ross, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0011000012457218">Mahalik et al., 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0011000012457218">Krane, Waldron, et al. (2001)</xref> found that female athletes reported positive body image when they thought about themselves in the athletic environment yet reported negative body image and maladaptive behaviors when they thought about themselves in the social environment. Thus, athletes may feel comfortable with their powerful bodies for the purpose of performance within the athletic environment, where strength and muscularity are perceived as acceptable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0011000012457218">Greenleaf, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0011000012457218">Krane et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0011000012457218">Krane, Waldron, et al., 2001</xref>). Although participating in sports may provide the opportunity for increased body esteem and empowerment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0011000012457218">Richman &amp; Shaffer, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0011000012457218">Shaffer &amp; Wittes, 2006</xref>), female athletes still express concerns regarding their body shape and size, resulting in feelings that they do not conform to societal norms of the feminine body ideal, particularly in social contexts outside of sport.</p>

<title>Relationship Between Female Athletes’ Uniform and Body Image</title>
<p>Considering the influence of gender norms and appearance-related norms on body image beliefs and behaviors, it makes sense to examine the role of sport uniforms in relation to body image concerns. Although limited, past research does suggest that uniforms may provide a unique source of stress and can influence female student athlete body satisfaction within the athletic environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0011000012457218">Feather et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0011000012457218">Greenleaf, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0011000012457218">Krane et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0011000012457218">Krane, Stiles-Shipley, Waldron, &amp; Michalenok, 2001</xref>). Former competitive athletes have reported that their uniforms made them more aware of their shape and physique, which influenced feelings of dissatisfaction about their bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0011000012457218">Greenleaf, 2002</xref>). Current athletes reported that appearance in uniforms raised awareness of body concerns and the potential for others to evaluate their bodies against the societal ideal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0011000012457218">Krane, Stiles-Shipley, et al., 2001</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0011000012457218">Feather et al. (1996)</xref> found body satisfaction to be related to satisfaction with sport uniform among female college basketball players. Specifically, the basketball players who were thinner and less muscular reported feeling more satisfied with their uniforms, whereas participants with larger body types reported greater dissatisfaction with their uniforms and lower levels of body esteem. Thus, players with different body types may experience varying levels of satisfaction with their sport uniform and resulting body image.</p>
<p>Athletes’ perceptions about the relationship between uniform and body image can be viewed through the lens of objectification theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0011000012457218">Fredrickson &amp; Roberts, 1997</xref>). This framework provides an understanding of the experiences of women who operate within a sociocultural context that sexually objectifies the female body. To this point, the prevalence of skintight sport uniforms has contributed to perceptions of female athletes feeling sexualized and objectified in their uniforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0011000012457218">Kolnes, 1995</xref>). Female collegiate student athletes who wore revealing uniforms reported feeling exposed and expressed concerns with how they looked, in addition to feelings of discomfort associated with their uniforms. These female athletes felt that their uniforms exposed their size and muscularity, yet they also acknowledged being perceived as sexy by heterosexual male fans. However, wearing revealing uniforms contributed to these female athletes feeling that their bodies were sexualized rather than appreciated for their athletic performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0011000012457218">Krane et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Past research has suggested that revealing sport uniforms can play a role in body image concerns across different sports, including dancing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0011000012457218">Reel, 1998</xref>), cheerleading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0011000012457218">Reel &amp; Gill, 1996</xref>), and swimming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0011000012457218">Reel &amp; Gill, 2001</xref>). Furthermore, revealing sports uniforms have also been linked to disordered eating among female athletes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011000012457218">deBruin, Oudejans, Bakker, &amp; Woertman, 2011</xref>). In highlighting both the salience of unique sporting contexts and differences in gendered sporting experiences, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0011000012457218">Thompson and Sherman (2010)</xref> provided examples of sports (e.g., beach volleyball, track and field) wherein female athletes wore significantly more revealing uniforms (e.g., bare midriffs, bikini bottoms, revealing spandex) than their male counterparts. The authors suggested that possibilities exist for unhealthy eating behaviors to emerge as motivators for these female athletes to lose weight to look good in these revealing sport uniforms. Furthermore, these uniforms may serve as physical and psychological distractions to on-court performance, in addition to precluding young athletes from participating in a sport (e.g., volleyball) or event (e.g., high jump) because of a fear of the uniform they might be required to wear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0011000012457218">Thompson &amp; Sherman, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Although this research has demonstrated connections between revealing sports uniforms and negative mental health outcomes that also provide support for the tenets of objectification theory (i.e., that wearing revealing uniforms would increase female athletes’ concerns about body image), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0011000012457218">Krane, Stiles-Shipley, et al. (2001)</xref> did not find a difference in female student athletes’ body satisfaction among participants who wore different classifications of revealing uniforms. The authors suggested that female athletes may not like wearing revealing uniforms, but that they often become accustomed to doing so by repeatedly competing in that type of uniform over the years. In addition to this habituation effect, female student athletes have been found to be able to shift their focus from uniform-related body image concerns to performance prior to competing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0011000012457218">Krane et al., 2004</xref>). This finding suggests that revealing uniforms do contribute to body image concerns, but this finding also indicates that female athletes are able to develop coping skills necessary to focus attention away from self-presentation concerns during competition. Thus, the multidimensional nature of female student athlete body image (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0011000012457218">Thompson &amp; Sherman, 2010</xref>) is a complex dynamic that warrants further investigation, particularly its relationship to uniforms worn across different sporting contexts.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0011000012457218">
<title>Current Study</title>
<p>More research is needed to better understand how different types of uniforms contribute to beliefs and behaviors regarding self-presentation, body image, and athletic performance among female student athletes across a broad spectrum of sports. Past research has indicated that female participants in aesthetic (i.e., judged) sports may be at risk for more negative body image attitudes than female athletes participating in refereed sports (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0011000012457218">Davison et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0011000012457218">Zucker et al., 2000</xref>). However, no research to date has examined how NCAA DI female student athletes in the refereed sport of volleyball think and feel about their uniforms and bodies, even though volleyball players wear skintight and often revealing spandex uniforms that do not fully cover all areas of their body (e.g., stomach, oblique muscles, buttocks, thighs). Thus, the potential exists for revealing uniforms to elicit concerns regarding these female athletes’ self-presentation and how other people may be evaluating and even objectifying their bodies.</p>
<p>Based on objectification theory (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0011000012457218">Fredrickson &amp; Roberts, 1997</xref>), our first research question operated under the premise that because these female student athletes often expose parts of their bodies in front of an audience of spectators, their uniforms may be a potential source of stress, which could subsequently contribute to body image concerns. In addition, because female athletes at the collegiate level are expected to meet high pressure performance demands, our second research question operated under the premise that perceptions of their athletic and muscular sport bodies may conflict with perceptions of their bodies in other social contexts. Subsequently, we conducted in-depth interviews with NCAA DI female volleyball players to examine beliefs and behaviors they hold about their bodies—both as athletes and as women outside of sport. In addition, we explored female volleyball players’ perceptions about their uniforms in an effort to examine whether these perceptions were related to body image.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants were 9 female college student athletes who played NCAA DI volleyball at a large public university in the Midwestern United States. Of the 12 members on the team who were contacted, 9 agreed to participate in this study. All members on this intercollegiate volleyball team were required to wear revealing spandex uniforms. Of the participants, 6 self-identified their race as White, 2 self-identified as Black, and 1 self-identified as Biracial. The mean age of the participants was 19.78 (<italic>SD</italic> = 0.83), with 3 first-year students, 3 sophomores, and 3 juniors. Participants reported having played volleyball for an average of 7.33 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 1.80). The average height of participants was 5 feet 10 inches, and the average weight was 161 pounds. Subsequently, the average body mass index (BMI) of participants was 23.13, which falls within the “normal weight” category (the categories include underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obese) along the range of BMI scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0011000012457218">National Institutes of Health, 2012</xref>).</p>

<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Research was conducted in accordance with institutional review board standards and American Psychological Association ethical standards. To address our research questions, we conducted an extensive review of the literature and consulted with psychologists who have expertise in this area (i.e., body image among student athletes) in an effort to compose a set of questions that would subsequently be used for the semistructured interviews (see appendix). The second author contacted athletic administrators and the team’s head coach in an effort to provide voluntary participation opportunities to players. Potential participants were contacted, and informal recruiting methods (e.g., word of mouth) resulted in interest from additional participants. The second author conducted and digitally recorded the semistructured interviews with nine volleyball players who expressed interest in participating in the study. After two research assistants transcribed the recordings of the interviews, the four members of the research team analyzed these interview transcriptions using consensual qualitative research (CQR) methodology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0011000012457218">Hill, Thompson, &amp; Williams, 1997</xref>). Philosophically, CQR can be characterized as constructivist with high degree of postpositivist aspects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0011000012457218">Hill et al., 2005</xref>), and the application of the CQR methodology in the current study can be interpreted as largely postpositivist in nature. CQR is considered to be an effective qualitative methodology that is “ideal because it involves a rigorous method that allows several researchers to examine data and come to consensus about their meaning” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0011000012457218">Hill et al., 2005</xref>, p. 204). CQR has been recently used in qualitative research that has explored issues in sport psychology (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0011000012457218">Steinfeldt, Foltz, et al., 2011</xref>), and “the reports of [CQR] studies are being published in premier, high impact journals” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0011000012457218">Ponterotto, 2010</xref>, p. 585).</p>

<title>Researchers and External Auditor</title>
<p>There were four members on the research team. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0011000012457218">Hill et al. (1997)</xref>, presenting relevant background information about researchers can help readers better evaluate the prospect of individual researchers’ biases. One member was a Biracial (White and American Indian) male counseling psychology faculty member who was a former NCAA DI college football, basketball, and baseball player. Another member was a White female sport psychology faculty member who was a former NCAA DIII college swimmer, whereas another member of the research team was a White female recreation and sport management faculty member who was a former NCAA DI college track and field athlete. The final member was a White female doctoral student in counseling psychology who was a former NCAA DI college volleyball player. The external auditor, a White male sport and exercise psychology faculty member, was chosen because of his expertise in sport psychology in addition to his experience with CQR research projects. All team members had previous experience with qualitative research, and all members possessed both personal and professional experiences with different sports, including familiarity with variations of uniforms and body image issues specific to different sports.</p>

<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Research team members discussed journal articles describing the process of conducting CQR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0011000012457218">Hill et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0011000012457218">Hill et al., 2005</xref>) as well as samples of articles that utilized CQR methodology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0011000012457218">Knox, Hess, Williams, &amp; Hill, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0011000012457218">Liu, Stinson, Hernandez, Shepard, &amp; Haag, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0011000012457218">Steinfeldt, Foltz, et al., 2011</xref>). To monitor biases that could influence the results, it is also recommended that researchers discuss potential assumptions, biases, and values prior to engaging in the CQR process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0011000012457218">Fassinger, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0011000012457218">Hill et al., 1997</xref>). Assumptions of team members included a belief that athletes might not be fully forthcoming about admitting weaknesses (e.g., poor body image beliefs), that thinner athletes might report greater satisfaction with their uniforms, and that the athletes might report being objectified—particularly by heterosexual men—while competing in their uniforms. Research team members also assumed that the nature of the revealing spandex uniforms could create greater body image dissatisfaction for volleyball players than female student athletes who participate in other sports without revealing uniforms.</p>
<p>In terms of potential biases, researchers acknowledged that although their past collective athletic experiences might provide useful insight in the process, these personal experiences could also potentially bias their interpretation of the data. Furthermore, it is important to acknowledge that research team members’ understanding of objectification theory could represent a potential bias in terms of how this familiarity with potential theoretical frameworks could influence their perceptions of emerging themes within the data analysis process. Based on CQR recommendations (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0011000012457218">Hill et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0011000012457218">Hill et al., 2005</xref>), assumptions and biases were constantly checked and evaluated throughout the data analysis process in an attempt to address and minimize bias in the data analysis process. For example, to address potential bias, research team members repeatedly challenged each other throughout the consensus building process to consider whether proposed themes were reflected within the data, or if they represented members’ personal perceptions.</p>
<p>Research team members read the interview transcriptions on their own to analyze interview data and to independently identify preliminary themes within the data. Rather than coding the transcripts with a preexisting list of potential themes based on the literature, all four research team members independently read the transcripts and developed their impressions about their own themes based on the participants’ responses within the interview transcripts. Team members were instructed to read through each of the transcripts multiple times before beginning to formally develop potential themes. To align with recommended CQR procedures, individual research team members read through each line of the transcripts in an attempt to generate themes that would “faithfully represent how participants describe their experiences rather than communicate how we as researchers experience the world” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0011000012457218">Hill et al., 2005</xref>, p. 197).</p>
<p>The research team then met multiple times to discuss these individually derived themes in an effort to develop a consensus on transforming these themes into categories and domains. Domains represent clusters of common notions (i.e., categories) that emerge from the independently created themes. Research team members presented, discussed, and negotiated their own analytical impressions of the data until consensus was reached to extract categories and domains from the transcripts. These preliminary results (i.e., categories, domains) were then sent to the external auditor for his feedback to elicit additional perspectives and, most important to the process, to check groupthink tendencies that may emerge in the consensus building process. For example, the external auditor commented that some categories appeared redundant, and this feedback was used to consolidate certain categories to more effectively represent the underlying sentiments conveyed by participants. After receiving the external auditor’s feedback, the research team met again to incorporate these perspectives to consensually compile the preliminary categorization structure.</p>
<p>Group members next provided clarification to each category by creating core ideas, which are intended to provide detail to the categories while remaining close to what the interviewees have said (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0011000012457218">Hill et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0011000012457218">Hill et al., 2005</xref>). To provide an account of the prevalence of each category within the data, the research team then employed a cross-analysis procedure to strengthen the methodological rigor of the study. Members of the team independently used the preliminary categorization structure to code the transcripts in conducting the cross-analysis procedure, in which the frequency of each category was identified as <italic>general</italic> (i.e., category was found in all of the transcripts), <italic>typical</italic> (i.e., category was found in more than half—but not all—of the transcripts), or <italic>variant</italic> (i.e., category was found in fewer than half of the transcripts). The members met to discuss their independent cross-analyses and reconciled the few differences they had. For example, the cross-analysis procedure demonstrated that a category in the first domain did not receive enough support in the transcripts, so after discussion among team members, this category was dropped from the emerging categorization structure. Finally, the group met again so we could agree on the final categorization structure.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Research team members’ initial analyses of the interview transcripts with the volleyball players identified many individual themes that emerged from the data. The consensus building process of CQR produced 18 categories and four domains from these individually derived themes. The domains that emerged from the data included (a) <italic>expectations of volleyball body/uniform</italic>, (b) <italic>uniform distraction/affirmation</italic>, (c) <italic>perceptions of others’ comments</italic>, and (d) <italic>social comparison.</italic> The cross-analysis procedure validated the domains generated, while simultaneously indicating the frequency (i.e., general, typical, variant) of each of the categories in the data (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0011000012457218">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Domain 1: Expectations of Volleyball Body/Uniform</title>
<p>The first domain addressed volleyball players’ perceptions about their bodies, particularly the relationship between body image and their uniforms. Specifically, players acknowledged societal expectations about what a volleyball player’s body should look like, as well as their own expectations about wearing a spandex uniform to play volleyball. The themes that emerged from these categories included those of confidence, capability, strength, a desire to be fit, and comfort while wearing the uniform. This domain comprised four categories: (a) <italic>purposeful body</italic>, (b) <italic>athletic, fit, self-assured</italic>, (c) <italic>desire to be comfortable</italic>, and (d) <italic>transition to spandex.</italic> The first category, <italic>purposeful body</italic>, constituted a typical response from eight of the players in this sample. Participants talked about the ways that being muscular, tall, and strong influenced their abilities on their court, as well as how their expectations of how being strong and physically fit could apply to other areas of their life. A 19-year-old Black player said, “If a coach or someone looks at me, they’re like, ‘Good, this girl is going to be powerful and stuff,’ because you would think she’s got all this power in her legs, she is strongly built.” Similarly, the second category, <italic>athletic, fit, self-assured</italic>, emerged from the transcripts of all nine of the players, constituting a general response. Participants described the type of body that people in society expect a volleyball player to have. This expected body type is athletic, fit, slim, and muscularly toned. Although many players acknowledged pressure to conform to this societal ideal, players also reported that these physical attributes can positively influence their body confidence and self-assuredness. A 20-year-old Black player stated,
<disp-quote>
<p>When you think of a volleyball player, you think of someone skinny, you think of like someone who just had, muscular legs, um, and I feel like throughout the years I’ve had that. I don’t feel huge in my uniform. I don’t feel big. So I just feel like I’m normal compared to what the stereotype for a volleyball player would be.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The third category in this domain, <italic>desire to be comfortable</italic>, emerged from the transcripts of all nine players, constituting a general response. Participants discussed the difficulties they faced in worrying about how they look in their spandex uniform, especially when this focus takes attention away from their on-court performance. In discussing this conflict, a 19-year-old White player said,
<disp-quote>
<p>I think it is a little too tight, just because not all, I don’t know how to say that, not all girls have like the right body for it, or they feel so self-conscious about it. And I feel like, “Why do you have to feel like that?” You shouldn’t have to worry about how you look in the uniform. You should only have to worry about how you are going to play, and like, focus on the game.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The final category, <italic>transition to spandex</italic>, also constituted a general response from all nine players. Participants recounted their personal memories of when they first began to wear spandex uniforms. Players disclosed having had initial concerns about the revealing nature of the uniform but reported feeling a sense of normalization when they saw peers wearing them. In discussing how she felt when she first started wearing spandex, a 19-year-old White player said,
<disp-quote>
<p>It just took a while to get used to because, I mean, when you go from basketball shorts to spandex, that’s like opposite ends of the spectrum. I kind of felt like, “Should I even go out in public in this?” I just looked like I was wearing a swimsuit. I was like, “Ummmm.” But then once I saw everybody else was wearing them, it was a lot better. It was a lot easier. But at first I wasn’t, I couldn’t, like, just wear spandex in public. I had to wear shorts over them, just like kind of as a cover, a cover-up.</p>
</disp-quote></p>

<sec id="section11-0011000012457218">
<title>Domain 2: Uniform Distraction/Affirmation</title>
<p>Although the first domain addressed expectations about body image and spandex uniforms, the second domain reflected players’ perceptions about how they believe their uniform specifically affects their body image and athletic performance, both negatively and positively. The five categories within this domain included (a) <italic>everything is hanging out</italic>, (b) <italic>shows all imperfections</italic>, (c) <italic>pregame performance</italic>, (d) <italic>in-game performance</italic>, and (e) <italic>functionality of uniform.</italic> The first category, <italic>everything is hanging out</italic>, was found in the interviews of eight of the players, constituting a typical response. In describing her concerns about how her body looked in the spandex uniform, a 19-year-old White player stated,
<disp-quote>
<p>Our shorts are just really short and really tight, and you know. Your butt hangs out, your legs are flopping around when you are diving on the floor. I just feel like that’s a lot to be seeing. And you know a lot of people are watching the games, and you just get self-conscious, like your butt is hanging out.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The second category, <italic>shows all imperfections</italic>, constituted a general response from all nine of the players in this sample. Players spoke about the nature of spandex uniforms and the ways that these tight, revealing uniforms can affect their body image. A 20-year-old White player stated, “Our jerseys are fairly skintight so it doesn’t leave much to the imagination.” Similarly, a 19-year-old White player said, “There is no room to hide anything. If you have one imperfection, everybody is going to see it, so you’d have to be really okay with yourself to not have to worry about that.”</p>
<p>The third category in this domain, <italic>pregame performance</italic>, emerged from the transcripts of four of the players, constituting a variant response. Participants discussed how their concerns about uniform and body led to a sense of hyperawareness during pregame warm-ups. Players also shared strategies they used before the game to mitigate this concern, including attempts to actively position themselves away from the gaze of spectators in the crowd. A 20-year-old White player stated,
<disp-quote>
<p>Definitely when we first get out there and we’re starting to warm up and we’re seeing people come into the gym, everyone is looking around, just trying to look at who’s on the court and who’s doing what and stuff. I’m definitely a little more self-conscious about what I’m doing and keeping myself, like, looking nice, and what my uniform is doing and how I’m looking in my uniform.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The fourth category, <italic>in-game performance</italic>, emerged from the transcripts of all nine of the players, constituting a general response. Participants discussed how awareness of uniform and body in front of a crowd contributed to constant adjustment of the uniform between plays or during breaks in action. In describing her own distraction during a match, another 20-year-old White player stated,
<disp-quote>
<p>I wasn’t thinking as much about the game as I should have been. I was thinking about, you know, what I looked like and what people were thinking about me instead of focusing on what I need to be doing for the game, or what I should be mentally preparing for the game. I would be worried, pulling my spandex down so I wasn’t falling out of them. Or pulling my jersey down so people wouldn’t see my stomach or my hips. It would take away from my concentration definitely.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although most of the categories within this domain represent negative appraisals of spandex uniforms, the comments in the final category acknowledged benefits of the uniform. This final category, <italic>functionality of uniform</italic>, constituted a typical response that was found in the transcripts of seven players. Many players described the aesthetic appeal of their uniform as a source of intimidation for competitors, particularly when they wore their black uniforms. Participants also indicated that the uniform could enhance performance, particularly as it relates to facilitating quick movements and preventing net calls. A 21-year-old White player stated,
<disp-quote>
<p>It helps because it [uniform] doesn’t get in our way as much because we are doing quick, fast movements, changing directions constantly, jumping up and down close to the net. Like if we were to have a baggy uniform, it might get caught in the net and we’d get a net call and that’s lost points to us.</p>
</disp-quote></p>

<sec id="section12-0011000012457218">
<title>Domain 3: Perceptions of Others’ Comments</title>
<p>In previous domains, players described their own beliefs and expectations about both body image and uniform. However, this next domain included impressions and comments that participants perceived were made—both directly and indirectly—by people around them. This domain comprised four categories: (a) <italic>coach messages</italic>, (b) <italic>teammates/competitors</italic>, (c) <italic>significant others</italic>, and (d) <italic>paradox of male spectators.</italic> The first category, <italic>coach messages</italic>, was found in the interviews of all nine of the players, constituting a general response. Participants discussed messages they received from coaches relating to weight gain or weight loss, and these messages affected players’ perceptions of both their appearance and their performance. A 20-year-old White player stated,
<disp-quote>
<p>Yes, our coach told us that, for a while, we heard that we had smaller uniforms so that everyone would want to lose weight or look better and that’s part of the reason why people said that we had small uniforms because they’d heard from our coach that we all needed to look, she wanted us to be aware of our bodies and want to look a certain way.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The second category, <italic>teammates/competitors</italic>, constituted a typical response from eight of the players in this sample. Participants talked about how teasing comments about uniforms and bodies were acceptable when they were made by teammates but unacceptable when competitors made such comments. A 19-year-old Black player specifically stated,
<disp-quote>
<p>My teammates definitely make fun of my butt because it’s big. But, I mean it’s all in fun. I mean I know they don’t mean any harm by it. But sometimes it’s annoying just because, I feel like even on the side other people [competitors] make comments too.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The third category in this domain, <italic>significant others</italic>, emerged from the transcripts of all nine players, constituting a general response. Participants described their perceptions of comments about the appropriateness of their revealing spandex uniforms made by significant others (e.g., family, friends, teachers). A 21-year-old White player stated,
<disp-quote>
<p>I think my family is not really a huge fan of them [spandex uniforms]. Like, they know it’s what everyone wears so like they are okay with it, but like my mom is always making sure, like, “Do you have a big enough size?” because she doesn’t like it when she sees other people have too small when it’s already, like spandex, then its extra small, so she wants to make sure I’m covering myself up as much as possible and stuff.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The final category in this domain, <italic>paradox of male spectator</italic>, constituted a typical response that was found in the transcripts of five players and reflected the assumption of heterosexuality (i.e., male spectators sexually desiring female volleyball players) that was expressed by the female participants in this study. Players discussed how objectifying comments about their bodies and uniforms made by fans—particularly male spectators—were expected and oftentimes uncomfortable. In recalling a time when she was distracted from the game and negatively affected by the actions of student spectators, a 20-year-old White player stated,
<disp-quote>
<p>I know there’s always certain schools that have student sections full of guys and girls, and they always will find anything to pick on and to just nail it into the ground. So I remember one game there was a student section and they had a white board and they were drawing our players, one by one, and our butts in the spandex. And I know everyone was completely distracted, not worrying about the game. They were all looking at, you know, what they were drawing.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Participants noted that they observed men frequently commenting about attending the matches primarily to see the female volleyball players wearing their revealing spandex uniforms. However, although many of the players reported feelings of dissatisfaction with the level of objectification illustrated by these examples, some players acknowledged their perception of a potentially beneficial side to the objectification accompanying their spandex uniforms. A 20-year-old White player said,
<disp-quote>
<p>And then friends-wise, I know a lot of guy friends that would come to our game specifically because it was girls in spandex. So a lot of times girls would, to get people to come to our games, we would be like, “You know you can come. It’s just a bunch of girls in spandex.” And so that’s how we would, you know, tell people to come to our games because I know that’s what a lot of guys come to our games for.</p>

<sec id="section13-0011000012457218">
<title>Domain 4: Social Comparison</title>
<p>The fourth domain comprised five categories: (a) <italic>comparison with other athletes</italic>, (b) <italic>paradox of on-court/off-court</italic>, (c) <italic>gaining muscle</italic>, (d) <italic>localized awareness</italic>, and (e) <italic>projection onto others</italic>. The categories in this domain described ways in which players compared themselves and their bodies both to other athletes and to nonathletic peers, including specific aspects of their body that were involved in this comparison. The first category, <italic>comparison with other athletes</italic>, was found in the interviews of eight players, constituting a typical response. Participants compared their own body to the bodies of competitors, making judgments about themselves and other athletes based on body structure. A 20-year-old White player stated,
<disp-quote>
<p>With the looks of it, I mean, if I had a choice I would definitely change some of the, like, the tightness of the uniforms or the look of the uniforms, just so it would benefit everybody and not so much like, “Oh I have to be skinny, and I have to be toned for these uniforms to look right,” because it does demote your confidence, and it does make you feel like, you compare yourself to other teammates and other athletes that look better in their uniforms, and you’re like, “Well, they look awesome and I look like I . . . [stopping].” You lose confidence points, really, if you don’t look good in your uniform.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The second category, <italic>paradox of on-court/off-court</italic>, emerged from the transcripts of seven players, constituting a typical response, whereas the third category in this domain, <italic>gaining muscle</italic>, also constituted a typical response from six of the players. In these categories, participants acknowledged a disparity between how they felt about their bodies while in sport compared to how they felt outside of their sport experiences. In expressing concern about gaining muscle necessary to be successful in volleyball, players compared their taller, bigger, and more muscular bodies to those of women who don’t play sports. As an illustration of the themes that emerged in both of these categories, a 19-year-old Biracial player said,
<disp-quote>
<p>I definitely feel like we’re a lot bigger because we’re working out so much and because we’re lifting weights all the time. I definitely feel like we have bigger bodies compared to women who don’t, which can be a little, um, you know, make me a little self-conscious because I, just like to say, comparing, I feel like a man sometimes because you’re just building so much muscle and constantly working out and then you see little petite women who are, you know, a lot smaller. So I guess it could make me feel a little more on the manly side.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The fourth category in this domain, <italic>localized awareness</italic>, emerged from the transcripts of eight players, constituting a typical response. Participants reported how spandex uniforms made them particularly aware of weight and of certain body parts, particularly in comparison to other athletes. A 20-year-old White player stated, “I feel like around my stomach area I might have more stuff there than I should but, I mean the uniform definitely shows that off so I tried and hide that as much as possible.” The final category in this domain, <italic>projection onto others</italic>, constituted a typical response that was found in the transcripts of seven players. Several players reported that they did not have a problem or concern, but instead they acknowledged the possibility that others might experience body image concerns related to wearing spandex uniforms. A 19-year-old Biracial player said,
<disp-quote>
<p>I could see where there could be problems. I’m not saying I have a problem with it. I don’t mind it at all. I don’t think anybody on my team minds it. I think we, I’m pretty comfortable with it. I think the girls on my team are. But I can definitely see where, if somebody was very self-conscious about their body.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results of this study provide insight into the complexities of body image beliefs held by female student athletes who play NCAA DI intercollegiate volleyball. Our findings support those of past research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0011000012457218">Greenleaf, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0011000012457218">Krane, Stiles-Shipley, et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0011000012457218">Krane, Waldron, et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0011000012457218">Steinfeldt, Carter, et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0011000012457218">Steinfeldt, Zakrajsek, et al., 2011</xref>), which indicates that female student athletes face conflicting messages about their bodies in regard to how they look on the court and how they are supposed to look off the court. These results also provide support for the notion that body image is a multidimensional construct among female student athletes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0011000012457218">Thompson &amp; Sherman, 2010</xref>). These women reported feeling pride and confidence in their athletic bodies within the athletic environment, yet they also reported feeling conflicted about their bodies within social contexts outside of sport, even though the average BMI of this sample was in the “normal weight” range. The volleyball players in our sample were six inches taller but weighed 4 pounds less than the U.S. national average for women, according to the U.S. National Health Statistics Report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0011000012457218">McDowell, Fryar, Ogden, &amp; Flegal, 2008</xref>). Thus, these are fit women with an athletic body type who would not be categorized as “overweight” or “obese” by BMI criteria, yet they still reported feeling concerned with how their bodies looked, particularly in revealing sports uniforms. In sum, our results supported the notion that female athletes “live the paradox” (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0011000012457218">Krane et al., 2004</xref>) wherein these women appreciate the power and strength of their bodies and acknowledge the importance of being muscular, yet they are also aware of contrasting societal body type expectations that contribute to their desire to avoid being perceived as too muscular and not conforming to traditional societal norms of femininity.</p>
<p>Our results concerning body image—particularly the findings related to perceptions of the revealing spandex uniform—can be interpreted within the framework of objectification theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0011000012457218">Fredrickson &amp; Roberts, 1997</xref>). Although sports are intended to provide opportunities for female athletes to achieve success, self-actualization, and a number of other positive experiences, the perceptions shared by participants in this study—along with the many anecdotes that enumerated their experiences of being evaluated and objectified—suggest that volleyball may represent a sexually objectifying environment (SOE). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0011000012457218">Syzmanski, Moffitt, and Carr (2011)</xref>, an SOE is an environment in which (a) traditional female and male gender roles exist, (b) women have little power in that environment, (c) a high degree of attention is drawn to physical or sexual attributes of women’s bodies, (d) a high probability of male contact exists, and (e) there is approval and encouragement of the male gaze.</p>
<p>Although their qualitative study of waitresses at an SOE (i.e., Hooters restaurant; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0011000012457218">Moffitt &amp; Syzmanski, 2011</xref>) might not readily fit with our perceptions of a volleyball match, the results of this study showed uncomfortable parallels between these two environments, based on the SOE criteria. Although female participation in sport has increased over the past four decades, sport remains an environment associated with traditional masculine traits (e.g., individualism, competitiveness, aggressiveness; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0011000012457218">Beal, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0011000012457218">Steinfeldt, Zakrajsek, et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0011000012457218">Wellard, 2002</xref>) and has a power base (e.g., coaches, athletic directors) that is made up of mostly men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0011000012457218">Acosta &amp; Carpenter, 2010</xref>). With those first two SOE criteria being met, the results of our study provided support for the final three criteria. Categories of participant responses about uniforms (e.g., <italic>everything hanging out, shows all imperfections, localized awareness</italic>) and the role that male spectators play (e.g., <italic>paradox of male spectator, significant others</italic>) suggest that volleyball matches might fit the criteria of an SOE. Furthermore, participants discussed their efforts to attract (presumably) heterosexual male spectators by framing their volleyball matches as an opportunity to see “a bunch of girls in spandex,” yet these women had to endure the humiliating experiences of having intimate parts of their bodies caricatured and publicly drawn by fans in the audience. Subsequently, in addition to creating the potential for volleyball matches to be characterized as an SOE, the consequences of revealing spandex uniforms can include increased sexual objectification, feelings of discomfort, and decreased body esteem among volleyball players.</p>
<p>Finally, the results of this study suggest not only that players’ perceptions about their uniforms influence their body image but also that these form-fitting spandex uniforms affect volleyball players’ performance on the court. Participants described the amount of time they dedicated—both during matches and before matches—to adjusting their spandex and worrying about how they looked in these revealing uniforms. Although some players indicated that they “got used to it,” most players expressed dissatisfaction with being distracted by the need to constantly adjust their uniform. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0011000012457218">Moradi and Huang (2008)</xref> suggested that self-objectification decreases task performance, which is consistent with our findings across multiple categories (e.g., <italic>desire to be comfortable, pregame performance, in-game performance, paradox of male spectator, teammates/competitors</italic>). Thus, in support of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0011000012457218">Thompson and Sherman (2010)</xref>, our results suggest that a revealing uniform may not only negatively affect the body image of female volleyball players, but these uniforms also contribute to decreased performance on the court.</p>
<sec id="section15-0011000012457218">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Even though our results provided insight into a previously understudied phenomenon, there were several limitations to this study. Although the chosen qualitative methodology intended to allow participants the space to express their unique experiences within this domain, certain questions on the interview protocol may create the perception of being directional in nature (e.g., “Have you ever felt like you needed to do anything to change your body in order to look better in your uniform in front of other people?”). Although these questions were intentionally phrased based on our a priori literature search on revealing sports uniforms, we acknowledge that this dynamic could unintentionally prime participants to respond in a certain manner. Another limitation is that the data were collected from only one team. Subsequently, the results may be influenced by unique dynamics operating within this particular college volleyball team. Furthermore, the members of this particular team were predominantly White. Although the racial demographic of our sample was consistent with the racial composition of NCAA DI volleyball players (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0011000012457218">NCAA, 2009</xref>), our results may not fully represent the experiences and body image issues facing women of color. Furthermore, because information on participant sexual orientation was not collected, the results of this study do not explicitly address body image issues among lesbian student athletes, which is salient given the perceptions of heterosexual objectification by men that the players in this study expressed.</p>
<p>Finally, because our sample consisted entirely of college-level volleyball players, a self-selection bias may exist within this group of women who have persisted in this sport over time. Because many of our participants discussed the difficulties they faced in the initial transition to wearing the spandex uniform, it is reasonable to assume that young girls may opt not to play volleyball because of their apprehension about having to wear a spandex uniform at a time when their body image concerns are developmentally salient and difficult to navigate. Future researchers should assess the body image attitudes among middle school and high school volleyball players to better understand the relationship between body image and uniforms in this context. In sum, the results should be interpreted in light of these limitations.</p>

<title>Implications for Counseling Psychologists and Other Mental Health Professionals</title>
<p>Although our small sample size limits the generalizability of our findings, the results can still be used to help practitioners and researchers better understand the potential role that uniforms can play in the body image of college volleyball players. This understanding can help facilitate rapport building in the training of mental health professionals who are working with student athlete populations in clinical settings. Consistent with past research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0011000012457218">Greenleaf, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0011000012457218">Krane, Stiles-Shipley, et al., 2001</xref>), our results suggest that appearance in uniforms may raise awareness of body concerns, particularly the notion that female athletes’ bodies often do not match the societal ideal of femininity. Counseling psychologists and other mental health professionals can use the results of this study to help female student athletes deal with issues related to body image as they strive to be confident in their bodies, both on the court and off the court. These professionals can design interventions to help female athletes address and normalize the process of navigating societal standards for muscularity and femininity (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0011000012457218">Steinfeldt, Zakrajsek, et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, in keeping with our field’s commitment to social justice (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0011000012457218">Pieterse, Evans, Risner-Butner, Collins, &amp; Mason, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0011000012457218">Singh et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0011000012457218">Vera &amp; Speight, 2003</xref>), counseling psychologists can empower female athletes to advocate for beneficial systemic change. This empowerment can equip these young women with the skills to effectively talk to their coaches and athletic administrators about their potential preference to have uniforms that provide comfort, competitive function, and fit for players with differing body types.</p>
<p>The results of this study also highlight the important role that coaches play in the lives of their athletes. Past studies have demonstrated that coaches wield great influence, both on the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0011000012457218">Steinfeldt, Rutkowski, Vaughan, &amp; Steinfeldt, 2011</xref>) and off the field (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0011000012457218">Becker, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0011000012457218">Gould, Collins, Lauer, &amp; Chung, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0011000012457218">Steinfeldt, Foltz, et al., 2011</xref>). It is interesting that participants in our study reported concern about coaches’ comments regarding perceived expectations for both weight loss and weight gain. We do not know the content of the coaches’ original message(s), but participants’ comments indicated that the players were interpreting these messages in a number of different and even potentially conflicting ways. To this end, counseling psychologists who work in athletic settings can be involved in educating coaches about not only the importance attached to their messages but also the different and impactful interpretations that athletes may generate from the same message. Doing so can help coaches more effectively utilize their influence so that female student athletes can more successfully navigate the paradoxical societal standards of body image.</p>
<p>Finally, future researchers and clinicians can expand on the results of this study to examine the potential link between body image concerns and mental health issues, such as disordered eating and mood disorders (e.g., depression, anxiety). A robust body of literature has demonstrated the link between body image and mental health issues, particularly disordered eating among female college student athletes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0011000012457218">Petrie, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0011000012457218">Thompson &amp; Sherman, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0011000012457218">2009</xref>). In support of past research indicating that revealing sport uniforms play a role in disordered eating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011000012457218">deBruin et al., 2011</xref>) and body image concerns across a variety of female athletes (e.g., cheerleaders—<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0011000012457218">Reel &amp; Gill, 1996</xref>; dancers—<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0011000012457218">Reel, 1998</xref>; swimmers—<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0011000012457218">Reel &amp; Gill, 2001</xref>), our results indicate that volleyball players’ perceptions about their revealing spandex uniforms can contribute to negative body image beliefs. Furthermore, the results of this study demonstrate that, similar to aesthetically judged sports, certain aspects (i.e., revealing spandex uniforms) of a refereed sport such as volleyball can negatively affect the body image of female participants. Past research has demonstrated that participation in sports can provide benefits to women, including increased body awareness and improved body satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0011000012457218">Richman &amp; Shaffer, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0011000012457218">Shaffer &amp; Wittes, 2006</xref>). Volleyball has the potential to provide the opportunity for women to achieve those positive benefits; however, our results suggest that the use of revealing spandex uniforms may undermine these positive effects of sport participation for women. Subsequently, future researchers should more extensively explore whether a relationship exists between uniform type and prevalence of disordered eating and mood disorders among student athletes, particularly the young women who participate in the unique—and previously unexplored—context of volleyball. Engaging in this line of research and facilitating these types of discussions, particularly with female student athlete clients, can help counseling psychologists and other mental health professionals address potential contributors to disordered eating and mood disorders within this domain.</p>
