<p>This book can be approached in two ways. It can be seen as a fresh perspective on a frequently examined period of religion history: England during the Reformation. It can also be described with equal accuracy as a theory text, as the Reformation is used as an extended test of a ‘cognitive ecology’ model. Despite its multidisciplinary relevance, the book itself is a concise, well-researched history of several facets of this period, including developments in religious practice and thought and the significance of written texts and music, using Quakerism and secular education as specific test cases.</p>
<p>‘Cognitive ecology’ is not yet a common phrase, so some background may be helpful. For those of us employing an evolutionary perspective on human behavior, a few of the commonsensical assumptions we bring with us ultimately prove to be flawed. If one seeks connections between our inherited genetics and our behavior, apes are not necessarily the best analogues: bowerbirds’ culture has important implications for our own (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1750698011432691">Martin, in press</xref>); Caledonian crows are impressive tool users (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1750698011432691">Hunt, 2000</xref>); birdsong shares more commonalities with human language than the bonobo Kanzi’s signs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1750698011432691">Osterhout et al., 2010</xref>). We can learn a great deal about how humans solve ecological problems by looking further afield. Tribble and Keene begin their book with a curious statement: ‘We recognize that not many books about early modern religion begin by thinking about mole crickets’ (p. 2). By the end, one is left thinking that perhaps more should.</p>
<p>Tribble and Keene (hereafter T&amp;K) target a more subtle assumption: that there is a firm distinction between the organism and its environment. The mole cricket’s song is too faint to effectively attract mates, so it lives in burrows that amplify sounds; their traits are only adaptive if they create an appropriate environment. We humans surround ourselves with what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1750698011432691">Tomasello (1999)</xref> called ‘socially and historically constituted artifacts and traditions’ – tools that help us solve ecological problems, but then become part of our selection environment. To understand our behavior, we must recognize that individual and environment overlap; ‘mind’ is not simply something that happens between ‘input’ and ‘output’ but is the interaction between our little grey cells and the world outside. T&amp;K point out that both philosophy (under the rubric ‘Extended Mind’) and the social sciences (as ‘Distributed Cognition’) posit a kind of psychological niche construction in which ‘the mind is both embedded in and extended into its worlds’ (p. 2). Cognition, then, must be seen in its ecological context. ‘Changes in one element of the ecology – for example, changes in the nature of social space, or the ready availability of exographic resources – will always reshape the wider system’ (p.14).</p>
<p>There is a considerable body of literature examining the effects of our evolutionary heritage on culture – if all humans share similar brains, our minds are fundamentally similar, and therefore some cultural commonalities may be explainable on a genetic level. (See, for example, the relatively new field of ‘Cognitive Science of Religion’ as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1750698011432691">Pyysiäinen and Anttonen, 2002</xref>, the IACSR website <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.iacsr.com/">http://www.iacsr.com/</ext-link>, etc.) However, if our genes and culture co-evolve, there is a reciprocal effect: our minds change not only on evolutionary, but historical time – though possessing similar neural architecture, an ancestor will not think in the same way as we do and will use their minds in different ways (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1750698011432691">Carruthers’ (1990)</xref> contrast of the modern pedagogical conceptions of memory to the embodied ‘rumination’ employed in medieval education).</p>
<p>T&amp;K’s book addresses this reciprocal effect, looking at historical trends in memory encoding techniques and purposes. They argue that the English Reformation is a fertile topic for distributed cognition for two reasons: it provides a strong test case for this model of cognitive transformations, and it opens additional avenues of investigation of a contentious period. In particular, an important feature of this Reformation was:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>an intense emphasis on practices and apparatus that marks religious controversy in this period. Historians have often noted that religious controversy in the English church is rarely centered on doctrinal issues; instead the most heated debates are about vestments, rituals, gestures, the material apparatus of worship, and other so-called ‘indifferent’ factors … Whilst there were undoubtedly theological differences underlying this dissension, those differences can only provide a partial explanation … Late medieval Catholics thought with a different set of objects, artifacts, and social surrounds than Protestants did. (pp. 15–16)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Changes in religious practice during the English Reformation, they argue, cannot be understood as simply side-effects of doctrinal shifts among the elite trickling down to the populace. It was also a shaping of shared cognitive space – a building of new ‘cognitive burrows’. Reformers sought to change more than the texts of prayers; they sought to change the internalized experience of religion, and thus wrestled not just with texts but the sacred spaces in which rituals were conducted.</p>
<p>In short, Reformers took an ecological view, manipulating a diverse range of influences on the transmission, perception and recall of the explicit information meant to shape people’s thoughts. Effective transmission of the sermon, according to one 1656 writer, required ‘we use such posture of the body, as may be apt to keep our senses waking, and to drive away heaviness &amp; sleep’ (quoted on p. 59), while ‘the believer is to be positioned within an architectural infrastructure conducive to hearing, and within that framework to discipline the senses so that hearing predominates over the other sensory modalities’ (p. 60). Latin texts set to complex music, sung by trained choirs to a passive audience are replaced by congregations singing in unison, which facilitates personal interactions with the text, but should not, T&amp;K argue, be mistaken for a simplistic notion of ‘out with the image, in with the Bible’ top-down shift in doctrine. Instead, such singing was ‘the least top-down of all reforms … and was probably one of the most successful modes of achieving a familiar and widely disseminated attachment to Protestantism’ (pp. 90–91).</p>
<p>T&amp;K are carefully conservative and focus primarily upon the conscious transmission of explicit information. The last chapter is a case in point: to demonstrate the range of applications available for an ecological view, they take a measured step only from the deliberate communication of sacred information to the communication of secular information. That the greatest discussion of music is under the heading of ‘Remembering Psalms’ is significant; they focus on the vitality of music practice as a way to transmit texts over the implicit schemas of such constrained aesthetic practice (e.g. the popular preference for monosyllabic unison singing over liturgical polyphony).</p>
<p>This caution is probably wise; as <italic>Cognitive Ecologies</italic> bridges half a dozen disciplines, a tight focus widens its usefulness. For example, for those who employ cognitive approaches to culture, T&amp;K’s theoretical foundation is sufficient to broaden the range of what variables should be considered by empirical studies – thus, the consistently historical nature of their discussions of multiple facets of English Reformation culture facilitates the extraction of comparisons.</p>
<p>In sum, scholars of Christianity, especially those interested in the English Reformation, should read this book. Those without any particular interest in religion should probably read it, too. It is an impressive piece of scholarship, with well-chosen quotations from contemporary sources, applying a novel theoretical perspective. Some sections may require careful reading, especially for those without prior exposure to Reformation religiosity or cognitive approaches to culture, but it is well worth the effort.</p>
