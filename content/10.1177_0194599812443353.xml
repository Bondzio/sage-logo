<title>Subjects and Methods</title>
<p>Sixty-one patients treated with 63 TORS procedures. Main outcome measures: intraoperative times, margin status, complications, time to diet, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube retention rate. The authors also report oncologic outcomes on their first 30 patients.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The spectrum of subsites included tongue base, tonsil, parapharyngeal space, retromolar trigone, supraglottis, and posterior pharyngeal wall. Surgical console time averaged 79 ± 53 minutes. After re-resection of 4 patients, final negative margin status was 94% (50/53). A subset of 30 patients with squamous cell carcinoma reaching an average of 18 months of follow-up had a local regional control rate of 97% with a disease-free survival rate of 90%. The PEG tube retention rate was 7%. Complications included 2 readmissions with dehydration, 1 aspiration pneumonia, and 2 with minor oropharyngeal bleeding. Ninety-one percent of patients resumed an oral diet by the first postoperative visit.</p>

<p>Transoral robotic surgery (TORS) was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in December 2009. Cited technical advantages include magnification and 3-dimensional optics along with the ability to visualize and dissect around corners due to angled endoscopes and the maneuverability of the robotic instrumentation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599812443353">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812443353"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812443353"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812443353">4</xref></sup> Since then, clinical data from pioneering TORS centers have emerged. These studies report encouraging early outcomes with respect to disease control and swallowing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599812443353">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599812443353"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599812443353"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599812443353"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599812443353"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599812443353"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599812443353"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599812443353"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599812443353">13</xref></sup> In order for a new treatment modality to be safely applied in a widespread manner, however, it must be demonstrated that the results of the pioneering studies are reproducible by adopters of the technology. To date, most published series reflect data collected in a pre-FDA approval protocol setting. The objective of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility and safety of establishing a TORS program in the post-FDA approval setting. Early outcomes are compared with the previously reported results of pioneering centers.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>Institutional review board approval was obtained from Thomas Jefferson University Office of Human Research. All patients undergoing TORS between March 2010 and October 2011 at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital were included in the study. The senior surgeon (DMC) completed the post-FDA approval TORS clinical training pathway with Intuitive Surgical and the University of Pennsylvania in March 2010. Intraoperative data, including setup, docking and console times, estimated blood loss, margin status, airway status, neck dissection, and reconstruction, were collected prospectively. Each patient was further analyzed for postoperative resumption of oral diet, final pathologic margin status, and adjuvant therapy. All patients underwent preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan to assess tumor extent and the location of the carotid artery. A preoperative positron emission tomography (PET)–CT scan was also performed in all patients with confirmed malignancy. Resections were performed in an en bloc fashion. Two specimens were bisected during dissection to facilitate removal due to size and location of tumor (1 supraglottis; 1 hypopharynx). Radical tonsillectomy included resection of the underlying constrictor muscle as previously described by Weinstein et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599812443353">11</xref></sup> Preliminary oncologic outcomes and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) retention were reviewed for the first 30 oncologic patients to allow for at least 12-month average follow-up.</p>

<title>Intraoperative Details</title>
<p>Estimated blood loss was 35 cc (range, 5-100 cc). The average time spent optimizing exposure and docking the robot was 20 ± 8 minutes with an average total console time (TORS operative time) of 79 ± 53 minutes. Docking to undocking took on average 144 ± 96 minutes, which included the console time as well as awaiting frozen sectioning results and hemostasis. Evaluation of the average console times for subsites demonstrated that radical tonsillectomies required 58 ± 26 minutes, tongue base 98 ± 59 minutes, and supraglottis/ hypopharynx 109 ± 51 minutes. No trend toward decreased console time was noted in the overall group, but the average time for the last 5 radical tonsillectomies was lower than the first 5 radical tonsillectomies (42 minutes vs 60 minutes). Average length of stay was 2.7 days, with a range of 1 to 21 days. The majority (62%) had length of stay 2 days or less, with 84% being discharged by postoperative day (POD) 3. The patient with the 21-day length of stay underwent staged neck dissections during the same hospitalization.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0194599812443353">
<title>Complications</title>
<p>There were no perioperative deaths or major complications. Five patients were readmitted in the postoperative setting. Two were readmitted for dehydration. Both were managed with supportive care and quickly resumed a normal diet. One patient was readmitted with aspiration pneumonia. In this patient, TORS was treatment for a second primary tumor in the base of tongue; he had previously had an ipsilateral radical neck dissection as well as radiation and chemotherapy. He has resumed a partial oral diet. Two were readmitted for minor oropharyngeal bleeding. One patient was observed overnight without further bleeding. The other patient was taken to the operating room and controlled with cautery.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0194599812443353">
<title>Airway Management</title>
<p>All patients were assessed for extubation at the conclusion of the case. Patients were left intubated at the discretion of the surgeon based on intraoperative edema, postoperative bleeding risk, patient anatomy/habitus, and site and extent of dissection. Most patients (76%) were extubated at the conclusion of the procedure. Review of the most common subsites demonstrated that only 14% (3/21) of patients undergoing tonsillar resections were left intubated at the conclusion of the procedure, whereas 32% (7/22) of patients with base-of-tongue resections were left intubated. All patients not requiring tracheostomy tube placement were extubated within 36 hours of the procedure. Two patients had tracheostomy tubes in the perioperative setting. One patient had a tracheostomy tube placed prior to TORS because of a large base-of-tongue cancer. He was decannulated on POD 20. The second had a tracheostomy tube placed at the time of hypopharyngectomy in part for tumor access and in part for baseline chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. She was decannulated on POD 9.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0194599812443353">
<title>Postoperative Diet</title>
<p>All patients were evaluated by a speech pathologist prior to discharge from the hospital. Most patients resumed an oral diet on the first or second postoperative day. At the first postoperative visit, 52 (83%) patients were on a strictly oral diet, 5 (8%) were on an oral diet with tube feed supplementation, and 6 (9%) were nil per os (NPO).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0194599812443353">
<title>Neck Dissection</title>
<p>Neck dissection was performed in 39 of 53 oncologic patients. Neck dissection(s) was performed concurrently with TORS in 18 of 39 (46%) cases and in a staged fashion in 21 (54%) cases. The median time between operations in the staged group was 12 days, with a range from 1 to 50 days. Factors influencing the decision for timing of neck dissection included concern for fistula based on size and site of TORS defect as well as operating room availability. In 2 patients (1 concurrent, 1 staged), intraoperative communication between the TORS dissection bed and neck dissection was encountered. Both were managed with fascial closure and reinforcing local muscle flap. No patients developed postoperative fistulae.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0194599812443353">
<title>Margin Status</title>
<p>Negative margins were achieved at the initial TORS in 46 (87%) of the oncologic patients (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0194599812443353"><bold>Table 2</bold></xref>). In 2 patients, an intraoperative negative margin on frozen section was subsequently determined to be positive on final pathology. Re-resection at a subsequent operative setting was performed in 4 patients with initial positive margins, decreasing the overall negative margin rate to 94%. In 3 of these 4 patients, there was no tumor in the re-resection specimen. None of these 4 patients recurred at the TORS site. The management of positive margins with associated outcomes is illustrated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0194599812443353"><bold>Table 2</bold></xref>.</p>

<title>Outcomes</title>
<p>To allow for 1-year outcomes data, only the first half of the cohort was included in the survival and PEG dependence analysis. This included 30 patients with a median follow-up of 18.9 months (range, 12-22 months). In patients in whom TORS represented initial head and neck cancer treatment, all were alive at last follow-up. No evidence of disease was present in 24 of 25, and 1 was alive with distant metastases. In patients who had a history of prior head and neck cancer and treatment, 3 are alive with no evidence of disease and 2 died of disease. One of these patients had a history of Fanconi anemia and multiple previous head and neck cancers and died after developing additional primary tumors and regional and distant disease. He died without evidence of disease at the TORS resection site. The second patient underwent TORS for a posterior floor-of-mouth SCC, which represented a second primary tumor after previous surgery and radiation for an ipsilateral anterior lateral tongue SCC. She developed a deep recurrence at the TORS resection site as well as an additional primary tumor in the contralateral pharynx and refused further intervention. The overall 1-year recurrence-free survival was 27 of 30 (90%) with an overall local control of 29 of 30 (97%).</p>
<p>At last follow-up, a total of 2 surviving patients of this group retained a PEG tube. One patient had a history of previous radiation, chemotherapy, and radical neck dissection ipsilateral to the TORS base-of-tongue resection. Baseline hypoglossal nerve palsy was noted pre-TORS. The other patient resumed an oral diet prior to initiating adjuvant chemoradiation and subsequently regressed. Both patients currently maintain a partial oral diet.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Prior to the era of chemoradiation, surgery was commonly used in the management of oropharyngeal tumors. A review of the National Cancer Data Base between 1986 and 1995 demonstrated that surgery alone or with radiation was used in the management of 42.7% of base-of-tongue tumors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599812443353">14</xref></sup> During the same time period, definitive chemoradiation was used in just 14.5% of cases. Gourin and Johnson<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0194599812443353">15</xref></sup> described the outcomes of the primary surgical management of base-of-tongue tumors at the University of Pittsburgh for nearly the same time period. The vast majority were open transcervical approaches, and most received adjuvant radiation, either alone (91%) or with chemotherapy (26%). Local control rates were 100% for T1 lesions, 97% for T2 lesions, 96% for T3 lesions, and 85% for T4 lesions. The disease-specific survival for stage II and stage IV disease was 62% and 48%. In the retrospective database sample of 16,188 base-of-tongue cancers, the inclusion of surgery in the treatment approach was associated with better survival for both early and advanced-stage tumors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599812443353">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Despite excellent local control rates with primary surgery, Gourin and Johnson<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0194599812443353">15</xref></sup> reported that they had begun to offer nonsurgical approaches to patients with advanced primary tumors due to poor functional outcomes and limited overall survival. Reflective of this rationale, the past few decades have seen a trend toward chemoradiotherapy (CRT) as the primary treatment for pharyngeal carcinomas. Indeed, the use of definitive CRT in the treatment of advanced oropharyngeal doubled between 1985 and 2001.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0194599812443353">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>To date, there are no randomized trials comparing surgical and nonsurgical treatments for oropharyngeal cancers. In 1999, the Groupe d’Oncologie Radiotherapie Tete et Cou (GORTEC) reported the results of a randomized trial of radiation vs radiation combined with carboplatin and 5-fluorouracil for patients with advanced-stage oropharyngeal carcinoma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0194599812443353">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0194599812443353">18</xref></sup> Overall survival, disease-free survival and locoregional control were all significantly improved in the combined group in comparison to the radiation-alone group. At 3 years, however, these results were only 51%, 42%, and 66%, respectively, for the combined arm. It is recognized that the above studies predate the impact of human papilloma virus (HPV) on the prognosis of oropharyngeal cancer, but it is evident that the trend away from surgery for the treatment of oropharyngeal cancer was primarily based on concerns with functional outcomes of surgical approaches and not due to oncologic benefit of nonsurgical approaches.</p>
<p>More recently, concerns have emerged regarding toxicity and functional outcomes with CRT for treatment of head and neck cancer. Machtay et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0194599812443353">19</xref></sup> pooled the data from the concurrent CRT arms of 3 randomized Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) trials to analyze factors associated with severe late toxicity of this treatment approach. Even after eliminating patients with severe laryngopharygneal dysfunction at pretreatment baseline and patients with locoregional failure or death due to cancer, the rate of severe late toxicity was 43%. As such, it is appropriate that primary surgical approaches are being reevaluated to address these issues. One advantage of the primary surgical approach is pathologic staging, which allows for individualized use of radiation and chemotherapy in the adjuvant setting. Six previous reports in conjunction with this series demonstrated that 8% to 37% of patients were spared radiation and 48% to 74% of patients did not require chemotherapy after TORS (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0194599812443353"><bold>Table 3</bold></xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812443353">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599812443353">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599812443353">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599812443353">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0194599812443353">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0194599812443353">21</xref></sup> This selective approach has the potential to reduce toxicity and reserve treatment modalities for second primary tumors or recurrences.</p>
<p>Transoral laser microsurgery (TLM) has been shown to have outstanding local control without the morbidity of open approaches. A multicenter trial of TLM for advanced-stage oropharyngeal cancer demonstrated 3-year overall, disease-specific, and disease-free survival of 86%, 88%, and 82%, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0194599812443353">22</xref></sup> To date, TLM has not been widely adopted. One proposed reason for this is a steep perceived learning curve.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812443353">4</xref></sup> Transoral robotic surgery has been proposed to overcome access issues with a shorter learning curve.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812443353">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0194599812443353">23</xref></sup> Imperative to the success of TORS is the ability of adopting institutions to match the outcomes of the pioneering centers that achieved FDA clearance. Outcomes of a controlled protocol setting cannot be assumed to be directly transferrable to the general treatment setting. An example of this is the treatment of advanced laryngeal cancer in the United States over the past 20 years. In 1991 and 2003, the Department of Veterans Affairs Laryngeal Cancer Study Group and RTOG 91-11 demonstrated reasonable survival rates with laryngeal preservation in patients treated without surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0194599812443353">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0194599812443353">25</xref></sup> Since then, there has been a marked trend toward CRT for the treatment of advanced oropharyngeal and laryngeal cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0194599812443353">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0194599812443353">27</xref></sup> However, large database reviews have shown a decrease in survival for patients with advanced laryngeal cancer concurrent with the increased use of CRT.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0194599812443353">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0194599812443353">29</xref></sup> This raises questions regarding patient selection and application of technique in the general population.</p>
<p>The current study compares favorably with previously published results of TORS in both execution and efficacy. Our average setup time of 20 ± 8 minutes is similar to that reported by Lawson et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0194599812443353">23</xref></sup> (24 ± 14 minutes) and Hurtuk et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0194599812443353">20</xref></sup> (23 ± 9 minutes). Our average console time did not trend lower with time, likely due to the variability in case site and increasing complexity. Anatomic subsite did affect the console time and reflects the increasing complexity with inferior location in the pharynx. Radical tonsillectomy is likely the most reproducible and least anatomically challenging TORS procedure. Analysis of our first 5 cases of radical tonsillectomy compared with our last 5 cases did show a decrease in console time for this procedure from 60 minutes to 42 minutes. Our average console time for supraglottic laryngectomies (109 minutes) was similar to previous reports from Lawson et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0194599812443353">23</xref></sup> (122 minutes) and Weinstein et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0194599812443353">30</xref></sup> (92-178 minutes).</p>
<p>A negative resection margin is an important prognostic for surgically managed oropharyngeal tumors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0194599812443353">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0194599812443353">31</xref></sup> Margins were deemed negative on the final pathology report of the first TORS procedure for 46 of 53 (patients treated for malignancy in our series.) In 2 patients, the margins were unclear based on specimen processing and were presumed to be positive. To ensure an accurate margin, the patients underwent re-resection at a second operative setting. In both of these patients, the re-resection specimen did not have tumor. Neither patient received adjuvant therapy, and both remain disease free.</p>
<p>In 2 patients, margins were not cleared intraoperatively at the initial TORS setting. One was cleared with a second TORS procedure, and one was treated with adjuvant CRT on the basis of advanced neck disease. In 3 patients, deep margins that were reported as negative on frozen section returned positive on final pathology. All were deep anterolateral margins in patients with glossotonsillar sulcus involvement. One patient underwent transcervical resection at the time of staged neck dissection, and all required adjuvant CRT on the basis of neck disease. After re-resection, negative margins were achieved in 50 of 53 (94%) patients treated for malignancy. This is comparable with previously reported results (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0194599812443353"><bold>Table 3</bold></xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812443353">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599812443353">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599812443353">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599812443353">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0194599812443353">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0194599812443353">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>The impact of TORS on airway control and swallowing function is considered less than the impact of open surgical approaches, which frequently require tracheostomy and feeding tube placement. Most patients were extubated at the conclusion of TORS. The location of the tumor resection affected the likelihood of intubation postoperatively. Only 3 of 21 (14.3%) tonsillar resections remained intubated, whereas 7 of 22 (31.8%) base-of-tongue resections and 5 of 8 (62.5%) supraglottic/hypopharyngeal resections remained intubated. All intubated patients were extubated within 36 hours, with the majority being extubated the morning of POD 1. Our immediate extubation rate of 76% compares favorably with the rate of 68.5% reported by Iseli et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599812443353">8</xref></sup> Most of our patients resumed oral intake by POD 1, with 91% of patients tolerating per oral (PO) intake at the first postoperative visit. In the patients who were taking an oral diet with tube feed supplementation, the PEG tube had been placed for anticipated adjuvant therapy with chemoradiation based on clinical staging. The patients who were strictly NPO at the first postoperative visit had undergone either supraglottic laryngectomy (n = 3) or hypopharyngectomy (n = 3) and were NPO at the surgeon’s direction due to anticipated risk of aspiration.</p>
<p>Long-term PEG tube dependency is often used as a marker of treatment-related late toxicity. In those patients with at least a 12-month follow-up, 2 continued to have a PEG tube. One patient had a history of previous radical neck dissection, hypoglossal nerve paralysis, and radiation. A PEG tube remains because of aspiration concerns. The second patient required the PEG tube during chemoradiation. Both have attained partial oral diets with the greater percentage by mouth. Our series of 7% PEG retention is consistent with previously published data from the pioneering TORS centers of 0% to 17% PEG dependence (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0194599812443353"><bold>Table 3</bold></xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812443353">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599812443353">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599812443353">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599812443353">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0194599812443353">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0194599812443353">21</xref></sup></p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The initiation of a TORS program in the post-FDA setting can be accomplished in a safe and efficient manner. Local regional control of 97% and disease-free survival of 90% support strong preliminary oncologic outcomes consistent with pioneering TORS centers. A high rate of early return to PO intake without enteral supplementation and a low rate of PEG tube retention after adjuvant therapy support good functional outcomes. Although these findings require longer follow-up, these results support continued investigation of TORS as a treatment option for oropharyngeal cancer.</p>
