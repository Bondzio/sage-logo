<p>Tuberous breast is a rare malformation that has major, negative physical and psychological impacts during puberty.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1090820X13480641">1</xref></sup> A range of surgical techniques has been used to correct breast shape and volume in the presence of this malformation. Most of these techniques are aimed at redistributing volumes based on a combination of skin plasty and mammary gland remodeling. Prostheses and locoregional flaps can also be used to replace the missing volume.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1090820X13480641">2</xref></sup> Fat grafting to the breast is another technique that has become popular; we have employed it in our department since 1998 as a complementary technique in breast reconstruction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1090820X13480641">3</xref></sup> It constitutes a natural way of providing volume and modifying the shape of the breast. However, this apparently simple procedure does have a learning curve and involves precise techniques.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1090820X13480641">4</xref></sup> Since 2000, we have applied fat grafting concepts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1090820X13480641">4</xref></sup> to the correction of acquired and congenital thoracic malformations in general and to tuberous breasts in particular. Here, we describe our experience correcting tuberous breasts by fat grafting.</p>
<sec id="section6-1090820X13480641" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>We performed a retrospective chart review of tuberous breast patients who were treated solely with fat grafting (ie, without the use of implants) over an 11-year period (January 2000 to December 2010) in our clinic. A total of 31 consecutive patients were included in the series. Preoperatively, we had graded each breast deformation according to Grolleau’s classification.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1090820X13480641">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1090820X13480641">5</xref></sup> Patient age, mean body mass index, and nature of the malformation (unilateral or bilateral) were noted. Mean follow-up after the final session was also recorded, as were the number of sessions, the volume injected per session, and any postoperative complications (infection, hemorrhage, pneumothorax, fatty embolism, etc) at the recipient site.</p>
<p>All patients were first provided with an information sheet on the risks, advantages, and disadvantages of lipomodeling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1090820X13480641">4</xref></sup> All patients provided their informed consent for participation in the study. A comprehensive preoperative clinical examination was performed for each patient, including an imaging assessment (ultrasound examination and a mammogram). The same imaging protocol was performed at 1 year postoperatively.</p>
<p>Each operation was performed by the first author (E.D.) using the same operating technique, and all procedures were performed under general anesthesia. Fat aspiration took place after local adrenaline infiltration (1 mg adrenaline in 500 mL of physiological saline for injection). Aspiration was performed with a 10-mL Luer-Lok syringe fitted with a 3.5-mm multihole cannula. The sampled tissue was centrifuged at 500 <italic>g</italic> (3000 rotations per minute) for 3 minutes in cases that were performed from 2000 to 2005 and for 20 seconds after 2006. Breast incisions were made with a 14-gauge trocar, and the fat was deposited in lines while retracting the 2-mm, single-hole cannula.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1090820X13480641">4</xref></sup> Fat was first transferred into the deepest area of missing breast volume and then to the edge of the zone.

</media></p>
<p>In zones under tension, fasciotomy was initially (from 2000-2005) performed by making V-shaped cuts with a cannula and then (2006 and later) by using a 14-gauge trocar to cut fibrous bridges after placing them under maximum tension with a double-hook retractor. Fine, rapidly resorbable threads were placed to suture the breast. A paraffin gauze dressing was used for the whole breast, and a compressive dressing was used for the area of liposuction. The compressive dressing was removed 5 days postoperatively.</p>
<p>Patient satisfaction was rated on a 4-point scale: very satisfied, satisfied, moderately satisfied, or dissatisfied. Written answers were recorded at a specific 1-year follow-up visit. The surgical team evaluated the results on a 4-point scale as well: very good, good, average, or poor.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Of the 31 patients included in this series, there were 18 cases of bilateral malformation and 13 cases of unilateral malformation. Breasts were graded as type 2 in 61% of cases, type 3 in 28%, and type 1 in 11% (again according to the Grolleau classification). Average patient age was 23 years (range, 15-47 years) and average body mass index was 21.9 (range, 18-26).</p>
<p>A single lipomodeling session (mean transfer volume, 158 mL; range, 90-253 mL) was required in 45% of cases (n = 14). A second session (mean volume, 226 mL; range, 100-316 mL) was necessary in the remaining 55% of cases (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1090820X13480641">Table 1</xref>). The mean follow-up period after the last fat transfer session was 6.5 years (range, 1.5-11 years). Overall, 94% of patients were very satisfied (n = 29) and the remaining 6% were satisfied (n = 2). The surgical team rated the results as being very good in 68% of cases (21 of 31), good in 26% (8 of 31), and average in 6% (2 of 31). No complications (infection, hemorrhage, pneumothorax, fatty embolism, etc) were noted.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Tuberous breast is a rare, congenital malformation that appears most frequently during puberty, at the time of mammary growth. Although the etiology and disease mechanism are still poorly defined,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1090820X13480641">1</xref></sup> it is clear that the presence of a fibrous ring alters the base of the breast<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1090820X13480641">5</xref></sup> and thus its shape during growth. In our series, most of the cases were bilateral Grolleau type 2,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1090820X13480641">5</xref></sup> which consists of a lack of volume in the lower pole of the breast. In the literature,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1090820X13480641">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1090820X13480641">5</xref></sup> type 1 is the most frequent deformation. This disparity can be explained by the fact that patients consulting for an increase in breast volume are usually motivated by a significant and bothersome deformation, corresponding to types 2 and 3. Type 1 tuberous breast is a minor to moderate deformation that bothers patients less and may not require an increase in volume.</p>
<p>The usual techniques for local correction of tuberous breast combine skin plasty<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1090820X13480641">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1090820X13480641">6</xref></sup> and mammary gland remodeling. The techniques described by Puckett and Concannon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1090820X13480641">7</xref></sup> and Ribeiro et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1090820X13480641">8</xref></sup> redistribute existing breast volume more evenly but do not provide additional volume. In cases where the available mammary volume is low, the standard technique involves placement of an implant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1090820X13480641">9</xref></sup> or flap<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1090820X13480641">10</xref></sup> to achieve a satisfactory result. Breast implants provide volume but expose the patient to a number of related disadvantages, such as capsule formation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1090820X13480641">9</xref></sup> In France, manufacturers guarantee the safety of their implants for a 10-year follow-up, and there is a need to change the implant every 10 years. Locoregional flaps can also be used to provide volume, but this is a more complicated procedure with a higher risk/benefit ratio.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1090820X13480641">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Only 1 or 2 lipomodeling sessions were required per tuberous breast; slightly more than half of our patients needed 2 sessions to obtain the desired result. The number of sessions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1090820X13480641">2</xref></sup> depended on the extent of the deformation, the quality of the recipient site,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1090820X13480641">11</xref></sup> and the size of the patient’s adipose reserves. Fat was transferred not only into the treated breast but also into the pectoralis major muscle, which we have shown to be a good recipient site<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1090820X13480641">12</xref></sup> for lipomodeling in autologous breast reconstruction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1090820X13480641">13</xref></sup> In our experience, the latissimus dorsi flap (without an implant) is the most appropriate tissue for receiving fat grafts because it is very well vascularized<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1090820X13480641">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1090820X13480641">13</xref></sup>; this muscle tissue is associated with excellent revascularization of the grafted adipocytes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1090820X13480641">13</xref></sup> By evaluating our results for 200 latissimus dorsi flap breast reconstructions not combined with an implant,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1090820X13480641">14</xref></sup> we showed that a single fat transfer (average volume, 176 mL) was needed to obtain a satisfactory outcome for 78% of patients. The remaining 22% required 2 or 3 procedures. The results were stable 6 months postoperatively.</p>
<p>The recipient site has an important impact on successful grafting of the transferred fat. The presence of fibrous tissue in tuberous breasts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1090820X13480641">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1090820X13480641">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1090820X13480641">12</xref></sup> makes fat grafting more difficult to perform; fasciotomies are very important in releasing the fibrous ring. The fibrous tissue associated with this deformation can be equated with the sequelae of conservative treatment of breast cancer,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1090820X13480641">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1090820X13480641">16</xref></sup> which are difficult to treat because of adjuvant radiotherapy. We believe that fat grafting has an antifibrosis role and explains the improved tissue growth after surgery. Khouri et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1090820X13480641">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1090820X13480641">18</xref></sup> emphasized the importance of the recipient site in breast reconstruction by fat grafting alone, since it determines the number of sessions required and the graft acceptance rate.</p>
<p>Rigotti et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1090820X13480641">19</xref></sup> demonstrated the importance of the vascular stromal fraction (VSF) in the efficacy of fat grafting. Adipose tissue is rich in stem cells, the potential of which for multiple differentiations is unaffected. The VSF triggers the secretion of angiogenic factors. Although the patients treated in our series did not involve the use of additional external devices, other techniques for complementing fat grafting are currently being assessed to improve the efficacy of this technique for treating tuberous breasts. Authors such as Khouri et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1090820X13480641">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1090820X13480641">18</xref></sup> have insisted on the importance of the recipient site in the long-term healing of grafted fat. Preexpansion of the recipient site with a BRAVA shaping device (Coconut Grove, Florida, via Bio-Mecanica, Montreal, Canada) may create volume by increasing the interstitial space and improving vascularization. The BRAVA might prepare the recipient site by altering the fibrous aspect of the tissues, which may be especially significant in the lower pole of Grolleau type 2 tuberous breasts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1090820X13480641">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1090820X13480641">5</xref></sup> Del Vecchio<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1090820X13480641">20</xref></sup> also stated that preparation of the recipient site is a significant factor in successful fat grafting. However, the utility of the BRAVA in tuberous breasts is limited by areolar enlargement and the aggravated risk of areolar hernia following repeated external expansion.</p>
<p>Each patient’s various adipose reserves should be examined to identify natural steatomeria. In most cases, abdominal fat is used in the first session, since its removal is popular with patients and it does not require a position change during surgery. The second-ranked site is the trochanter region and the inner plane of the thighs and knees.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1090820X13480641">4</xref></sup> For subsequent sessions, we consult with the patient and decide together on the zones to be aspirated. In terms of the result’s stability over time, it is important for the patient to maintain a stable weight postoperatively, since the transferred fat retains the memory of its original site (ie, if the patient loses weight after surgery, she will lose some of the benefit of the procedure).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1090820X13480641">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1090820X13480641">4</xref></sup> The importance of strict weight stability was confirmed by 1 of our patients, who developed hypertrophy of the treated breast. Despite this undesired effect, breast reduction did not pose any particular technical problems; histological analysis showed a normal, fatty breast. The transferred fat had become perfectly well integrated and could not be distinguished from native mammary fat.</p>
<p>In this study, postoperative imaging assessment was used as a guide to subsequent breast monitoring. From a radiological standpoint,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1090820X13480641">21</xref></sup> all breast appearances were normal, but oil cysts were present in some cases. In our experience, a seasoned radiologist will not confuse these images with a diagnosis of breast cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1090820X13480641">22</xref></sup> If in doubt, a microbiopsy of the zone in question must always be performed to obtain an unambiguous diagnosis. This indication is, however, very delicate,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1090820X13480641">23</xref></sup> and we recommend that fat grafting in these patients only be performed by a multidisciplinary care team, the members of which are perfectly acquainted with this technique, and only once the plastic surgeon is sufficiently experienced in less difficult diagnoses (eg, at least 50 cases of thoracic/breast lipomodeling).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1090820X13480641">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1090820X13480641">23</xref></sup> In our series of young patients, we have never needed a microbiopsy to clarify a diagnosis.</p>
<p>The very high level of patient satisfaction and the absence of complications in this patient series confirm lipomodeling as our preferred technique for the correction of tuberous breasts. Fat grafting to improve the malformations of the tuberous breasts is advantageous for various reasons: (1) the purely autologous nature of the operation, (2) the relatively low cost, (3) the reproducibility (since the technique can be repeated if required), (4) the natural appearance and consistency of the breast postoperatively,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1090820X13480641">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1090820X13480641">25</xref></sup> (5) the postoperative symmetry with the contralateral breast, and (6) the secondary benefits of the liposuction involved in the procedure.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Fat grafting represents a major advance in plastic and reconstructive surgery of the breast. The treatment of tuberous breast by fat transfer is a reliable technique that yields high levels of patient satisfaction. The aesthetic result is natural, implant free, and stable over time. Fat grafting improves the pliability of fibrous tissue. It also corrects the missing volume in a precise, personalized way that enables breast shape to be changed via the associated fasciotomies. Lipomodeling’s efficacy and the absence of complications have made it our preferred treatment for the correction of tuberous breasts, as long as the patient has sufficient adipose reserves. Unilateral hypotrophy constitutes the prime indication for this technical advance because it provides a natural and long-standing result.</p>
