<p>Amputation or degloving injuries of the thumb or index finger are highly disabling. We describe the use of twin dorsal middle finger flaps harvested from the dorsal aspects of the middle and ring fingers, and based on one palmar proper digital artery, its venae comitantes, and the dorsal branches of the palmar digital nerves of the middle and ring fingers, respectively. These flaps offer advantages when large soft tissue defects of the thumb or index finger are present. In this study, twin dorsal middle finger flaps were used in nine patients (six thumbs, three index fingers). All flaps completely survived. At the mean follow-up of 20 months, the appearance of the reconstructed thumbs or index fingers was acceptable, the length was maintained, and the mean static 2-point discrimination values were 10 mm in the palmar flap and 13 mm in the dorsal flap of the reconstructed digit. All patients were satisfied with the appearance and mobility of the donor fingers. All but one donor finger showed normal finger pulp sensibility, with a static 2-point discrimination between 3 and 6 mm.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Complete or partial loss of the thumb or index finger results in significant permanent disability. Even just the loss of sensation in these digits greatly affects hand function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193411434378">Adani et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1753193411434378">Horta et al., 2009</xref>). The aim of surgical reconstruction is to preserve length and restore at least sensation and well-padded skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753193411434378">Cao and Cai, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1753193411434378">Yao et al., 1996</xref>). The dorsal middle phalangeal finger (DMF) flap has been previously described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193411434378">Büchler and Frey (1988)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1753193411434378">Leupin et al. (1997)</xref>. The DMF flap is harvested from the dorsal aspect of the middle finger within the midlateral line anywhere from the distal interphalangeal joint to the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint. Its axial supply is based on one palmar digital artery and its dorsal branches, the corresponding venae comitantes and dorsal branches of the palmar digital nerve (DBPDN). Although this flap has been subsequently shown to be appropriate for resurfacing a soft tissue defect in a finger, a single flap is usually insufficient in size for a circumferentially degloved thumb or index finger, and twin flaps are more appropriate.</p>
<p>We used a twin dorsal middle finger (TDMF) flap, harvested from the dorsal aspects of the middle and ring fingers, for thumb and index finger reconstruction. We describe our clinical experience with these flaps.</p>

<sec id="section2-1753193411434378" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>From October 2005 to March 2009, the TDMF flaps were used in nine patients who had circumferential soft tissue defects of the thumb or index finger. Seven patients were male and two were female. Mean age of patients was 32 (range 19–48) years. The mechanisms of injury were by crush and avulsion in all patients. Five of the patients (four thumbs and one index finger) sustained traumatic amputations at the level of the proximal phalanx and were not suitable for replantation. Four patients (two thumbs and two index fingers) sustained degloving injuries that resulted in circumferential skin defects from the tip of the digit to the proximal phalanx (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1753193411434378">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Before the application of the TDMF flaps, five osteosyntheses of the proximal phalanx, one arthrodesis of the distal interphalangeal joint of the index finger, and tendon sutures were carried out in five patients.</p>
<p>Patients were selected based on the following:</p>
<list id="list1-1753193411434378" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>After debridement, the circumferential soft tissue defect of the thumb or index finger extended from the distal to the proximal phalanx.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Allen’s test on the middle and ring finger confirmed the bilateral patency of the palmar digital arteries before starting surgery.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Patients were excluded based on the following:</p>
<list id="list2-1753193411434378" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Injury to the dorsum of the proximal and/or middle phalanx of the middle or ring finger.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Allen’s test confirmed damage to one or both palmar proper digital arteries of the middle or ring finger.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The skin defect of the thumb or index finger was proximal to the metacarpal head.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>In this series, size of thumb defects ranged from 3.5 × 6.0 cm to 4.5 x 7.0 cm, and the size of index finger defects ranged from 4.8 × 6.0 cm to 5.5 × 6.8 cm. All patients were operated on as emergencies, with a mean time delay of 5 (range 3–10) hours. The flap from the middle finger ranged in size from 4.5 × 3.5 cm to 5.7 × 4.0 cm, and the flap from the ring finger ranged in size from 4.0 × 3.5 cm to 5.5 × 4.0 cm.</p>
<sec id="section3-1753193411434378">
<title>Surgical technique</title>
<p>The procedure was carried out under brachial block anaesthesia with the aid of tourniquet control. Magnifying surgical loupes were required for the dissection. The middle and ring fingers were used as the donor site, and the flaps were tailored on the dorsum of the proximal and middle phalanx between the midlateral lines. The size of flaps depended on the size of the defect.</p>
<p>The midlateral skin incision was made on the ulnar side of the middle finger and the radial side of the ring finger. The two lines were joined together at the palmar aspect of the metacarpal head. The palmar subcutaneous tissue was separated along the midlateral incision to expose the proper digital neurovascular bundle. The corresponding proper digital nerve was located along the palmar side of the proper digital artery, allowing the corresponding proper digital nerve to be dissected away from the digital artery pedicle and left in continuity. A dorsal branch arises from the proper digital nerve at the level of the proximal phalanx, and this was separated from the proper digital nerve. The length was based on the distance between the defect and nerve end in the injured finger. A Z skin incision was made on the palm of the hand between the middle and ring metacarpals for the exposure of the common digital neurovascular bundle. The common digital vascular pedicle was dissected away from the common digital nerve. The vascular pedicle was dissected proximally to the pivot point at which the artery originated from the superficial palmar arch. The dorsal digital nerves (DDN), which innervate the dorsum of the proximal phalanx of the middle and ring fingers, were also included in the flap. Thereafter, the flag-shaped flaps on the dorsum of the middle and ring fingers were elevated with the single vascular pedicle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753193411434378">Figure 1</xref>). Protection of the tenosynovium of the tendon was critical to permit successful skin grafting. The flap was transferred to the defect through an open incision or a subcutaneous tunnel and wrapped around the exposed tendon and bone of the injured digits without any tension on the vascular pedicle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753193411434378">Figures 2</xref><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1753193411434378"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1753193411434378"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1753193411434378"/>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1753193411434378">6</xref>).</p>

<p>The flap harvested from the ring finger covered the palmar aspect of the injured digit and the DBPDNs and DDNs in the flap were joined to the proper digital nerve stumps at the recipient site. The flap harvested from the middle finger covered the dorsal aspect of the injured digit, and sensory branches in the flap were joined to the dorsal digital nerve stumps. The donor site was resurfaced with a full-thickness skin graft.</p>

<sec id="section4-1753193411434378">
<title>Postoperative care</title>
<p>Flap circulation was monitored by visual inspection of the flap colour and capillary refilling for at least 2 days. Patients who had only nerve repair were allowed to mobilize their fingers 2 weeks postoperatively. All patients were encouraged to exercise the fingers by 3 weeks postoperatively.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1753193411434378">
<title>Assessment of outcome</title>
<p>At final follow-up, the range of motion (ROM) arcs of the reconstructed digit and donor fingers were measured using a goniometer. We assessed the sensibility of the flaps and the radial and ulnar portions of pulp of the donor fingers using the static 2-point discrimination (2-PD) test.</p>
<p>Cold intolerance of the injured hand was assessed using the Cold Intolerance Severity Scale (CISS) questionnaire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1753193411434378">Irwin et al., 1997</xref>). The CISS score can range from a minimum of 0 to a maximum of 100. The cut-off point for the diagnosis of cold intolerance is ≥ 30, based on the 95% confidence interval in healthy subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1753193411434378">Ruijs et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1753193411434378">2007</xref>).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>One flap covering a defect of the dorsum of an index finger showed venous congestion after surgery, which was relieved after partially removing stitches to reduce the tension on the vascular pedicle. Two weeks after surgery, all flaps survived completely, and all the wounds had healed without infection. Three weeks after surgery, the surviving flaps displayed warmth, good capillary refill, and a pink colour</p>
<p>Patients were followed for a mean of 20 (range 15–36) months. No patient complained of pain or functional scar contracture in the donor area. All patients were satisfied with the appearance of the donor fingers. Most patients complained about the absence of a nail on the reconstructed thumb or index finger.</p>
<p>At final follow-up, the mean ROMs of the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and interphalangeal (IP) joints of the reconstructed thumbs were 40° and 30°, respectively. The mean ROMs of the MCP, proximal interphalangeal (PIP), and distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints of the reconstructed index fingers were 63°, 50°, and 15°. The mean ROMs of the MCP, PIP, and DIP joints of the donor middle fingers were 85°, 96°, and 70°, and those of the donor ring fingers were 85°, 95°, and 68°. The ROMs of donor fingers were similar to those of the opposite sides in all patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1753193411434378">Figure 4</xref>).</p>
<p>Shortening of the reconstructed thumbs ranged from 0–0.5 cm compared with the opposite side. Shortening of the reconstructed index fingers ranged from 0.7–1.2 cm compared with the opposite side (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1753193411434378">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<p>The mean static 2-PD values in the palmar and dorsal flaps of the reconstructed fingers were 10 and 13 mm, respectively. All but one donor finger showed normal finger pulp sensibility, in that static 2-PD was between 3 and 6 mm. The palmar digital nerve on the side of one finger from which the flap had been harvested had possibly been damaged by the dissection because the static 2-PD value was 11 mm.</p>
<p>The mean CISS score was 25 (range 4–52). Three patients had a CISS score &gt; 30, indicating pathological cold intolerance (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1753193411434378">Table 3</xref>). The donor finger with the damaged digital nerve showed signs of discolouration and the patient had slight pain while holding a glass of ice water. Cold intolerance was not a problem in the warm weather. When the injured hands were exposed to the cold environment in winter, two reconstructed fingers showed mild cooling and pain, and one reconstructed thumb exhibited extreme cooling, pain, and hypoaesthesia, which disappeared with prolonged rewarming.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Most amputated thumbs and index fingers should be replanted. However, in the face of a severe crush injury or unavailability of the amputated part, a microvascular repair may not be feasible, and the use of alternative salvage techniques for the preservation of hand function becomes necessary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193411434378">Arakaki and Tsai, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1753193411434378">Muzaffar et al., 2005</xref>). Although several surgical techniques are available for reconstruction of the thumb, reconstruction of a circumferential soft tissue defect of the index finger remains a challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1753193411434378">Chen and Noordhoff, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1753193411434378">Kitidumrongsook et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The toe transfer technique provides a cosmetic thumb or index finger, with a nail and good recovery of sensibility, but the procedure requires a high degree of skill. The TDMF flaps include tissue from the dorsum of both the proximal and middle phalanges; therefore, they can cover an extensive defect in the thumb, with minimal shortening of reconstructed thumbs. The TDMF flaps are harvested from the middle and ring fingers, so they can also cover a circumferential defect of the index finger. Because of limitations of the length of the vascular pedicle, it is difficult for flaps to reach the tip of the index finger without some shortening of the reconstructed finger. This ranged from 0.7–1.2 cm compared with the opposite side.</p>
<p>Littler’s neurovascular island flap provides sensation for key pinch, but loss of sensation in the pulp and cold intolerance in the donor fingers are major disadvantages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1753193411434378">Elliot, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193411434378">Büchler and Frey (1988)</xref> described a modified flap harvested from the dorsum of both the proximal and middle phalanges, with the main nerve supply of the donor finger remaining intact. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1753193411434378">Leupin et al. (1997)</xref> found a correlation between the degree of cold intolerance in the donor finger and sensibility of the finger pulp. It has been demonstrated that a finger with one patent digital artery and intact bilateral nerves shows a better adaptation to cold environment. In this series, only one donor finger showed cold intolerance, and there was hypoaesthesia of the pulp in this finger caused by surgery. It is important to preserve the functional integrity of the ipsilateral palmar digital nerve so that the separation of this nerve from the remainder of the neurovascular bundle must be done with great care to prevent inadvertent injuries.</p>
<p>To minimize donor morbidity, the flaps were harvested from the dorsum of the middle and ring fingers, and the palmar aspect of the donor fingers remained intact. The dorsal aspect of the donor fingers had a deformity of contour that improved over time; the midlateral and dorsal scars on the middle and ring fingers showed no functional contractures. Scar contracture in the web space along the conduit of the pedicle was found in one patient, but secondary scar release had a good result.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1753193411434378">Nijhuis et al. (2010)</xref> found that more severe or complex injuries are associated with higher CISS scores. In this series, three patients had a CISS score &gt; 30, and they all had severe crush injuries. Joint stiffness in the reconstructed digits was noted, but this complication was related to the complexity and severity of original injury, rather than the flap transfer.</p>
<p>The TDMF flap technique provides a reconstructed thumb or index finger. Its major drawback is the appearance; however, the recovery of sensibility was comparable to that achieved by toe transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753193411434378">Buncke et al., 2007</xref>). After joining a recipient digital nerve stump and the DBPDN and DDN in the flap, mean static 2-PD was 10 mm in the palmar flap of the reconstructed finger, and there was no problem of sensory reorientation was shown in the TDMF flaps. Substantial sensory capacity could be restored in the reconstructed digits without loss of sensation in the pulp of the donor fingers.</p>
<p>The TDMF flap is a relatively simple, safe, single-stage procedure that can be used for covering extensive circumferential soft tissue defects of the thumb or index finger.</p>
