<title>Ivan Strenski</title>
<p>I very much appreciate the attention Kevin Schilbrack has applied to the task of critical reading of the contributions to this collection. His remarks are at once incisive, constructive and interesting. One could hardly ask for more. My response to those remarks aimed at my paper will be blessedly brief, since on the whole I find Kevin’s comments entirely “on the money.”</p>
<p>The issues that I should like to develop here are, I believe, nonetheless salient and consequential regarding the topic Bryan Rennie invited us to address. Schilbrack asserts that “‘beliefs’ cannot be removed from a decisive place in lived religion,” that “the discursive is still central,” that “what matters about religions is the <italic>propositions</italic> that religious people assume or assert” (3). While I accept that this is true, given certain religions or states of religious life, it is debatable whether it is true overall, or indeed, true most of the time. Lots of things “matter” to religious folk other than “propositions,” even if philosophers and theologians fret intensely about beliefs, discursive matters, propositions and such. Robertson Smith’s view,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0008429811430059">1</xref></sup> benighted, obsolete or not, that certain religions were devoid of myths, doctrines, ethical injunctions and the like, remains on the historical record. I do not seek to “rubber stamp” Robertson Smith. But why is it obviously true that the discursive is “what matters” in religion, when much that goes on in “lived religion” is not, at least on the surface, “discursive”? Why is belief, in effect, primary in all religious action and life? As evidenced by the manifest diversity of dimensions of religion exclusive of propositions, e.g. ritual, experiences, social organization, and so on, religion is, at least on its face, not constituted as a mass of propositions, even if it may be linked with propositions. And, besides, who decides “what matters”? In the same vein, in a recent intervention about Sister Elizabeth Johnson’s book <italic>Quest for the Living God</italic>, Emory University theologian Luke Timothy Johnson remarked that:<disp-quote>
<p>resurrection faith in “Jesus as Lord” is obedient trust in God’s work before it is belief in the truth of propositions … theology is the interrogation and celebration of such existential faith within the life of the church—an inductive art—rather than the handing down of verbal formulas …. (Johnson, 2011: 9–11)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0008429811430059">2</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>To press the issue further, why should we believe that all religious action is, in Kevin’s language, “intentional”? Do we not do things unthinkingly in religion—unintentionally—as easily, for instance, as artists Le Bron James and others do in moments of spontaneity and creation? Do religious composers create sacred music intentionally, or do they do so by risking elusive intuitive leaps and unpremeditated invention? What about that master of improvisation, Bach, or our own free-wheeling gospel musicians? I do not rule out intentional possibilities here, but discourse, propositions, beliefs and such do not stand out as central to these religious practices. So, I do want to highlight the unintentional, spontaneous, improvised dimension to religious action—those features of religion that I, at least, think of as part of what makes “lived religion” lived. Yes, we can always retrospectively impute certain intentions, beliefs, propositions and the like to actions that seem to be performed unintentionally or unthinkingly. We can even argue that these actions have no meaning unless they can be brought within the embrace of intentions, beliefs, propositions and such. But, when they are done, and in being done—“lived”—they seem to be devoid of the “discursive” elements, such as intentions. I would have thought, then, that this bit of prima facie facticity would require philosophers like Kevin to explain such action, not simply to subsume its existence to other—intentional—sorts of facts. Not to acknowledge this unthinking quality in religion is, then, to mis-describe part of what religion sometimes is. Thus, I do not quarrel with the thrust of the argument or the example of Linda in Kevin’s remarks. She spontaneously grabs her umbrella after looking at the sky. Thus, she may be a good example of someone who “believes the proposition, ‘It may rain,’” and acts accordingly. Fine, for Linda. But, Linda’s actions are instrumental—already pre-cooked as intentional actions. What of non-instrumental actions? What, for example, of the shout of “Hallelujah!” or “Thank you, Jesus! Thank you, Lord”? Always intentional? Or, sometimes, even often, an unthought, uncalculated outburst of emotions? What of one of Bach’s violent improvisational runs up and down the scale? Well thought out and devised? Or, a flash of musical genius that only has “meaning” retrospectively, when we try to divine a musical logic to it? And, what of the wave of solemnity and reverence that may sweep over people in the face of the experience of burial or death? Put on deliberately? Reckoned with forethought? Or, just what seemed the right thing to do? What, finally, of the shock at the moment of executing blood sacrifice? What of the visceral reaction to the sound of the great sundering “thwack” of the sacrificial knife? Why is belief necessarily behind such spontaneous reactions—even if we can interpret all such actions as shaped by beliefs? I may have acted as the cognitivist interprets me to act, and thus acted intentionally. But, maybe I did not. As a general interpretation of human action, looking for intentions is a reasonable way to read human behavior. But it remains an empirical matter, I would suggest, whether religious action generally arises out of intentions or not. Kevin needs to ponder the unthinking part of life, and thus about the “life” in “lived religion.” Beyond these views about the unintentional part of religion, there is philosophy itself to consider.</p>
<p>It is not saying anything particularly interesting that analytic or linguistic philosophy of religion is a “discursive” operation. It dwells upon parsing religious propositions. But, surely other kinds of “philosophies” exist, too. And, while these philosophies in themselves are acts of discursive thinking, they do not always or in principle dwell upon discursive acts. What, for example, of Phenomenology, Sartrean existentialism and such—philosophies that attend to action, social construction, feelings etc.? What people do and experience are not the same sorts of things as what they say or believe. It is, therefore, at the very least, an empirical matter whether it is true that “beliefs cannot be removed from a decisive position” in religion as well as in philosophy.</p>

<title>Greg Alles</title>
<p>I want to begin by thanking Bryan Rennie, Ivan Strenski, Marsha Hewitt, and Kevin Schilbrack for allowing me to be part of this special publication, and especially Kevin Schilbrack for his careful attention to my text. I am privileged to be in such fine company.</p>
<p>A younger colleague of mine is fond of pointing out that in his field, philosophy, it is common for people to write articles rather than books, and indeed, relatively few articles over the course of a lifetime, because the time required for developing philosophical arguments that are properly precise and vigorous is immense. Looking back at this essay from the distance of a year—I am writing in August 2011—I am beginning to understand his point. I wonder whether what is being presented to the world here is not really a fetus in need of a much longer period of gestation in order to be truly viable. I was sorely tempted to abort it, or at least to keep it in utero until it reached fuller term. But abortion hardly seemed fair to the others, especially Kevin Schilbrack, who took the trouble to comment on my thoughts. It also did not seem fair to ask the others to wait until my thoughts and arguments had gestated fully, a time that might very well never come. And it seemed highly unfair to Schilbrack to offer for publication a different article from the one upon which he commented. So, however premature it may be, the birth has occurred—with a little help from an editorial ventouse cup (an obstetrical suction cup).</p>
<p>Before I address the specific content of my article and Schilbrack’s critique, I would like to say why I find it appealing to talk about clumps. Over the last three decades or so, scholars of religions as well as others have engaged in a sustained critique of the category “religion.” At the risk of gravely oversimplifying the discussion, I might identify two basic arguments that critics of the term have utilized. (Most readers will know the literature.) The first is that religion as currently understood originated as a result of political, social, and cultural developments within Europe, beginning with the Reformation. The second is that not all people conceptualize the social–cultural world in terms whose fields of reference are identical with those of “religion.” The conclusion from both arguments is that “religion” applies to only a very limited range of data. To attempt to apply it elsewhere, as the study of religions has done, is to engage in acts of conceptual colonialism.</p>
<p>The historical and ethnographic claims embedded in these arguments are certainly worth making, just as the empirical studies upon which they rest and to which they have given rise are worth doing. They have enriched the understanding of our vocabulary and history immensely. Neither argument, however, actually leads to the intended conclusion. As a result, I think, both ultimately obscure rather than elucidate where some real problems with our terminology lie.</p>
<p>The first argument can be dismissed as a rather bald instance of the genetic fallacy. Notwithstanding that the category “religion” certainly comes with a checkered and quite interesting backstory, the path by which a term or a proposition or a position comes into existence is not relevant to assessing its adequacy. Presumably one can point to many cases in the history of human thought in which our conceptual repertoire has changed for the better for a variety of not particularly good reasons. For example, if in fact Isaac Newton’s belief in astrology allowed him to entertain the possibility of forces that acted without direct physical contact, that would not alter the usefulness of his account of gravity. (It is possible for our conceptual repertoire to regress, too, but that has no effect on the argument.) The second argument may appeal to those who still believe, as Robert Pirsig asserted in <italic>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</italic>, that gravity did not exist until Isaac Newton invented it, but today most philosophers of science, at least, are suspicious of the claim that there are theory-dependent objects, that is, objects whose existence depends upon my thinking about them. To think otherwise is to confuse invention and discovery, objects and conceptualizations or, in the case of what scholars of religions study, first-order conceptualizations and analytical ones. This is probably more readily apparent in the case of natural objects such as the Atlantic Ocean or Pluto, now conceptualized as only a dwarf planet, but it is also possible for social and cultural patterns and structures to exist quite apart from whether the people who evince them conceptualize them as such. Consider the regularities of grammar—descriptive, not prescriptive.</p>
<p>None of this means, however, that “religion” is an unproblematic term. How to conceive of regularities, determining which conceptualizations are better and which worse, is in principle a never-ending project. Newton’s account of gravity was certainly a good one, but it had flaws; every account does. Today, even with better mathematical descriptions, we still do not have, so far as I know, an agreed-upon mechanism to account for gravity. There are, I think, very real limits to the category “religion,” too. These limits deserve better than to be obscured by arguments that commit the genetic fallacy or to be obfuscated by confusion between first- and second-order categories. Nor should we magically wish them out of existence by claiming that, as scholars, we are free to define “religion” any way we wish, provided that we stipulate clearly what we mean. Clarity of expression is certainly welcome for avoiding misunderstandings and disagreements that are merely verbal, but establishing objects by stipulation is most appropriate in developing axiomatic systems, not for making claims about empirical reality of the sort that, I assume, most scholars of religions intend to make, even if they intend merely to talk about what other people say.</p>
<p>To my mind, the limits to and problems with the category “religion” have everything to do with our inability to transform the concept, in actual scholarly usage, from a clump into either a kind or a clearly defined, commonly agreed upon class, the way the International Astronomical Union has defined a planet as “a celestial body that (a) is in orbit around the Sun, (b) has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly round) shape, and (c) has cleared the neighbourhood around its orbit.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0008429811430059">3</xref></sup> Although these problems and limits are hardly confined to “religion,” this concept has been my primary concern here. My aim, to whatever degree it has been met, has been to provide a basis for understanding difficulties with the category “religion,” and other categories as well, that avoids both committing the genetic fallacy and confusing first- and second-order terminology. I have tried to achieve it by considering some features of “religion”—as a concept, not a thing, although my phrasing has been inconsistent. My hope is that by characterizing the term in this way, we will be better able to avoid treating “religion” as anything but a clump, in either our claims for it or our complaints about it, until we manage to transform it or some other term into something more precise. Since, in my limited experience, most thinking about concepts and conceptualization has taken concepts that target natural and mathematical objects for its exempla, I have set out a little on my own.</p>
<p>Now to specifics. Kevin Schilbrack has been very kind in his response, and for that I am grateful. I apologize for inconsistencies in my language. I also do not want to get bogged down defending weak examples, and I am willing to concede that “cup” is a weak example. I cannot resist pointing out, however, that “concave devices for holding things” constitutes a well-defined class that we might call “containers” and which includes not only cups but also swimming pools, bowls, jars, mugs, pitchers, drinking glasses, <italic>Krüge</italic> (beer “steins”), cup holders, baskets (waste, strawberry, Easter), drawers (desk, file-cabinet, chests of, at least when they are open), buckets, bucket seats, saucers, pots and pans, winnowing fans, oil-lamps (of the kind I routinely see at <italic>puja</italic>), and perhaps a whole host of other things. Some cups may even bear less resemblance to concave devices for holding things than they do to convex devices for covering things. (Recall Wittgenstein’s duck-rabbit.) Not being terribly familiar with obstetrics, I had originally written “ventouse cap” in the second paragraph above, but then I discovered that Google gave about twice as many hits for “ventouse cup” (1930 as opposed to 1040), so I decided to change the vowel. I am not sure what the properties are by which we identify an object as a cup, as some other kind of container, or as a cap, or by what logic one synecdoche ends and another begins. I personally would never say suction cap, although several websites do, for example: “The ventouse is a suction cap [not cup] which is made of silicone plastic.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0008429811430059">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Schilbrack’s response raises a couple of important questions that I cannot really answer. Where, he asks, is the boundary between a very diffuse, polythetically defined class and a clump? It will sound evasive to say that it is fuzzy, but that is about all I can manage. It may sound even more evasive to say that I think Schilbrack has actually pointed to an important characteristic of clumps. Clumps may not be precisely defined classes, but they are not arbitrary aggregations, either. If they were, they would not be useful. There were reasons—bad ones, as it turned out—why various conditions were lumped together as schizophrenia. And there were reasons—of various sorts—why the British government and then the government of India identified very heterogeneous groups of people as “tribals” (<italic>ādivāsīs</italic>), a social fiction, perhaps, that has become very real in the self-referential way that Schilbrack identifies for schizophrenia.</p>
<p>As I imagine it, the brain constructs clumps on the basis of superficial resemblances of just the sort that Schilbrack describes. Here is a crude, simplified model—crude because, among other things, it disregards socialization. Start with object A. (By “object” I do not mean “a thing out there”; I simply mean anything taken up for processing by what we might call the conceptual system.) The brain associates object A with Noun-This. When the brain encounters object B, for some reason it recalls object A, too. We normally say that B resembles A, and we identify that resemblance as a shared property. Doing so, however, is a little sloppy, because resemblances have varying ranges and strengths, so here let’s just say that the link occurs for reason 1, which may or may not be particularly good. Then, for reason 2 rather than reason 1, the brain invokes object A when it encounters object C, and Noun-This acquires object C. Then it acquires object D because the brain invokes object B for reason 3. Noun-This now refers to four objects, A, B, C, and D, for three reasons. Obviously we can continue this game for quite a while, linking objects for a variety of reasons. The longer we continue it, the less sense it makes to define Noun-This in terms of reasons 1 … <italic>n</italic>. That is because it is not only hard to keep track of every reason, but the various reasons themselves are not particularly useful in identifying a significant number of objects. It may be just as easy to think of Noun-This as a clump of objects. Another concept, Noun-That, which enchains objects A … ZZZ (78 objects) for only reasons 1 and 2, would be different. (Consider George Orwell: “Whatever goes on four legs, or has wings, is a friend.”) “Red triangles,” my “classic class,” is even more economical: it enchains objects A … ∞ for reason 1(a … b)—that is, every instance is both red and triangular—while the IAU’s definition of “planet” in actuality enchains objects Mercury … Neptune for reason 1(a … c).</p>
<p>We could amuse ourselves by drawing out these linkages and making patterns. I would suggest that if we did so, two types of patterns would be potentially interesting: clustered clumps and non-clustered ones. (Well-defined classes would be boring.) A clustered clump would bring together a group of objects, let us say A … Z, of which objects B … Z are enchained to object A, perhaps a very complex object, for reasons 1 up to 25 (an implausible number). A non-clustered clump would not have such a center; it would ramble. To the extent that we find Benson Saler’s prototype account of “religion” useful, it may be that “religion” is a clustered clump. In that case, it may be useful in approaching the difficulties with the category “religion,” and assessing the claims we want to make for it, to consider the implications of this clustering. It may indeed be more useful, analytically if not politically, than invoking genetic fallacies and claims of cultural colonialism.</p>
<p>The crude model sketched above may also provide a way to distinguish classes from clumps. Classes are closed (inference fixed). Our understanding of them may change. We may think that, a right angle being 90°, the angles of red triangles add up to 180°, until we take a globe and a red marker, draw triangles from the North Pole to two points on the equator, and find that their angles add up (I hope) to some number greater than 180° but less than 540°. Nevertheless, the class “red triangle” is still defined as containing red triangular objects. Our understanding of the reasons that define the class may change, but if we change the reasons, we change the class. Clumps are not closed. It is always possible, at least in principle, to add yet one more concatenation for yet one more reason <italic>x</italic>, as has happened time and again with “religion.”</p>
<p>I am already well over the limit of words allotted for my response, so let me simply end with a comment that a senior scholar who has wrestled with these issues more than I made to me after the session in Toronto, to the extent that I can remember it: “I’m a clumper myself. I don’t like defining religion in terms of superhuman beings. That too quickly precludes examining religion together with similar social–cultural movements, such as many environmental movements, where superhuman beings are absent.”</p>

<title>Bryan Rennie</title>
<p>First I would like to echo my fellow contributors’ thanks for Kevin Schilbrack’s incisive and appreciative comments, which have served to clarify all of our intentions and our arguments. I would particularly like to thank him for not over-simplifying my own argument.</p>
<p>Schilbrack drives home the ethno- or, more correctly, the Christo-centrism of standard “philosophy of religion” and echoes a common theme with his point that “one almost never sees analytic philosophers of religion working on issues central to non-Christian theisms”—never mind issues central to non-theisms. How can a definition of religion as “the love of God,” do anything but estrange and isolate large areas of what we commonly refer to as religion? The “practical bed” of religions, to adopt Schilbrack’s phrase, is the whole of humanity and our history, not some culturally or historically constrained area. In responding specifically to my paper Schilbrack asks, “How do history and philosophy inform one another?” Not as well as they should, I would reply. Schilbrack particularly raises the question of how philosophy would be helpful to historians. He does suggest his own response to this question, and I agree with him: it is a basic problem that writers who do not adequately consider the philosophical background of certain problems sometimes assume simplistic solutions to complex problems—folk theory or common knowledge, so to speak—that compromise the integrity of their presentation. Areas liable to such problems might include the constitutive features of confirmation or explanation—not simple points as some might assume. One particularly significant area concerns which claims, or what sort of claims, are ineluctably moot or constitute Kantian-type antinomies. While I would suggest that the fundamental questions of religious belief, especially the transcendental questions with which standard philosophy of religion primarily concerns itself, might remain entirely intractable, there are many other questions about religions and religious behavior that <italic>can</italic> effectively be dealt with by rational inquiry but which will inescapably be misunderstood without adequate philosophical sophistication. Examples would be the implications and evaluation of the plurality of religions; the relationship of religions and violence, or, more generally, the evaluation of religions as positive or negative contributions to human culture; the relationship of religion and science; the definition of religion (is there a “common core” to all religions?); the relation of religion to other cultural phenomena, such as Marxist ideology (is Marxism a religion?) or art (what <italic>is</italic> the relation of religion and art?); the nature and validity of the phenomenology of religion; the implications of neurotheology and cognitive studies of religion; and the role of the philosophy of time and history in the understanding of religious traditions. Questions such as what constitutes relevant evidence for religious claims and what is the role of reductionism in the study of religion all require a firm historical background knowledge of what has transpired in the past—what claims and what assumptions have in fact been made and in what circumstances. But such considerations cannot move confidently forward without an equally firm grasp of the philosophical analysis of the issues. Any representation of the history of religions that touches in any way on any of these, or similar, issues simply cannot afford to adopt simplistic, common-knowledge, understandings without being significantly compromised.</p>

<title>Marsha Aileen Hewitt</title>
<p>First, my thanks to Kevin Schilbrack for his thoughtful and supportive response to my paper. He has rightly understood that part of my intention is to encourage scholars to adopt an open-minded approach in their efforts to explain the human phenomenon of religious experience, beliefs and practices. My commitment to developing and promoting an <italic>integrative</italic> perspective that relies on psychoanalytic <italic>as well as</italic> neuro- and cognitive science insights in our efforts to account for religious experience is not directed toward theoretical synthesis or conceptual reconciliation, but rather seeks to establish a method of intellectual inquiry that is genuinely interested in understanding and illuminating its object, not in establishing its own academic hegemony. Schilbrack quite rightly observes that there is a “tension” (conflict?) between “<italic>phenomenological</italic> cognitive science (like that of Alva Noe or Shaun Gallagher) and <italic>eliminativist</italic> cognitive science (like that of the Churchlands or Steven Stich).” The “eliminativists,” Schilbrack states, “want to drop not only feelings or desires but the very category of the mental” from explanatory theories of religious experience. Why is this the case? What is at stake in this theoretical antagonism? Is there something to prove that is even capable of being proved? Why should our thinking be so riddled with conflictual exclusivist methodologies? How can human feelings and emotions be dismissed as irrelevant or distracting or unimportant in any theory that directs itself to explanations of any form of human experience? This approach is especially astounding when no one, not from cognitive science, neuroscience or psychology, for example, knows how it is that brain gives rise to mind.</p>
<p>My paper is organized around the claim that human experience, religious or otherwise, is <italic>both</italic> a biological and a psychological event, which means that awareness of biological sensations is psychological in that they are inevitably mental representations, however rudimentary. There is no such thing as a thought without some kind of feeling accompanying it. That the nature of the relationships between physical sensation, emotions and psychological meaning are yet to be worked out is indisputable; that they are interconnected, interdependent phenomena is equally indisputable. Inquiries into the nature of human experience, including religious experience, require multiple disciplinary perspectives in co-operation with each other <italic>if</italic> our aim is to understand what is happening when people believe that they encounter supernatural/superhuman agencies. So what is going on with those “exclusively physiological cognitive scientists [who] worry that a psychological/phenomenological approach conceals a view that thoughts are anything other than physical realities completely understood and explained by biochemistry and neuroscience,” described by Schilbrack?</p>
<p>I speculate that behind such rigid exclusivist claims in the field of religious studies lies a theology-anxiety that fears venturing into the messiness and unpredictability of the internal world of human beings with its often impenetrable mixture of phantasy, desire, longing, hatred, love and terror because there we will find things we cannot explain—yet. Our effort to fill in the gaps with the language of symbol and metaphor, for example, takes us away from the clear, more predictable world of scientific method and perhaps ventures dangerously close to some kind of [crypto?] theological explanation or superstitious filling in of gaps in our knowledge that sidetrack and obscure our efforts to construct coherent explanations. Psychoanalysis has long established that anxiety underlies the aggression of exclusivist, rigid thinking that believes too much in its own powers of knowing, and must defend it by establishing impenetrable boundaries. One does run into this approach to theory building rather frequently in the field of the study of religion. Theology-anxiety, as with any form of anxiety, threatens to undermine critical thought when it engages in exclusivist practices by collapsing into monologue rather than more expansive, dialogical forms of theoretical investigation. It also happens that certain forms of theoretical inquiry suspected of harboring theological sympathies are opposed, dismissed or treated with outright contempt, as is certainly the case with the tone of Richard Dawkins’s book <italic>The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution</italic>.</p>
<p>Schilbrack disagrees with my speculation about theology-anxiety and instead argues for another form of anxiety, where the real worry motivating the representatives of “eliminativist” cognitive science has more to do with what they see as a “<italic>humanist</italic> interest that includes beliefs, desires and emotions.” Schilbrack may well be right on this point, but perhaps the unconscious phantasies that may underlie that particular worry are less important than the eliminativist theoretical method itself. Here I remind the reader of the references in my essay to the work of Antonio Damasio, which applies equally to one-sided thinking that privileges both cognitive and neuroscience over the explanatory power of other disciplines. Damasio writes, “a simple neurobiological explanation for the rise of ethics, religion, law, and justice is hardly viable. It is reasonable to venture that neurobiology will play an important role in future explanations. But in order to comprehend these cultural phenomena satisfactorily we need to factor in ideas from anthropology, sociology, psychoanalysis, and evolutionary psychology, as well as findings from studies in the fields of ethics, law, and religion.” In other words, Damasio’s call for an “integrated” approach to knowledge requires the inclusion of the humanities—psychoanalysis too—in scientific inquiries into the nature of mind and its vast diversity of experiences.</p>
<p>What is required of scholars interested in the study of religion is the cultivation of an enlarged mentality that is willing to enter into critical dialogue with those disciplines that have something to say about the complexities of human experiences, beliefs and practices. Adorno’s remarks on the role of philosophy in intellectual inquiry are pertinent here when he writes, “Authentic philosophic interpretation does not meet up with a fixed meaning which already lies behind the question, but lights it up suddenly and momentarily, and consumes it at the same time … philosophy has to bring its elements, which it receives from the sciences, into changing constellations … into changing trial combinations, until they fall into a figure which can be read as an answer, while at the same time the question disappears.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0008429811430059">5</xref></sup> This is the task of critical thought, the aim of intellectual inquiry, whose greatest promise lies in its potential to illuminate the questions that drive us to know about ourselves and our world.</p>
<p>Finally, to address Schilbrack’s concern about my remarks that religions can (and often do) provide human beings with a “vivid sense of harmony and peace” within the self and with the universe, which, he thinks, only tells part of the story. He asks about those “religious paths that promote self-abasement and mortification? Or those that teach the rejection of society—or even violence?” This is an important question to which psychoanalysis contributes an illuminating and persuasive answer. For many religious believers, including those who are motivated to commit violent acts in the name of their god, what is most important is the pursuit of an experience of intimate, loving <italic>relationship</italic> with that god. It is not the violence and destruction instrumental to achieving the experience that is the <italic>aim</italic> of religious violence (although it might be the case with some people) but rather the need for felt connection and recognition in the mind of the god who is worshipped. What the religious believer craves in these instances is a feeling of being-in-relation with their god that is as unmediated and intimate as possible. What we need to understand, then, is the depth and nature of that <italic>need for connection</italic>; whether it is for god or another human being or the cosmos is a secondary question.</p>
<p>At least since the advent of object relations theory in psychoanalysis, it has been widely accepted that human beings, motivated by the attachment system that is a feature of the human organism and of most of the higher mammals, seek <italic>relationships</italic> with others from earliest infancy and not the mere satisfaction derived from bodily-based drives. The need to connect with another being—human or divine—was certainly recognized by Freud but it has become central to subsequent developments in psychoanalytic theorizing to this day. It can happen, of course, that the conditions that contextualize the pursuit of relationships are fraught with difficulties and frustrations, making it appear, for example, that those environmental obstacles blocking connection with the one desired must be attacked, overcome and/or even abolished. Freud explained this phenomenon symbolically and metaphorically in terms of Oedipal conflict and an originary act of violence against those (patriarchal) forces that blocked the fulfillment of desire for the mother’s (woman’s) reciprocated love. Whatever the critical challenges that were leveled against Freud’s Oedipal and primal horde theory by object relations and/or contemporary relational, self-psychological and intersubjective psychoanalytic theories, one central insight remains that connects them all: the existence of an innate, powerful need in human beings for connection with others. If that need is frustrated, it does not mean that the pursuit of it stops, but rather that struggles against the obstacles to its fulfillment will be taken up. In terms of religious longing, what Schilbrack describes as “self-abasement” and “mortification” or the promotion of violence are not in themselves the ultimate goals of the practices that result in negative experiences, but rather the means to a higher aim that envisions a state of loving reconciliation with an other, and in the case of religion, a spiritual, superhuman or supernatural Other.</p>
<p>Although I have made this point elsewhere,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0008429811430059">6</xref></sup> an illustration of the above argument is worth repeating. In her cross-cultural, comparative study of religious groups and individuals who advocated and enacted violence in the name of their god, Jessica Stern quotes a letter she received from a young woman member of the Liskar Jihad group, who wrote, “Don’t ever think that we’re afraid of death in defending our religion. Even death is our goal to reach the true glory … This is our call … we’re just seeking for bigger love from Him.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0008429811430059">7</xref></sup> The desire expressed here to win God’s love is <italic>the</italic> most important, ultimate motivating factor that underlies and directs acts of religious militancy. What psychoanalysis tells us is that the need for loving connection and recognition from another trumps all other human motivation. This drive for relationship is universal in that it is part of the evolutionarily bequeathed attachment system and, as such, is a key organizing feature of human psychological development that is expressed in an infinite variety of diverse cultural forms. As I have also argued elsewhere,<sup>8</sup> Freud had a strong intimation of this that is expressed in his theory of religious longing as driven by the need for the protection of the father, who provides the fledgling infant with a haven of safety in a dangerous world. Given that the universally shared attachment system may be activated when human beings find themselves in various degrees of danger or under other types of threat, then they will do whatever they need to do, including committing acts of violence, to protect themselves and the cultural goods—like religion—that they value. When Schilbrack and so many others wonder why people engage in religiously motivated violence when the religion in question embraces peace and harmony, the peace and harmony sought is a feeling state that structures the sense of relationship with the god. That violence or even the death of oneself might occur in the struggle to achieve this state is beside the point. What it is important to understand are those feeling states, mental organizations, psychic structures and unconscious phantasies that underlie and give rise to the more conscious manifest content of beliefs and actions. On the surface and from the perspective of conscious reason, religious violence seems difficult to comprehend unless we look deeper into the underlying psychodynamics of the human mind and its profound need for connection with others, human or divine.</p>
<p>The findings of the neuro- and cognitive sciences in the recent past have yielded enormous benefits to scholars of religion in their efforts to understand and explain the complexities of religious experiences, beliefs and practices. Although, as scholars of religion, we are not neuro- and cognitive scientists and researchers, we must be open to these disciplines in order to enrich and expand our own inquiries. What is required in the study of religion, as in any field of inquiry, is a methodology that strives toward “an increasingly seamless system of interconnected knowledge” that does not regard “conceptual unification” as an enemy, or the “relevance of other fields a menace to their freedom to interpret human reality.”<sup>9</sup>
