<abstract>
<p>In this article we draw on a specific case study – the re-regulation of BBC political reporting in the nations and regions in the UK post-devolution – to compare the BBC’s interventionist, public service framework with the ‘light touch’ regime of commercial broadcasting. We carried out a content analysis of BBC Television News (where issues of accuracy and impartiality are regulated by the BBC Trust), and three commercially funded channels (where programme content is entirely regulated by Ofcom) before and after an editorial intervention by the BBC Trust.</p>
<p>We found that the BBC improved the balance and accuracy of its television news coverage whereas commercial broadcasters continued to overlook or misrepresent the reality of devolved politics in the UK. While it can be difficult to demonstrate empirically how regulation can enhance media content compared to a ‘light touch’ system – as our study found – we suggest that the impact of regulatory interventions should be more central to journalism studies internationally.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In recent years, many politicians, policy makers and media professionals have increasingly subscribed to the view that the regulation of broadcast media is a bureaucratic and cumbersome endeavour that inhibits creative freedom and innovation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1464884911431536">Freedman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1464884911431536">McChesney, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1464884911431536">Wheeler, 2004</xref>). While this perspective has been widespread in the United States (US) for some time, in Europe and the United Kingdom (UK) in particular this ‘free market’ impulse to media policymaking has become more prevalent (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1464884911431536">Bassett, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>This is not to suggest, of course, that effective regulatory frameworks do not remain in place or that a ‘free market’ system of broadcasting has entirely displaced public service structures. Many European Union (EU) countries, in this respect, have maintained a strong public service presence and robust regulatory frameworks. The EU, in particular, has sought to re-regulate media markets and prevent unfettered market dominance. Nevertheless, for all the re-regulatory efforts of many governments, sustained analysis of media policy debates in recent years has shown most countries are imposing less rather than more regulation on broadcasters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1464884911431536">Freedman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1464884911431536">McChesney, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1464884911431536">Puppis, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The global impact of media deregulation has been interpreted both favourably and critically by media scholars (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1464884911431536">Bennett, 2004</xref>, for review). Since deregulation has enabled more commercial markets to flourish, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1464884911431536">Norris (2000)</xref> argues that the information environment has been enriched with the availability of a wider range of media sources. The rise of commercial television news, in this context, is associated with the supply of more democratic choice since viewers are able to pick and choose from more entertaining programming driven by their needs as opposed to the more top-down, highbrow world of public service journalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1464884911431536">Baum, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1464884911431536">Zaller, 2003</xref>). However, many scholars challenge the democratic value of new commercial programming. Writing about the consequences of deregulation in the 1980s, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1464884911431536">Hallin (1994)</xref> suggests the competition from an increasing range of cable news sources meant that US journalism became swept up in a ratings war between channels. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1464884911431536">Hallin’s (1994)</xref> view the character of US journalism changed, since news was primarily delivered to entertain rather than inform viewers about the world. More than a decade on, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1464884911431536">Thussu (2007)</xref> argues that these values have spread globally as public television is increasingly sold off and market competition is reshaping the values of the television news genre. The information environment, in other words, is diminishing as media markets become privatised.</p>
<p>While many scholars have been critical of a deregulated media culture, there has been less empirical attention on how re-regulation – where new regulatory requirements are established – could improve rather than impede the quality of journalism. This is partly because it has often been difficult to demonstrate how regulation – beyond a general sense of upholding standards – can <italic>enhance</italic> media content in a way that a ‘light touch’ system cannot. There has, of course, been analysis of national and increasingly supranational changes in media regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1464884911431536">Freedman, 2008</xref>: 13–15; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1464884911431536">McChesney, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1464884911431536">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1464884911431536">Wheeler, 2004</xref>), or general discussion about shifting regulatory models, including deregulation and re-regulation as well as co-regulation or self-regulation where flexible arrangements exist between key stakeholders. Within a European context, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1464884911431536">Bardoel and D’Haenens (2008</xref>: 348) have identified:
<disp-quote>
<p>… a change from protectionism to promotion of competition; the separation of political and operative tasks (i.e. independent regulatory authorities); the shift from vertical (sector-specific) to horizontal regulation; the transition from national to supra- and international regulation; and the change from state to self- and co-regulation in which private and societal partners are becoming more actively involved in regulation.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Debates of this kind are often framed around the discourses of specific legislation, with an act or directive analysed generally or in fine detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1464884911431536">Bardoel and D’Haenens, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1464884911431536">Harvey, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1464884911431536">Livingstone et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1464884911431536">Wheeler, 2004</xref>). What is less understood in media and journalism studies, however, is the measurable and comparative impact of different types of regulatory frameworks on news coverage after media industries have been either deregulated or re-regulated.</p>
<p>In this study we draw on a comprehensive content analysis to explore a case study of how one media regulator, the BBC Trust,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1464884911431536">1</xref></sup> attempted to reshape the news agenda of BBC news in order to make programming more accurately reflect the UK nations and its newly devolved political institutions. Television news broadcasters in the UK have had to adapt and respond quickly to the profound shift from a centralised to a devolved political system during the last decade, when substantial powers shifted from Westminster (in England) to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Our study, in brief, empirically explores whether a specific set of guidelines had any measurable impact on the volume and nature of television reporting of the UK and devolved politics.</p>

<title>State interventions into commercial and public service broadcast journalism</title>
<p>Public interventions into media content and, more specifically, broadcast journalism are largely shaped by how nation states balance commercial and public service priorities. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1464884911431536">Moe and Syvertsen (2009)</xref> identify three types of public service broadcasting (PSB) models: broad interventions, associated with countries in Northern Europe; some public service intervention, often used to protect markets in national cultures, notably France, Canada and Australia; and minimalist intervention, where PSB is not well established or supported, and is seen to ‘supplement commercial resources’ rather than ‘act as national broadcasters’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1464884911431536">2009</xref>: 398–399). While we can characterise broadcasting systems on a national level, there are also variations <italic>within</italic> nations, many of which have two-tier systems, with public service and commercial channels subject to different levels of regulation. This has been exacerbated by the growth of transnational media and the proliferation of commercial channels, weakening the public service ecology of broadcasting systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1464884911431536">Tracey, 1998</xref>)</p>
<p>In most interventionist countries, the state-mandated structures dominated the media industries until the 1980s. At this point, new technologies opened up opportunities for new, transnational media markets to develop first cable then satellite broadcasting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1464884911431536">Chalaby, 2009</xref>). Lured by the promise of lucrative revenues, many governments began a process of deregulation, stripping back legislation that might impede growth and liberalising media ownership laws. As cable and satellite broadcasting entered the market in the 1980s, broadcasting policy followed broader political and economic changes in de-nationalising industry and embracing the forces of globalisation. This is largely the case within a European context, where broadcasting policy initially developed within a more publicly funded environment. But while the regulation of broadcast journalism is still considered healthy to a democratic culture in most European countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1464884911431536">Bardoel and D’Haenens, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1464884911431536">Cushion, 2012</xref>), many have allowed commercial broadcasting to develop with less regulatory demands.</p>
<p>As a consequence, recent history has seen the decline of the national public service broadcasting model and its wider regulatory framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1464884911431536">Cushion, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1464884911431536">Tambini and Cowling, 2002</xref>). A paternalistic approach to state regulation to shape programme content is difficult to sustain when, in the face of emerging commercial markets, growth, freedom and innovation are touted as the broadcasting currency of the future. Politicians and legislators have adopted this currency, with technocratic language used to champion what market competition can deliver if state intervention is minimised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1464884911431536">Bassett, 2010</xref>). Likewise, many regulators have responded to this prevailing view, stepping back from intervening too heavily in content management and distorting market competition.</p>
<p>In more minimalist intervention countries, most strikingly the US, the lack of a meaningful public broadcasting presence has meant television journalism has been subject to less regulatory oversight. Commercial broadcasters in the US are encouraged to make programmes the market demands, with minimal interference from the regulator, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). But even in the US this approach has not gone uncontested. During the 1960s, a market deficit of news and current affairs programming became a major concern, causing the FCC to become more interventionist and oblige commercial networks to invest more in this area, under the impartiality rules of the ‘Fairness Doctrine’. From the 1980s, however, the US has generally pursued a more deregulatory line, and the practices and conventions of US television news programming have not been subject to the same regulatory requirements as many European broadcasters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1464884911431536">Cushion, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1464884911431536">Freedman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1464884911431536">McChesney, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1464884911431536">2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Since the case study explored in this article is based in the UK, it is necessary to briefly contextualise the UK’s approach to the regulation of television news. UK broadcasters operate in a both interventionist and minimalist regulatory environment. The overarching public service structure that once defined both commercial (ITV, Channel 4) and public broadcasters (the BBC) was abandoned in the late 1980s to create a tripartite regulatory system (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1464884911431536">Cushion, 2011</xref>). Most of the new channels within this structure were governed by a ‘light touch’ commercial framework, with the ‘old’ commercial broadcasters still tied to some public service commitments and the BBC left as the only broadcaster with a clearly defined public service remit. As of 2011, commercial broadcasters in the UK are regulated by the Office of Communication (Ofcom – established in 2003) while the BBC is regulated by the BBC Trust (established in 2007).</p>
<p>The BBC Trust defines itself as an interventionist watchdog, claiming from a public service perspective to ‘have considerable power to wield on your behalf – and when we need to, we act quickly and decisively in your interests’ (BBC Trust website).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1464884911431536">2</xref></sup> By contrast, Ofcom was conceived as a ‘light touch’ regulator. While ‘light touch’ is a somewhat vague description, it signals an attempt to limit the enforcement of top-down regulation. In its statutory principles, Ofcom states ‘it will operate with a bias against intervention, but with a willingness to intervene firmly, promptly and effectively where required’ (Ofcom website).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1464884911431536">3</xref></sup> According to an Ofcom statement on <italic>Identifying Appropriate Regulatory Solutions</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1464884911431536">2008</xref>: 2), its favoured approach is self-regulation (‘where industry administers a solution without formal oversight’) or co-regulation (‘where a form of statutory requirement is necessary’). In practice, the commercial broadcasters – ITV, Sky, Channels 4 and 5 – have varying levels of regulatory responsibilities related to the delivery of news and current affairs. While Sky has to conform to laws ensuring its journalism is impartial (as do all UK broadcasters), it is not legally obliged to carry any news or current affairs programming. So, for example, during the early stages of Rupert Murdoch’s 2011 bid to buy all of BSkyB’s shares in the UK (before it was derailed by the <italic>News of the World</italic> phone-hacking scandal), it was suggested that Sky News could be sold off or even closed down to ensure the deal went through. ITV, Channel Four and Channel 5, by contrast, operate under public service broadcasting licences that require each station to supply different levels of television news and current affairs programming.</p>
<p>As the commercial infrastructure of broadcasting has grown stronger in recent decades, pressure has inevitably been exerted on commercial broadcasters with costly public service commitments such as the production of high quality local television news. These financial constraints have allowed commercial broadcasters to successfully argue that public service obligations have put them at a competitive disadvantage. So, for example, ITV – which, out of the four main commercial broadcasters in the UK, carries the most public service responsibilities – is in advanced discussions to reduce or even entirely drop its commitment to regional news when its public service licence ends in 2014 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1464884911431536">Brown, 2011</xref>). A new Conservative Secretary of State for Culture, Olympics, Media and Sport, Jeremy Hunt, has enthusiastically advocated establishing commercially run local television news stations, having shelved the previous Labour government’s IFNCs (Independently funded news consortia) which sought to forge public/private partnerships to sustain local news services. While these market-led ambitions have been scaled back somewhat (after commissioned reports have questioned their commercial viability; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1464884911431536">Shott, 2010</xref>, for example), both initiatives represent the need to address the commercial retreat from regional and local news. Meanwhile, additional pressure has been placed on BBC journalism to inform viewers about regional and local issues across the nations and regions in the UK post devolution.</p>
<p>We now turn to a case study of how a public service broadcaster – the BBC – has attempted to regulate its reporting of the nations and regions in a post-devolution UK environment and compare its television news coverage with commercial broadcasters operating under a ‘light touch’ regulatory framework.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1464884911431536">
<title>Measuring the impact of intervention</title>
<p>As part of its remit, the BBC Trust commissioned the Cardiff School of Journalism, Media and Cultural Studies in 2007 to carry out a quantitative and qualitative analysis of BBC and commercial television news coverage of UK news and devolved politics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1464884911431536">Lewis et al., 2008</xref>). This was prompted by concerns that the BBC was not being impartial in its coverage of the four nations that make up the UK – England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland – and, more specifically, that it was not accurately reporting the new political landscape in which power was no longer centralised in Westminster but devolved to new governments (established in 1999) in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. These institutions now hold considerable powers and are increasingly making different policy decisions on key areas such as health and education. Each institution holds different levels of legislative responsibility and, over the last decade or so, these have increased, with further reviews expected to devolve yet more fiscal powers and policy responsibilities.</p>
<p>Since both commercial and public service channels continue to operate UK-wide news television bulletins, devolution has made the reporting of politics and political issues far more challenging for journalists. This was reflected in our first review of broadcast coverage of the nations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1464884911431536">Lewis et al., 2008</xref>), which broadly concluded that the public and commercial broadcasters needed to considerably increase their coverage beyond England to more accurately report the political powers Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland now hold. Since the study was commissioned by the BBC trust, commercial broadcasters were not obliged to respond to the recommendations. The conclusions of the report, nevertheless, raised considerable debate amongst broadcasters and were widely reported in mainstream and specialist media (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1464884911431536">Gibson, 2008</xref>). Commercial broadcasters, without having to be as publicly accountable, could have taken the opportunity to reflect on their own coverage since the findings were in the public domain. But as we discuss in the conclusion, Ofcom’s less interventionist approach perhaps restricted its ability to more pro-actively respond and encourage commercial broadcasters to make changes to their news reporting.</p>
<p>We carried out a comprehensive content analysis of BBC and commercial television bulletins gathered during eight-week periods in October and November 2007 (before the BBC Trust’s intervention) and in 2009 (approximately two years later). For BBC television, this included BBC <italic>News at One</italic>, BBC <italic>News at Six</italic>, BBC <italic>News at Ten</italic>, BBC <italic>News</italic> (BBC One Saturday and Sunday afternoons),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1464884911431536">4</xref></sup> and one hour per day of the BBC News Channel (5–6p.m. Monday–Friday, 6–7p.m. Saturday, Sunday). For commercial television, this included Channel 4 <italic>News</italic> (including Saturday, Sunday), ITV <italic>News at Ten</italic>, ITV <italic>News</italic> (Saturday, Sunday), and one hour per day of Sky News (5–6p.m. Monday–Friday, 6–7p.m. Saturday, Sunday).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1464884911431536">5</xref></sup> Overall, 4,794 news items were examined in both studies.</p>
<p>The coding frame was developed to assess impartiality and accuracy, exploring whether coverage of the four nations was balanced, accurate and helpful in understanding the new political world of devolved government. To measure the extent of coverage across the nations and regions in the UK, the story and reporter location of every news item was quantified. At the same time, every news item was categorised into story subjects to establish which stories dominated and, more for comparative purposes, how far devolved politics was part of the overall agenda.</p>
<p>Our research objectives were challenging. The nature of devolution can be complex, since many powers overlap with Westminster, requiring us to adopt a more sophisticated interpretative framework that might allow us to appreciate the degree to which journalists understand and represent devolved politics. This meant a significantly greater level of discursive detail than that required by most forms of content analysis, which are often limited to measuring simple categories. We discuss how we coded these more qualitative coding frames when we present the findings since they need to be explained in detail. The intercoder reliability scores remained high, nonetheless, between 90–100 per cent (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1464884911431536">Appendix</xref>). This was achieved by extensive piloting, regular team meetings and the development of elaborate but precise values and criteria.</p>
<p>In examining the potential impact of the BBC Trust’s intervention, our approach is consigned to the analysis of television news as opposed to understanding the internal machinations that might have led to changes within its journalism or in how viewers understand devolved coverage. We are not able, in other words, to explore the personal or professional motives behind individual decisions by BBC management to execute the recommendations of the BBC Trust. Nor can we claim that any shifts in the nature of devolution coverage will automatically enhance viewers’ knowledge or engagement. What we can assess is the quality and nature of information available to people on the most dominant and influential news outlets. In identifying causality, then, our conclusions are informed by a detailed analysis of a substantial volume of news coverage before and after the BBC Trust’s intervention. Nonetheless, we are able to assess any changes in the content of television news based on the BBC management’s response to the findings of the first study. These warrant summarising briefly since they provide an insight into editorial policies enacted after the BBC Trust’s intervention that might have impacted on the BBC’s television news journalism.</p>
<p>Following the 2007 research – which suggested a number of shortcomings in the BBC’s coverage of post-devolution politics – the BBC management suggested a wide range of structural changes to its training and editorial policy, with the full management response including an action plan published in July 2008.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1464884911431536">6</xref></sup> While there were many different recommendations about changing the internal structures that shape BBC news gathering, we focus on four specific guidelines in order to empirically explore whether they led to changes in the content of news. First, the BBC proposed that news items be labelled to reflect the ‘different levels of devolved responsibilities and different political priorities in each nation’. As part of this, BBC journalists should be more ‘accurate about whether or not the facts and views conveyed in output apply to each individual nation’. Overall, a story should be rooted in its geographic applicability for audiences to be able to understand its political relevance.</p>
<p>Second, policy differences between nations should be more clearly explained. In the BBC management’s own words, this ‘involves reflecting different perspectives from the nations on particular policy developments’. The UK-wide news network, in other words, should be communicated more accurately to capture the complexity and changing nature of devolved politics.</p>
<p>A third recommendation was that journalists should ‘seek to feature perspectives and examples from across the nations and regions when reporting major UK stories (e.g. economy or business), to reflect the fact that stories impact differently in different parts of the UK’. What this refers to, in particular, is the need to illustrate stories beyond London to other capital cities – Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast – to represent the UK more widely.</p>
<p>Finally, the BBC recommended giving ‘appropriate weight to coverage of stories which are of major importance to audiences in the nations and regions, including the actions and policies of the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland’. In short, to increase the news value of the nations beyond England and devolved politics more generally.</p>
<p>While all of these recommendations could be applied equally to the UK’s commercial broadcasters’ coverage, Ofcom did not issue or develop a similar set of guidelines. This therefore provided an excellent case study to review two different regulatory frameworks in action and to develop a comparative critique of the kinds of news produced in both. As we have already pointed out, while all commercial broadcasters operate under Ofcom – a ‘light touch’ regulator – they are not subject to the same level of regulation. Our analysis thus seeks to compare the three commercial broadcasters (ITV, Channel 4 and Sky News) in the context of how ‘lightly’ each is regulated. Comparing the more interventionist BBC Trust and Ofcom is not unproblematic either. The BBC Trust is part of the BBC’s organisation and culture, with structures in place to directly influence its editorial policy and training. Ofcom, by contrast, is a quango, a more distant external body, and since it operates primarily via self-regulation or co-regulation, implementing editorial recommendations is clearly more difficult. Nevertheless, this should not invalidate the comparative analysis of two competing regulatory systems, since it reveals how both models work in practice and whether television journalism can be policed effectively to maintain editorial standards.</p>
<p>In establishing how different regulatory frameworks impact on coverage of the nations and devolved politics, we were faced with four possibilities. First, the problem (a failure to represent the nature of the new devolved political landscape) would be too deeply rooted in metropolitan journalistic assumptions to be solved by either the BBC Trust’s interventionist or Ofcom’s ‘light touch’ approaches. Second, we would see improvements across the board, suggesting that a more heavy-handed intervention is no more successful than well-informed self-regulation. Third, we would see improvements mainly in the BBC’s coverage, or, fourth, mainly in the commercial broadcaster’s coverage. The third of these possibilities would signal success for a more interventionist approach and a failure of self-regulation, while the fourth possibility would suggest that direct interventions were actually counter-productive, and that freedom from such constraints actually increases the flexibility of broadcasters to respond to a problem.</p>

<title>One union, four nations: Reflecting the UK?</title>
<p>The 2007 study – which informed the BBC Trust’s intervention – identified that routine television news coverage was primarily based on stories <italic>in England</italic>. By contrast, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland received significantly less coverage than might be expected given their population size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1464884911431536">Lewis et al., 2008</xref>). This is not to imply that population or audience share should necessarily determine the proportion of stories across the UK, but in the absence of any other plausible criteria (‘news value’ being too vague and subject to interpretation – see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1464884911431536">O’Neil and Harcup, 2009</xref>), it does suggest the centre (England) is favoured over the periphery (Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland). This point was acknowledged by the subsequent BBC recommendation that ‘appropriate weight (be given) to coverage of stories which are of major importance to audiences in the nations and regions’.</p>
<p>The priority given to coverage of the four nations is brought into sharper focus if we look at the distribution of reporters across the UK by news organisations. We thus isolated all those news items covering stories about specific nations in the UK – such as a murder in Leeds or hospital closures in Scotland – that were covered by a reporter on location within the UK – whether live or featuring a package on location (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1464884911431536">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>In the two years from 2007 to 2009, our findings indicate that BBC news bulletins have, collectively, became less England-centric, with an increased proportion of stories from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Across BBC television news, the proportion of news items featuring reporters on location in BBC news bulletins in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland rose from 9.4 per cent to 15.4 per cent. By contrast, on ITV, Channel 4 and Sky News the proportion of news items with reporters on location in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland fell from 6 per cent to 3.5 per cent.</p>
<p>This indicates a growing divergence between BBC television and commercial television broadcasters. In 2007, the gap between them was much less striking, with 9.4 per cent of news items reported from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland on the BBC and 6 per cent on commercial channels. By 2009 the gap was much more dramatic, rising to 15.4 per cent on the BBC and falling to only 3.5 per cent on the commercial channels. While ITV’s range of reports did become a little more diverse (with more news items from both Scotland and Wales), the two other commercial channels – Channel 4 and Sky News – became less so. In both cases, over 98 per cent of news items were reported from England, with nothing from Scotland or Northern Ireland on Channel 4 and nothing from Wales or Northern Ireland on Sky News. Indeed, <italic>all</italic> the BBC news programmes we looked at featured a higher proportion of news items from any one of the three nations outside England than the combined total for all three on Channel 4 or Sky.</p>
<p>These news items covered a wide range of stories, only a minority of which were related to devolved political issues. If we look at <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1464884911431536">Table 2</xref> we can see more precisely the percentage of news items about devolved politics or devolved issues (like health or education) in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1464884911431536">Table 2</xref> shows that stories about devolution, devolved politics or institutions occupy only a small fraction of the news agenda. However, on BBC news bulletins, we did find a modest increase in the proportion of news items in topics involving devolved issues in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland (up from 1% in 2007 to 1.4% in 2009). This contrasts sharply with the decline in coverage of devolved politics on the commercial news bulletins: devolved items on ITV, Channel 4 and Sky halved from 2007 to 2009 (0.7% to 0.3%). It may be, of course, that there were fewer stories about devolved politics in the 2009 sample period, which might explain the fall in the coverage from commercial news channels. In this context, the editorial shift in the BBC’s news agenda towards the coverage of devolved politics is all the more striking.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1464884911431536">
<title>Interpreting the complexity of devolved politics</title>
<p>We developed a coding frame that quantified news items that had some relevance to political devolution, regardless of whether this was made clear by the news report in question. We looked, in other words, for absences as well as presences. A number of news items about health or education policy – largely areas where power has been devolved to governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland – fell within this category, even if they did not actually refer to devolved powers. Our aim was to see how events or issues that involved aspects of devolved authority – such as health, education or policing – were covered.</p>
<p>First we isolated those news items that made specific references to devolved powers in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, even if the story was not primarily about these powers (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1464884911431536">Table 3</xref>). We found, overall, that only a small number of news items made such references, although this involved a substantial increase in the number of news items on BBC outlets that referred to devolved powers outside England (from four to 25). On the commercial bulletins, a mixed picture emerges. While the number of news items referring to devolved powers on Channel 4 and ITV (combined) increased from four to eight news items, we did not find any references to devolved powers on Sky News in either period.</p>

<p>Despite the sharp BBC increases, it remains true that most stories in both periods related to devolved issues in England. One of the key issues to emerge from the 2007 study was that many stories about issues like health or education in England tended to ignore the fact that, following devolution, they applied <italic>only</italic> to England (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1464884911431536">Lewis et al., 2008</xref>). Viewers in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland may well have been confused by such coverage, unaware that different policy regimes existed in their own countries. In order to pursue this point, in 2009 we identified every news items relevant to devolution that applied specifically to England (or England and at least one other devolved nation) to see how often their geographical applicability <italic>was</italic> specified. The complexities of devolution mean that some stories may only apply to England, some only to England and Wales, and some to England, Wales and either Scotland or Northern Ireland. We categorised all these news items in three ways:</p>
<list id="list1-1464884911431536" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Those that made it clear that they were about England (or England and at least one other nation).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Those that failed to specify that the story referred only to England (or England and at least one other nation).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Those that were confusing about their geographical applicability in the UK.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1464884911431536">Table 4</xref> shows that most of these news items were about stories that applied only to England, while most of the others referred to England and Wales. It also indicates that on BBC outlets the majority of news items about England (or England and at least one other nation) stated correctly that the policy focus of the item applied only to England (or England and at least one other nation).</p>

<p>We found a notable difference between the BBC and commercial broadcasters in this regard. While 65 per cent of BBC news items (correctly) identified when a story applied only to England (or England and at least one other nation), commercial broadcasters only made this fact clear in 35 per cent of the relevant news items. In most cases, then, viewers of ITV, Channel 4 or Sky News may have been left with the impression what was happening in England actually applied UK-wide.</p>
<p>BBC reports would typically refer to the relevance of a story’s location in the introduction. So, for example, in a review of education for infants (relevant to England only), the BBC’s <italic>News at One</italic> began:
<disp-quote>
<p>Children in <italic>England</italic> shouldn’t start formal education until the age of six. That’s according to the largest review of primary education <italic>in England</italic> for 40 years. It says there’s no evidence that starting formal learning at 5 brings any benefits, and could even be harmful. The government called the review disappointing and out of date. (BBC <italic>News at One</italic>, 16 October 2009, our emphasis)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Since ‘in England’ is explicitly referenced twice in the introduction, this instance demonstrates the simplicity of ‘good practice’ when dealing with UK policy.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the BBC did not always make clear the devolved relevance of news stories. So, for example, in a story relating to a review of criminal justice we found that both public service and commercial television programmes did not accurately state its relevance to England and Wales only. On the BBC’s <italic>News at Six</italic>, the news presenter stated:
<disp-quote>
<p>The Justice Secretary, Jack Straw, has announced a review of the way the police use cautions and out-of-court fines. A BBC <italic>Panorama</italic> investigation to be broadcast this evening found such penalties being used to deal with some violent offences. Mr. Straw said that guidance was clear, but that the review would examine how it was applied. (BBC <italic>News at Six</italic>, 9 November 2009)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Channel 4’s news in brief, likewise, announced:
<disp-quote>
<p>The way the police issue cautions and fixed-penalty notices is to be reviewed. The Justice Secretary, Jack Straw, said that the assessment would be carried out jointly with the Home Office. Up to 40,000 assaults are dealt with by a caution every year … (Channel 4 <italic>News</italic>, 9 November 2009)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In both examples, there is a lack of context about where this story applied. The ‘police’, on Channel 4, were mentioned in a general way while ‘40,000 assaults’ were referenced without explaining that this source referred to figures in England and Wales. At no point did television news make viewers aware that the measures were not relevant to Northern Ireland or, indeed, Scotland, since criminal justice is devolved to the Scottish Parliament and the police do not even use the cautions system. So, while our figures suggest the BBC has made substantial progress since 2007 – in marked contrast to commercial bulletins – this remains a blind spot for UK broadcasters.</p>
<p>Another notable finding in the 2007 study was the failure of journalists to use opportunities to compare and contrast policies between the four nations. Indeed, in 2007 we found only a few comparisons made in passing and no instances where substantive comparisons between policies or approaches in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland were made. As a consequence, one of the BBC Trust’s key recommendations was to encourage BBC reporters to compare policies and powers across the four nations. As the four nations increasingly pursue different policies on health and education, in particular, a compare and contrast approach to reporting policies could potentially be informative and relevant to UK audiences. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1464884911431536">Table 5</xref> records all those instances where either substantive or passing comparisons were made in 2009, with 2007 figures in brackets.</p>

<p>As we can see, while the numbers remain low, BBC news programmes have begun to make substantive comparisons between devolved nations. The number of comparisons made in passing also increased markedly on BBC news programmes, from eight to 39. This contrasts sharply with the record of commercial news programmes. Indeed, with the exception of Channel 4, where the number of passing comparisons doubled, ITV and Sky News did not include any substantive <italic>or</italic> passing comparisons. There appears, in other words, to be a far more concerted effort by the BBC to take a compare and contrast approach of the four nations in political reporting.</p>
<p>So, for example, a number of BBC television news bulletins featured an education story about proposals in England to move to a more play-based infant curriculum. The story was illuminated by interviewing a teacher in Wales, pointing out that such a curriculum had already been introduced there.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>In Wales and Northern Ireland, although children can start school from the age of 4, in line with the rest of the UK, formal learning is put off until children are 7, with the emphasis, instead, on play. (BBC <italic>News at One</italic>, 16 October 2009)</p>
<p>Children do start school in the UK at a younger age than in many other countries, but the more important issue for the review is when the switch takes place from play-based learning, to a more formal, structured curriculum. In England and Scotland, the curriculum starts at 5, whereas in Wales and Northern Ireland, the emphasis on learning through play continues right through, until children are 7. (BBC <italic>News at Six</italic>, 16 October 2009)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In both reports, the story was introduced with reference to schools in England, but other devolved nations (most notably Wales and Northern Ireland) are used to compare the various nations’ education policies and explain how parts of the UK already pursue the recommendations of the review. Sky News’ coverage, by contrast, not only failed to make comparisons between the four nations but gave the impression that the story applied across the UK:
<disp-quote>
<p>Now, the Schools Minister has rejected proposals for children to start school a year later, at the age of 6. The recommendation was made in the most comprehensive review of primary education for 40 years, but Vernon Coaker said the plans were ‘counterproductive’. (Sky News, 16 October 2009)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Sky, in the course of their report, did not inform viewers that the review relates to English schools <italic>only</italic> or that two of the devolved nations already pursue the rejected policy. In addition, Sky used the words ‘England’ and ‘the UK’ interchangeably, potentially misleading viewers that the policy was relevant to all four nations.</p>

<title>Challenging ‘light touch’ orthodoxy: Towards more evidence-driven interventionist regulation</title>
<p>It would be hard, on the evidence presented in this article, to argue that our findings reflect a radical transformation in the BBC’s coverage of post-devolution politics in the UK. There remain ongoing challenges, such as the London-centric<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1464884911431536">7</xref></sup> nature of much UK television news coverage which we have discussed elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1464884911431536">Cushion et al., 2009</xref>). Nor would we claim that, on the strength of one case study, an interventionist strategy is the exclusive means by which journalism can be improved. Nonetheless, our content analysis does suggest clear and, in some cases, striking improvements after the BBC Trust’s recommendations, with coverage that better reflects the new realities of devolved politics across the UK.</p>
<p>Our case study can thus be seen to challenge claims that a ‘light touch’ approach is the most effective means of policing the media market in an increasingly deregulated environment. We have shown how a regulator with a public mandate for intervention can help reshape an area of journalism where coverage has lagged behind the realities of political developments in the UK. Far from regulation being a democratic obstruction on journalistic freedom, this regulatory intervention demonstrated the impact it can have on improving the accuracy of political reporting and addressing UK network failures in covering the four nations. On a range of different measures, we found that this intervention made a difference, reshaping the news agenda of BBC news in order that programming more accurately reflect the UK nations and its newly devolved political institutions.</p>
<p>By contrast, for commercial broadcasters (with the exception of Channel 4 in some measures) there was little evidence of any enhanced coverage of the nations or in explaining the relevance of policy when it might apply only to a particular nation (primarily, England). Indeed, our data suggest that the channel that performed least well – Sky News – is also the one most clearly outside a public service ethos. As we discussed previously, while Channel 4 and ITV are commercial broadcasters operating under public service licences, Sky News carries no meaningful obligations in how it delivers television news other than adhering to ‘due impartiality’ guidelines. Put another way, of the three organisations regulated by the ‘light touch’ Ofcom, the channel with the ‘lightest’ regulatory baggage – Sky News – was the least committed to covering the nations beyond England or in accurately conveying the complexity of devolved politics. This would suggest that Ofcom’s ‘bias against intervention’ and favoured self- or co-regulatory approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1464884911431536">Ofcom, 2008</xref>) is not as effective in encouraging a more balanced UK news agenda or in raising levels of accuracy in political journalism as the BBC Trust’s interventionist model.</p>
<p>This is not to imply that Ofcom has been ignorant about the programming schedules of different channels nor that the regulator has idly sat back unconcerned about what is broadcast. Since the quango was established in 2003, it has published many detailed reviews and reports into the routine output of television, intricately measuring the type of public service programming pursued by different channels over many years. Indeed, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1464884911431536">Tunstall’s (2010</xref>: 156) view, in ‘the Ofcom era, PSB has been quantified’. But while Ofcom has developed a more evidence-based approach to monitoring media content, unlike the BBC Trust it does not possess the interventionist instinct or the necessary powers to advise commercial broadcasters about the quality of content. Of course, regulation cannot always be easily quantified. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1464884911431536">Livingstone et al. (2007)</xref> have observed, Ofcom’s attempt to act in the ‘public interest’ has been hampered by the lack of agreement about how the ‘public’ are defined or the ‘interests’ that should be pursued. Evidence-driven regulation, in other words, is not as easy to put into practice when there are no precise measures that can be used and interpreted to observe the boundaries of ‘public interest’. While not wanting to simplify the complexity of different types of media regulation, we have argued that it is possible to develop evidence-based interventions that can enhance the quality of journalism.</p>
<p>We have suggested, in more detail, various journalistic methods to more effectively communicate devolved issues in UK-wide news bulletins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1464884911431536">Cushion et al., 2009</xref>). We now want to address the broader international relevance of regulatory intervention into public service broadcasting and the impact media scholarship can have on informing journalistic practice. In an increasingly crowded and competitive media market-place, ‘PSBs have to legitimise their existence, both in terms of positive and explicit political and cultural purposes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1464884911431536">Bardoel and D’Haenens, 2008</xref>: 351). For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1464884911431536">Jacka (2003)</xref>, arguments legitimising public service broadcasting have often been well intentioned but largely impotent. Abstract terms – citizenship, the public sphere, democracy – have been invoked, she suggests, without supporting evidence to measure the impact of what public service broadcasting can achieve. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1464884911431536">Jacka (2003</xref>: 188) writes, ‘we need to provide very situated microanalyses of our “public broadcasters” within their particular media and not endlessly regurgitate tired and superseded general arguments about PSB’s natural superiority’. In this respect, our findings demonstrate very specific instances where public service broadcasting fulfils a clear and important democratic role compared to the market that has often pushed this area of journalism to the sidelines.</p>
<p>We need only look at the broadcasting ecology of the US where a deregulated approach to media policy making has meant areas of news – in politics, business, and social policy – have been largely neglected by commercial news outlets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1464884911431536">McChesney, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1464884911431536">Patterson, 2000</xref>). Indeed, as access to the BBC’s digital channels and its online presence has grown easier, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1464884911431536">Bicket and Wall (2009)</xref> suggest that it has become a key transnational public broadcaster in the US. Without the infrastructure, financial resources or political will to credibly fund a public broadcaster, they argue ‘the role of the BBC has begun to resemble that of a domestic US alternative news source’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1464884911431536">2009</xref>: 378).</p>
<p>The impact of a more pervasive public service culture beyond that of the UK has been well illustrated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1464884911431536">Curran et al. (2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1464884911431536">2010</xref>), who use public knowledge studies comparing nations with public service driven television (e.g. Denmark and Finland), dual systems (e.g. UK) of commercial and public news and more market driven models (e.g. US). After controlling for variables such as civic education and economic inequalities, they found knowledge about current affairs increased in nations with a more publicly funded infrastructure of news media. They conclude by arguing that ‘continued deregulation of the broadcast media is likely, on balance, to lower levels of public knowledge’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1464884911431536">Curran et al., 2009</xref>: 22). Our findings clearly support this view, demonstrating how the failure to regulate provides a more permissive environment for misleading (or sloppy) political coverage.</p>
<p>In our view, not only do we need to counter the view that deregulation can help maintain or promote the quality of journalism, we need also to enhance the role of independent media regulators. Since this challenges the deregulatory impulse of most contemporary media policy making, regulators must tread carefully in how they evaluate media content and make interventions into editorial decision-making. We agree with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1464884911431536">Heap (2005)</xref> that strategic interventions must be carefully targeted and evidence based. This is best achieved, we would argue, independently of public broadcasters themselves and, further still, the body that regulates its content. While media and communication departments have sometimes had a mixed relationship with the journalism industry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1464884911431536">Cushion, 2011</xref>), media scholars have, we would suggest, an important role to play in unpacking <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1464884911431536">Jacka’s (2003)</xref> call for more microanalyses of public service media content.</p>
<p>Since journalism studies has expanded rapidly over the previous decade with more publishers interested in book-length endeavours, more dedicated journalism journals arriving on the scene, and more established scholarly networks emerging, it should be possible to draw on this rich tapestry of research from around the world to develop more evidence-based interventions into ‘best-practice’ news reporting. By establishing more formal links between regulators and scholars, journalism studies internationally could be well placed to monitor and enhance the quality of news coverage.</p>
<p>In doing so, public interventions can be justified on the basis of robust communication research. After all, while commercial broadcasters sometimes complain of needless regulation or generous public subsidies, a more open, independent and evidenced-based approach to identifying specific areas of market failure would be difficult to argue against. Indeed, working collaboratively with academics to review and recommend ‘best-practice’ news reporting, our case study of the BBC Trust’s review of the four nations and devolved politics coverage demonstrates that an evidence-based approach to media policy-making can have an impact on the quality of journalism available to mainstream audiences.</p>

<p>While the BBC Trust is labeled a regulator in this study, it is not a conventional one. According to former BBC Trust chairman, Sir Michael Lyons, the BBC Trust is “Not a traditional regulator… but with significant powers and the resources to challenge BBC management and to shape the BBC on behalf of the public who own it.” While the Trust’s powers are not regulatory in the bureaucratic, legal sense, they have a very real influence on BBC policy</p>
