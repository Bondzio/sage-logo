<p>The transradial approach (TRA) is commonly applied for coronary catheterization. However, there are few reports on the safety and feasibility of transradial catheterization in patients with prior coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. We retrospectively evaluated 124 consecutive patients who underwent graft angiography and intervention via the transradial (TRA group, n = 68) or transfemoral approach (TFA group, n = 56). The baseline clinical characteristics between the 2 groups were similar except for prior myocardial infarction. No significant difference (<italic>P</italic> &gt; .05)was observed in procedure time, the success rate of puncture, angiography, and intervention procedure between the 2 groups. There was no significant difference in major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events during hospitalization. However, the vascular access site complications were significantly lower (<italic>P</italic> = .021) and the duration of hospitalization was shorter (<italic>P</italic> = .007) in the TRA group. The TRA for coronary bypass graft angiography and intervention was safe and feasible.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Currently, the transradial approach (TRA) for coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has progressively gained popularity. Transradial approach was introduced by Campeau<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0003319711408863">1</xref></sup> in 1989 for diagnostic coronary angiography and by Kiemeneij and Laarman<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0003319711408863">2</xref></sup> in 1993 for intervention. Compared with the transfemoral approach (TFA), the TRA offers such advantages as significantly less bleeding complications at the vascular access site and patient comfort. Patients may ambulate early following the procedure. They are typically discharged earlier and have a shorter period of hospitalization. Transradial approach is becoming the default technique for diagnostic angiography and PCI, instead of being reserved for patients at high risk of bleeding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0003319711408863">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0003319711408863"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0003319711408863">5</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>However, there are few reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0003319711408863">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0003319711408863"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0003319711408863">8</xref></sup> on the safety and feasibility of TRA for angiography and intervention post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). Among patients undergoing percutaneous coronary angiography and interventions, those post CABG represent a high-risk subgroup and usually have atherosclerosis, diffusely diseased aortic wall, and complex lesions. Selective coronary graft catheterization post CABG is challenging and traditionally performed via the femoral artery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0003319711408863">9</xref></sup> We performed a retrospective study to compare the safety and feasibility of transradial angiography in grafts with or without intervention versus the femoral approach.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-0003319711408863">
<title>Study Population</title>
<p>From August 2008 to February 2009, 124 consecutive patients who underwent coronary angiography (with or without intervention) of saphenous vein graft (SVG) and/or internal mammary artery (IMA) graft were considered eligible for this study. Patients with cardiogenic shock, bilateral IMA grafts, radial artery, or gastroepiploic graft were excluded from the study.</p>
<p>All operators were familiar with the TRA and TFA procedures and performed more than 100 PCIs/year. The decisions for the approach and stenting techniques were made according to the operator’s discretion.</p>
<p>Baseline demographic data, clinical and procedural characteristics, and procedural complications during hospitalization were recorded.</p>
<p>Written informed consent of the catheterization was obtained from every patient prior to the procedure. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Anzhen Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0003319711408863">
<title>Antiplatelet and Anticoagulant Treatment</title>
<p>All patients received aspirin 300 mg daily prior to the procedure. In addition, a 300-mg (6 hours prior to the index procedure) or 600-mg (2 hours prior to the index procedure) loading dose of clopidogrel was administered and then followed by 75 mg/d. After insertion of the radial or femoral artery sheath, a bolus of unfractionated heparin (70 IU/kg) was administered to achieve an activated clotting time of 250 to 300 seconds. If the target value was not achieved after a bolus of heparin, an additional bolus (2000-5000 IU) was given during the procedure. The administration of glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa inhibitors was at the operator’s discretion. After the PCI procedure, an aspirin dose of 300 mg daily was prescribed for 1 to 3 months, followed by 100 mg/d lifelong. At the same time, clopidogrel 75 mg daily was also prescribed for at least 1 year following the implantation of a drug-eluting stent. In patients without PCI, aspirin was prescribed at a dose of 100 mg daily for life.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0003319711408863">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Allen's test was performed routinely prior to transradial procedure in all patients for evaluation of collateral circulation in the hand. Patients with hand blushing within 10 seconds or less were considered candidates for TRA. The “reverse” Allen's test<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0003319711408863">9</xref></sup> was also performed before the procedure and the patients with negative “reverse” Allen's test were excluded from the TRA group. When a delayed response to the “reverse” Allen's test occurred, Doppler ultrasound was advisable to assess the patency of the forearm vessels.</p>
<p>The right or left arm was positioned in abduction and the wrist hyperextended. After local subcutaneous anesthesia with 2% lidocaine, the radial artery was punctured using Seldinger technique with a 20-gauge angiocatheter needle (Terumo Co., Japan), and a 0.635 mm straight tip guidewire was inserted. The needle was then removed. A 16-cm 6F transradial sheath (Terumo Co.) was inserted and the wire removed. A total of 200 μg verapamil was administered through the sheath to prevent arterial vasospasm.</p>
<p>For transfemoral PCI, the femoral artery was punctured with an 18-gauge arterial needle after local anesthesia with 2% lidocaine and a 0.889-mm guidewire was inserted. Upon removal of the needle, a 6F arterial sheath was placed over the guidewire.</p>
<p>If the radial or femoral artery was not palpable or puncture failure occurred, the first choice was a contralateral approach and the second choice was crossover between the radial and femoral approaches.</p>
<p>In all patients, diagnostic angiography of the native coronary artery was performed using 5F Multipurpose catheters (Cordis Co. Miami, Florida, USA). Percutaneous coronary intervention of the native coronary artery was performed using 6F or 7F guiding catheters. Venous graft angiography was performed using Amplatz right or left catheters after native coronary angiography. Internal mammary artery angiography was performed using a Judkins right or left 4.0 catheter or Amplatz catheter, IMA curves catheter when appropriate. The type and size of guidewires, balloon catheters, and stents were selected according to the type and feature of the target lesions with the interventional cardiologists' discretion.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0003319711408863">
<title>Hemostasis</title>
<p>In the TRA group, the arterial access sheath was removed immediately after the procedure, and hemostasis over the puncture site was achieved by radial compression with TR-Band (Terumo Co.) or adhesive bandage for 4 to 6 hours. In the TFA group, the arterial access sheath was removed immediately after the application of vascular closure device. Without the application of vascular closure device, the arterial access sheath was removed 4 to 6 hours after the procedure. Then hemostasis was achieved by manual compression for 20 to 30 minutes followed by a pressure bandage for 8 to 12 hours. Two types of closure devices are used in our institute: Angio-Seal vascular closure device (St. Jude Medical, St. Paul, Minnesota, USA) and Perclose (Abbott Vascular Devices, California). The application of the closure device was chosen by the interventionalist. The contraindications of the closure devices were defined according to the femoral arteriogram via the arterial sheath: the access site was at or below the femoral bifurcation; the diameter of the femoral artery was &lt;5 mm; severe calcification or plaque formation was present in the femoral artery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0003319711408863">10</xref></sup> In general, the band was slowly loosened and the compression pressure was gradually decreased. The pulses of the radial artery and the femoral artery need to be confirmed by repeated measures. Patients were allowed to ambulate immediately after radial sheath removal and 24 hours after femoral sheath removal unless indicated otherwise by the attending cardiologist.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0003319711408863">
<title>Study End Points and Definitions</title>
<p>Primary end point was defined as the occurrence of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCEs), including death, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), repeat target vessel revascularization (TVR), transient ischemic attack, or stroke during hospitalization. The secondary safety end point was major or minor bleeding complications in hospital.</p>
<p>Myocardial infarction was defined as either the development of new pathologic Q waves in at least 2 contiguous leads or, in the absence of pathologic Q waves, an elevation in creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) 5 times the upper limit of normal. Transient ischemic attack was defined as a sudden focal loss of neurological function with complete recovery usually within 24 hours, while stroke was defined as an ischemic cerebral infarction caused by an embolic or thrombotic occlusion of a major intracranial artery. Target vessel revascularization was defined as a reintervention or CABG driven by any lesion located in the target vessel. The indication for repeat revascularization was based on anginal symptoms and a significant angiographic stenosis (&gt;50% stenosis).</p>
<p>Vascular access site complications were assessed postprocedure including minor bleeding, major bleeding, large hematoma (&gt;5 cm), pseudoaneurysm, arteriovenous fistula, neurologic deficit, and artery occlusion. According to the Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) criteria,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0003319711408863">11</xref></sup> major bleeding was defined as a hemoglobin drop &gt;5 g/dL (with or without an identified site) or intracranial hemorrhage or cardiac tamponade. Minor bleeding was defined as any clinically overt sign of bleeding associated with a hemoglobin drop &gt;3 g/dL but ≤5 g/dL or spontaneous gross hematuria, hemoptysis, or hematemesis. Artery occlusion was regularly examined by palpation and ultrasonographic assessment in all postprocedure patients.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0003319711408863">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS 16.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois). Continuous variables were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Categorical variables were reported as percentages. Continuous data were analyzed using the <italic>t</italic> test. Categorical data were analyzed using the chi-square test or the Fisher's exact test, as appropriate. A <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05 was considered significant.</p>

<title>Baseline Clinical Characteristics</title>
<p>A total of 124 patients with prior CABG surgery who underwent graft angiography with or without intervention were enrolled in our study. Of these, 68 patients underwent the TRA (TRA group) and 56 patients the TFA (TFA group). The baseline clinical characteristics are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0003319711408863">Table1</xref>. The age and gender were not significantly different between the 2 groups. Both groups were high-risk populations in coronary artery disease. They had a variety of comorbid conditions, such as higher body mass index (BMI), history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, current or prior smoking, prior MI or prior PCI, prior stroke, and so on. There were 57 patients (83.8%) in the TRA group with SVG and 46 (82.1%) in the TFA group (<italic>P</italic> = .804). In addition, there are 58 patients (85.3%) in TRA group with IMA graft and 47 patients (83.9%) in the TFA group (<italic>P</italic> = .834). No statistical difference in risk factors was noted between the 2 groups, except for a higher prevalence of prior MI in the TRA group (55.9% vs 37.5%; <italic>P</italic> = .041). No significant difference was observed between the 2 groups in the indications for graft procedures. Unstable angina was the most common clinical presentation in both groups (TRA vs TFA: 73.5% vs 60.7%, <italic>P</italic> = .129).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present study showed that transradial graft angiography with or without intervention may be safely performed in patients with previous CABG surgery, using the SVG or the unilateral IMA. The success rate of puncture, angiography, and intervention was high and similar with either TRA or TFA. However, the incidence rate of the vascular access site complications during hospitalization was significantly lower in the TRA group than that in the TFA group. No statistical difference in the MACCE rate between the 2 groups was observed. Moreover, the length of hospital stay was shorter in the TRA group compared with that of the TFA group.</p>
<p>Lower occurrence of access site bleeding complications, similar procedure and fluoroscopy time were reported for the transradial route compared with the transfemoral percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0003319711408863">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0003319711408863">13</xref></sup> Among these studies, few patients with SVG and/or IMA were recruited, although the radial artery has almost become the main access for coronary angiography and intervention.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0003319711408863">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0003319711408863"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0003319711408863"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0003319711408863">17</xref></sup> Some recent observational studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0003319711408863">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0003319711408863">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0003319711408863">17</xref></sup> confirmed that similar procedural success rate and procedural time were observed in patients with previous CABG via either the TRA or TFA.</p>
<p>Our study indicated a similar success rate of puncture, angiography, and intervention through radial or femoral approach. All the operators in our study were experienced interventional cardiologists with long exposure and clinical practice of the TRA. There was just 1 patient crossover from the TRA to TFA group. Such low incidence was in accordance with Guédès' study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0003319711408863">18</xref></sup> The leading causes of conversion to the femoral artery were radial artery spasm and subclavian artery tortuosity resulting in difficulty to insert the catheter.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0003319711408863">17</xref></sup> We confirmed that the incidence of vascular access site complications was significantly lower in the TRA group than for the TFA group, which was similar to other previous studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0003319711408863">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0003319711408863">20</xref></sup> Mann et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0003319711408863">21</xref></sup> stated that although femoral artery closure devices could decrease the incidence of bleeding complications to some extent after the procedure, the incidence was higher than that via TRA. Nonetheless, we should try our best to protect the radial artery during the procedure because the radial artery catheterization may destroy the integrity of the radial artery luminal wall and render it an inappropriate conduit for future CABG or radiocephalic arteriovenous fistula.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0003319711408863">22</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>The transradial procedure offers the advantage of maintaining hemostasis with ease after the procedure because the radial artery is superficial and easy to compress, allowing an immediate removal of the artery sheath. The incidence of the radial artery occlusion was very low in our observation and similar to those in previous studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0003319711408863">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0003319711408863">23</xref></sup> The higher rate of vascular access site complications is often further augmented by aggressive antiplatelet and/or anticoagulant therapy, inevitably resulting in the longer hospital stay, nursing burden, and higher cost. Rinfret et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0003319711408863">24</xref></sup> reported the economical impact of same-day home discharge after uncomplicated transradial PCI. Slagboom et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0003319711408863">25</xref></sup> confirmed the feasibility and safety of outpatient coronary angioplasty.</p>
<p>In our study, the choice of approach (TRA or TRF, right or left) to perform the procedure was at the operator’s discretion. Several studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0003319711408863">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0003319711408863">9</xref></sup> suggested that the approach should be chosen according to the clinical situation. Homolateral TRA facilitated the catheterization of an IMA graft compared with the TFA.</p>
<p>The technique of the transradial procedure on IMA in contralateral approach has some challenges because the catheter deeply cannulated into contralateral subclavian artery has to overcome multiple angulations and the high frictions without adequate support.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0003319711408863">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0003319711408863">26</xref></sup> Valsecchi and Vassileva<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0003319711408863">20</xref></sup> found that selective angiography of left IMA grafts via right TRA was safe and feasible. Similarly, Cha et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0003319711408863">27</xref></sup> showed that nonselective left IMA graft angiography could be safely performed via right radial artery using a 5F Judkins catheter. As for SVG cannulation, the left radial approach was better than the right radial approach.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0003319711408863">27</xref></sup> However, Lee et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0003319711408863">17</xref></sup> suggested that the angiography of the SVG and/or IMA graft could be successfully performed via the right radial artery in most patients without severe subclavian tortuosity.</p>
<p>The SVG and/or unilateral IMA are the most frequently used as the graft conduit for surgical revascularization, whereas bilateral IMAs, the radial, and the right gastroepiploic artery are not usually applied in our clinical practice. It seems that femoral approach is the optimal choice among these cases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0003319711408863">9</xref></sup> Therefore, all these 3 types of patients were excluded in our study.</p>

<sec id="section14-0003319711408863">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>First, this is a nonrandomized and retrospective study. The assignment of either TRA or TRF was not based on randomization scheme but on the discretion of interventional cardiologists. Second, different vascular closure devices were applied to access sites and device selection was not randomized. This may affect vascular access site complications. Lastly, the patients were all from a single hospital. The number of enrolled patients was relatively small with possible selection bias. Nevertheless, our data demonstrate that the angiography and PCI of grafts may be safely and successfully performed via the radial artery.</p>

<sec id="section15-0003319711408863">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The present study suggests that the TRA could be used as an access of angiography and intervention for most of the post CABG patients, with lower incidence of vascular access site complications and shorter length of hospital stay compared with the TFA.</p>
