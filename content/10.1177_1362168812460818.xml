<abstract>
<p>Although a number of studies have investigated classroom-based peer interaction with adults and high school students, research pertaining to children in the elementary grades is scant. Drawing on sociocultural theory, the present study investigated how children in an intensive elementary level Grade 6 class for English as a second language (ESL) scaffolded each other while carrying out cooperative learning tasks. Interactions for two teams were analysed. As in the case of older learners, children were shown to be capable of engaging in linguistically oriented scaffolding. Although a variety of scaffolding strategies were in evidence, the two most frequently used pertained to request for assistance and other-correction. As in the Foster and Ohta (2005) study, the present analysis suggests that the strategies typically associated with negotiation of meaning within an interactionist perspective were rarely used. To explain how the children were orienting to the tasks, the importance of the classroom culture and the structure of the cooperative learning tasks were evoked.</p>

<title>I Introduction</title>
<p>Since the advent of the communicative approach, pair and group work have been widely advocated as a means of enabling students in large language classes to get more time to practise the target language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1362168812460818">Long &amp; Porter, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1362168812460818">Pica, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1362168812460818">Pica, Lincoln-Porter, Paninos, &amp; Linnell, 1996</xref>). Although considerable research on peer interaction has been conducted, much of it, especially during the 1980s and 1990s, has been carried out in laboratory contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1362168812460818">Foster, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1362168812460818">Gass, Mackey, &amp; Ross-Feldman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1362168812460818">Pica, 1994</xref>). More recently, however, an increasing number of studies have attempted to investigate peer interaction in classroom settings. To date, as will be discussed below, most of these studies have involved adult learners or high school students; research pertaining to children remains scant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1362168812460818">Mackey &amp; Oliver, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1362168812460818">Pinter, 2007</xref>). To contribute to this latter area, the present study, drawing on sociocultural theory, aims to investigate how children in an intensive elementary level class for English as a second language (ESL) scaffolded each other while carrying out cooperative learning (CL) tasks. Prior to discussing the methodology and the results, we will review the relevant research related to peer-peer interaction in classroom contexts.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1362168812460818">
<title>II Classroom-based research involving peer-peer interaction in pair and group work</title>
<p>With respect to the nature of peer–peer interaction, one line of research has focused on investigating whether the strategies generally associated with negotiation of meaning studies conducted in laboratory settings also pertain to classroom settings. In this regard, a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1362168812460818">Foster (1998)</xref> which involved adult ESL learners engaged in pair and group work revealed that her students rarely resorted to such strategies. To explain the results, Foster maintained that, as in ordinary social interaction between native speakers, the L2 learners appeared not to be correcting each other so as to avoid a threat to face. In a study conducted in 2005, Foster and Ohta further demonstrated that the social interactive processes that may lead to language development are broader than those typically suggested in the interactionist literature. Although in their study the strategies often associated with negotiation of meaning (i.e. comprehension checks, confirmation checks and clarification checks) were rarely used, learners provided scaffolding and assisted each other through the use of other strategies, of which co-construction, other-correction, and continuers. In other words, as the researchers note ‘Interactional processes including negotiation for meaning and various kinds of peer assistance and repair are among the many ways learners gain access to the language being learned’ (p. 426).</p>
<p>Another line of classroom-based research has attempted to show how the scaffolding engaged in during peer–peer interaction is related to language learning. Thus, for example, an early study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1362168812460818">Donato (1994)</xref> focused on the interaction arising in a group of three university French second language students. Tracing the moment-by-moment co-construction of selected utterances, his study provided a microgenetic analysis of how the group collaborated in order to collectively resolve language related problems during the preparation of a dialog. The study also showed that the items focused on during the group work were appropriated by students and reused in a follow-up presentation. Other studies that have variously shown links between scaffolding and learning include <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1362168812460818">Garcia Mayo (2002)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1362168812460818">Nassaji and Tian (2010)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1362168812460818">Storch (2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1362168812460818">2007)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1362168812460818">Swain and Lapkin (2001)</xref>. Of the studies that have involved peer–peer interaction and the role of scaffolding, a few have attempted to explore how type of task might influence the degree of scaffolding episodes and possible appropriation of the items focused on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1362168812460818">Garcia Mayo, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1362168812460818">Nassaji &amp; Tian, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1362168812460818">Swain &amp; Lapkin, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition, however, to studies that have highlighted how peers positively scaffold each other, others – as in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1362168812460818">Foster (1998)</xref> study referred to above – provide examples of classrooms where such is not necessarily the case. A study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1362168812460818">Aline and Hosoda (2009)</xref>, conducted in a Japanese university setting, revealed that peers rarely provided linguistic support or corrected others in their groups. As in certain other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1362168812460818">Foster, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1362168812460818">Foster &amp; Ohta, 2005</xref>), the researchers evoked the notion of face, maintaining that the upper-intermediate learners of their study were aligning with native speakers where such interventions are deemed as face-threatening and thus avoided. In other instances, pairs/groups within the same classroom have been shown to differentially engage in linguistic scaffolding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1362168812460818">Storch, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1362168812460818">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1362168812460818">Swain &amp; Lapkin, 1998</xref>). Those researchers working in a sociocultural perspective tend to explain such differences in terms of the way the learners are orienting to the task at hand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1362168812460818">Coughlin &amp; Duff, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1362168812460818">Donato, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1362168812460818">Ohta, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1362168812460818">Storch, 2002</xref>). In a school context, certain researchers have specifically discussed how the orientation to a task in terms of whether it is perceived as an opportunity to learn the second language or simply to complete it may impact the type of strategies used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1362168812460818">Gillette, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1362168812460818">Matthey, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1362168812460818">Parks, Huot, Hamers, &amp; Lemonnier, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>It is of note that all of the above studies have specifically involved adults or high school students. With respect to children in elementary school, one of the few studies to focus on peer–peer interaction is that by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1362168812460818">Pinter (2007)</xref>. Pinter’s study involved two 10-year-old children in a beginner level ESL class in Hungary. At the time the study was carried out, the author queried whether children of this age would be capable of productively engaging in communicative tasks. This was especially the case as the children’s proficiency level was at a beginner level and the teaching students had been exposed to emphasized grammar, rehearsal of set dialogues and memorization through rote learning. Despite these constraints, analysis of the data obtained for three spot-the-difference tasks provided evidence of peer assistance, including corrective feedback. Noting the limitations of her study, Pinter concludes: ‘Research with different tasks, more learners in different contexts and of different age groups would be essential to begin to build up a picture about the processes that occur in children’s peer–peer interactions in language tasks’ (p. 203). A study by Guk and Kellogg (2011) involving fifth grade students in Korea further suggests that the way a teacher might provide scaffolding during one-on-one interaction with a student differs from how students provide scaffolding to each other in group work. In this particular study, the teacher first demonstrated how to carry out a task with one student who then had to return to a small group and show his peers how to proceed. In contrast to peer–peer interaction, the teacher gave more attention to helping students learn the targeted structure through such strategies as leading questions / initiating a solution or demonstrating a solution (asymmetrical scaffolding). By contrast, peer–peer interaction was reflective of symmetrical collaborative dialogue where the emphasis was on participation and discourse co-construction rather than the appropriation of accurate forms. A study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1362168812460818">Mattar and Blondin (2006)</xref> investigated the use of CL tasks by two Grade 2 immersion classes in Belgium, one for Dutch and the other for German. Although the study demonstrated that students of this age were capable of collaborating to complete the targeted tasks, the study did not analyse the interaction in terms of scaffolding. More generally, researchers involved in research on children have pointed out the need to pay closer attention as to how contextual factors might be implicated in peer interaction as well as be cautious about applying the results from studies involving adults to children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1362168812460818">Ellis &amp; Heimbach, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1362168812460818">Mackey &amp; Oliver, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1362168812460818">Mackey, Oliver, &amp; Leeman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1362168812460818">Oliver, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1362168812460818">Oliver, 2002</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section3-1362168812460818">
<title>III Context for the study: The ESL class</title>
<p>Within the province of Quebec, English is an obligatory subject in the Francophone school system. Although most students are involved in regular core ESL classes, some schools have intensive programs (for more information, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1362168812460818">Lightbown &amp; Spada, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1362168812460818">White &amp; Turner, 2005</xref>). The present study focused on an intact class of 29 Grade 6 students (10–11 years of age) enrolled in an intensive ESL program that took place during the second half of the school year from mid-January to the end of June 2008. The program involved a minimum of 300 hours of English compared to the 30 hours of the regular core program. All students in the intensive program had been previously involved in the regular core program since Grade 3 and had had little exposure to English outside the school system. Essentially, the students started off the program with beginner-level English. To be selected for the program, the students had to fulfil four main requirements:</p>
<list id="list1-1362168812460818" list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>be motivated to learn English;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>have good behaviour;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>have good academic results, especially in French and Math;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>not be bilingual.</p></list-item></list>
<p>At the time of the study, the teacher, Mrs. R., had 25 years of teaching experience, including eight teaching ESL in the regular and four in the intensive program of this school. Mrs. R. generally used a student-centered approach and oral communication was predominant in the classroom. Although she did not characterize herself as using a CL approach, on occasion she used certain activities associated with the CL repertoire, such as jigsaw, and roles such as the reporter or materials manager. For the purpose of this study, the teacher agreed to use CL activities in her class and felt that the research project was a good opportunity for her to try out new ones.</p>
<p>As the classroom was the only opportunity for the students to practice English, Mrs. R. emphasized the use of the target language. To underscore this, red tape on the floor just inside the classroom door signalled to students that they were entering the ‘English zone’, where English was obligatory. Signs and posters on the walls provided examples of functional language, including expressions intended to facilitate oral interaction such as: ‘How do you say X in English?’, ‘Can you repeat please?, ‘What did you say?’, ‘Can you speak slower please?’ Although Mrs. R. favoured teaching grammar in context, she also taught some grammar points more directly and had students do traditional grammar exercises. During classroom activities, she accorded a particular attention to correcting students’ errors of language or pronunciation using both explicit and implicit strategies to do so. In terms of in-class activities, Mrs. R. stated that 50% of her time was devoted to pair work, 30% to group work, and 20% to individual work (an estimate that includes the teacher-fronted activities involved in carrying them out).</p>

<title>IV Methodology</title>
<p>This section provides information about the CL tasks, participants, data collection procedures and data analysis.</p>
<sec id="section5-1362168812460818">
<title>1 CL tasks</title>
<p>For the purpose of this study, three different types of CL tasks that incorporated the principles of positive interdependency and individual accountability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1362168812460818">Johnson &amp; Johnson, 1994</xref>) were used. Positive interdependence refers to tasks that – via the way resources and roles are allocated – ensure that all team members are required to work together to achieve a common goal. Individual accountability ensures that all team members are held accountable for contribution to the completion of a task through assigned parts and/or as part of an individual evaluation. To ensure that the tasks were appropriate for the students involved in the study, they were developed and tried out with the group of intensive students Mrs. R. had had during the fall session. Following is a brief description of the types of CL tasks used in the study (for more information, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1362168812460818">Gagné, 2009</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section6-1362168812460818">
<title>a Numbered Heads Together</title>
<p>For the ‘Numbered Heads Together’ task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1362168812460818">Kagan, 1994</xref>), students in each team numbered off from one to four. Following the presentation of a poster with a scene drawn on it, team members put their heads together to tell each other what they saw in response to questions such as: <italic>What do you see on the poster? What are the people doing?</italic> The cue ‘heads together’ served as a signal for students to begin their team discussions. Once teams had shared, the teacher randomly called on a team and team member (e.g. team 4, student 1) to answer the previously identified questions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1362168812460818">
<title>b Jigsaw</title>
<p>Although jigsaw tasks can vary greatly, this study used a crossword puzzle jigsaw (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1362168812460818">Coelho, 1992</xref>). For this task, each team received one sheet with a crossword puzzle and four cards with different clues, one for each team member. After taking turns reading the clues for a given crossword puzzle item, team members tried to guess the answer. Students were not allowed to show their cues but had to ask for repetition and help each other understand as necessary; a dictionary could be used as a resource. One student was in charge of writing down the team’s answers on a crossword puzzle form. The three topics used for the jigsaw puzzles were animals, food and winter activities.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1362168812460818">
<title>c Round-robin/Round-table</title>
<p>For the Round-robin/Round-table task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1362168812460818">Kagan, 1994</xref>), team members had to describe a cartoon consisting of eight pictures, both orally and in writing. Each team member received two of the pictures on individual cards. The task was structured so that the student who had to describe a card was not the same as the one who had to write the sentence; the role of secretary was indicated on the answer sheet and each student performed this role twice. For each picture, students first placed the card on the table for all to see, said what they could, and got help from other team members as necessary. The team had to agree on what would be written on the answer sheet.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section9-1362168812460818">
<title>2 Participants</title>
<p>Although all students volunteered for the study, due to the logistics of videotaping it was decided to focus on two focal teams only. Consistent with recommendations for team formation within CL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1362168812460818">Johnson, Johnson, &amp; Holubec, 1994</xref>), heterogeneous teams were created based on the teacher’s evaluation of their proficiency in English: one high achiever, two average, and one low. Following this, a draw was conducted to randomly select the two teams that would be videotaped.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1362168812460818">
<title>3 Data collection procedures</title>
<p>For the purpose of this study, each team carried out nine CL tasks over a two-week period. More specifically there were three rounds with each round consisting of a Heads Together, Crossword Puzzle Jigsaw, and Round-robin/Round-table task. Each task took approximately 30 minutes to carry out. As discussed below, data were collected using three instruments: videotaped recordings of the CL tasks, classroom observation, and interviews.</p>
<sec id="section11-1362168812460818">
<title>a Videotaped recordings</title>
<p>To ensure high quality recordings, videotaping of the two focal teams was carried out using two professional Sony MiniDV digital camcorders with integrated sound and images, mounted on portable tripods. Two sets of four Sony digital clip-on microphones connected to a mixer were plugged into the cameras through a Beachtek transformer to help modulate the sound. The use of the cameras was essential in order to capture non-verbal behaviour related to task performance such as pointing at an item on a sheet of paper, searching in the dictionary, or nodding to indicate approval. Unfortunately, due to a technical problem, the data for one of the Heads Together tasks could not be analysed. Thus, for the purpose of analysis, the videotaped recordings of 8 CL tasks for each team (approximately 9 hours) were retained and subsequently transcribed. The data were collected toward the end of the students’ course (last two weeks in May). Using the video camera in class was not a problem as students were used to being videotaped in the context of other activities.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1362168812460818">
<title>b Observations</title>
<p>During the second week of the course, the first author, Nathalie Gagné, observed the class for three full days and took notes with respect to the classroom environment, interaction, and types of activities conducted by the teacher. It should also be noted, however, that she had spent several days observing the teacher and working with her to prepare the tasks for the study earlier in the school year when the teacher was working with her first group of intensive students.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1362168812460818">
<title>c Interviews</title>
<p>Two semi-structured interviews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1362168812460818">Patton, 2001</xref>) were conducted with the teacher previous to and following the data collection phase with the students. The objective of the first interview was to obtain information about the teacher’s background and her views with respect to the use of the target language, pair and group work, and CL. The second interview focused on her perception of her students’ interaction while they carried out the CL tasks. Both interviews were recorded and transcribed.</p>
<p>Although the videotaped recordings were essential for responding to the research questions, the observations and interviews were important to have a better understanding of the classroom culture. This information served two purposes: first, to provide a description of the context for the study and, second, to shed light on certain aspects of the results of the study (see Section VI).</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section14-1362168812460818">
<title>4 Data analysis</title>
<p>As defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1362168812460818">De Guerrero and Villamil (2000)</xref>, scaffolding is a ‘process by which tutors – parents, caretakers, teachers, or more expert partners – help someone less skilled solve a problem’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1362168812460818">De Guerrero &amp; Villamil, 2000</xref>, p. 52). More specifically in the case of the present study, scaffolding includes any process in which any other class participant (peer, teacher, researcher, or student teacher) assists to solve a problem; the word tutor is retained to refer to these participants. As a means of identifying units of analysis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1362168812460818">Swain and Lapkin’s (1998)</xref> definition of a language-related episode was resorted to: ‘Any part of a dialogue where the students talk about the language they are producing, question their language use, or correct themselves or others.’ As for this study we wished to highlight scaffolding by others, the latter definition was slightly modified to exclude instances of self-correction, thus: ‘Any part of a dialogue where the students talk about the language they are producing, question their language use, correct others or assist each other in expressing themselves’.</p>
<p>In order to categorize the types of scaffolding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1362168812460818">Miles &amp; Huberman, 1994</xref>), both authors repeatedly reviewed the scaffolding episodes in order to produce a taxonomy which fit the data at hand. Following agreement amongst the authors, the data were independently coded by a rater with a graduate degree in Applied Linguistics and a native speaker of English with fluent French. This rater agreed with 96% of the coded items. This iterative process resulted in nine different types of scaffolding strategies: request for assistance, comprehension check, co-construction, confirmation check, continuer, instructing, marking of critical features, other-correction, and use of resources. Definitions and examples taken from the transcripts for each type are provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-1362168812460818">Appendix 1</xref>. Transcription conventions, mainly based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1362168812460818">Jefferson (1984)</xref>, are provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table9-1362168812460818">Appendix 2</xref>.</p>
<p>In addition to analysing the types of scaffolding, the number of instances of successful attempts at scaffolding is also provided. ‘Successful’ is used to indicate that the scaffolding strategy initiated had a successful outcome (e.g. an error was corrected). Unsuccessful attempts refer to those instances where assistance by a more expert other was not forthcoming or the assistance provided was inadequate or involved language which was not correct (i.e. errors).</p>
<p>As defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1362168812460818">Lyster and Ranta (1997)</xref>, ‘uptake’ refers to ‘a student’s utterance that immediately follows the teacher’s feedback and that constitutes a reaction in some way to the teacher’s intention to draw attention to some aspect of the student’s initial utterance’. Since for this study we wished to focus more generally on whether any of the corrective feedback or assisted language production was picked up on and repeated by either the student who had had the original problem or another member of the team, the more general term ‘reuse’ was resorted to. Two types of reuse were identified: appropriate or inappropriate. ‘Appropriate reuse’ refers to language items that were lexically or grammatically correct. ‘Inappropriate reuse’ refers to those instances which involved the repeating of errors. As revealed by the analysis, more than one type of scaffolding strategy could be found within a given language-related episode. Thus, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1362168812460818">Figure 1</xref>, for example, for language-related episode 6, there were two attempts at scaffolding, one unsuccessful and the other successful. In addition to the qualitative analysis of the scaffolding discussed above, quantitative analyses (to be discussed in Section V) were also conducted in order to more fully assess the nature of the interaction taking place in the two groups of targeted students.</p>

<title>V Results</title>
<p>As previously noted, drawing on sociocultural theory, the present study aims to investigate how children in an intensive elementary level ESL class scaffolded each other while carrying out cooperative learning (CL) tasks. Analysis of the data (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1362168812460818">Table 1</xref>) revealed that during the carrying out of the CL tasks, a total of 217 scaffolding strategies were invoked. Of these, 204 (94%) involved interactions solely amongst students and 13 (6%) with tutors (teacher, student-teacher or researcher). Although the students resorted to a variety of strategies, the two most frequently used were request for assistance and other-correction (53.9% and 23.9%, respectively). Combined together these two strategies thus accounted for 77.8% of strategy use. The analysis also revealed that 73% of instances involving scaffolding were successful. Of these, 30% involved successful reuse (i.e. repetition of a correct response) by one or other of the team members; only 4 errors generated during the scaffolding episodes were picked up on and repeated.</p>

<p>In order to determine whether the two teams differed in their use of strategies, a Chi-square test was performed using Fisher’s Exact Test. As certain strategies (S2 and S7) had not been used by students or were used rarely (S3 and S5), the analysis was conducted using the five most frequently used strategies (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1362168812460818">Table 2</xref>).

<p>In order to determine whether there were any significant differences in the types of strategies used, an analysis of variance with ‘team’ as a block was used to compare the mean number of interventions between strategies. The Mixed procedure of the SAS was used with ‘team’ as a random factor. The square-root transformation was used to improve the normality and homogeneity assumptions. Pairwise comparisons were made using Protected Fisher least-significant difference. As reflected in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1362168812460818">Table 4</xref>, significant differences were found between learners’ use of strategy 1 (request for assistance) and strategy 8 (other-correction) as compared to all other strategies (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01, <italic>η</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.96). The large value of <italic>η</italic><sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1362168812460818">Table 5</xref>) provides further evidence that over 96% of the total variance is due to the differences between the learners’ use of these strategies. To determine whether there were differences in strategy use in regard to task type, a Chi-square test was performed using data from the combined teams. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1362168812460818">Table 6</xref>, the teams used approximately twice as many scaffolding strategies while carrying out the Round-robin/Round-table task compared to either the Heads Together or Jigsaw tasks. Results revealed that these differences were significant (<italic>χ</italic><sup>2</sup> = 31.5911 &gt; 10.83, 2 <italic>df, p</italic> &lt; 001).</p>

<title>VI Discussion</title>
<p>A number of studies have demonstrated that adults and high school students are capable of providing each other with scaffolding while carrying out tasks in pair and group work in classroom contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1362168812460818">Donato, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1362168812460818">Foster &amp; Ohta, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1362168812460818">Storch, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1362168812460818">Swain, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1362168812460818">Swain &amp; Lapkin, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1362168812460818">Villamil &amp; De Guerrero, 1996</xref>). The present study contributes to the limited literature in this area pertaining to if and how younger learners engage in linguistic scaffolding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1362168812460818">Pinter, 2007</xref>). As shown in Section V, although the ESL learners in the present study had recourse to a variety of scaffolding strategies while interacting with their peers, the two strategies most frequently resorted to were request for assistance and other-correction. Together, these two strategies accounted for 77.8% of the total number. As in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1362168812460818">Foster and Ohta (2005)</xref> study, the present analysis suggests that the strategies typically associated with negotiation of meaning within an interactionist perspective were rarely used. Specifically, in the present study confirmation checks were used in only 9% of instances whereas comprehension checks were never resorted to. It is also of note that confirmation checks as well as marking of critical features were the two strategies solely resorted to by tutors. Such strategies appear to be more reflective of those who in a teacher capacity have the language knowledge and view their role as teachers in terms of their ability to maximize opportunities for second language learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1362168812460818">Matthey, 1996</xref>). The finding further lends support to Guk and Kellogg’s (2011) contention that teacher–peer scaffolding differs from peer–peer scaffolding.</p>
<p>In contrast to Guk and Kellogg (2011) where the fifth graders seemed more focused on task completion, the students in this study appeared to be viewing the task as an opportunity for language learning insofar as they were actively involved in scaffolding each other’s language production and fairly successful at resolving their problems. In terms of explaining the way these students were orienting to the task, a first point of note pertains to the classroom culture and how the teacher perceived her role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1362168812460818">Parks et al., 2005</xref>). As reflected in the interviews, the teacher maintained that group work was crucial to encouraging all students to first help each other linguistically and, second, to contribute to the completion of the task by drawing on their personal strengths. As a teacher who wished to encourage learner autonomy, she considered that it was ‘good for the students to be able to rely on someone else and to be assisted in performing a task’ and that cooperation ‘often leads to a rewarding completion of a task for all students involved’. Although focus on form was not necessarily a requirement for all tasks completed by students in this class, they were generally encouraged to assist each other. The results of this study, which show that the two most prevalent strategies were requesting help and other-correction, suggest that students were at ease in terms of both asking for and giving help with language.</p>
<p>However, in addition to the teacher’s general attitude, two specific strategies promoted by her within her classroom are of particular note. The first pertains to the use of the phrase: <italic>How do you say X in English?</italic> As illustrated in the following extracts, this formula (in bold) was the most widely used strategy to ask for help:<disp-quote>
<p>(1) Round-robin/Round-table story</p>
<p>B: ok when he arrive (pause) – arrived or arrives?</p>
<p>T: (writing a sentence) when he arrives, arrives – <bold>how do you say</bold> en haut? In the? On?</p>
<p>B: on the mountain.</p>
<p>T: on the top.</p>
<p>B: when he arrive on the top.</p>
<p>P: when he-</p>
<p>B: when he arrives</p>
<p>(2) Heads Together (poster)</p>
<p>B: I see a road, a little road with – <bold>how do you say <italic>des escaliers</italic>?</bold></p>
<p>P: with stairs, stairs two stairs.</p>
<p>(3) Heads Together (poster)</p>
<p>M: <bold>how do you say</bold> (pointing to lines indicating a trail)</p>
<p>B: trail.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A second strategy encouraged by the teacher was the use of resources that included both reminding students to check with their peers before asking her as well as referring to material resources such as dictionaries, posters or words on the board. The emphasis on resources also reflected her concern with making the students more autonomous language learners. In the following extract, the teacher is caught on tape reminding students to use resources:<disp-quote>
<p>(4) Heads Together (poster)</p>
<p>A: (asking teacher) how do you say <italic>gazon</italic>?</p>
<p>Teacher: <bold>Did you ask in your team?</bold></p>
<p>A: (turning to team mates) do you know <italic>gazon</italic>?</p>
<p>Teacher: (addressing students) do you know how to say <italic>gazon</italic>?</p>
<p>B: no.</p>
<p>K: I don’t remember.</p>
<p>Teacher: it’s grass.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As was the practice in this class, during the completion of the CL tasks, all teams had a dictionary at their disposal. As shown in the following examples, the videotaping, which captured the visual aspects of the interaction, provided evidence of students using material resources as an aid to language learning:<disp-quote>
<p>(5) Round-robin/Round-table story</p>
<p>B: after that, the ambulance (English pronunciation), <italic>ambulance</italic> (French pronunciation), what is ambulance? How do you say?</p>
<p>T: (picking up a dictionary) <bold>we can see in the dictionary</bold></p>
<p>(…)</p>
<p>T: (concluding his search) <italic>ambulance</italic> (French pronunciation), ambulance (English pronunciation). It’s the same thing.</p>
<p>(6) Round-robin/Round-table story construction task</p>
<p>B: (doesn’t know how to say period) How do you say point (French word for period)?</p>
<p>T: point? (<bold>pointing to a poster on the wall</bold>). Period.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Oddly, in most classroom-based studies involving pair and group work, the teacher is rarely visible as a participant. By contrast, in the present study (as would typically be the case in a language class), the teacher circulated during group work as was her habit and, on occasion, served as a resource. As a further point in terms of understanding the teacher’s stance, it is important to note that her actions were sanctioned by the province-wide ESL curriculum officially approved for use in the schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1362168812460818">Gouvernement du Québec, 2001</xref>). In this curriculum, functional language (e.g. asking for help), encouraging autonomy through use of resources, and promoting cooperation amongst students figure prominently.</p>
<p>In addition to the points discussed, students’ success in collaborating may also be due, at least in part, to task type. In the present study, students were engaged in CL tasks designed to foster positive interdependence and individual accountability. In a certain sense, the tasks themselves acted as a scaffold to facilitate interaction and draw attention to linguistic aspects. Thus, for example, in the crossword jigsaw task, one student was in charge of the answer sheet (resource interdependence) and students needed to collaborate to come up with an answer based on clues distributed amongst the team members (also an example of resource interdependence); as well, as shown in the following extract, the number of slots for the answers forced students into negotiation of a relevant response:<disp-quote>
<p>(6) Jigsaw (with crossword puzzle)</p>
<p>M: (reading clue) [you can get food here].</p>
<p>A: (to M) repeat.</p>
<p>M: (repeating clue) [you can get food here].</p>
<p>A: (guessing) ski station? No. Can I see how many words? (means number of letters, looks at answer sheet)</p>
<p>B: wait! (takes the answer sheet and looks at it)</p>
<p>A: (to M) repeat your –</p>
<p>M: (repeating again) [you can get food here]</p>
<p>A: you can or you can’t?</p>
<p>M: CAN. (guessing) restaurant.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Similarly, in the Round-robin/Round-table task, each student was in charge of a certain number of pictures and took turns writing sentences to describe the latter on the answer sheet; task instructions further stipulated that students were to agree on what was eventually written down. As illustrated in extract 1, for example, students were collectively engaged in trying to describe a picture, an effort that led them to negotiate the form of the verb <italic>arrive</italic> as well as how to say <italic>en haut</italic>. Although recent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1362168812460818">Foster &amp; Ohta, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1362168812460818">Ohta, 2001</xref>), as well as the present one, suggest that scaffolding strategies traditionally associated with the negotiation of meaning literature need to be more broadly conceived within classroom contexts, it is nevertheless of relevance that within this tradition two-way tasks, in particular Jigsaw, have frequently been shown to be more conducive to fostering interaction than one-way tasks. As well, within the classroom-based studies pertaining to adults and high school students, task type as it relates to scaffolding and learning continues to be a concern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1362168812460818">Garcia Mayo, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1362168812460818">Nassaji &amp; Tian, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1362168812460818">Swain &amp; Lapkin, 2001</xref>). It is of note that in the present study the Round-robin/Round-table task, which involved writing a short text and agreeing as a team on what should be written, produced more than twice as many scaffolding strategies as the other two CL tasks, Jigsaw and Heads Together.</p>
<p>Although within second language teaching the relevance of CL principles for communicative tasks has been duly acknowledged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1362168812460818">Abdullah &amp; Jacobs, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1362168812460818">Dörnyei, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1362168812460818">Oxford, 1997</xref>), little research has specifically emerged under the CL banner. The present study suggests a need to further explore how CL tasks may be relevant to productive group work, especially as pertains to peer–peer linguistic scaffolding with young learners and those with low levels of second language proficiency. As well, future research with younger learners needs to show how scaffolding may be relevant for possible learning outcomes as has been the case with studies involving adults and high school students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1362168812460818">Garcia Mayo, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1362168812460818">Nassaji &amp; Tian, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1362168812460818">Storch, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1362168812460818">Storch, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1362168812460818">Swain &amp; Lapkin, 2001</xref>). In this regard, such studies also need to pay closer attention to the classroom culture, particularly the teacher’s role, and the way it may pertain to how students orient to linguistic scaffolding. Finally, a major limitation of the present study is that only two groups could be videotaped. Although classroom-based research is challenging to carry out, data from more groups and collected over longer periods of time would greatly contribute to the validity and reliability of findings. As well, surveys or interviews with students would be useful to better understand how the latter are orienting to the tasks at hand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1362168812460818">Parks et al., 2005</xref>).</p>

<title>VII Conclusions</title>
<p>To conclude, the present study contributes to the sparse literature pertaining to how peers interact while carrying out language tasks within classroom settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1362168812460818">Pinter, 2007</xref>). More specifically, this study demonstrates that Grade 6 children in an intensive ESL class were capable of providing varied scaffolding to peers as they engaged in CL tasks. Of the strategies resorted to, requests for assistance and other-correction were the most frequent. To explain how students were orienting to the tasks, the importance of the classroom culture and the structure of the CL tasks were evoked. Future research will be required to more thoroughly elucidate how such factors relate to the way second language learners engage in scaffolding and how these processes relate to language learning and development.</p>
