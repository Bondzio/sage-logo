<body>
<p>Welcome to the June issue of <italic>Seminars in Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia</italic> (<italic>SCVA</italic>). I introduced Dr Mark Twite as the section editor for the Congenital Cardiac Forum earlier this year.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1089253213488700">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1089253213488700">2</xref></sup> Dr Twite has put together an excellent collection of articles covering all the key aspects of patients with hypoplastic left ventricle. This series is a great representation of how we plan to cover these challenging topics in the Congenital Cardiac Forum in the future, and Mark has introduced these articles in his accompanying editorial.</p>
<p>From the general review series, we have a well-written article on the use of regional anesthesia in vascular surgery. Dr Stoneham and colleagues provide a framework for the key vascular operations that can benefit from regional adjunctive anesthesia, as well as outlining a number of controversies. Vascular surgery has long provided a challenge to surgeons and anesthesiologists. With the advent of the hybrid operating room and accompanying interventional approaches, many additional types of vascular surgeries may be manageable using regional techniques, so it is critical that we identify the key risk factors to focus on in this relatively sick patient population. The topic of regional anesthesia will be covered in stages throughout the upcoming year, with future articles going into more detail on procedural specifics and also placement considerations.</p>
<p>In the Educational Forum there are 2 clinical challenges articles. The first is a case-based mini-review of the use of double lumen endotracheal tubes in the setting of thoracic aneurysm repair prepared by Dr Silvay and colleagues. The second article is a nice case detailing a rare syndrome of acute silicoproteinosis and the considerations for completing whole lung lavage by Dr Puskas and colleagues. Each of these articles details useful clinical pearls in two very challenging scenarios and provide an interesting read.</p>
<p>From an administrative front, I would like to welcome our newest Editorial Board member, Dr Marc Stone from Mount Sinai in New York. Dr Stone is the cardiothoracic fellowship director at Sinai and has been involved with the <italic>SCVA</italic> at various levels over the years. I look forward to his contributions in upcoming issues.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy this issue.</p>
