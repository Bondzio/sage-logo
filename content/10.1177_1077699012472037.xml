<p>Whether readers appreciate <italic>Yours in Truth: A Personal Portrait of Ben Bradlee</italic> will depend upon their answers to at least two questions: (1) Do they want to know more than is in Benjamin Crowninshield Bradlee’s own autobiography <italic>A Good Life: Newspapering and Other Adventures?</italic> and (2) Is the author–subject relationship of primary, secondary, or no importance at all?</p>
<p>Jeff Himmelman’s self-deprecating style and his admiration for his sources (Carl Bernstein, Ben Bradlee, Katharine Graham, Sally Quinn, and Bob Woodward) may engage some readers and alienate others. However, his book complements Bradlee’s <italic>A Good Life</italic> and Graham’s <italic>Personal History</italic> and provides fascinating compressed narratives absent from either autobiography.</p>
<p>Descriptions of Bradlee throughout the book—“all editorial flint and casual cool”—confirm that Himmelman, a journalist, author, and musician, likes and admires his source. Just as Bradlee himself could not resolve the conflict between being a journalist and a friend when he wrote <italic>Conversations with Kennedy</italic>, Himmelman, too, struggles to walk his own fine line. When Woodward tells the author, “All biographers are concealers,” it is clear that Himmelman understands the nuances in the statement.</p>
<p>Bradlee discounts his relationship with JFK—“I was a newspaper person first and foremost because if I’d been less of a newspaperman, I would have been more of a friend”—but Himmelman is devoted to Bradlee and appreciates the time and access that Bradlee allowed him. Himmelman enjoyed the use of Bradlee’s extensive archives, which include more than sixty boxes of memos, notes, personal letters, photographs, and transcribed interviews and met regularly with Bradlee and with many Bradlee family members and acquaintances:
<disp-quote>
<p>Over the course of the next three years, Ben opened his entire life to me, from his archives at <italic>The Washington Post</italic> to his friends, his colleagues, and his dinner table. We’ve shared birthdays and howled in pained unison at the television screen during Redskins games. We have conducted dozens of formal interviews in Ben’s office and untold hundreds of casual ones over the dinner dishes, or in lounge chairs by the pool. My wife is in love with him. We’re friends.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>However, for all readers—no matter what their perspective on the proper relationship between a journalist and a source—there are treasures around every bend. Himmelman looks closely into Janet Cooke’s “Jimmy’s World” scandal; the relationships that develop among Bradlee, his second wife Antoinette (Tony) Bradlee, JFK, and Jacqueline Kennedy; and previously hidden concerns about the reliability of sources—including Deep Throat—during the Watergate years.</p>
<p>These treasures include descriptions of special moments between friends and the value of seemingly inconsequential items, such as a birthday invitation and a photograph. For example, Himmelman describes Ben and Tony Bradlee as they approach the Kennedys’ front door to congratulate JFK on his successful run for the White House: “Just the four of them, having dinner, taking in a movie, sharing a celebratory bottle of champagne. What a moment in life, in anyone’s life, to watch the key turn in the lock and the door swing open, to see history in such personal terms.”</p>
<p>Himmelman also conveys a certain pathos and wistfulness throughout the biography, as he describes unexpected discoveries. While wading through stacks of paper, Himmelman finds an invitation to a birthday celebration for John Kennedy Jr. at the White House. About to set it aside, he notes the date: November 26, 1963. He writes,
<disp-quote>
<p>In a flash I realized that it was an invitation to a party that never happened, planned as it was for four days after Kennedy’s death. I had to stop working and just sit with it for a while. Ben wrote a book about Kennedy, and has answered countless questions about him in countless interviews since 1963. Somehow the card did more to convey their closeness, and what was lost, than anything Ben has ever said or written.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Later, Himmelman discloses a longing for bygone days when newspapers were essential to the national discourse, and when editors and publishers seemed larger than life. Describing a photograph of Bradlee and Katharine Graham laughing (a photograph that is included in the book), he writes,
<disp-quote>
<p>Ben and Kay have just left the federal courthouse in D.C. during the early stages of the legal battle over the [Pentagon] Papers. They seem so vital, so assured, like the real life you always thought you might lead if everything went right. This is what Ben stands for, and Kay, too: the golden era in newspapers that’s gone and isn’t coming back, as unrecoverable as the joke Ben cracked the instant before the picture was taken.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Readers expecting detailed coverage of high points and scandals in the history of the <italic>Washington Post</italic> will not be disappointed. Bradlee tells Himmelman that he believes “daily journals and diaries aren’t as important in recreating the life of a newspaperman as the newspapers themselves.” A dramatic example is the August 9, 1974, front page of the <italic>Washington Post</italic> with the “biggest two-word headline ever to run” in the paper: “NIXON RESIGNS.” In a related photograph, a quiet and pensive Bradlee sits next to the page form of the famous front page. The narratives about John-John’s birthday and Richard M. Nixon’s resignation transport the reader from Camelot to the fall of a president.</p>
<p>After Watergate, the lives of the editors, publishers, and reporters at the <italic>Post</italic> changed forever. “The press had stepped out of the wings and onto the stage during Watergate,” Himmelman writes. “Bob and Carl and Ben and, increasingly, Sally—they had all become part of the story, actors in the drama itself. . . . Their heightened profiles would beget increased scrutiny and resentment, something that all of them were aware of but maybe weren’t quite ready for.” According to Himmelman, Bradlee “felt suddenly how public his life had become,” and he describes the instant when Bradlee “realized that they were all going to be bigger than they had ever imagined.”</p>
<p>Most of the biography underscores the tough-as-nails portrayal of Benjamin C. Bradlee by Jason Robards in the 1976 film <italic>All the President’s Men</italic>. However, Himmelman expands our understanding by sharing selections from Bradlee’s correspondence to prospective reporters and to established ones. Bradlee recommends to students applying for jobs at the <italic>Post</italic> that they not seek a journalism career until they know something about “judgment and ethics and priorities and compassion and sensitivity,” suggests that applicants take the time to check the spelling of the editor’s name—it’s “Bradlee,” not “Bradley”—and chastens those who believe they know more than they do—“You lack courtesy, you lack flexibility, you lack any semblance of humility. You think you are better than you are, which is not sinful, but it is apparent.” When Bob Woodward begins to respond to other job offers, Bradlee writes a message in which he says to his prize investigative reporter, “A light will go out in this place, if or when you leave. A light that never flickered, and generally burned strong and clean.”</p>
<p>The title of the biography is drawn from the signature in a letter Bradlee wrote to Woodward in which he replaces “Sincerely” with “Yours in truth, Ben.” Bradlee’s commitment to courage and veracity in journalism is legendary, and in the aftermath of Watergate, enrollment in journalism programs exploded across the nation. Hundreds of prospective journalists set their sights on Bradlee’s news organization: in the early 1970s, 1,600 people applied for fifteen summer internships at the <italic>Post</italic>.</p>
<p>Called “The Last Dangerous Editor” in a 1995 article in the <italic>New Yorker</italic> by David Remnick, Bradlee always has been aware of his educational and social advantages. White, wealthy, male, intelligent, charming, and attractive, Bradlee seems invincible, although even after considering all these characteristics, Himmelman argues that it is still difficult to account for Bradlee’s “easy way with the world.”</p>
<p>Throughout <italic>Yours in Truth</italic>, Himmelman celebrates the commitment Bradlee made to his friend and publisher Katharine Graham, and the excellence he demanded from the reporters and editors who answered to him. A towering presence in the newsroom, Bradlee left a legacy to the nation and to the newspaper industry. His decades of service may best be explained by citing his famous phrase: “So whaddaya got for tomorrow?”</p>
