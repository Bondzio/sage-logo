<abstract>
<p>The success of organizational change increasingly depends on employees taking personal responsibility for change through effective adaptation to changing conditions and proactive anticipation of new challenges. In this study, we examined how work context features influence the change-oriented behaviors of adaptivity and proactivity in the workplace. We proposed several direct and moderating effects of job context variables on adaptive and proactive behaviors. We used a multilevel design and a unique data set with 621 special education teachers embedded in 157 urban public schools to test our hypotheses. Our analyses show that adaptive and proactive behaviors are distinct aspects of job performance during organizational change and that different job features have distinct direct and moderating effects on these behaviors. Our results provide insights into how leaders of change efforts can create a work context that encourages employees to actively participate in the change process.</p>

<p>In the context of organizational change, some forms of work behavior are more effective and desirable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0021886312469254">Howard, 1995</xref>). To cope with dynamic environments and enact change, organizations expect employees not only to work harder but also to engage in change-oriented behaviors, such as adapting to changing conditions and proactively anticipating new challenges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0021886312469254">Griffin, Parker, &amp; Mason, 2010</xref>). Scholars have argued that organizational success increasingly depends on employees taking personal responsibility for change through personal initiative and proactive behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0021886312469254">Crant, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0021886312469254">Frese, Kring, Soose, &amp; Zempel, 1996</xref>). Indeed, this active style of work behavior has been documented by organizational scholars in contemporary workplace concepts such as psychological empowerment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr119-0021886312469254">Spreitzer, 1995</xref>), organizational citizenship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0021886312469254">Organ, 1988</xref>), proactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0021886312469254">Crant, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0021886312469254">Grant &amp; Ashford, 2008</xref>), personal initiative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0021886312469254">Frese &amp; Fay, 2001</xref>), taking charge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0021886312469254">Morrison &amp; Phelps, 1999</xref>), and job crafting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021886312469254">Berg, Wrzesniewski, &amp; Dutton, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr134-0021886312469254">Wrzesniewski &amp; Dutton, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Change-oriented work behaviors are critical to organizations undergoing change initiatives, as employees often need to get involved in changing work roles and organizational practices to successfully implement organizational change efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0021886312469254">Hornung &amp; Rousseau, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0021886312469254">Morrison &amp; Phelps, 1999</xref>). Consider, for example, evidence from successful examples of incremental organizational change documenting the critical role of personal initiative in igniting organizational change from below. Evidence suggests that proactive employees brought about organizational change, by proactively introducing modifications in product design that reflected a deeper understanding of consumer needs, or initiating a revision of a marketing approach based on new information technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0021886312469254">Frohman, 1997</xref>). Further evidence comes from studies of taking charge, a proactive behavior that entails voluntary and constructive efforts to create change. Employees who felt personally responsible for change and actively tried to bring about improvement in their organizations were critical to organizational adaptation and change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0021886312469254">Morrison &amp; Phelps, 1999</xref>). Other scholars have argued that continuous improvement in the form of active change-oriented behavior aimed at improving productivity and quality was critical for enacting organizational change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0021886312469254">Fuller, Marler, &amp; Hester, 2006</xref>). Finally, innovation researchers have discussed the role of employee-initiated change for long-term organizational innovation and adaptability to a changing environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr117-0021886312469254">Scott &amp; Bruce, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>However, very little change research has examined the adaptive and proactive employee behaviors that promote organizational change, and how managers can develop these behaviors in employees. Only recently have researchers examined empirically change-promoting beliefs and behaviors such as readiness to change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021886312469254">Armenakis, Harris, &amp; Mossholder, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0021886312469254">Cunningham et al., 2002</xref>), adaptivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0021886312469254">Griffin, Neal, &amp; Parker, 2007</xref>), proactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0021886312469254">Hornung &amp; Rousseau, 2007</xref>), and change-oriented citizenship behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0021886312469254">Choi, 2007</xref>), and their role in facilitating organizational change. Most change research has focused on the impact of individual differences and broader organizational factors, such as leadership and climate on employee support for change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0021886312469254">Choi, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0021886312469254">Oreg, Vakola, &amp; Armenakis, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr128-0021886312469254">Wanberg &amp; Banas, 2000</xref>). Much less change research has examined more proximal aspects of context such as factors in an employee’s tasks or relationships with others at work.</p>
<p>Within organizational research in general, there is increased interest in identifying the antecedent conditions that inform managerial efforts to encourage employee proactivity, taking charge, or initiating change at work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0021886312469254">Grant &amp; Ashford, 2008</xref>). However, most of these studies have examined individual-level differences as drivers of proactive behaviors, such as proactive personality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021886312469254">Bateman &amp; Crant, 1993</xref>) and self-efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0021886312469254">Morrison &amp; Phelps, 1999</xref>). Less research attention has turned to aspects of the work environment that may encourage such behaviors. This is a significant gap, because understanding the impact of work contexts on proactivity will provide managers with insights into creating work environments that foster employee adaptive and proactive behaviors, regardless of employees’ individual characteristics or personality traits. Recognizing this limitation, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0021886312469254">Griffin et al. (2007)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0021886312469254">Grant and Ashford (2008)</xref> suggest that more research is needed that examines how work context influences change-oriented behaviors.</p>
<p>Adaptive and proactive behaviors are initiated by employees rather than prescribed or directed by others. Thus, it is difficult for managers to give direction with regard to how employees can be more adaptive and proactive. In this research, we propose that managers can shape employees’ immediate work context by providing opportunities for individuals to engage in adaptive and proactive behaviors. Clearly, there is great need to research employee adaptivity and proactivity in the context of change initiatives and the role of employees’ proximal work context in encouraging these behaviors. Given the anticipated benefits of adaptivity and proactivity in change and the need to understand the work context levers that managers have to promote them, we develop and test a model of adaptive and proactive performance and its work context antecedents.</p>
<p>We conducted a study of special education (“special ed”) teachers in a large U.S. public school district. The school district under investigation was engaged in the implementation of a district policy focused on scaling up a new mathematics curriculum. Given the nature of the change, implementation required changes in teacher task behavior, both in terms of actions to adapt teaching practice to new demands and proactively introduce new approaches to teaching using the new curriculum. The district policy aimed to foster teacher collaboration on curriculum planning and student assessment; however, change implementation in the form of actual instruction was done independently by each teacher in her classroom. Generally, teaching is an occupation where job performance essentially requires adaptive behavior to accommodate various learning needs in the classroom, and where proactive behavior is both possible and important in improving job performance. Special ed teaching, in particular, is characterized by rapidly changing demands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021886312469254">Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2010</xref>). Effective job performance for special ed teachers relies less on following standard texts, lesson plans, and examinations, and more on inventing new teaching approaches or negotiating new learning outcomes to accommodate each child individually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0021886312469254">Crutchfield, 1997</xref>). In addition, the change context made the adaptive and proactive behaviors of teachers even more critical to the implementation of the change, since the school district relied on teachers to find the best approaches to teaching the new curriculum that fit the needs of their classrooms.</p>

<title>Adaptive and Proactive Behaviors and Organizational Change</title>
<p>New perspectives on work performance increasingly account for the full range of behaviors that contribute to job effectiveness during times of change. In particular, dimensions of work behavior that lie beyond what has been traditionally included in the scope of the job are increasingly important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0021886312469254">Griffin et al., 2007</xref>). Such dimensions include organizational citizenship behavior (OCB), prosocial behavior, personal initiative (PI), and adaptive and proactive behaviors, among others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021886312469254">Brief &amp; Motowidlo, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0021886312469254">Frese &amp; Fay, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0021886312469254">Griffin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-0021886312469254">Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Paine, &amp; Bachrach, 2000</xref>). Although scholars have investigated various forms of discretionary behavior, many of these behaviors are neither focused on an individual’s job nor are they change oriented. For instance, most OCB research has emphasized its promotive and affiliative aspects (i.e., interpersonal helping and compliance—behaviors that focus on improving performance by maintaining and enhancing existing work relationships and task procedures; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-0021886312469254">Podsakoff et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr126-0021886312469254">Van Dyne, Cummings, &amp; McLean Parks, 1995</xref>). More recently, scholars have examined change-oriented OCB, a challenging type of OCB that integrates aspects of voice and taking charge. However, this concept may only include suggesting changes and not necessarily enacting them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0021886312469254">Choi, 2007</xref>). In contrast, our focus is on actual behaviors aimed at adapting to new circumstances and introducing change. Another type of discretionary behavior, taking charge, can be directed beyond an individual’s job role and thus is a broader concept than adaptive and proactive behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0021886312469254">Morrison &amp; Phelps, 1999</xref>). Finally, PI has been conceptualized as a relatively stable behavioral tendency resulting in an individual’s taking a self-starting approach to work, regardless of the situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0021886312469254">Frese et al., 1996</xref>). Unlike PI, adaptive and proactive behaviors vary depending on the context in which they are enacted.</p>
<p>Based on an integration of previous work performance theories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021886312469254">Borman &amp; Motowidlo, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0021886312469254">Ilgen &amp; Pulakos, 1999</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0021886312469254">Griffin et al. (2007)</xref> have developed a model of work performance that highlights three different types of behavior—proficiency, adaptivity, and proactivity. According to this model, in predictable environments, effectiveness can be enhanced by increasing proficiency of task execution. In times of change, work requirements cannot be clearly anticipated and prescribed, and thus adaptivity and proactivity become much more important for effectiveness. Indeed, during change, work roles emerge dynamically in response to changing demands and in anticipation of future opportunities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0021886312469254">Katz &amp; Kahn, 1978</xref>). <italic>Adaptive behavior</italic> describes actions aimed at responding to changing demands arising in the work environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-0021886312469254">Pulakos, Arad, Donovan, &amp; Plamondon, 2000</xref>). It is tailored to address problems and needs as they arise in a dynamic context and reflects one’s efforts to modify task behavior to meet the challenges inherent in novel and demanding situations. However, dynamic work contexts often require employees to not only adapt their behavior to accommodate change, but also act on the environment and initiate change themselves through proactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0021886312469254">Grant &amp; Ashford, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0021886312469254">Grant &amp; Parker, 2009</xref>). <italic>Proactive behavior</italic> describes self-directed action to initiate change and expand the current boundaries of work roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0021886312469254">Crant, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-0021886312469254">Parker, Williams, &amp; Turner, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Adaptive and proactive behaviors are critical for enacting organizational change. Successful implementation of many change efforts ultimately involves altering employee in-role behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0021886312469254">Hornung &amp; Rousseau, 2007</xref>). Indeed, organizational changes that challenge work roles and goals encourage employees to act in ways that go beyond existing roles. Because change creates uncertainty and ambiguity about appropriate and effective action, its success depends on the cumulative changes that proactive employees introduce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr131-0021886312469254">Weick &amp; Quinn, 1999</xref>). Adaptivity and proactivity are even more important during organizational change, because the most effective work behaviors cannot be prescribed in advance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr122-0021886312469254">Strauss, Griffin, &amp; Rafferty, 2009</xref>). Indeed, adaptive and proactive actions on the part of employees who recognize and seize opportunities for creating new courses of action are critical for the success of change initiatives (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021886312469254">Table 1</xref>). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021886312469254">Table 1</xref> presents the dimensions of adaptive and proactive behaviors, their importance to change management, and their illustration in the two major categories of change (i.e., incremental/evolutionary and frame breaking/revolutionary) built on the major typologies of change found in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021886312469254">Burke, 2008</xref>).</p>

<p>Evidence from change studies suggests that active employee involvement in change initiatives is central to increasing the likelihood of sustainable change. Active involvement in change allows employees to select changes they feel they can accomplish and boosts their self-efficacy. In addition, increased participation in change efforts (i.e., through employee initiative) creates a sense of individual agency and control over the change and leads to higher readiness and support for the change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0021886312469254">Oreg et al., 2011</xref>). Active involvement allows employees to take an active role in dealing with difficult change issues related to their jobs and increases perceptions that they can benefit from the change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021886312469254">Armenakis &amp; Harris, 2009</xref>). Indeed, proactive employees respond more positively to organizational change (i.e., report higher anticipated benefits from change; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0021886312469254">Hornung &amp; Rousseau, 2007</xref>), and are more likely than their less proactive counterparts to support and promote organizational change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0021886312469254">Frese et al., 1996</xref>).</p>

<title>Contextual Influences on Adaptive and Proactive Behaviors</title>
<p>A large body of research has examined individual differences that promote positive reactions to organizational change. Evidence suggests that individual responses to organizational change are contingent on factors, such as personality traits, coping styles, motivational needs, and demographic variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021886312469254">Ashford, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0021886312469254">Oreg et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0021886312469254">Judge, Thoresen, Pucik, &amp; Welbourne, 1999</xref>). For example, individuals with a proactive personality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021886312469254">Bateman &amp; Crant, 1993</xref>) tend to be more proactive at work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0021886312469254">Parker &amp; Collins, 2010</xref>), experience a higher readiness to assume responsibility for change, and persevere in making change happen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0021886312469254">Fuller et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0021886312469254">Parker &amp; Spriggs, 1999</xref>). Other dispositional variables related to change-oriented behavior are motivational characteristics, such as learning goal orientation, action orientation, and need for achievement; general self-efficacy; problem-focused coping; problem-solving style; and personality traits, such as locus of control and type-A/B personality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0021886312469254">Frese, Fay, Hilburger, Leng, &amp; Tag, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0021886312469254">LePine &amp; Van Dyne, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0021886312469254">Muehlfeld, van Doorn, &amp; van Witteloostuijn, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0021886312469254">Morrison &amp; Phelps, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr117-0021886312469254">Scott &amp; Bruce, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>Although this research provides useful insights for change management, it shifts the focus away from how managers can promote employee change-oriented behaviors to how they can select employees that are more likely to engage in these behaviors. Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0021886312469254">Frese et al. (1996)</xref> recommend that organizations increase job control and complexity to encourage PI, rather than solely focus on selecting dispositionally proactive employees. We think that a better understanding of the role of work context in promoting change-oriented behaviors will provide a practical avenue for managers to encourage these behaviors during organizational change and make the change efforts more successful. Work context shapes behavior because of its influence on the range of actions that are appropriate or possible within work roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0021886312469254">Johns, 2001</xref>). Context can shape employee adaptive and proactive actions and make organizational change more likely to happen. Indeed, context characteristics such as a supportive environment, trustworthy management, and culture have been associated with support for change in several studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021886312469254">Armenakis, Bernerth, Pitts, &amp; Walker, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0021886312469254">Coyle-Shapiro &amp; Morrow, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0021886312469254">Cunningham et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0021886312469254">Jones, Jimmieson, &amp; Griffiths, 2005</xref>). In addition, research suggests that support for change is related not only to contextual factors in the organization but also to more proximal factors in an employee’s work tasks. Indeed, discretion and control encourage employees to be more proactive during the change process and more likely to support it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0021886312469254">Cunningham et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0021886312469254">Hornung &amp; Rousseau, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0021886312469254">Fuller et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Among the proximal dimensions of context identified by previous research, we examine aspects of the task and relational dimensions, which have long been considered important in shaping how work roles are perceived and enacted by individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0021886312469254">Katz &amp; Kahn, 1978</xref>). They are also important prechange antecedents of organizational change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0021886312469254">Cunningham et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0021886312469254">Oreg et al., 2011</xref>). Task context refers to the constraints and opportunities for adaptive and proactive behaviors that are attributable to task characteristics, such as complexity and autonomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0021886312469254">Johns, 2006</xref>). Relational context describes the interpersonal relationships that are embedded in and influenced by an employee’s job (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0021886312469254">Grant &amp; Parker, 2009</xref>). Our choice of task and relational context is informed by research examining reactions to change (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0021886312469254">Oreg et al., 2011</xref>, for a review). This research suggests that certain job characteristics relate to favorable perceptions of change and higher readiness and acceptance of change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021886312469254">Armenakis et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0021886312469254">Cunningham et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0021886312469254">Hornung &amp; Rousseau, 2007</xref>). Jobs characterized by psychologically demanding tasks with high-decision latitude (so called “active jobs,” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0021886312469254">Karasek, 1998</xref>) increase motivation, stimulate development of new behaviors, and allow employees to enact change through incremental steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021886312469254">Armenakis et al., 1993</xref>). Active jobs increase employees’ confidence in their ability to manage change and facilitate their participation in organizational redesign (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr120-0021886312469254">Spreitzer, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021886312469254">Armenakis et al., 1993</xref>). Furthermore, relational aspects of work such as supportive environments and trustworthy relationships with managers and coworkers increase intentions to support change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0021886312469254">Coyle-Shapiro &amp; Morrow, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0021886312469254">Cunningham et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>To select our task context factors, we looked at literature suggesting that adaptivity and proactivity are special types of motivated behavior associated with perceptions of control and capability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021886312469254">Bindl &amp; Parker, 2010</xref>). Job factors that promote these perceptions are critical during change and should be associated with higher adaptivity and proactivity. Discretion and complexity, both concerned with the degree to which employees can choose how to proceed with their work, have been positively related to proactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0021886312469254">Frese, Garst, &amp; Fay, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0021886312469254">Morrison, 2006</xref>). In support of this view, Frese et al. (2006) suggest that organizations increase job control and complexity to encourage PI. We also examine two relational context factors—social ties and interdependence. Interactions with coworkers are more pervasive than ever in contemporary work, given the increased work interdependence and the growing use of teams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0021886312469254">Griffin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0021886312469254">Kiggundu, 1981</xref>). Social ties are critical in that they provide the social support and access to information that employees need to support change and be more proactive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0021886312469254">Fuller et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0021886312469254">Oreg et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, interdependence is an important antecedent of extrarole behavior and job crafting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-0021886312469254">Pearce &amp; Gregersen, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr134-0021886312469254">Wrzesniewski &amp; Dutton, 2001</xref>). These four context factors are also highly relevant to our research setting and change context of special ed teachers involved in the implementation of a new mathematics curriculum. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021886312469254">Figure 1</xref>, we present our model depicting how work context features influence adaptive and proactive behaviors.</p>

<p>To structure our arguments, we use the job characteristics theory and job demands–resources theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021886312469254">Bakker &amp; Demerouti, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0021886312469254">Demerouti, Bakker, Nachreiner, &amp; Schaufeli, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0021886312469254">Hackman &amp; Oldham, 1980</xref>). The job characteristics theory provides insights into the motivating role of job characteristics; recent extensions that address proactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0021886312469254">Grant &amp; Parker, 2009</xref>) explain why individuals may take an active role on the job. The job demands–resources theory provides insights into the factors (i.e., job resources and demands) that facilitate an employee’s work engagement and encourage adaptivity and proactivity. In addition, given the evidence that some work characteristics may interact to predict readiness for change (i.e., decision latitude and job demand, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0021886312469254">Cunningham et al., 2002</xref>), this theory also allows us to examine the potential interaction effects of job characteristics.</p>

<title>Effects of Job Resources on Adaptive and Proactive Behaviors</title>
<p>Job resources (i.e., job control, social support) are job features that are functional in achieving work goals, reducing job demands and their associated costs, or facilitating personal growth and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021886312469254">Bakker &amp; Demerouti, 2007</xref>). They activate a motivational process that leads to high work engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0021886312469254">Crawford, LePine, &amp; Rich, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0021886312469254">Kahn, 1990</xref>). Job resources play an intrinsic motivational role because they foster individual growth, learning, and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021886312469254">Bakker &amp; Demerouti, 2007</xref>). According to the job characteristics theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0021886312469254">Hackman &amp; Oldham, 1980</xref>), job resources such as discretion promote felt responsibility and increase motivation. They also allow employees to choose tasks that fulfill autonomy, competence, and relatedness needs and thus increase intrinsic motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-0021886312469254">Ryan &amp; Deci, 2000</xref>). Job resources also play an extrinsic motivational role because they are instrumental in accomplishing work goals. Work contexts that offer many resources increase individual willingness to invest one’s effort and skills and the ability to successfully complete the task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0021886312469254">Meijman &amp; Mulder, 1998</xref>). Indeed, recent evidence reveals a positive relationship between job resources and job performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0021886312469254">Hakanen, Perhoniemi, &amp; Toppinen-Tanner, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>We expect that job resources facilitate both adaptive and proactive behaviors. Since job resources spark engagement in the task and create positive emotions, they also broaden people’s thought-action repertoires and build their enduring personal resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0021886312469254">Fredrickson, 2000</xref>). In turn, these positive emotions spark a desire to explore new things and should promote the development of new and creative ideas for action. Therefore, employees enjoying increased job resources will be more willing to try new things, have increased ability to adapt to changes, and become more proactive. In support of this proposition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0021886312469254">Hakanen et al. (2008)</xref> found that job resources led to increased work engagement, which in turn sparked more PI on the job. In experimental research, positive emotions were found to trigger more flexible thinking and openness to information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0021886312469254">Estrada, Isen, &amp; Young, 1997</xref>) and facilitate creative problem solving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0021886312469254">Isen, Daubman, &amp; Nowicki, 1987</xref>). Based on the above, we expect that job resources are positively related to adaptive and proactive behaviors.</p>
<p><italic>Task discretion</italic>, defined as “the degree of autonomy, or freedom of action, that an individual, team or organization has” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0021886312469254">Johns, 2006</xref>, p. 394), is a key job resource for a large variety of jobs and occupations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021886312469254">Bakker &amp; Demerouti, 2007</xref>). In a recent meta-analysis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0021886312469254">Crawford et al. (2010)</xref> found that discretion was one of the most studied job resources across a multitude of empirical studies. Discretion promotes feelings of control and capability and should facilitate participation in change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021886312469254">Bindl &amp; Parker, 2010</xref>). In addition, discretion is a core feature of teachers’ work and is considered critical for wellness in this profession (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-0021886312469254">Pearson &amp; Moomaw, 2005</xref>). Discretion is critical for special ed teachers’ health and well-being because it is associated with more opportunities to cope with stressful situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0021886312469254">Karasek, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>We expect that task discretion is positively related to adaptive and proactive behaviors. Indeed, recent theory suggests a positive relationship between task discretion and employee adaptive and proactive work behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0021886312469254">Frese et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0021886312469254">Parker, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr121-0021886312469254">Staw &amp; Boettger, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr134-0021886312469254">Wrzesniewski &amp; Dutton, 2001</xref>). Discretion signals to employees that they have the ability and opportunity to take on broader roles and integrate more tasks into their work roles if they choose to do so (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0021886312469254">Morgeson, Delaney-Klinger, &amp; Hemingway, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0021886312469254">Parker, 2007</xref>). Discretion increases ownership of problems and allows employees to recognize a wider range of skills and knowledge as important for their roles. Discretion is also likely to facilitate role breadth self-efficacy, a specific form of self-efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021886312469254">Bandura, 1997</xref>) reflecting the influence of both personality and situational factors. Role breadth self-efficacy refers to employees’ confidence in taking on “broader and more active roles, beyond traditional prescribed technical requirements” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0021886312469254">Parker, 1998</xref>, p. 835) and has been shown to predict proactive behavior toward one’s tasks and toward the team and the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0021886312469254">Griffin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-0021886312469254">Parker et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr122-0021886312469254">Strauss et al., 2009</xref>) as well as PI during organizational change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0021886312469254">Hornung &amp; Rousseau, 2007</xref>). In addition, efficacy beliefs have been identified as one of the key change beliefs underlying individuals’ motives to support change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021886312469254">Armenakis &amp; Harris, 2009</xref>). In sum, we hypothesize the following:</p>
<list id="list7-0021886312469254" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 1a</italic>: Special education teachers who experience higher levels of task discretion engage more frequently in adaptive and proactive behaviors.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p><italic>Social ties</italic> in the workplace are a key job resource in that they promote social support, resilience, security, and positive mood on the job (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0021886312469254">Karasek &amp; Theorell, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-0021886312469254">Ryan &amp; Deci, 2000</xref>), foster work engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr116-0021886312469254">Schaufeli &amp; Bakker, 2004</xref>), and encourage prosocial work behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0021886312469254">Grant, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0021886312469254">Grant &amp; Parker, 2009</xref>). For special ed teachers, social ties are a particularly important job resource as they allow teachers to share important task knowledge and work practices while helping them get social support from colleagues.</p>
<p>We expect that stronger relationships with coworkers foster employee adaptive and proactive behaviors. First, stronger social ties at work promote psychological safety, which facilitates proactive learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0021886312469254">Edmondson, 1999</xref>). Second, social ties are related to proactivity in implementing new ideas and solving problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-0021886312469254">Parker et al., 2006</xref>). Third, social ties provide opportunities to learn from others through the transfer of tacit and explicit knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021886312469254">Berman, Down, &amp; Hill, 2002</xref>). For example, social networks have a strong effect on individuals’ creative potential and domain-relevant knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-0021886312469254">Perry-Smith, 2006</xref>). Finally, social ties should facilitate more supportive and empowering work contexts, which are thought to encourage individuals to take the risks inherent in showing initiative and introducing change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021886312469254">Ashford, Rothbard, Piderit, &amp; Dutton., 1998</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0021886312469254">Dutton et al. (2002)</xref> argue that individuals’ proactive behaviors are often based on contextual sense-making processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr130-0021886312469254">Weick, 1979</xref>). As such, individuals assess their social context for cues about political support, image risk, and the probability of success for their actions. Stronger ties with coworkers should facilitate confidence that when one exercises discretion to engage in adaptive and proactive behaviors, such action will be well received without fear of negative consequences. In addition, social ties provide the social support that employees need to support organizational change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0021886312469254">Oreg et al., 2011</xref>). We therefore hypothesize the following:</p>
<list id="list8-0021886312469254" list-type="simple">

<title>Effects of Job Demands on Adaptive and Proactive Behaviors</title>
<p>Job demands (i.e., workload, role ambiguity) are job features that require sustained physical or psychological effort or skills. They exhaust employees’ mental and physical resources through an energy depletion process and can lead to stress, burnout, and health problems. Although research has concluded that job demands have a positive relationship with stress and burnout, the evidence concerning the relationship between job demands and work engagement has been less conclusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021886312469254">Bakker &amp; Demerouti, 2007</xref>). A recent meta-analysis indicates that job demands have a differentiated impact on work engagement that depends on the psychological responses that different job demands tend to trigger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0021886312469254">Crawford et al., 2010</xref>). In particular, people appraise various job demands as either challenges or hindrances. Challenge demands are typically appraised as stressful demands that are under one’s control and can promote mastery and personal growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0021886312469254">Cavanaugh, Boswell, Roehling, &amp; Boudreau, 2000</xref>). Some examples include workload, time pressure, and job responsibility. Employees tend to perceive challenge demands as opportunities to learn and demonstrate competences that are rewarded in organizations. In contrast, hindrance demands are typically appraised as stressful demands that are uncontrollable and can undermine personal growth, learning, and goal attainment. Some examples include role conflict, role ambiguity, organizational politics, and bureaucracy. As such, employees tend to perceive hindrance demands as constraints or barriers that hinder their progress toward achieving goals and getting desired rewards. Although individuals may differ in how they perceive different job demands, there is evidence that individuals tend to appraise various job demands in a consistent manner because of a common understanding of the work context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021886312469254">Brief &amp; George, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0021886312469254">LePine, Podsakoff, &amp; LePine, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Since challenge and hindrance demands trigger different emotions and cognitions in individuals, they tend to induce different responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0021886312469254">Lazarus &amp; Folkman, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0021886312469254">LePine et al., 2005</xref>). Because of their potential to promote personal growth and goal attainment, challenge demands tend to foster positive emotions and an active, problem-solving style of coping (i.e., increased effort, strategizing). In response to challenge demands, individuals are more confident that expending more effort and strategizing will help them successfully meet the demands, achieve goals, and see meaningful personal growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0021886312469254">Kahn, 1990</xref>). Indeed, research has shown that the experience of being challenged creates positive emotions and an increased sense of meaning, leading to higher work engagement and motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0021886312469254">May, Gilson, &amp; Harter, 2004</xref>). Similarly, task characteristics that promote a sense of responsibility increase worker internal motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0021886312469254">Hackman &amp; Oldham, 1980</xref>). Furthermore, an active problem-solving style of coping with challenge demands is more adaptive, in that individuals are likely to increase effort and engage in different behaviors, such as adaptive and proactive, to achieve their work goals. Therefore, we expect that challenge demands are associated with more adaptive and proactive behaviors.</p>
<p>Because hindrance demands are generally appraised as impeding personal growth and goal achievement, they tend to evoke negative emotions and trigger a passive or emotional style of coping (i.e., withdrawing from the situation; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0021886312469254">Crawford et al., 2010</xref>). In response to hindrance demands, individuals feel that they are unable to adequately meet these demands, are less willing to invest effort to respond, and are likely to resort to a passive style of coping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0021886312469254">Kahn, 1990</xref>). Indeed, research has shown that the experience of hindrance demands is associated with negative emotions and psychological threats that decrease motivation and engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0021886312469254">May et al., 2004</xref>). Similarly, job demands that threaten the fulfillment of competence, relatedness, and autonomy needs undermine internal motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0021886312469254">Deci et al., 2001</xref>). Furthermore, a passive, emotional style of coping with hindrance demands is more maladaptive, in that individuals are likely to decrease the effort they put into the task, because they perceive that goals are beyond their control; as such, they are less likely to engage in adaptive and proactive behaviors to accomplish work goals. In sum, we expect that hindrance demands are associated with less adaptive and proactive behaviors.</p>

<title>Task complexity</title>
<p>Task complexity is a key feature of special ed teachers’ work and a challenge demand. Special ed teachers face increased complexity because of the diverse and changing needs of students in their classrooms, encompassing a multitude of learning, physical, and mental disabilities. This complexity is further amplified during the implementation of a new curriculum. Complex tasks have high information load, diversity, or rate of change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0021886312469254">Campbell, 1988</xref>). They have a larger number of elements that must be considered for effective performance, are more mentally demanding, and place increased emphasis on the knowledge, skills, and abilities of the individual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0021886312469254">Morgeson &amp; Humphrey, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr133-0021886312469254">Wood, 1986</xref>). In a recent meta-analysis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0021886312469254">Crawford et al. (2010)</xref> found that complexity was one of the frequently studied challenge demands in organizational research. Furthermore, models of work design and stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr123-0021886312469254">Theorell &amp; Karasek, 1996</xref>) have suggested that demanding tasks that offer potential for mastery, learning, and personal growth (i.e., high complexity) are likely to be perceived as challenging and should facilitate proactive job performance. Accordingly, individuals performing complex tasks feel they can successfully meet task demands by working hard and by doing so they can experience a sense of personal accomplishment and receive recognition.</p>
<p>Complexity should enhance adaptivity and proactivity because it increases the sense of responsibility for the whole job (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0021886312469254">Hackman &amp; Oldham, 1980</xref>) and is associated with a broader and more proactive role orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-0021886312469254">Parker, Wall, &amp; Jackson, 1997</xref>). This increases adaptive and proactive behaviors by stimulating proactive thinking, self-starting approaches, and efforts to overcome barriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0021886312469254">Frese et al., 2007</xref>). Evidence suggests that complexity enhances PI at work via control orientation, or the belief of control over relevant and important issues at work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0021886312469254">Frese et al., 2007</xref>). Frese et al. have consistently shown that employees in more complex jobs exercise more PI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0021886312469254">Frese et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0021886312469254">Frese et al., 2007</xref>). Some have argued that very high levels of complexity are often associated with stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr135-0021886312469254">Xie &amp; Johns, 1995</xref>) and lower creativity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0021886312469254">Elsbach &amp; Hargadon, 2006</xref>), and thus moderate levels of complexity encourage intellectual flexibility and felt responsibility without overwhelming employees. However, research has provided mixed support for this proposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0021886312469254">Fay &amp; Sonnentag, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0021886312469254">Ohly, Sonnentag, &amp; Pluntke, 2006</xref>). Drawing on control theory, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0021886312469254">Fay and Sonnentag (2002)</xref> hypothesized and found that situational constraints, such as complexity lead individuals to think ahead about how to prevent negative outcomes in the future and encourage higher initiative.</p>
<p>Furthermore, individuals performing complex tasks feel less pressure to act in a prescribed manner and are more willing to engage in adaptive and proactive behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0021886312469254">Grant &amp; Ashford, 2008</xref>). In addition, tasks that require problem solving provide employees a chance to perform in challenging and novel situations in which they can demonstrate and reinforce a sense of competence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0021886312469254">Humphrey, Nahrgang, &amp; Morgeson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-0021886312469254">Ryan &amp; Deci, 2000</xref>). Finally, complex tasks should enhance individuals’ arousal at work and their interest in doing the work more effectively, which should spark new approaches and innovative ideas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr118-0021886312469254">Shalley, Zhou, &amp; Oldham, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr132-0021886312469254">West &amp; Farr, 1990</xref>).

<title>Task interdependence</title>
<p>A large part of a special ed teacher’s job involves working interdependently, communicating and coordinating with other coworkers involved in the education of students with special needs, including social workers, school psychologists, occupational and physical therapists, school administrators, and other teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021886312469254">Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2010</xref>). Interdependence is a critical job demand for special ed teachers. Teachers need to communicate with and coordinate the work of other school specialists in their daily work but are also highly dependent on input from these workers to successfully perform their jobs.</p>
<p>Interdependence reflects the connectedness of jobs to one another in a work process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0021886312469254">Morgeson &amp; Humphrey, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr124-0021886312469254">Thompson, 1967</xref>), such that successful completion of an individual’s work depends on the successful completion of work by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0021886312469254">Campion, Medsker, &amp; Higgs, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0021886312469254">Kiggundu, 1981</xref>). Interestingly, prior research has found an inconsistent relationship between interdependence and individual job outcomes. Some research suggests a positive relationship between interdependence and subjective performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0021886312469254">Humphrey et al., 2007</xref>). Interdependence leads to extrarole helping via increased felt responsibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-0021886312469254">Pearce &amp; Gregersen, 1991</xref>). One possible explanation relates to a cognitive mechanism through which interdependence affects job outcomes; interdependence implies more opportunities to learn from others through knowledge transfer. It could also be that individuals who experience increased interdependence are likely to feel responsible for coworkers whose work depends on them and thus engage in more helping. In contrast, other research indicates that interdependence reduces motivation and work satisfaction via decreased autonomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr124-0021886312469254">Thompson, 1967</xref>). Early studies on the effects of interdependence on worker outcomes conducted with coal miners support this idea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr125-0021886312469254">Trist &amp; Bamforth, 1951</xref>). Similarly, interdependence involves relying on others for important resources and information and being tied to the timing and tasks of others, leading to less autonomy to act and less self-starting behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr134-0021886312469254">Wrzesniewski &amp; Dutton, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>These inconsistent findings suggest that the effects of interdependence are intriguing and clearly not well understood yet. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr124-0021886312469254">Thompson (1967)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr134-0021886312469254">Wrzesniewski and Dutton (2001)</xref>, we argue that interdependence has a negative impact on adaptive and proactive behaviors. Interdependence acts as a situational constraint on individuals and thus it is likely to be appraised by individuals as a threat to the achievement of individual goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0021886312469254">Crawford et al., 2010</xref>). Interdependence acts as a hindrance job demand and should impede individually initiated changes in one’s job. Furthermore, adaptive and proactive behaviors are generally directed toward changing aspects of one’s own job and not toward other colleagues, like citizenship behavior. As such, we do not expect interdependence to positively affect adaptive and proactive behaviors via felt responsibility for others. Instead, interdependence should have a negative impact on adaptive and proactive behaviors via decreased autonomy. Therefore, we hypothesize the following:</p>

<title>The Moderating Role of Job Resources</title>
<p>The job demands–resources theory proposes that job resources can buffer the impact of job demands on individual well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021886312469254">Bakker &amp; Demerouti, 2007</xref>). Since job resources are functional in achieving work goals and stimulate personal growth, they can provide additional support when individuals face high job demands, by reducing the level of cognitive or emotional effort necessary to cope with these demands. This is consistent with the demands–control theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0021886312469254">Karasek, 1998</xref>), in that job strain is caused by a combination of high job demands and low job control. A premise of the theory is that employees who can decide themselves how to meet their job demands (i.e., high job control) do not experience job strain. This suggests that job control moderates the relationship between job demands and individual well-being outcomes. The job demands–resources theory expands this line of thought and proposes that several different job resources can play a buffering role for various job demands. In particular, the job demands and resources that are important in this moderating relationship depend on the specific job characteristics in a particular setting. Job resources can reduce the tendency of job demands to generate specific stressors, alter the individual perceptions and cognitions triggered by these stressors, moderate the individual responses that follow the appraisal process, or reduce the negative consequences of these responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0021886312469254">Kahn &amp; Byosserie, 1992</xref>). In addition, the job demands–resources theory predicts that job resources particularly influence motivation and work engagement when job demands are high, further suggesting a moderating effect of job resources on the relationship between job demands and individual outcomes.</p>
<p>We propose that discretion and social ties (i.e., job resources) moderate the impact of complexity and interdependence (i.e., job demands) on special ed teachers’ adaptive and proactive behaviors. First, high discretion evokes the experience of job control, by making teachers feel that they can better control the job demands associated with high job complexity and task interdependence. Job discretion is also associated with more opportunities to cope with demanding situations, such as those characterized by increased complexity and interdependence with others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021886312469254">Bakker &amp; Demerouti, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0021886312469254">Karasek, 1998</xref>). Second, stronger social ties are associated with increased social support from coworkers, which is functional in achieving work goals. Social ties provide instrumental help and emotional support from colleagues, which can aid teachers in coping with job demands, facilitate their performance, and protect them from the pathological consequences of stressful experiences associated with high job demands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0021886312469254">Cohen &amp; Wills, 1985</xref>). In addition, social ties provide additional resources, such as access to critical knowledge or physical assistance in the classroom that better enable teachers to deal with job demands and accomplish their work objectives. Thus, higher discretion and stronger social ties further assist teachers to meet challenge demands and reduce the negative effect of hindrance demands by providing additional socioemotional and cognitive support. We expect that the relationship between complexity and adaptive and proactive behaviors is stronger for higher levels of discretion and stronger social ties because of the increased availability of resources and the motivational impact of socioemotional support. Similarly, we expect that the relationship between interdependence and adaptive and proactive behaviors will be less negative for higher levels of discretion and stronger social ties because of the additional resources and emotional support provided. Therefore, we hypothesize the following:</p>

<sec id="section9-0021886312469254">
<title>Research Setting, Sample, and Procedures</title>
<p>We conducted our research in an urban public school district in the Northeastern United States as part of a larger study of district reform, social capital, and new curriculum implementation. The school district in the study was undergoing a major change initiative focused on scaling up a new mathematics curriculum district-wide, as part of a broader effort to improve mathematics teaching and learning. With regard to the various typologies of organizational change, the change investigated here was an evolutionary, incremental change, consisting of incremental steps taken to improve math instruction and enhance student learning. Implementation of the new curriculum required changes in teachers’ job behavior, with regard to actions to adapt teaching practice to new demands and proactively introduce new, more effective teaching approaches using the new curriculum. The district policy emphasized teacher collaboration on curriculum planning and student assessment, given the accumulated evidence that teachers’ professional communities play an important role in policy implementation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0021886312469254">Coburn, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0021886312469254">Louis &amp; Marks, 1998</xref>). However, change implementation in the form of actual instruction was done independently by each teacher in her classroom.</p>
<p>Teaching in public schools has been characterized by high job discretion, allowing teachers considerable opportunity to adapt and change work methods and procedures in their classroom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr129-0021886312469254">Warren, 1975</xref>). However, discretion levels vary across contexts. Each school shapes the context in which teachers work through the structures, controls, and operating principles it enacts to comply with district mandates, which may limit or enhance teacher discretion, interdependence, and job complexity. In addition, teachers’ professional networks within each school are thought to significantly influence teaching practice and, as a result, new curriculum implementation. Increasingly, policy makers have begun to include provisions aimed at fostering teacher professional community as part of policy and reform initiatives, such as activities that allow teachers to interact with their colleagues with regard to teaching and learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0021886312469254">Coburn &amp; Russell, 2008</xref>). Prior education research suggests that teachers’ professional communities provide the trust necessary for risk taking, access to expertise to support learning, and opportunities for teachers to negotiate the meaning and implications of reform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021886312469254">Bryk &amp; Schneider, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0021886312469254">Coburn, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Special ed teachers face particular challenges in their work. Because of the unique and changing needs of their students, teachers need to adapt or devise new approaches to tailor and expand their work practice. In the context of the change introduced by the school district, these behaviors are even more critical to teachers’ effectiveness since the district relied on teachers to find, improve, and refine their teaching of the new curriculum. Furthermore, adaptive behavior and being proactive can be instrumental in motivating and retaining teachers. Turnover among special ed teachers is especially costly, given the advanced certifications and education credentials required to be considered “qualified” for the job. Quit rates are quite high among all public school teachers in many urban districts and even higher among special ed teachers, whose work is seen as more demanding and “special,” and thus outside the core educational practice of the public school. In part because of their inherent “outsider” status, special ed teachers tend to report lower levels of support in their schools than do other teachers. This situation is further complicated by shortages of certified special ed teachers in many schools and districts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0021886312469254">Kozleski, Mainzer, &amp; Deschler, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>We surveyed all special ed teachers in 204 elementary schools in the district. Surveys were distributed by teacher representatives and completed during paid after-school time. To ensure anonymity of respondents, the completed surveys were mailed directly to a third party for data entry where a code was also assigned so that individual survey responses could be matched to archival data. Teachers each received a $10 gift card for their participation in the study. Of the targeted 204 schools, 200 participated in the study, yielding a school-level response rate of 98%. We received full data on teachers and schools in 77% of the 204 schools for a final sample of 157 schools that were used in the analyses. Of the 807 special ed teachers assigned to these schools, 621 returned usable surveys, representing a response rate of 77%. We combined the teacher surveys and the archival data to develop a multilevel data set that enabled us to statistically model the variables across two levels of analysis: individual (621 special ed teachers) and organization (157 schools). Eighty-nine percent of the participants were women. The average age of participants was between 35 and 44 years. On average, participants had 5 years of teaching experience (<italic>SD</italic> = 2 years). Twenty-seven percent of teachers (<italic>n</italic> = 170) were team teaching, with the remaining 451 teachers working in stand-alone classrooms.</p>

<sec id="section10-0021886312469254">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>We assessed <italic>adaptive and proactive behavior</italic> using context-appropriate measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0021886312469254">Morrison &amp; Phelps, 1999</xref>). Our rationale for developing context-specific measures of adaptive and proactive behaviors stems from our theory. Identifying a behavior as adaptive or proactive depends in large part on the type of job being done (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0021886312469254">Frese &amp; Fay, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-0021886312469254">Parker et al., 2006</xref>). Unlike PI, which has been conceptualized as a relatively stable behavioral tendency but similar to taking charge, adaptive and proactive behaviors vary depending on the situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0021886312469254">Frese et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0021886312469254">Morrison &amp; Phelps, 1999</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0021886312469254">Frese and Fay (2001)</xref> support this proposition with the example of developing a total quality management program. Such a program may be construed as self-starting behavior for a manager in an African context, given what is normal and expected; however, for an American manager, the same action is not considered self-starting, proactive behavior because it is simply following the lead of others. Thus, developing context-specific measures seems an appropriate strategy for our study. There are also methodological reasons for developing context-specific measures. Rather than using general statements such as “I make things happen” that reflect proactivity-centered values, context-specific measures are “more likely to result in a valid self-assessment because the socially desirable responses are less obvious” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-0021886312469254">Parker et al., 2006</xref>, p. 642).</p>
<p>We followed an approach similar to the one used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-0021886312469254">Parker et al. (2006)</xref> to develop our measures. We began our research with observations of special ed teachers and open-ended interviews with teachers, school administrators, and subject matter experts in the school district under study. Our aim was to better understand the nature of teachers’ work; how teachers dealt with the various issues of new curriculum implementation in their classrooms; and how teachers’ work context influenced their work. Our interviews were guided by insights from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0021886312469254">Griffin et al.’s (2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0021886312469254">2010)</xref> theory of work performance emphasizing the critical role of adaptive and proactive dimensions of performance during organizational change. Based on our observations and interviews, we developed a list of more than 20 distinct behaviors that teachers considered important for job performance for the new curriculum implementation. These answers reflected job behaviors aimed at adapting to new demands and proactively initiating changes in work methods to improve the delivery of the new curriculum.</p>
<p>Of this set of behaviors, we identified the most “adaptive” and “proactive” in the following way. We used these behaviors as input for a focus group discussion with subject matter experts in the school district. These experts had considerable experience teaching special ed students themselves and coaching other teachers in the district and thus were aware of various teaching issues that transcended a specific school. The purpose of the focus group was to refine a sample of the adaptive and proactive behaviors identified by teachers that would be representative of teachers’ adaptive and proactive behaviors and show variance in the extent of use among teachers. The focus group narrowed the initial list of behaviors to 10 items, with 6 items for adaptive behavior and 4 items for proactive behavior. These 10 items were adopted as our survey measures. The focus group also helped us determine the most appropriate anchors to use with our adaptive and proactive behavior scales.</p>
<p>The survey items asked teachers to answer how often they engaged in these behaviors to make their use of the new mathematics curriculum more effective. The adaptive behavior measure (6 items) included “Teach concepts in small steps that are more manageable for some students;” “Provide shorter problems or fewer assignments for some students;” “Allow extra time for students to complete tasks;” “Use flexible grouping to meet individual student needs;” “Have different performance expectations for students in the same class;” and “Use alternate multi-sensory means to teach a concept to some students” (α = .78). The proactive behavior measure (four items) included “Use your own math games for students;” “Use songs you wrote to help recall facts;” “Use math resources you found on the internet;” and “Use math materials you purchased with your own money” (α = .71). The response format captured the frequency of using each behavior in the classroom and was informed by our focus group discussions (5-point scale; 1 = <italic>never</italic>; 5 = <italic>for all class sessions</italic>). We should note that we used self-assessments because individuals have easier access to and more readily available examples of their own behaviors and can potentially detect behavior differences to a greater extent than their supervisors or coworkers. Using self-assessments of adaptive and proactive behaviors also avoids a potential halo effect of external raters who are more likely to base assessments on overall impressions or observe behaviors designed to impress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0021886312469254">Janssen, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0021886312469254">Parker &amp; Collins, 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>Task discretion</title>
<p>Task discretion was measured with six items adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0021886312469254">Jehn (1995)</xref> to fit the context of our setting. These items asked respondents to indicate the extent to which they felt they had freedom to experiment with new methods, alter their teaching approach, and have autonomy to solve teaching-related problems (5-point scale; 1 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic>; 5 = <italic>strongly agree</italic>; α = .79). We measured <italic>social ties</italic> by assessing how often teachers talked about work-related issues with other special ed teachers in the school. Since the research was part of a larger study focused on the practice of mathematics instruction, we asked teachers to report on how often in the past month they talked with other special ed teachers in their school about mathematics instruction. The frequency data, originally continuous variables, were recoded on a 1 to 5 scale (1 = <italic>low frequency</italic>, 5 = <italic>high frequency</italic>) to correct skewness. Based on information gleaned from interview and focus group discussions, we measured <italic>task complexity</italic> as the range of special needs among students in the teacher’s classroom. If teachers have students with different physical and mental disabilities, they must both differentiate and integrate their teaching to accommodate the range of disabilities and facilitate a cohesive learning experience for the class as a whole. Discussions with special ed experts revealed that the various types of disability conditions (e.g., learning disability, speech or language impairment, emotional disturbance, autism, orthopedic impairment) could not be ranked clearly according to their relative complexity, so we did not attempt to rank them in such a manner. Instead, task complexity was measured as the number of different disabilities represented among children in the teacher’s classroom. <italic>Task interdependence</italic> was measured with a three-item scale adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0021886312469254">Campion et al. (1993)</xref> to fit the context of our research. The items captured the extent to which each teacher depended on other teachers in the school, and other teachers depended on her, for information, teaching materials, and so on to get their work done. The responses were anchored on a 5-point scale (1 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic>; 5 = <italic>strongly agree</italic>; α = .71, higher than the .61 and .70 reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0021886312469254">Campion et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0021886312469254">Campion, Papper, &amp; Medsker, 1996</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section12-0021886312469254">
<title>Control variables</title>
<p>We controlled for several individual and organizational variables-teacher experience, coworkers’ adaptive and proactive behaviors, team teaching, school size, total number of special ed teachers in the school, school socioeconomic status (SES). In controlling for <italic>teachers’ experience on the job</italic>, we reasoned that individuals with more experience develop higher levels of tacit knowledge and a broader repertoire of work behaviors. We measured experience by asking teachers to report on the number of years they have spent in the teaching profession. To ensure that our measures of adaptive and proactive behaviors reflect the performance of individual teachers rather than the behavioral norms for the school as a whole, we controlled for <italic>coworkers’ adaptive and proactive behavior</italic>. Since coworkers are an important source of information and cues regarding appropriate work behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr115-0021886312469254">Salancik &amp; Pfeffer, 1978</xref>), coworkers’ behavior may influence individuals’ adaptive and proactive behaviors. We measured coworkers’ adaptive behavior by averaging individual adaptive behavior across all special ed teachers within the focal teacher’s school, except the focal teacher. We followed the same approach to assess coworkers’ proactive behavior.</p>
<p>Since <italic>team teaching</italic> was introduced in some schools in the district under study as an approach to integrate special ed students into regular classrooms, we included it as a control variable. Teachers in our sample worked in either a stand-alone classroom (i.e., individual teaching) or a team-based classroom (i.e., team teaching). Teachers in team-based classrooms worked in dyads, with each special ed teacher paired with a regular classroom teacher. Team teaching was measured with a dichotomous variable indicating whether the teacher worked in a <italic>team based</italic> (coded 1) or <italic>individual classroom</italic> (coded 0). Of the 621 teachers in the final sample, 451 teachers worked in individual classrooms (73% of the teachers) and 170 teachers were team teaching (27% of the teachers). We also controlled for <italic>school size</italic> since larger schools may have more bureaucratic structures and place more constraints on what teachers can do in the classrooms, thus affecting adaptive and proactive work behaviors. School size was measured as the total number of teachers in the school. Furthermore, we controlled for the <italic>number of special education teachers in the school</italic> because it may affect the frequency of individual interactions with peers. Finally, we controlled for the overall SES of the student population in each school. School SES has been shown to have profound effects on student performance as well as teachers’ approaches to instruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr113-0021886312469254">Rosenholtz &amp; Simpson, 1990</xref>). SES can influence teachers’ motivation to take initiative beyond the proficiency standards of their jobs since low-SES schools are generally viewed as more challenging work environments by teachers and are associated with lower teacher satisfaction and retention rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0021886312469254">Louis &amp; Marks, 1998</xref>). Following convention in the literature, SES was measured as the percentage of the student body in a school eligible for government-subsidized lunches. A higher SES score indicates that there are more children enrolled in subsidized meal plans and denotes a school with a less affluent student population.</p>

<title>Analytic Approach</title>
<p>Since our data structure is hierarchical, with 621 teachers nested in 157 schools, the independence of observations assumption that underlies ordinary last squares regression cannot be assured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-0021886312469254">Raudenbush &amp; Bryk, 2002</xref>). We used hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) to test the main and cross-level effects of individual-level variables (discretion, social ties, complexity, interdependence, and individual-level controls—experience and team teaching) and organization-level variables (school-level controls—school SES, school size, number of special ed teachers in school, and coworkers’ adaptive and proactive behaviors) on teachers’ adaptive and proactive behaviors. We specified individual teachers as the Level-1 data and schools as the Level-2 data. To estimate the magnitude of variation between schools in adaptive and proactive behaviors, we first tested a model with no predictors at either level for each dependent variable (referred to in the HLM analysis as the unconditional model). Variance decomposition between the two levels of analysis showed that for adaptive behavior, 82% of the total variance lies at the individual level and 18% at the organizational level (χ<sup>2</sup> = 283.08, <italic>df</italic> = 156, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). For proactive behavior, 91% of the total variance lies at the individual level and 9% at the organizational level (χ<sup>2</sup> = 228.92, <italic>df</italic> = 156, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Thus, we concluded that HLM analyses are appropriate.</p>
<p>Because some of the measures we used were gathered from the same source, we followed suggestions in the literature to investigate whether common method approach biased our data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-0021886312469254">Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Lee, &amp; Podsakoff, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-0021886312469254">Podsakoff &amp; Organ, 1986</xref>). First, we took measures to minimize common method bias by intermixing items of different constructs in our questionnaire, using different response formats for the dependent and independent variables, and protecting respondent anonymity. Second, we conducted Hartman’s single-factor test on the items in all our variables (discretion, interdependence, complexity, social ties, adaptive and proactive behaviors). If common method variance was a problem, then the results would show that a single general factor explained a majority of the variance. Results showed that the unrotated principal components solution extracted six components with eigenvalues greater than 1, and the first component accounted for only 20% of the variance. Thus, common method variance is not a serious problem in our survey data.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>We performed a confirmatory factor analysis to assess discriminant validity among our survey-based measures—discretion, interdependence, adaptive behavior, and proactive behavior. The confirmatory factor analysis for the four-factor model (with all items in the survey-based constructs loading on their expected factors) achieved acceptable fit with a comparative fit index (CFI) of .96 and a root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) of .053. Both the CFI and the RMSEA satisfied the cutoff criteria suggested in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021886312469254">Bentler, 1992</xref>). Next, we examined the extent to which respondents distinguished between adaptive and proactive behavior. We compared the four-factor model with a three-factor model, in which adaptive and proactive behavior items were specified as loading on the same factor. Compared with the four-factor model, the three-factor model yielded a poor fit (CFI = .83 and RMSEA = .105). Thus, the four-factor model was superior to the three-factor model (χ<sup>2</sup> diff = 464.46, <italic>df</italic> = 3, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). Finally, we compared an unconstrained model (where the correlation coefficient between adaptive and proactive behavior was freely estimated) with a constrained model (with the correlation coefficient between adaptive and proactive behavior restricted to 1.0; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021886312469254">Bagozzi, Yi, &amp; Phillips, 1991</xref>). The unconstrained model displayed superior fit to the data (χ<sup>2</sup> diff = 426.15, <italic>df</italic> = 1, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). Thus, adaptive and proactive behaviors are distinct constructs empirically in our sample.</p>

<title>Direct Effects of Job Resources and Job Demands</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0021886312469254">Table 2</xref> shows the means, standard deviations (<italic>SD</italic>s), and zero-order correlations of the variables in the study. In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0021886312469254">Table 3</xref>, we show the relationship between the predictor variables and adaptive and proactive behaviors. Models 1a and 2a show the relationship between the control variables and adaptive and proactive behaviors. As expected, coworkers’ adaptive behavior has a strong positive relationship with a focal teacher’s adaptive behavior (β = .06, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). We find a similar relationship between coworkers’ proactive behavior and the focal teacher’s proactive behavior (β= .19, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). Furthermore, team teaching is negatively associated with adaptive behavior (β = −.29, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), indicating that working in a team setting constrains a teacher’s opportunities to be more adaptive. Experience is marginally associated with adaptive (β = .01, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .10) and proactive behavior (β = .02, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .10), suggesting that more experienced teachers tend to adapt to various demands more frequently and be more proactive in their jobs. Teachers in schools with larger numbers of special ed teachers are marginally less adaptive in their teaching practice. Finally, school size and SES are not significantly related to adaptive or proactive behavior.</p>

<p>With regard to job resources, our hypotheses suggest that teachers who report greater discretion (Hypothesis 1a) and stronger social ties (Hypothesis 1b) engage in more adaptive and proactive behaviors. Models 1b and 2b in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0021886312469254">Table 3</xref> show that discretion is positively related to adaptive (β = .11, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and proactive behavior (β = .23, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), lending strong support to Hypothesis 1a. We also found that strong social ties are positively related to both adaptive (β = .05, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) and proactive behavior (β = .06, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), providing strong support for Hypothesis 1b.</p>
<p>With regard to job demands, our hypotheses suggest that teachers who experience increased complexity engage in more adaptive and proactive behaviors (Hypothesis 2a), whereas teachers who experience increased interdependence engage in less adaptive and proactive behaviors (Hypothesis 2b). Models 1b and 2b in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0021886312469254">Table 3</xref> show that complexity is positively related to proactive behavior (β = .06, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), but is not related to adaptive behavior (β = .01, <italic>ns</italic>), lending partial support to Hypothesis 2a. We also found that interdependence is negatively related to adaptive behavior, as hypothesized (β = −.06, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). Interestingly, we found that interdependence has a significant positive relationship with proactive behavior (β = .09, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). Thus, Hypothesis 2b was partially supported.</p>
<p>Recall that the majority of the variance in adaptive (82%) and proactive (91%) behavior resides between individuals rather than between schools. Our analysis of adaptive and proactive behaviors employs HLM, limiting our ability to meaningfully describe explained variance in terms of an overall level. Instead, we computed the proportional reduction in unexplained variance at each level of analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-0021886312469254">Raudenbush &amp; Bryk, 2002</xref>). As reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0021886312469254">Table 3</xref>, our direct effects models (Models 1b and 2b) explain 19% of the between-individual variance in adaptive behavior and 42% of the between-individual variance in proactive behavior, compared with our control models (Models 1a and 2a). Taking into account our control variables at the individual and organizational level, our direct effect model for adaptive behavior explains 28% of the between-individual variance in adaptive behavior and 23% of the between-school variance, compared with a null model (i.e., no predictors entered). For proactive behavior, our direct effect model explains 43% of the between-individual variance and 83% of the between-school variance, compared with a null model.</p>

<title>Moderating Effects of Job Resources</title>
<p>We hypothesized that job resources moderate the impact of job demands on adaptive and proactive behaviors (Hypotheses 3a to 3d). Models 1c and 2c in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0021886312469254">Table 3</xref> show the results of the moderation analyses. We found that discretion significantly moderates the effect of complexity on proactive behavior (β = .04, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), indicating that the positive effect of complexity on proactive behavior is even stronger for teachers experiencing higher levels of discretion. Furthermore, social ties significantly moderate the effect of interdependence on adaptive behavior (β = .04, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), indicating that the impact of interdependence on adaptive behavior is less negative for teachers with stronger social ties. However, discretion does not moderate the effect of complexity on adaptive behavior. The moderating effect of social ties on the relationship between interdependence and proactive behavior was only marginally significant (β = .03, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .10). Thus, we found partial support for Hypotheses 3a and 3d. Furthermore, the impact of complexity on adaptive and proactive behaviors was not moderated by social ties, indicating no support for Hypothesis 3b. Finally, we did not find any moderating effects of discretion on the relationship between interdependence and adaptive and proactive behaviors. Thus, Hypothesis 3c was not supported. Each of our interaction models (Model 1c and 2c) explains an additional 1% between-individual variance in adaptive and proactive behavior, respectively, compared with the main effect models (Models 1b and 2b).</p>
<p>To examine the nature of the significant interactions found, we first plotted simple regression lines representing the relationship between complexity and proactive behavior separately for low (1 <italic>SD</italic> below the mean) and high (1 <italic>SD</italic> above the mean) levels of discretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021886312469254">Figure 2A</xref>). We analyzed the interactions following the approach suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-0021886312469254">Preacher, Curran, and Bauer (2006)</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021886312469254">Figure 2A</xref>, social ties had a significant boosting effect on the relationship between interdependence and adaptive behavior. In terms of the magnitude of this effect, a 1 <italic>SD</italic> increase in interdependence is associated with a 0.02% decrease in adaptive behavior for teachers with weak social ties but a 10.5% increase in adaptive behavior for teachers with strong social ties. We also plotted simple regression lines representing the relationship between interdependence and adaptive behavior for weak (1 <italic>SD</italic> below the mean) and strong (1 <italic>SD</italic> above the mean) social ties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021886312469254">Figure 2B</xref>). As shown, discretion had a significant boosting effect on the relationship between complexity and proactive behavior. In terms of the magnitude of this effect, a 1 <italic>SD</italic> increase in complexity is associated with a 25.9% increase in proactive behavior for teachers with low discretion, and a much larger 37.1% increase in proactive behavior for teachers with high discretion.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In times of organizational change, employees must adapt to new demands and proactively implement new ideas to make the change efforts successful. Although scholars have recognized that organizational change success is ultimately contingent on changing individual behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-0021886312469254">Robertson, Roberts, &amp; Porras, 1993</xref>), little research has considered how to promote employee adaptivity and proactivity, behaviors with particular relevance to organizational change. Since adaptivity and proactivity are emergent and cannot be prescribed in advance, change leaders face a challenge in that they cannot simply direct employees to be more adaptive and proactive. Instead, change leaders can encourage adaptivity and proactivity by shaping a work environment that stimulates these behaviors. Our findings suggest that employees’ proximal work context, in both its task and relational aspects, can motivate more adaptivity and proactivity. These findings converge with those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0021886312469254">Fuller et al. (2006)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0021886312469254">Hornung and Rousseau (2007)</xref>, who found that employees enjoying more autonomy and increased access to information and resources are better positioned to be more proactive and support organizational change.</p>
<p>Our results show that adaptivity and proactivity are distinct types of change-oriented behavior that relate to features of the job. With regard to broader patterns that emerged from our data, discretion and social ties had a positive impact on adaptive and proactive behaviors, consistent with our hypotheses. Furthermore, and consistent with our predictions, complexity was associated with more teacher proactive behavior. However, teachers experiencing increased complexity did not engage in more adaptive behavior. This comports with earlier arguments in the organizational learning literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0021886312469254">March, 1991</xref>) suggesting that complex job demands are associated with the generation of new routines and work practices (i.e., proactive exploration), but not with the selection among existing routines and practices (i.e., adaptive exploitation). In addition, our findings highlight the importance of discretion and social ties in encouraging the behaviors that are so critical for implementing incremental change (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021886312469254">Table 1</xref>). In such contexts, organizations rely on employees’ continuous efforts to adapt to new circumstances, cope with changes in tasks, proactively solve problems, and initiate improvements.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we found that interdependence had a negative impact on adaptive behavior, as hypothesized, but a positive impact on proactive behavior. The negative impact on adaptive behavior is consistent with our hypothesis that interdependence was experienced by teachers as a hindrance demand. The finding that interdependence leads to more proactivity is intriguing, given earlier arguments in organizational literature suggesting that interdependence is a constraint on change-oriented behaviors such as job crafting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr134-0021886312469254">Wrzesniewski &amp; Dutton, 2001</xref>). It may be that more interdependent workers had more opportunities to draw on expanded resources and ideas from others and thus become more proactive. The benefits of increased interdependence may be greater when rewards and feedback, like goals, are provided at the group level, congruent with the interdependent nature of work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr127-0021886312469254">Wageman, 1995</xref>). Since job effectiveness for special ed teachers is dependent on information and resources from various others, such as psychologists, social workers, school administrators, occupational and physical therapists, and other teachers, this outcome interdependence may have provided teachers with increased motivation to draw on diverse knowledge and proactively initiate improvements in their practice. This is consistent with research suggesting that interdependence has more benefits in diverse groups because it encourages cooperation and sharing of information from novel perspectives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0021886312469254">Jehn, Northcraft, &amp; Neal, 1999</xref>). Finally, it could also be that individuals experience interdependence as a hindrance and a challenge simultaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0021886312469254">Lazarus &amp; Folkman, 1984</xref>). However, more research is needed to understand how interdependence influences proactivity.</p>
<p>With regard to moderating effects, we found that complexity was associated with more proactive behavior for teachers experiencing increased discretion compared with those who reported lower discretion. Similarly, interdependence was associated with more adaptive behavior for teachers with strong social ties with peers compared with those whose social ties were weak. These findings are consistent with the buffering hypothesis regarding the moderating impact of job resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021886312469254">Bakker &amp; Demerouti, 2007</xref>). However, we were surprised by the lack of support for the interaction between discretion and interdependence and between social ties and complexity. Recently, scholars have highlighted some costs of individual discretion under conditions of high interdependence. When interdependence is high, individual autonomy can undermine group performance by reducing group cohesiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0021886312469254">Langfred, 2005</xref>). When interdependence is low, individual autonomy facilitates the motivation and performance benefits predicted by the job characteristics theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0021886312469254">Fried &amp; Ferris, 1987</xref>). This suggests an interaction effect in the opposite direction than our prediction. However, in our case, these interactions were not significant, suggesting that more research is needed to better understand these effects. Finally, since interaction effects are often difficult to detect in field studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0021886312469254">McClelland &amp; Judd, 1993</xref>), we may have not been able to detect a significant moderation effect with our sample. Clearly, the interactions in our study suggest potentially important relationships that may warrant further study.</p>
<p>The effects of some of the control variables considered in our analysis are also noteworthy. For instance, teacher experience was positively associated with both adaptive and proactive behavior. This suggests that more experienced teachers were likely to develop more tacit knowledge and a broader repertoire of work behaviors to use when facing changing work demands. Furthermore, team teaching was negatively related to adaptive behavior, indicating that working collaboratively in a team reduces one’s ability to adapt to the challenges inherent in changing situations. This finding is consistent with those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021886312469254">Berg et al. (2010)</xref>, who argued that one’s relative invisibility in the social system of the organization endows people with a greater sense of freedom to be adaptive. In our study, special ed teachers working alone in the classroom were less visible to other teachers than their colleagues working in collaborative classrooms. In addition, our results suggest that peer norms have a significant impact on teacher behavior. In particular, teachers embedded in schools where their coworkers engaged in more frequent adaptive and proactive behaviors were more likely to be themselves more adaptive and proactive, respectively. This is consistent with earlier research suggesting that teachers’ professional communities play an important role in change policy implementation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0021886312469254">Louis &amp; Marks, 1998</xref>). Finally, we should note that we did not have access to school overall performance data. Controlling for school performance in our analysis would have allowed us to ensure adaptive and proactive behaviors do not reflect a boost in self-efficacy due to school-level factors. It could be argued that teachers in high-performing schools (i.e., higher student scores) may be more willing to take risks and be more proactive in dealing with changing demands because of their increased self-efficacy.</p>
<p>Our research has implications for organizational change theory and practice. The change context investigated in this research, the implementation of a new mathematics curriculum in public schools, highlights an important aspect of planned organizational change. Change that alters performance goals and work roles encourages employees to adapt to changing demands, as well as anticipate, plan ahead, and act in advance to create change. Our research underscores the importance of individual behavioral change in models of planned organizational change. Indeed, without individual behavioral change, successful organizational change is not possible. In addition, our findings suggest that organizations undergoing change may facilitate these behaviors by allowing increased discretion and encouraging social interaction with coworkers. Since organizations often cannot reduce the demands placed on employees (i.e., decrease complexity or interdependence with others), our research suggests an avenue to increase adaptivity and proactivity in challenging situations—that is, providing more resources that increase flexibility, access to knowledge, and social support from others. Of course, the public school context in our research allows for increased levels of discretion and social interaction with coworkers, given the nature of the teaching occupation. In other organizational contexts, this may be done through job rotation, developing broader skills, sharing information about the larger context in which one’s job is performed, enhanced opportunities for interactions with coworkers, and increased discretion in decision making related to one’s job.</p>
<p>The interaction of social ties and interdependence suggests some practical implications for managing organizational change. In order to mitigate the limited opportunities that interdependent work provides for individual adaptation to change, change leaders can encourage the development of stronger professional communities at work. Our findings highlight the critical role of employees’ professional communities at work in providing interdependent workers the trust necessary for taking risks to be proactive during change; in addition, professional communities at work offer employees the opportunity to negotiate the meaning of change and its implications for each individual involved in organizational change.</p>
<p>Our results further suggest that adaptivity and proactivity can be useful in managing efforts at two stages of the change process. First, active employee involvement in the change process (i.e., through increased opportunities to have a say in how employees deal with the change) is an important influence strategy that change leaders can use to create readiness for change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021886312469254">Armenakis &amp; Harris, 2009</xref>). Active participation through adaptivity and proactivity contributes to increased feelings of efficacy that underlie employees’ readiness for change and their motives to support the change. Second, adaptivity and proactivity are important aspects in the change adoption and institutionalization phase (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021886312469254">Table 1</xref>). They allow individuals to adapt effectively to new circumstances created by the change and initiate changes in their work that are consistent with the larger change effort. In addition, employees who are adaptive and proactive during change will be more committed to the change process, will internalize the change effort, and contribute to its institutionalization.</p>
<p>From a theory perspective, our study complements previous research on change antecedents, such as innovative climate, access to strategy information, and supportive and visionary leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0021886312469254">Choi, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0021886312469254">Griffin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr128-0021886312469254">Wanberg &amp; Banas, 2000</xref>). Our research highlights the importance of more proximal factors in an individual’s task and relational context that encourage adaptive and proactive behaviors during change. Of course, contextual factors are unlikely to be sufficient on their own in increasing adaptivity and proactivity during change. When enabling contextual factors are present, individuals will be more adaptive and proactive if critical beliefs, such as self-efficacy and felt responsibility for change are activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0021886312469254">Choi, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0021886312469254">Fuller et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0021886312469254">Hornung &amp; Rousseau, 2007</xref>). The importance of these beliefs for implementing change gives rise to the question as to how one can build greater self-efficacy and felt responsibility for change. Evidence suggests that role breadth self-efficacy can be enhanced over time through enriched work design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0021886312469254">Hornung &amp; Rousseau, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0021886312469254">Parker, 1998</xref>). Of course, we did not have data to test these mediating effects, but future research should examine in more depth the intervening mechanisms through which the task and relational facets of work context encourage adaptivity and proactivity during change.</p>
<p>We should also note that individuals’ adaptive and proactive behaviors may also reflect attempts to achieve a better fit between the job and their own skills, motivations, and interests at work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr134-0021886312469254">Wrzesniewski &amp; Dutton, 2001</xref>). In particular, organizational change affects the fit between employees and various aspects of their work environment (person–environment fit; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0021886312469254">O’Reilly, Chatman, &amp; Caldwell, 1991</xref>). Thus, change can trigger realignment of the relationship between individuals and their work environment through individual efforts to adapt to the new work environment and proactively plan and initiate changes. When change alters individual jobs, employees will likely assess the fit and attempt realignment between the new demands and their abilities (person–job fit). Given that organizational change relates to person–environment realignment, and given the important outcomes associated with increased or decreased fit, the direct implication is that organizations undergoing change need to pay attention to fit issues as they can affect employee reactions to and support for change, ultimately affecting the success of change initiatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021886312469254">Caldwell, Herold, &amp; Fedor, 2004</xref>). Indeed, person–environment fit perceptions are important to both employees (i.e., change participants) and managers (i.e., change agents), because they relate to critical outcomes, such as job satisfaction, organizational commitment, and intentions to quit. Since employees tend to focus more on the impact of change on their immediate work environment than on the meaning of the larger organizational-level change, change agents’ assessment of change needs to capture the more proximal impact of change on the daily work routines and practices through change participants’ adaptive and proactive behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021886312469254">Burke &amp; Litwin, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0021886312469254">Lau &amp; Woodman, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Another aspect that is worth discussing is the organizational implications of adaptivity and proactivity. We have argued, consistent with previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0021886312469254">Frese &amp; Fay, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0021886312469254">Griffin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0021886312469254">Morrison &amp; Phelps, 1999</xref>), that adaptivity and proactivity are functional for the organization and facilitate change implementation. Evidence also shows that proactivity leads to increased support for the change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0021886312469254">Hornung &amp; Rousseau, 2007</xref>) and thus should positively influence its success. However, some scholars have recently argued that proactivity may have negative consequences under certain circumstances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021886312469254">Belschak, den Hartog, &amp; Fay, 2010</xref>). For example, high proactivity should lead to positive consequences when employees have high knowledge and skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0021886312469254">Frese et al., 2007</xref>); however, when coupled with low skills, it may lead to low performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0021886312469254">Chan, 2006</xref>) and low ability to be adaptive and proactive during change. However, we did not have the opportunity to measure organizational performance at the end of the change process. This would have allowed us to establish a direct link between teachers’ adaptive and proactive behaviors and change outcomes. We encourage further research in this direction, particularly longitudinal research that unpacks the underlying dynamics of the relationships between work context, adaptive and proactive behaviors, and change outcomes.</p>
<p>We extend organizational research by examining the impact of job resources and demands on active job performance facets that are critical for the success of organizational change. Recently, the job design literature has begun to depict a more fluid image of work roles, a more agentic view of job holders as crafters of their work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr134-0021886312469254">Wrzesniewski &amp; Dutton, 2001</xref>), and a more relational view of job design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0021886312469254">Grant &amp; Parker, 2009</xref>). We focus on these emergent work behaviors, distinguish theoretically and empirically between two forms of such behavior—adaptive and proactive—and incorporate relational elements of context in our model of adaptive and proactive performance. In addition, we provide evidence that change-oriented behaviors are socially embedded processes. We found that the relational context of work plays a key role in encouraging both adaptive and proactive behaviors. This enabling role suggests that social ties may shape the opportunities available to be adaptive and proactive at work and the perceived ability to act on these opportunities during change. Within the context of reform initiatives in public schools, our findings show that school administrators can encourage adaptive and proactive behaviors during change through enabling contexts that allow teachers to use the discretion and complexity in their work and by encouraging contexts where teachers can form stronger social ties.</p>
<sec id="section18-0021886312469254">
<title>Strengths and Limitations of the Research</title>
<p>Our study is not without limitations. Many of our measures are employee self-reports, including our measures of adaptive and proactive behaviors, and thus the relationships among the variables could be inflated by common method bias. However, as discussed earlier, there are good reasons why we used self-assessments of adaptive and proactive behaviors. Individuals have easier access and more readily available examples of their own behaviors and can potentially detect differences among their behaviors to a greater extent than supervisors or coworkers. Using self-assessments of adaptive and proactive behaviors is also likely to produce more accurate results by avoiding the potential halo effect of external raters who can base their assessments on overall impressions as well as observe behaviors designed to impress supervisors. In addition, self-report measures are a valid approach to measuring proactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-0021886312469254">Parker et al., 2006</xref>). Furthermore, some of our context variables are objective measures (i.e., complexity) and thus should limit the potential for common method bias. To further minimize the potential for common method bias, we intermixed items of different constructs on the questionnaire, used different response formats for the dependent and independent variables, and protected respondent anonymity.</p>
<p>Another limitation of our study is that all variables were measured at one point in time, and thus we cannot infer causality. Future research should adopt a longitudinal perspective, thus making possible the inference of causality, and allowing for a reflection of the dynamic nature of adaptive and proactive behaviors and how they contribute to organizational change success. Our study also leaves unanswered an important question about the performance implications of adaptive and proactive behaviors. We have argued that adaptive and proactive behaviors should be positive in the context of new curriculum implementation in public schools. This would seem to be a reasonable assumption but further research is needed to empirically link adaptive and proactive teacher behavior to indicators of school and student performance after the adoption of the new curriculum.</p>
<p>A final limitation of our study is the generalizability of our findings. We collected data across a large number of organizations, which should enhance generalizability. On the other hand, we deliberately developed measures of adaptive and proactive behaviors that are largely context-specific for reasons that we have highlighted in our methods. Of course, this strategy limits the direct applicability of our measures to other change contexts. An advantage of context-specific measures is that general statements for adaptive behavior (i.e., “I adapt well to change”) and proactive behavior (i.e., “I make things happen”) might result in less valid answers because of social desirability, relative to context-specific measures where social desirability is less obvious (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021886312469254">Bindl &amp; Parker, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-0021886312469254">Parker et al., 2006</xref>). Furthermore, generalized measures of proactive behavior tend to capture more of a stable disposition to be proactive (such as proactive personality) than proactive behavior. The problem with measuring a stable disposition as a measure for a situation-specific behavior is that differences across situations might not be captured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021886312469254">Bindl &amp; Parker, 2010</xref>). Of course, besides the low generalizability to other samples, context-specific measures also require more resources than generalized measures because they need to be specifically developed for the research. However, we believe that our approach to operationalizing adaptive and proactive behaviors is applicable to other contexts and thus could be used as a guide for designing measures of these behaviors in other contexts.</p>
<p>In terms of strengths, we gathered data across a large number of individuals and organizations. We also used a mixed-method research strategy by combining observations of work practice, interviews, archival data, and surveys. Therefore, we were able to combine the richness of qualitative work with the rigor of quantitative analysis. Furthermore, we adopted a process perspective on jobs to examine two types of behavior with relevance to managing change in contemporary organizations. Our process perspective recognizes the importance of understanding how work is carried out during change and unpacks its adaptive and proactive components as well as the contextual influences on these behaviors. Research on adaptive and proactive behaviors is a relatively recent undertaking in organizational studies in general, and in change research in particular. Our research highlights the importance of understanding the adaptive and proactive behaviors that employees engage in to make change happen in contemporary organizational settings and provides important insights for managing organizational change.</p>
