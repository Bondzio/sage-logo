<abstract>
<p>Despite the growing literature on social interactions in dementia settings, few studies have investigated ‘friendships’ in people with dementia living in long-term care. ‘Social interactions’ describe communicating, verbally and/or non-verbally, at least once with another person while ‘friendship’ suggests a deeper, more meaningful connection that may include reciprocity, intimacy, and shared trust. During a 6-month, mixed-methods study, we investigated friendships among 31 assisted living residents with moderate to advanced dementia. Results revealed no correlation between test scores or demographic characteristics (except gender) and friendship dyads identified by staff. Staffs’ perceptions of residents’ friendships were not supported through our observations. We did observe friendships among residents characterized by voluntary participation and accommodation in conversation, and recognition of the uniqueness of the other. Findings suggest staff perceptions of residents’ friendships are not sufficient and that more research on this topic is needed.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1471301211421186" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>The word ‘friendship’ in the context of long-term care and dementia is often a <italic>de facto</italic> reference to friendships established before any cognitive changes occurred, or to friendly people a person with dementia may encounter (e.g. the receptionist at the doctor's office, staff members of a residential facility). Rarely is the typical meaning of ‘friendship’ explored in this group, especially in people with advanced dementia living in long-term care. Although definitions may differ, ‘friendship’ is usually described as a voluntary, affective tie between two individuals who recognize each other as distinct people with unique characteristics. Friends choose to spend time with each other and come to know their friends’ unique traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1471301211421186">Howes &amp; Mueller, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1471301211421186">Sias &amp; Bartoo, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In the dementia literature, there is a dearth of studies exploring friendships among residents with dementia in long-term care, although there is a growing body of literature on ‘social interactions’ in a variety of special care facilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1471301211421186">Diaz Moore, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1471301211421186">Kelly, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1471301211421186">Kutner, Brown, Stavisky, Clark, &amp; Green, 2000</xref>). ‘Friendship’ in the context of dementia has been defined as ‘continued interaction of specified individuals over an extended time period’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1471301211421186">Kutner et al., 2000</xref>, p. 190), while a ‘social interaction’ can be a one-time occurrence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1471301211421186">Kelly, 1997</xref>). For both terms, number, not quality, of interactions, are the primary components of the definition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1471301211421186">Matthews, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1471301211421186">Kutner et al., 2000</xref>). These definitions are in stark contrast to the broader literature on ‘friendship,’ that includes children and adults, where ‘friendship’ is not reduced to a number of interactions but instead implies reciprocity, a desire to spend time with each other, trust and intimacy, many of which are expressed in a conversational context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1471301211421186">Adams &amp; Blieszner, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1471301211421186">Adams, Blieszner, &amp; de Vries, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1471301211421186">Ertel, Glymour, &amp; Berkman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1471301211421186">Parks and Floyd, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Conversation is not required for friendships to exist, however. Studies on friendships in pre-verbal children, as young as 14 months old, include elements of quality in the definition of friendships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1471301211421186">Howes, 1983</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1471301211421186">1986</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1471301211421186">Howes (1983)</xref>, defined friendships among infants and toddlers as having three necessary components: mutual preference, mutual enjoyment, and the ability to engage in skillful interaction. Friendships were not defined or understood in terms of interactions alone, but in the perceived enjoyment and connectedness that the infants and toddlers seemed to express affectively for each other. While challenges in communication may make it more difficult to understand the quality of friendships among people with later stages of dementia, these challenges do not mean that friendships are not possible or that people in advancing stages are incapable of making new friends. To assume that friendship does not occur or is not important may reflect a type of implicit stigmatization that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1471301211421186">Sabat (2006)</xref> refers to as ‘malignant positioning’ in which the person with dementia can be increasingly viewed and treated as ‘defective’ and ‘unable’ by others due to cognitive decline. Malignant positioning leads to accepted views that: (1) the person with dementia is incapable of expressing ‘real’ concerns or fears; (2) lacks awareness of self; or (3) is not in a position to legitimately counter others (e.g. care providers) such as disagreeing on a course of action or expressing a view that is in opposition to the person who does not have dementia.</p>
<p>There is a long and well-established literature linking social interactions and friendship to psychological well-being throughout the life course which is worth exploring in this context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1471301211421186">Berkman, Glass, Brissette, &amp; Seeman, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1471301211421186">Berkman &amp; Syme, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1471301211421186">Felmlee &amp; Muraco, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1471301211421186">Keyes, 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1471301211421186">Keyes (2007)</xref> uses the term ‘flourishing’, defined as the <italic>promotion</italic> and <italic>maintenance</italic> of mental health to underscore the importance of viewing mental health not simply as the absence of a condition, which Keyes calls ‘languishing’, but as the presence of something positive. He describes three broad dimensions of flourishing: positive emotions (positive affect, avowed quality of life), positive psychological functioning (self-acceptance, personal growth, purpose in life, environmental mastery, autonomy, and positive relations with others), and positive social functioning (social acceptance, social actualization, social contribution, social coherence, and social integration). All three aspects of flourishing are important to discussions of friendships among people with dementia.</p>
<p>The purpose of this paper is to examine the scope of ‘friendship’ within the context of dementia and long-term care. We draw on data from a 6-month observational study on the social environments of people with dementia in long-term care and include interviews with staff and residents, demographic and functional performance data, and direct observation to consider friendship among residents. Guiding our approach is the growing literature on person-centered approaches in dementia by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1471301211421186">Kitwood (1997)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1471301211421186">Sabat (2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1471301211421186">2006</xref>) whichstress the importance of highlighting the individual with the diagnosis rather than medicalizing the person and their experience. We therefore include the perspectives of people with dementia in our data collection process and present this insight as we reconsider ‘friendship.’</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1471301211421186"><title>Background</title>
<p>Overall, definitions of friendship vary based on differences in cultural and societal norms which present additional challenges to establishing a universal definition of the term (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1471301211421186">Cohen, 1980</xref>). We therefore selected key elements of definitions of friendships that appeared consistently in the different literature. We then considered these components of friendship within the context of people with dementia. We were particularly concerned with ways in which qualities of friendship were represented and experienced by people in moderate to late stages of dementia. We anticipated that communication and verbal challenges that may be present in some people could make expressions of friendship more difficult to achieve and therefore for an outsider (e.g. our research team) to observe and interpret.</p>
<p>While there is no one accepted definition of friendship, some general characteristics of friends have been suggested. The word ‘friends’ can be applied to mere acquaintances orintimates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1471301211421186">Allan, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1471301211421186">Kurth, 1970</xref>). Friends are often confidants or people who have a high level of intimacy relative to other relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1471301211421186">Gupta, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1471301211421186">Howes &amp; Mueller, 1980</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1471301211421186">Matthews, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1471301211421186">Parks &amp; Floyd, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1471301211421186">Powers, 1991</xref>). Friendship is voluntary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1471301211421186">Howes &amp; Mueller, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1471301211421186">Matthews, 1983</xref>). People tend to choose friends of the same sex, age, race, religion, geographic area to include micro-geography such as close proximity during meal time, and status level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1471301211421186">Laumann, 1973</xref>), although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1471301211421186">Adams (1989)</xref> points out that our culture does not require friends to be in structurally similar positions to ourselves. Friends share resources and provide social support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1471301211421186">Powers, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1471301211421186">Roberto, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1471301211421186">Shea, Thompson, &amp; Blieszner, 1988</xref>). Finally, friendship involves a level of affective involvement and a sense of uniqueness of the other individual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1471301211421186">Matthews, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1471301211421186">Sias &amp; Bartoo, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>When thinking about friendships among people with dementia, several challenges to conventional definitions exist, at least on the surface. For example, if ‘friendship’ is voluntary, how can ‘friendship’ be discerned from a conversation between two people who have been seated next to each other, regardless of personal choice? If reciprocity is a key to friendship, what types of reciprocity are ‘required’ by someone with memory impairment in long-term care? What type of reciprocity is possible when one is restricted by place, as in a secure dementia care facility, and/or mobility, such as in people who are unable to ambulate independently? Is it necessary that a person recall his/her friend's name to be considered a friend? Does the length of a social interaction or conversation between two people carry the same importance in a dementia care setting as it does in the outside community, especially considering that people within long-term care facilities are not in control of their own time or space and that the subjective experience of time may be considerably different for those facing uncertainties associated with institutional living?</p>
<p>Despite the wealth of studies on friendships in old age, there is currently only a small but growing body of work that fully explores the construct of friendships among people with dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1471301211421186">Kelly, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1471301211421186">Kutner et al., 2000</xref>). One obvious challenge is that people with dementia have impairments in cognitive abilities such as memory, language, reasoning, and orientation to time and place, all of which are thought to be integral to the workings of a friendship. These and other dementia-related impairments point to the question: How is ‘friendship’ defined and experienced in people with dementia?</p>
<p>Several studies have examined a variety of social relationships within dementia special care units, including dementia residents' relationships with staff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1471301211421186">Cohen-Mansfield &amp; Marx, 1992</xref>); residents' friendships related to agitated behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1471301211421186">Kutner et al., 2000</xref>); and staff's perceptions of residents' characteristics and successful social placement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1471301211421186">Wood, Cooper, Richardson, &amp; Forbes, 1992</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1471301211421186">Cohen-Mansfield and Marx (1992)</xref> studied relationships between residents with dementia and ‘outsiders’ (e.g. family, friends not living in the nursing home) but not social relationships among residents. They found that increased agitation was associated with fewer outside social contacts. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1471301211421186">Kutner et al. (2000)</xref> studied friendship and agitated behaviors among 59 residents of a dementia care unit and, as did Cohen-Mansfield and Marx, found an association between friendship and lack of agitated behavior. These authors did not, however, characterize the friendships or investigate qualities that may have contributed to their formation such as communicative ability, cognition, and physical function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1471301211421186">Astell &amp; Ellis, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1471301211421186">Wood and colleagues (1992)</xref> investigated whether residents’ characteristics (specifically cognition, affect, and mood and/or behavior) influenced staff members’ perceptions of the resident's successful placement in a care facility. They found that negative affect and depressed mood, as opposed to cognitive function or behavior, were strongly linked with residents who were labeled as ‘unsuccessfully placed’. The authors did not investigate social interactions among residents but rather used scales and staff perceptions to determine whether individual residents ‘fit in’ at the facility.</p>
<p>The present study was undertaken to examine how friendships are defined and experienced by people with dementia living in long-term care and offers a revised conceptual schema to understand friendship and a view of social interactions that comprises these friendships.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1471301211421186" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title>
<p>Data used to inform the concept of friendship were collected as a part of a 6-month, ethnographic study on the social environments of people with dementia in long-term care. In addition to our observational data, we administered a battery of assessments (as discussed in the following) to enable us to respond better to potential questions about our research regarding the homogeneity of our sample, or whether different stages and/or competency levels could explain our findings. Data were collected in a 20-bed assisted living residential care unit exclusively for people with moderate to severe dementia. The Institutional Review Board of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine reviewed and approved this study. Staff participants were recruited through staff meetings where the research team described the study. Resident participants were recruited via letter to their legally authorized representative. Both participant samples are described in detail in the following section.</p>
<sec id="sec4-1471301211421186" sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title>
<sec id="sec5-1471301211421186"><title>Resident sample</title>
<p>A total of 31 (21 women, 10 men) residents participated in the study over the 6-month study period. Two participants described their race/ethnicity as African American; the remainder (<italic>n</italic> = 29) were European American. Residents who left the unit during the course of the study were replaced. The inclusion criterion was having lived in the care unit for at least 1 month. Residents who were unable to leave their rooms for over 1 week due to illness or immobility were excluded.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1471301211421186"><title>Staff sample</title>
<p>Fourteen staff members were recruited through announcements at training sessions and through a recruitment flyer. The staff participants came from three departments: activities (<italic>n</italic> = 3), social work (<italic>n</italic> = 2), and nursing, to include certified nursing assistants and medication aides (<italic>n</italic> = 8). Inclusion criteria for staff were: at least 1 month employment (minimum of 10 hours per week) within the assisted living wing; and written informed consent. Two participants described their ethnicity as African American, one as Caribbean American, one as African, and 10 as European American.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1471301211421186"><title>Interviews with staff and residents</title>
<p>The research team conducted semi-structured interviews with staff and residents regarding their views of friendship. The goal of the interviews was to find out directly, in a deductive fashion from staff and residents, their views on which characteristics defined friendship and which residents were friends. Interviews were semi-structured; depending on the response, the interviewer could probe for further information or redirect the question appropriately. Interview prompts for staff were as follows:
<list id="list1-1471301211421186" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>How do you define friendship?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Describe key factors that influence friendships.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Which residents are in conflict with each other and why?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Which residents are friends and why?</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Interview prompts for residents were:
<list id="list2-1471301211421186" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>What does friendship mean to you?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What do you like to do with friends?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Who are your friends here?</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>All interviews were transcribed and analyzed for thematic content. (See the ‘Coding’ section for a description of the coding procedures and analysis.) Ten staff and 12 residents each completed one interview lasting approximately 30 minutes each. The remaining seven residents at the beginning of the study either did not grant assent for the interviews or had difficulties in language and were unable to complete the oral interviews.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1471301211421186"><title>Measures</title>
<sec id="sec9-1471301211421186"><title>Cognitive and communicative status</title>
<p>Researchers administered two tests with each resident upon his/her entry to the study: (1) the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1471301211421186">Folstein, Folstein, &amp; McHugh, 1975</xref>), a well-known, widely used brief mental status measure to assess cognitive status; and (2) the Functional Linguistic Communication Inventory (FLCI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1471301211421186">Bayles &amp; Tomoeda, 1994</xref>), a well-validated, 30-minute structured interview used to evaluate language comprehension and production (e.g. greetings, word reading, gestures, and participation in conversations) in people with moderate to severe dementia. Higher FLCI scores indicate higher communicative ability and have been shown to correspond to Functional Assessment Staging (FAST) in dementia ratings, which range from 4 to 8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1471301211421186">Sclan &amp; Resberg, 1992</xref>). A higher FAST score indicates a higher severity of dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1471301211421186">Sclan &amp; Resberg, 1992</xref>). Descriptive statistics were used to characterize demographic data and functional status of the participating residents.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-1471301211421186"><title>Staff rating matrix</title>
<p>At the start of the study, research interviewers completed a staff rating matrix with participating staff for the 19 residents residing in the assisted living unit at that time. The purpose was to understand better the staff's views of residents’ relationships and to guide the researchers on resident dyads that were thought by staff to be friendly with each other. Staff members were presented with a series of index cards with an arrow pointing from one resident's name to another. Staff members were asked, ‘On a scale of –3 (strongly dislikes) to + 3 (strongly likes), how much do you think [A] likes [B]?’. Staff were also asked, ‘On a scale of –3 (strongly disliked) to + 3 (strongly liked), how much do you think [A] is liked by [B]?’. The purpose of the two questions was to differentiate between a resident who may be very nice to other residents (someone who strongly likes residents B, C, D, etc.) but may not be well liked by others (is strongly disliked by B, C, D, etc.) for various reasons (e.g. personal habits, communication style, or others). The two series of index cards were completed for each possible pair of residents. Based on ratings, each resident was assigned two scores: (1) a mean rating score of staff's perception of how much resident [<italic>x</italic>] likes other residents and (2) a mean rating of how much the staff believe that resident [<italic>x</italic>] is liked by others. Given transfer of residents to and from the unit, the matrix was completed only once, at the beginning of the study, with 19 residents.</p>

<sec id="sec11-1471301211421186"><title>Ethnographic observations</title>
<sec id="sec12-1471301211421186"><title>Field notes</title>
<p>Ethnographic observations of residents were conducted over the course of 6 months. Research team members sat quietly in background areas and took field notes on interactions between residents, the general social environment, and other general impressions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec13-1471301211421186"><title>Audio- and video-taping</title>
<p>When possible, we videotaped residents’ interactions to capture non-verbal data such as facial expressions, physical position, ‘body language’ and other cues to communication. Video-taping was limited to common, public areas of the assisted living wing (e.g. dining room, television lounge, hallways). We obtained written informed consent for video- and audio-taping from each resident's legally authorized representative (LAR) and obtained residents’ assent to any taping at the start of each observational session. Only written field notes were used if residents did not assent to taping or if residents, staff or others (e.g. visitors) for whom consent had not been obtained were present. Video-tapes were transcribed using multi-modal transcription techniques which include other-than-language elements found present in video footage such as images and gestures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1471301211421186">Baldry &amp; Thibault, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1471301211421186">Ledema, 2003</xref>). Audio tapes were transcribed verbatim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1471301211421186">DuBois, 1991</xref>).</p>

<sec id="sec14-1471301211421186"><title>Coding</title>
<p>Field notes and transcripts were initially coded by two researchers and later reconciled by the entire study team. The following four steps were used: (1) determine whether an interaction occurred; (2) determine the length of any interactions; (3) identify interaction as friendly/positive, unfriendly/negative, neutral, or ‘more information needed’; (4) code the interaction by theme. In determining whether an interaction occurred between two residents, coders included only resident-to-resident interactions (not staff interactions with residents). To be considered an interaction, two or more residents must each display at least one turn in an exchange (verbal or non-verbal) with each other and must recognize the other as a unique person, different from other people in the environment. For example, if Resident A makes a comment to Resident B and Resident B either responds directly to Resident A or engages affectively (e.g. a smile, a nod), then the exchange was considered an interaction. However, if Resident A makes a comment to Resident B, and Resident B makes a general comment not directed at Resident A <italic>per se</italic>, then the exchange was not considered an interaction.</p>
<p>Guidelines for timing the length of interactions were originally suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1471301211421186">Howes and Mueller (1980)</xref>, who used 5 second increments as a basis for determining interactions among non-verbal participants. Our observation period was lengthened, based on our observations in this population on the typical length of pause after speaking and potential topic change between participants’ exchanges. Timing began at the start of the interaction and continued until either (1) a pause of more than 10 seconds occurred between a resident interaction accompanied by a topic change or (2) a pause between participants of 30 seconds regardless of topic change. A codebook, established and refined throughout the study, was used to assign themes to interactions. Coders then labeled the interaction as:
<list id="list3-1471301211421186" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>‘friendly/positive’, in which there was positive and/or relevant verbal or non-verbal communication appropriate to the situation and/or the tone appeared to be pleasant;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>‘unfriendly/negative’, in which the response of one or more participant was inappropriate or tone/reaction of at least one participant was unpleasant;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>‘neutral’, when an interaction between two residents did not fit the criteria of either friendly/positive or unfriendly/negative and when the interaction contained no observable emotional reaction (such as when one resident asks another for the time) and/or a minimal exchange; or</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>‘more information needed’ when camera angle or field notes prevented adequate information for coding.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>If coders did not agree on what code to assign, the entire research team evaluated, discussed, and assigned a code based on mutual agreement.</p>

As stated earlier, staff ratings were conducted only on the first 19 participants in the study.

In the final sample, 9 residents were married; 16 widowed; 3 divorced/separated; 2 single; and 1 ‘marital status unknown’. Age (in years) ranged from 57 to 95 (mean 82.4, SD 7.6). Years of education ranged from 8 to 20 (mean 14.1, SD 3.4). MMSE scores (<italic>n</italic> = 23) ranged from 0 to 28 (mean 14.7, SD 6.7); FAST scores (<italic>n</italic> = 24) ranged from 4 to 7 (mean 5.0, SD 1.0).

<p>The staff rating matrix was completed with staff for the initial 19 residents enrolled at the start of the study. The ‘is liked’ rating for all 19 residents ranged from 0.05 to 1.09 (mean 0.6, SD 0.3) out of a possible range of –3 to 3 points, with higher scores meaning ‘greater likeability.’ The ‘likes others’ rating ranged from –0.04 to 1.3 (mean 0.6, SD 0.4). The two staff rating scores (‘is liked’ and ‘likes others’) were significantly correlated (<italic>r</italic>(17) = 0.89, <italic>p</italic> &lt;0.000).</p>
<p>There was no significant relationship between FAST score and ‘is liked’ rating [<italic>F</italic>(5, 13) = 0.80, <italic>p</italic> = 0.6] or FAST score and ‘likes others’ [<italic>F</italic>(5, 13) = 0.67, <italic>p</italic> = 0.7]. There was also no significant relationship between MMSE and either ‘is liked’ [<italic>F</italic>(8, 12) = 3.97, <italic>p</italic> = 0.1], or ‘likes others’ [<italic>F</italic>(8, 12) = 0.95, <italic>p</italic> = 0.6]. We did find a significant difference between gender and ‘is liked’ ratings [<italic>F</italic>(1, 17) = 6.0, <italic>p</italic> = 0.03] and gender and ‘likes others’ [<italic>F</italic>(1, 17) = 8.3, <italic>p</italic> = 0.01], with men having higher ‘is liked’ scores (mean 0.87, SD 0.14) and ‘likes others’ scores (mean 0.92, SD 0.25) than women (mean 0.51, SD 0.34 and mean 0.49, SD 0.32, respectively).</p>

<sec id="sec18-1471301211421186"><title>Residents who were identified as ‘friends’ by staff</title>
<p>Of the over 300 unique possible dyadicpairings of friends, only 20 were identified by staff. The ‘Friends’ column in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1471301211421186">Table 1</xref> lists the friends named by staff for each resident. Staff almost unanimously named the four men who sit at the same table, ‘the men's table’: John, Sam, Matthew, and Ralph. In addition, Carl, who did not sit at the men's table but sat on the opposite side of the room, was also cited as being friends with Harrold, Sam, Matthew and Ralph. Two additional pairs of resident friends were also cited: Carl and Lilly, who sit at adjacent tables; and Lilly and Anna, who sit at the same table. In all cases, independent conversation between residents was the main characteristic of the friendships described by staff.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec19-1471301211421186"><title>Residents who were identified by other residents as being friends</title>
<p>Three residents identified other residents as friends. Another at the men's table, Sam, said he was friends with the other men at the table and that he talked with them a lot. Bob, who at the time of his interview had replaced Matthew at the ‘men's table’ due to Matthew's move to a higher level of care within the facility, responded: ‘Well there is one woman that I am quite friendly with here, Lilly’. When asked if he was friends with Ralph, Bob said: ‘I am not as friendly with him because a friend should be outgoing, too, so you can exchange ideas. Ralph is not outgoing’. Lucy and Carl both identified each other as friends.</p>
<p>Many responded that they currently did not have any friends. John, one of the four men at the ‘men's table’ who was described by staff as being friends with his three tablemates, said, ‘I don't have any friends right now because I'm new here. I don't have time to get together with them’. We note that at the time of the interview, John had been living in this house for over a year.</p>

<sec id="sec20-1471301211421186"><title>Themes from staff and resident friendship interviews</title>
<sec id="sec21-1471301211421186"><title>Qualities of friendship</title>
<p>In response to the face-to-face interview question regarding definitions and views of friendship in general staff and residents described four themes to characterize the qualities of friendship: (1) common interests, (2) intimacy, (3) reciprocity, and (4) reliability.</p>
<p>The first theme, common interests, described when two people enjoyed the same activities or topics of conversation. For example, one member of staff described friendship as ‘When two people get along, have things in common that they enjoy’. Another member of staff described friends as those having similar desires. One resident said a friendship is ‘a relationship with someone with whom you have either something in common or someone who is willing to exchange ideas with you on a wide variety of subjects in amiable way’. The idea of sharing common interests as comprising ‘friendship’ was therefore mentioned by staff and residents.</p>
<p>The second theme was intimacy which referred to the closeness of the relationship. One staff member commented that friendship includes ‘a kind of a closeness; somebody you can relate to’. Another described it as ‘someone you can go to and talk to and maybe share similar thought patterns’. Examples of intimacy in residents’ descriptions of friendships were ‘close and ongoing relationships where each friend respects the other and never tries to take advantage of them’ or ‘someone that you can confide in’.</p>
<p>The third theme, reciprocity, was described by staff as two people caring for each other in a mutual fashion. One resident described this as ‘having friends be nice to you and you be nice to them’.</p>
<p>Finally, the fourth theme was reliability/helping. Staff described this idea that a friend would be someone to call for help at any time and always be there for you whatever you needed. Similarly, residents described this as having an understanding of your neighbor's problems and helping them if you can. For example, Sarah, a resident, told the interviewer:
<disp-quote>
<p>Sarah: Well I, actually I sit between two people that are very sick … ill … need</p>
<p>help with eating..anything. And I am sort of a … of a … helper. There</p>
<p>is a reason that I want to be there because I can help them.</p>
<p>Interviewer: So those relationships are based on their need for help?</p>
<p>Sarah: Yes. They are not close. I feel that way. Some people tell me that I</p>
<p>go over board but I like to help helpless people. They can not do it</p>
<p>for themselves and that is really why I sit there.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Sarah's comments suggest that helping, not necessarily receiving help, was important to her in her interactions with others. She specifically sat with particular individuals to offer help and felt that her help was appreciated. Overall, the four themes were present in residents’ and staffs' comments, which points to both groups having similar views of important components of friendships. Although staff and residents had similar definitions of friendships, the staff, in particular, were not accurate in reporting actual friendships among residents. Instead of drawing from the definitions they provided to the interviewers, staff appeared to overly rely on male gender and seating assignments as key indicators of friendships. It is not clear whether memory impairment may have prevented residents from naming their friends (if any) at the assisted living facility.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec22-1471301211421186"><title>Contextual activities of friendships</title>
<p>Staff members were asked to think about residents whom they would consider to be friends with each other and to describe the activities that they liked doing together. Residents were asked, ‘What do you usually do with friends?’. Three categories were present: (1) communication, (2) meals, and (3) recreational activities. ‘Communication’ includes engaging in greetings, passing comments, and conversation which includes reminiscing and joking. One staff member said, ‘The men always sit around the table talking about everything’. One resident commented, ‘It is usually conversation. There is not much in the way of activity here except just shooting the bull’. Another resident voiced a similar view, adding the importance of helping: ‘Oh, I like to converse with them [referring to the other residents]. And if they need any help, somebody to be there for them, that situation’.</p>
<p>The other two themes, ‘meals’ and ‘recreational activities,’ were found only in the staff interviews, not in the residents’ interviews. Staff described mealtimes as part of friendship interactions. Eating meals together was an indicator to staff of what friends do with each other. The third theme, recreational activities, included attending music programs, art classes, lectures, taking walks, and watching television. Staff reported that women often walk around with the goal of finding a way out of the facility. Staff felt that sometimes this activity of finding a way out forms an alliance between these female residents. As indicated in the resident's comment associated with the theme of communication, many residents did not think there were many things to do nor did they equate meal time with a friendship-type activity, perhaps because in both cases, residents had little choice and were instead often guided by staff, even to their meal-time seats.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec23-1471301211421186"><title>Factors influencing residents’ friendships</title>
<p>Staff members were asked specifically about the key factors that they believe influenced friendships among residents. Four main factors emerged: (1) personal characteristics, (2) level of cognitive function, (3) communicative ability, and (4) physical proximity of residents to each other. We examined correlations between data for these four factors for the 16 residents who were part of at least one friendship dyad identified by staff.</p>
<p>The first factor, personal characteristics, includes demographic features such as gender, age, years of education, occupation, personality, and place of origin. We note that we were only able to use gender, age, and years of education due to a lack of additional information for the residents. As mentioned earlier, being male was a big determinant in staff's views of what influenced friendships as the male residents were often cited by staff as being friends. Male gender was significantly correlated with higher ‘likes other’ ratings (<italic>r</italic>(16) = 0.53, <italic>p</italic> = 0.03) although not with ‘is liked’ (<italic>r</italic>(16) = 0.45, <italic>p</italic> = 0.81). Neither age nor years of education were correlated with either staff rating score. Regarding the second factor, level of cognitive function, staff believed that individuals with similar cognitive abilities were more likely to be friends. We found no correlation between staff ratings and either MMSE scores or FAST scores. Third, similar levels of communicative ability were perceived to be an indicator of likely friendships, where those residents who were able and willing to converse with each other were thought to be friends. We found no significant correlation between FLCI total score and staff ratings. Finally, staff reported that physical proximity, specifically being seated together at meals, was important in determining who was likely to interact and thus to establish and maintain friendships. Although four of the men sat at the same table, another man, Carl, did not, despite being named as a friend of the other four. In addition, Carl and Lucy did share a table. This dyad was not identified by staff as being friends, but Carl did name Lucy as a friend in his interview. These findings suggest that proximity alone does not lead to friendship although it certainly might.</p>

<sec id="sec24-1471301211421186"><title>Residents in conflict</title>
<p>Staff also answered questions regarding their views of residents’ conflicts. When asked to name which residents were in conflict with each other and to describe what they thought contributed to the conflict, staff stated three basic reasons: non-interaction, repetitiveness, disruptive behavior. For example, one staff mentioned a resident who was possessive with the television and did not talk or interact with other residents unless they came too close to her television area. Another staff member described a resident's repetitiousness in repeating the same story due to memory impairment, which caused other residents to become annoyed. Finally, another resident was described as being a source of conflict because she coughed loudly and often, which disturbed the others.</p>

<sec id="sec25-1471301211421186"><title>Residents as friends: resident perspectives</title>
<p>As mentioned earlier, many residents said they did not have any friends, some because they were unclear on where they were or their length of stay, and others because they felt that creating new friendships in this long-term care setting is difficult or undesirable. For example, Lilly did not believe that she lived in the unit and therefore said she did not have any friends there. Carl (who was not part of the men's table) said he was friends with everybody. Carl also identified one of his friends in the unit, Lucy, who he mentions in the following exchange:
<disp-quote>
<p>Interviewer: So who are you friends with here?</p>
<p>Carl: Oh everybody.</p>
<p>Interviewer: Everybody.</p>
<p>Carl: I am friends with her (points to Lucy, who sits at his table with him).</p>
<p>Interviewer: Yes I always see you both have dinner and lunch together.</p>
<p>Carl: And talk to one another.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Although the interviewer mentions mealtime as a source of friendship activities, Carl quickly points out the importance of talking to one another as a part of the friendship.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec26-1471301211421186"><title>Ethnographic observations</title>
<p>Fifty-six hours (one hour per day) of direct observation with field notes were completed without video and were described in field notes. An additional 12 hours of observations were video-taped. Of the coded field notes, 111 unique social interactions were identified, encompassing a total of 52 minutes. Of these interactions, 100 were friendly/positive, 0 were unfriendly/negative, 0 were neutral, and 11 required more information to make a determination.</p>
<p>Staff identification of residents who were friends was not clearly supported by our observations. Most notably, our 6 months of direct observation of the men's table specifically revealed only minimal interaction and/or talking, restricted almost entirely to greetings and goodbyes. The following exchange is a typical exchange for John and Ralph:
<disp-quote>
<p>[Ralph comes and sits down opposite of John]</p>
<p>John: Hello.</p>
<p>[Ralph, who is already eating, looks up at John]</p>
<p>Ralph: Hi.</p>
<p>[John examines a card sitting on the table]</p>
<p>John begins to eat as well. Over the next 90 minutes, no</p>
<p>conversation takes place between the two except the initial</p>
<p>greeting.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Despite being identified by staff as being friends and participating in many conversations, we observed few verbal and non-verbal interchanges among the four male residents at the men's table. As illustrated by the example, the conversations we did observe or record were extremely brief. Our observations of the men's table call into question the clear message from the staff who rated these men all to be friends.</p>
<p>In contrast, we recorded and observed multiple conversations between Carl and Lucy, a pair of residents who were <italic>not</italic> identified by staff as being friends but who named each other as friends during their individual interviews. Carl and Lucy were tablemates in the dining room. Lucy, who had been sleeping at the table, was surprised to awake and see Carl sitting across from her:
<disp-quote>
<p>Lucy: I think I was dozing when you came up.</p>
<p>Carl: I think you were.</p>
<p>Lucy: I really can sleep anywhere I guess.</p>
<p>Carl: That's good. As long as you don't skip any meals.</p>
<p>Lucy: Yeah. I don't want to miss any meals.</p>
<p>Carl: Get up and go to bed, go to bed.</p>
<p>Lucy: What?</p>
<p>Carl: Get up everyday and stay up for about half hour and go to bed, take a</p>
<p>nap, and sleep all day again.</p>
<p>Lucy: My, I couldn't do that.</p>
<p>Carl: You might if you're a good sleeper.</p>
<p>Lucy: No I couldn't sleep that much. I don't go to bed early. I, I don't go to</p>
<p>bed ‘til, until midnight a lot of times.</p>
<p>Carl: Midnight? You never told me that before.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Carl is accommodating in his response to Lucy, agreeing with her at times and drawing on her most recent remark to form an appropriate reply. In response to her comment about staying up until midnight, Carl mentions not having heard that about her before, a remark that suggests some level of intimacy or personal knowledge between the two and a mutual recognition of each other as unique individuals. Unfortunately, we were unable to characterize many of the 111 positive interactions as signifying friendship due to their brevity. Many times, interactions were limited to a brief (less than 10 seconds) exchange of words or glances between two people.</p>

<p>The data from our study reveal interesting information about perceptions and stereotypes of friendship norms and whether those norms are realized in a long-term care setting of people with dementia. Staff and, specifically, residents’ descriptions of friendship characteristics seem to follow social and cultural stereotypes: common interests, intimacy, reciprocity, and reliability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1471301211421186">Adams &amp; Blieszner, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1471301211421186">Diaz Moore, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1471301211421186">Powers, 1991</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1471301211421186">Allan and Adams (1989</xref>, p. 46) point out that while friendships are somewhat voluntary, at the same time they are structured and patterned and thus more complex. Our results suggest, however, that how friendship is conceptualized does not always coincide with how it is observed and possibly experienced in this population.</p>
<p>One of the biggest differences we found in staff perceptions of friendships was in the residents who they identified as friends. Staff repeatedly pointed to the men's table as a place where friendships occurred, with conversational activity forming the basis of these friendships and men composed the majority of residents in the highest likability ratings. Direct observation revealed only minimal communication among the men, existing almost exclusively of a brief greeting at the start and finish of each meal. Joking, reminiscing, and other descriptors of the male residents' interactions were only rarely observed during the course of the study. When asked about friends, Sam said he was friends with all the men at the table. Another man at the table, John, said he had no friends. Another, Bob, said he was not friends with Ralph (who sat at the men's table) but was friends with Lilly (who sat at another table). The lack of verbal interaction among the male residents despite staff's perception of friendships calls into question the potential role of gender bias on the part of the staff. It appeared that staff members assumed men were friends, perhaps because there were so few of them compared with women and due to cultural norms of adult friendship patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1471301211421186">Adams, 1989</xref>). What is unclear, however, is whether the male residents at the men's table <italic>do</italic> view each other as friends and if they are missing the opportunity to socialize with others, namely female residents, because staff have seated them together. Proximity, being able to communicate physically with another, is an important factor in socializing and the development of friendship especially in this environment. Staff may therefore be creating friendship barriers or equating proximity without any negative valence as friendship (e.g. men who sit together and who do not fight are friends).</p>
<p>We note that staff did not name Lucy and Carl as being friends, even though both residents named each other. In addition, Lucy and Carl sat at a two-person table together. It is unclear why staff did not identify this pair since we observed many conversations between the two which pointed to staff members’ definitions of ‘friendship’.</p>
<p>Many of the residents we interviewed did not view the long-term care facility as ‘home’ and consequently did not express interest in making friends or mentioned having friends within the facility. In addition, many could not directly name any friends they had, although some certainly could. These and other challenges associated with dementia, including decline in language abilities in addition to poorer memory and orientation, should not suggest that people with dementia are incapable of experiencing friendship. Although communication was a feature of their ‘friendship,’ it was not just the fact the pairs talked, but rather the nature of what transpired in the conversation. In the excerpt from Carl and Lucy, Lucy tells Carl that she could stay up until midnight, to which Carl responds, ‘you never told me that before’. There is a sense of intimacy, of revealing details about themselves that the other either recognized as having known, or comments about having not known before.</p>
<p>We find as an indicator of ‘friendship’ a sense of accommodation in a conversation where one partner makes an attempt not only to respond to the other in a meaningful way, but also to add some quality to the conversation; of recognizing the uniqueness of a particular individual, even if name recall is not possible; and voluntarily participating in the interaction. Although it is a very simplified description of a potentially complex process, we offer it as a valid and possibly valuable starting point to consider with regard to friendships among people diagnosed with dementia. We also note that the majority of the 111 interactions we coded as ‘friendly’ were brief and often did not provide a context in which to ascertain whether a friendship relationship existed, or whether people were simply being polite to one another. Perhaps more time for direct observations of the men in different settings would yield a different picture.</p>
<p>Although there is substantial literature on friendships in old age and friendships in institutions such as nursing homes, there is a need for more work specifically regarding friendships among people diagnosed with dementia, for friendships are clearly understood to improve the quality of people's lives and could serve as an important non-pharmacological means of improvement of affect, physical health, and flourishing. Results from the small study presented here are meant to provide a point from which more in-depthwork can begin on broadening our understanding of friendships in people with later stages of dementia. Although the limitations in the current work include small sample, limited data observations, and lack of generalizability to other people in long-term care, the phenomena discussed herein may be found in other long-term care settings for people with dementia. Further research is needed that can further ‘unpack’ non-verbal and better identify non-verbal and conversational markers of friendships across long-term care settings.</p>
