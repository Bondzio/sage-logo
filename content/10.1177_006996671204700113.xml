<p>It is a pleasant coincidence that both these texts engage with each other implicitly—where a set of questions laid out by Narayan and Omvedt helps the reader trace the basic problematic. Yet, their individual work reveals their distinct concerns for Dalit politics. While Narayan’s text is concerned with the political project of Hindutva forces to subsume the Dalits under the fold of an overarching ‘Hindu’ identity, Omvedt questions the very conception of ‘Hinduism’ and more importantly, the identification of Hindus as the ‘people of India’ and the need to go beyond the debate that poses ‘secularism’ or a ‘reformed Hinduism’ as an alternative to Hindutva, thereby going beyond ‘Hinduism’ itself.</p>
<p>Narayan’s <italic>Fascinating Hindutva</italic> is born out of fieldwork in regions of UP and Bihar, drawing on empirical data to show the use (and abuse) of folklore, popular histories, myths, rituals and commemorative ceremonies of Dalits by Hindutva politics. Such a political project, he claims, is enabled by the concept of electoral democracy where sheer numbers (of votes) become significant in the battle for acquiring power. Nevertheless, he describes how this has, to an extent, endowed small, marginalised Dalit castes with power to assert themselves and perhaps, alter existing power equations. While he understands that history and cultural identities are closely intertwined and that each of them is open to being written and rewritten, interpreted and reinterpreted by communities, he elucidates how political parties deploy the languages, symbols, aspirations and other possible identity resources of target populations to create vote banks. In practice, this is done by organising celebrations, erecting statues, holding rallies, distributing pamphlets and booklets that narrate legends about heroes of the community that ideologically suit the political party. This is done by both the dominant political parties, the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) that was formed to empower Dalits against their exploitation by upper caste Hindus as well as the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which has openly proclaimed its desire to spread Hindu nationalism and which supports the moral and cultural code offered by ancient Hindu religious texts such as <italic>Manu Samhita</italic> as well as epics like Ramayana and Mahabharata. The strategic process of appropriation of myths, legends and caste heroes of individual Dalit castes, their saffronisation by the BJP and encompassing into a ‘Hindu’ identity (to gather votes) in the face of the Muslim ‘other’ is what Narayan describes, problematises and calls ‘Fascinating Hindutva’. Starting from the glorification of Suhaldev as a Hindu king who vanquished the Muslim invader, Sayyad Salar Ghazi Mian, to the mobilisation of the Nishad community on grounds that their king Nishadraj played a significant role in Lord Rama’s life during his exile, along with a celebration of other heroes such as Avantibai Lodh, Rani Rasmani and Phoolan Devi and the deployment of the cultural resources of the Musahar and Salhes community, Narayan offers a detailed description of the discourse and political gimmicks used by political parties as observed in the field. By way of critique, it is possible to say that while Narayan’s work is empirically rich, it would seem that in his attempt to problematise Hindutva politics, he underestimates the politics of the divisive and hierarchic forces that operate within Dalit castes themselves. Notwithstanding, one wonders: who does history belong to, if at all it can be owned?</p>
<p>In <italic>Understanding Caste: From Buddha to Ambedkar and Beyond</italic>, Omvedt begins by taking issue with the metonymic link that is often established between Hinduism, the religion and its apparently obvious ties with the nation ‘India’ and by implication, its people. Even when the secular left and democratic forces have opposed communalism, Hinduism as a whole remained unquestioned. Casteism has been viewed as the liability of the colonisers where ‘true Hinduism’ is to be sought in the <italic>bhakti</italic> traditions. To unsettle these assumptions, Omvedt brings together a variety of discourses around caste on a common platform, while Hinduism remains at its fulcrum. She begins with the chapter, ‘Two Great Traditions of India and the Construction of Hinduism’ where she traces the hegemonic status of Hinduism to the colonial period. She shows how, both those who were overtly rooted in religious discourses, such as Gandhi, and others who claimed to be modern and secular, such as Nehru, drew on a Brahmanical Hindu discourse. This is a trend that comes to be challenged only later. This is seen in the theories and polemics of Phule (even though the Dalit-Bahujan based tradition began with Buddha and the Shramanas), which she elucidates in the following chapter (‘Before Hinduism: The Buddhist Vision’). She argues that even as Brahmanical Hinduism was attaining its form, it was not the only religion as others such as Jainism, Buddhism, Lokayat materialism and other Shramana sects were prominent during the period. Islam was also present due to Muslim invasion and, in fact, even resisted the Hindu hegemony along with the Bhakti movement, Lingayat movement (Karnataka), the radical Tamil Siddha movement and the Varkari movement (Maharashtra). Brahmanic Hinduism was also condemned in the works of Phule and early feminists such as Pandita Ramabai and Tarabai Shinde on casteist and patriarchal lines, suggesting the presence of a prominent counter discourse that was closer to ideals of lower classes and peasant women. Omvedt also discusses the mobilisation of the shudras and ati shudras during the 1920s and 1930s, based on varied ideologies and leaderships. Other parts of India witnessed the Tamil non-Brahman movement, along with the Adi-Dharm (Punjab), Adi-Hindu (UP and Hyderabad), Adi-Dravida, Adi-Andhra and Adi-Karnataka movements which produced non-Aryan themes indicating common claims to being original inhabitants. Most of these ideas and concerns persisted and resonated in works of Ambedkar but were largely overshadowed by the nationalist question. Even as Omvedt discusses the movements of the ‘backward castes’ during the 1970s and 1980s by the Dalit Panthers and other attempts by the Republican Party or the BSP to form a unified ‘Dalit’ identity, she seeks to expand the scope of Dalit politics as well. Her aim seems to be to draw the reader towards alternative interpretations of the so-called ‘Indian’ identity based in the traditions of the lower castes, Dalits, non-Brahmans, peasants, the working class and women and in this, to question hegemonic categories such as ‘Hindu’, ‘Indian’ and even ‘Dalit’.</p>
