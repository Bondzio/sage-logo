<p>The enhancement of thermal-insulation capability of rooftop and exterior wall are key issues in energy conservation for buildings. The objective of this study is to provide insights into thermal-insulation alternatives that will improve the thermal performance of rooftop constructions. In doing so, experiments have been performed for investigating the energy-saving effect of adding microencapsulated Phase Change Materials (mPCM) to a conventional factory ceiling (gypsum board). The average energy-saving effect at the entire heat absorption stage of a mPCM gypsum board compared with a conventional gypsum board is 31.7 per cent.</p>

<p>During the process of melting or solidification, Phase Change Material (PCM) can effectively release or store a great amount of latent heat. The most important characteristic of PCM is that its temperature can be stably maintained during the latent heat transmission process. Therefore, in the application of energy storage and thermal environmental control, PCM is a very promising material choice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954408911399507"><bold>1</bold></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954408911399507"><bold>5</bold></xref>]. The applications of PCM include systems for thermal storage, integration with building materials, and usage in fireproof engineering. Integration of building materials with PCM for environmental control has been achieved by two PCM treatment methods: addition of PCM particles during material production processing (especially microencapsulated PCM, mPCM) or lamination of PCM onto construction panels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954408911399507"><bold>1</bold></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954408911399507"><bold>4</bold></xref>].</p>
<p>The geographic location of Republic of China is somewhere near Tropic of Cancer. Therefore, the roofs of most buildings located in Republic of China can be exposed to direct (overhead) sun-rays during the summer season. The objective of this study is to provide insights into thermal-insulation alternatives that will improve the thermal performance of the rooftop constructions in Republic of China which are considered, for which little or no information is available. In doing so, experiments have been performed for investigating the energy-saving effect of adding microencapsulated Phase Change Material (mPCM) to a conventional factory ceiling (gypsum board).</p></sec>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954408911399507">Figure 1</xref> illustrates the development process of the experimental prototypes. Considering the slant roof structure, ceiling material and its connection to roof construction, exterior wall structure, and PCM heat absorption/release pathways, this study pointed out the most appropriate PCM application location, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954408911399507">Fig. 1(b)</xref>. A scaled-down experimental prototype in order to evenly apply the PCM onto the ceiling surface (close to the attic and roof plate) was used to observe the heat transfer of ceiling material in combination with mPCM materials. The roof material is a conventional corrugated steel plate with a 30° slant. The size of the ceiling is 600 × 600 × 10 mm<sup>3</sup> (thickness). Gypsum board was first selected. After thoroughly mixing mPCM with terra alba, gypsum board containing randomly mPCM was then made. Then, the structure materials are assembled into two experimental prototypes of the same dimensions. The first prototype has a pure gypsum board on the ceiling and the other has a mPCM gypsum board. The sides are sealed with heat insulation material, in order to reduce heat loss.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954408911399507">Figure 2</xref> illustrates the test facility, in which six 500W/2A/220V infrared ray-less halogen light bulbs were used to simulate the outdoor environment. Its radiation wave spectrum falls between 0.4 and 2.4 µm, and would approximately simulate the thermal radiation strength of sunshine on the roof. The main test section is installed directly under the light bulbs. An air-conditioner, equipped beneath the experimental prototype, was used to mimic the indoor air environment.

<sec id="sec4-0954408911399507"><title>2.2 mPCM gypsum board</title>
<p>Paraffin with a melting temperature close to room temperature was selected to be the core material of the used mPCM, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954408911399507">Fig. 3</xref>, which was manufactured by Microtek Laboratories, Inc. The model number was MPCM 28-D; core material was paraffin; mean particle size was 17–20 µm; melting point 28°C; melting heat 180–195 J/g; capsule composition was 85–90 wt% PCM and 10–15 wt% polymer shell; and specific gravity 0.9. In this study, mPCM, water, and terra alba are mixed into gypsum board (3 kg mPCM/m<sup>2</sup>) containing evenly distributed mPCM as the randomly mixed building material in this program.

<sec id="sec5-0954408911399507"><title>2.3 Measurement</title>
<p>Air temperatures and flow rates at the indoor and outdoor environment simulation system were measured. Type K thermocouples are installed outside the external wall plate (close to outdoor environment simulation system), inside the external wall plate, the middle of the air gap, outside the mPCM gypsum board, in the middle of the mPCM gypsum board, and inside the mPCM gypsum board (close to indoor environment simulation system). Collection of temperature data from thermocouples is conducted with data loggers (YOKOGAWA MX100) and PCs. TESTO 445 Multi-functional ventilation/air-conditioning detectors equipped with two sensing connectors are used to detect airflow velocity and temperature; the data are analysed with an RS 232 transmitting line and the professional analysing software ComSoft 3 (Testo 0554 0830) on the Windows platform.</p></sec></sec>

<sec id="sec8-0954408911399507"><title>3.2 Energy-saving analysis</title>
<p>The measured temperature in the initial experiment period can be categorized into two groups. The first one is the temperature of the surface and the bottom of the steel wave plates; the other is the temperature distribution of the surface (facing attic air layer), inside the board, and bottom (facing room interior) of the pure gypsum boards or mPCM gypsum boards. Taking into consideration installation cost and PCM added weight, addition of mPCM into the building structure (or materials) is limited. Appropriate design is needed to optimize the mPCM to a certain amount. The recommended mPCM stores only the solar heat gained in the second group during the heating stage and dissipates the obtained heat in the reverse direction at night time.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954408911399507">Figure 4</xref> shows the temperature rising of pure gypsum board and mPCM gypsum board in this reduced-scale experiment. Saw-tooth type temperature fluctuations at the gypsum and mPCM gypsum board bottoms were caused by the operation of the indoor simulation system (an air-conditioner), reflecting the real indoor situation. The three temperature rising curves (temperature measuring points at top surface, half thickness, and bottom of the board) of the pure gypsum board present regular heat conduction behaviour. The front stage (0–20 min) of mPCM gypsum board temperature rising curve presents an upward concave, different from regular heat conduction temperature rising behaviour. This means that the mPCM gypsum board has a phase change effect when board temperature changes at close to the melting point of the core material (paraffin) of the mPCM. The heat absorption affects the front stage heat conduction, making the temperature rising relaxed. With 35°C as the observation target, one can find that mPCM gypsum board surface reaches this target around half of the time slower than pure gypsum board. This expresses the shift of solar peak load of mPCM gypsum board. The same tendency can be found in the data of other measuring points.

<p>From the measured indoor heat gain through pure gypsum board (<italic>Q</italic><sub>p</sub>) and through mPCM gypsum board (<italic>Q</italic><sub>m</sub>), one can have ‘energy-saving effect of a mPCM gypsum board compared with a conventional gypsum board’, <italic>η</italic>:

<sec id="sec9-0954408911399507" sec-type="conclusions"><title>4 CONCLUSION</title>
<p>This study added mPCM into gypsum to make mPCM gypsum. Density, latent heat, melting temperature, specific heat, and heat transfer characteristics of the mPCM gypsum were measured. At mPCM's melting effect stage (approximately 0∼20 min), the energy-saving effect can be as high as 63 per cent. The average energy-saving effect at the entire temperature rising stage is 31.65 per cent.</p></sec>
