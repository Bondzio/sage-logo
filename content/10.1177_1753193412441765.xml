<body>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>A 98-year-old lady presented to the emergency department having had a mechanical fall while at home. She sustained a left extra capsular fractured neck of the femur and a closed distal radius fracture on the ipsilateral side. The radius fracture was shortened and dorsally angulated. Longstanding degenerative changes were noted, particularly in the distal radio-ulna joint. There was also a nonunion of the ulna styloid indicating previous trauma to the wrist (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753193412441765">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<p>As per national guidelines she had her neck of femur fracture fixed within 36 h of admission. Under the same anaesthetic the radius fracture was manipulated and stabilized with Kirschner wires. Owing to her frailty and co-morbidities it was requested that the anaesthetic time be kept as short as possible. The intra-operative radiographs show the fracture to be held in an acceptable position. It should however be noted that two of the Kirschner wires extend from the radial cortex to abut the ulna proximally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753193412441765">Figure 2</xref>). A check radiograph a week later demonstrated fracture of the ulna at the level of the protruding Kirschner wires (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1753193412441765">Figure 3</xref>). There was no history of further injury to the limb post-fixation and the cast was in good condition. The wires were withdrawn at this stage so as not to abut the ulna and removed at four weeks post fixation. Subsequent imaging acquired three months after wire removal shows the track of the wires in the united radius fracture and a non-union of the ulna fracture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1753193412441765">Figure 4</xref>). Although a nonunion was present this lady, with a very low functional demand, was essentially asymptomatic and was pleased with her outcome.</p>

<p>This case highlights the potential problems that can occur during what is often perceived as a straightforward procedure. As can be seen from the radiographs this lady has markedly osteopeanic bones and as a result sustained a fracture of the ulna owing to the unicortical perforation by a Kirschner wire. There are many well-described complications of Kirschner wire fixation such as infection and wire migration. We could find no previous reports of iatrogenic fracture secondary to Kirschner wire placement in English literature. It is important to ensure that wires are accurately placed to prevent against such complications and good principles of fracture fixation are maintained, especially when operating under time pressure in frail elderly individuals. As the population ages and the likely number of fragility fractures requiring treatment increases, it is important to be aware of the potential complications that can occur if Kirschner wires are left too long in osteoporotic individuals.</p>
