The structural design of the compatibilizers synthesized via a hydrosilylation–deprotection sequence was primarily based on a polymer structure with a nonpolar segment consisting of a carbosilane unit and a polar segment with a bisphenol-type moiety. Besides the homopolymer, block copolymers with varying contents of the polycarbosilane unit and the bisphenol A unit were synthesized and characterized. Curing experiments on the blends of Starfire resin–Matrimid incorporating 1–5% of the compatibilizers were performed followed by morphological characterization of the cured resin plaques. The effectiveness of the compatibilizers was assessed by the StarFire domain size and the distribution of cured specimens was examined in the scanning electron micrographs. Results indicated that the compatibilizers that were more effective in minimizing phase separation were relatively more polar and comprised a larger fraction of the phenolic functional units. In fact, the blend composition incorporating 5% of the homopolymer compatibilizer with the largest fraction of the polar bisphenol A unit was highly effective in providing a homogeneous distribution of very small StarFire domains, that is, fairly uniform domain sizes of the order of 5 µm or less.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Preceramic polymer</kwd><kwd>bismaleimide</kwd><kwd>hybrid</kwd><kwd>thermal protection</kwd><kwd>phase separation</kwd><kwd>compatibilizers</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="section1-0954008312466879"><title>Introduction</title><p>As part of a larger objective of producing an inorganic-to-organic gradient interphase material capable of high temperature stability for thermal protection applications involving surface temperatures in excess of the range of 800–1000°C, a hybrid material approach combining a ceramic component and a high-performance thermoset polymer component has been recently described in the literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954008312466879">1</xref></sup> Preceramic materials based on silicones, organic layered silicates, and polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane are known to be incorporated in thermosetting resins for increased operating temperatures, improved thermo-oxidative stability, enhanced atomic oxygen resistance, and improved barrier properties. The mode of protection in this case was the formation of a glassy, passivating silicon dioxide layer upon exposure to oxygen at elevated temperatures as well as atomic oxygen.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954008312466879">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954008312466879"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954008312466879">4</xref></sup> However, for still higher surface temperature hybrids, a silicon carbide (SiC) outer layer rather than silicon dioxide is desired especially for rocket propulsion and turbine engine components. Preferred hybrid architecture from the standpoint of thermal shock resistance would also embody a gradient interface between the ceramic and the polymer components. In advanced thermostructural composites such as C/C-SiC in which the core was made up of C/C composite and the surface was protected by a layer of SiC, problems due to cracking from the different thermal expansions of the two materials was overcome with the use of a gradient composite with SiC present in the matrix phase.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954008312466879">5</xref></sup> For the fabrication of a non-oxide ceramic such as SiC, the pyrolysis of polymer precursors has been demonstrated to have distinct advantages such as the fabrication of unconventional structures and the generation of ceramics at relatively low temperatures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954008312466879">6</xref></sup> Among the precursors of SiC, the allylhydridopolycarbosilane class of polymers is known to be available in ultrahigh purity forms yielding a near stiochiometric ratio on complete pyrolysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954008312466879">7</xref></sup> Their unique processability, high ceramic yield, and low thermal shrinkage are advantageous from the viewpoint of fabricating high-performance SiC composites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954008312466879">8</xref></sup>As a precursor of thermally stable SiC, allylhydrido-phenylpolycarbosilane (trade name: Starfire RD-730) potentially combines the dual advantage of the inherently high temperature capability of the ceramic and the polymer/composite-like processability in the range of 200–400°C. The cure temperature of this precursor is reported to be in the range of 150°C and it also has reactive functionalities for combining with commercial bismaleimide (BMI) formulations, making it an ideal preceramic candidate for the fabrication of hybrid ceramic–polymer blends and composites for thermal protection applications. The hybrid formulation would serve as a gradient interphase and a transition layer in an overall architecture that would consist of a polymer matrix composite understructure and an outer layer of SiC. Initial studies of the fabrication by melt mixing and casting of the blends and their characterization after cure have been described in a companion article in this journal.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954008312466879">9</xref></sup> It was shown that the blends had a two-phase morphology in which the Starfire resin RD-730 was dispersed as spheres within the BMI matrix. It was observed that the number of RD-730 globules increased with increasing weight fraction of RD-730 in the blend. At these higher fractions, RD-730 was also shown to coalesce to produce larger domains in the microstructure. Alleviating this problem to promote the formation of a continuous phase material involving BMI and the carbosilane ceramer would be desirable from the viewpoint of a hybrid material architecture with a gradient morphology.</p><p>The main purpose of the current work is to mitigate or even eliminate the morphological issue of phase separation in the preceramic–thermoset transition layer via the incorporation of suitably designed polymeric compatibilizers in the Starfire RD-730-BMI blends. This article describes in detail the design, synthesis, and characterization of polymeric compatibilizers utilized in the formation of the hybrid material; also described are the processing and the cure of the blend systems with the compatibilizers as well as the morphological characterization of the cured resin plaques to assess the extent of phase separation and the uniformity of distribution of the dispersant particles relative to control specimens that did not contain any compatibilizer in their formulation.</p></sec><sec id="section2-0954008312466879"><title>Experimental</title><sec id="section3-0954008312466879"><title>Materials</title><p>The Starfire resin RD-730 was purchased from Starfire Systems, Malta, New York, USA.

Accordingly, if the DABA/BMI system cures rapidly, during the typical Matrimid 5292 heating profile, then very few reactive maleimide groups will be present in the system for co-reaction with the Si-allyl groups on the Starfire polymer.</p><p>The cure mechanism of the Matrimid resin system discussed by Phelan and coworkers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954008312466879">11</xref></sup> invokes “ene” reaction of DABA with BMI as the first step in the cure followed by Diels-Alder reaction and rearomatization in the subsequent steps of the cure. While the Diels-Alder addition that occurs in the second step between the “ene” adduct formed in the first step and BMI is favored by the presence of the electron-rich phenolic group, the role of the phenolic group and its effect on reaction rates is not entirely clear. Nevertheless, if the Starfire can be made more miscible with the Matrimid components and if, as a result, early Starfire phase separation can be slowed, and then this may cause the Starfire domains to be much smaller than what was previously observed. This could result in the production of a BMI/Si-C hybrid, or at least, a material that is compatible with BMI-type processes but is converted to SiC during heat exposure/end-use conditions.</p><p>The approach we describe in this article for improving the homogeneity and the miscibility of Starfire–Matrimid blends consists of incorporation of small amounts of suitably designed compatibilizers in the blend system followed by the cure of the blend. The molecular design of the compatibilizers was based on the combined structural similarity to two of the components in the Starfire resin–Matrimid blends, that is, polycarbosilane and DABA. We envisaged that a simple homopolymer backbone structure consisting of a nonpolar carbosilane unit and a polar bisphenol A-type unit would be representative of such a compatibilizer. The structure of such a homopolymer containing dipropyl-substituted bisphenol A and tetramethyldisilylethane units can be readily prepared from commercially available starting materials and will be used as one of the compatibilizers in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954008312466879">Figure 4</xref>).</p><fig id="fig4-0954008312466879" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p> Homopolymer containing carbosilane and bis(n-propyl)bisphenol A structural units.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954008312466879-fig4.tif"/></fig><p>We have also extended this structural motif by exploring similar methodology to that described above for synthesizing well-designed block copolymers consisting of a nonpolar segment as well as a relatively more polar phenolic block that may result in well-defined polar and nonpolar domains for enhanced compatibilization and miscibility of Starfire and Matrimid systems. The structure of such a block copolymer for utilization as a compatibilizer in this study contains a nonpolar block in which a carbosilane is attached to a hydrocarbon chain and a polar block that has the repeat unit of the homopolymer backbone shown above. The nonpolar block can be considered a “carbosilane-modified paraffin” analogous to the siloxane modification of a long chain hydrocarbon 1,9-decadiene via hydrosilylation reaction, reported in the literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954008312466879">12</xref></sup> The chemical structure of the carbosilane block copolymer compatibilizer containing hexyl and dipropyl-substituted bisphenol A linkers is shown above  (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954008312466879">Figure 5</xref>).</p><fig id="fig5-0954008312466879" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p> Carbosilane block copolymer containing hexyl and bis(n-propyl)bisphenol A linkers.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954008312466879-fig5.tif"/></fig><sec id="section20-0954008312466879"><title>Purification and protection of DABA</title><p>DABA was purified by preparing the corresponding disodium salt, followed by toluene extraction of impurities, such as diallyloxy bisphenol A, followed by reacidification to regenerate DABA.

The average domain size revealed by SEM is similar to that observed for the control sample and thus it is evident that the addition of this compatibilizer did not improve the miscibility of the Starfire and Matrimid components in the mixture. On the other hand, SEMs of Starfire–Matrimid with compatibilizer 1 (5 wt%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig19-0954008312466879">Figure 19</xref>) indicate that the presence of this compatibilizer with intermediate polarity resulted in distinct improvement in phase separation and in reducing domain size. The micrograph at the higher magnification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig19-0954008312466879">Figure 19</xref>) shows Starfire domain sizes to be typically of the order of 10 µm compared with larger than 25 µm sizes seen in the control specimen. Besides, several smaller spherical domains are seen as well. Furthermore, several small, dark circles seen around the brighter, white spheres in the SEM may be attributed to the compatibilizer breaking up discrete Starfire domains but nevertheless failing to provide a cured specimen that is completely homogeneous.</p><fig id="fig18-0954008312466879" position="float"><label>Figure 18.</label><caption><p>SEM of Starfire-Matrimid (10 wt% Starfire) blends incorporating 1 wt% compatibilizer 2 with ×40 (left) and ×1000 (right) magnification.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954008312466879-fig18.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig19-0954008312466879" position="float"><label>Figure 19.</label><caption><p>SEM of Starfire-Matrimid (10 wt% Starfire) blends incorporating 5 wt% compatibilizer 1 with ×40 (left) and ×1000 (right) magnification.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954008312466879-fig19.tif"/></fig><p>In contrast to the blends incorporating compatibilizers 1 and 2, the morphology of a cured blend of Starfire–Matrimid blend containing 5 wt% of compatibilizer 3 (homopolymer in this study) was dramatically different.

The structural motif of the compatibilizers synthesized via a hydrosilylation–deprotection sequence was primarily based on a polymer repeat unit with a nonpolar segment consisting of a carbosilane unit and a polar segment with a bisphenol A-type moiety. Besides the homopolymer, two block copolymer systems with varying proportions of a nonpolar block containing a carbosilane with an aliphatic hydrocarbon linker and a relatively more polar block containing a bisphenol A unit linked to a carbosilane were also synthesized and characterized. The effectiveness of the compatibilizers, incorporated in small quantities for alleviating phase separation in the blends, was assessed by the Starfire domain size and distribution observed in the SEM of cured specimens. The block copolymer, designed to have an equal number of the nonpolar and polar block repeat units, was found to be reasonably effective in mitigating phase separation. However, the incorporation of the homopolymer that was most polar due to the highest phenolic content in its structure resulted in a dramatic reduction of the Starfire domain size, down to ≤5 μm in diameter, in the cured Starfire–Matrimid blend. The presence of this compatibilizer was also found to result in the uniform distribution of Starfire domains in the samples examined.</p><p>Based on the discussion above, the compatibilizers can be assessed as follows in terms of decreasing effectiveness in minimizing phase separation of the Starfire domains as well as promoting homogeneity in the cured resin plaques, in accordance with decreasing polarity from the homopolymer compatibilizer 3 to block copolymer compatibilizer 2: compatibilizer 3 (5 wt%) &gt; compatibilizer 3 (1 wt%) &gt; compatibilizer 1 (5 wt%) &gt; control &gt; compatibilizer 2 (5 wt%).</p><p>Further work in this area will involve molecular design of compatibilizer structures in which various polar phenolic moieties will be attached via flexible spacer groups as side chains to a polycarbosilane backbone using hydrosilylation methodology reported for such reactions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954008312466879">15</xref></sup></p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>The authors would like to thank Mary Galaska and Kathleen Schenk (University of Dayton Research Institute) for the DSC and TGA results on the compatibilizers synthesized in this study.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure" id="fn1-0954008312466879"><label>Funding</label><p>Funding provided to the University of Dayton Research Institute under Contract # FA8650-10-D-5011, Task Order 0001 entitled “Hybrid Materials Compositions in Combined Aggressive Environments,” from AFRL/RXBC, Materials and Manufacturing Directorate, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base is gratefully acknowledged.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bibr1-0954008312466879"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Brown</surname><given-names>JM</given-names></name><name><surname>Putthanarat</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Trejo</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><etal/></person-group>. <article-title>Preceramic polymer for gradient organic-inorganic morphologies</article-title>. <source>SAMPE Proceedings</source> <year>2010</year>.</citation></ref><ref id="bibr2-0954008312466879"><label>2</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Wilson</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Beckley</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Koo</surname><given-names>JH</given-names></name></person-group> . <article-title>Development of silicone matrix-based advanced composites for thermal protection</article-title>. <source>High Perform Polym</source> <year>1994</year>;
