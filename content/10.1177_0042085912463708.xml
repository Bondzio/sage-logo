<p>Regardless of what we do—increase funding, reduce class size, establish charter schools, create private schools, increase parent involvement, raise standards/expectations, lower standards/expectations, offer year-round schooling, or desegregate—we continue to fall far short in attempts to provide quality education for students of African descent and other so-called minority and poor children in the United States.</p>
<p>Lisa Delpit, the author of the award-winning book, <italic>Educating Other People’s Children</italic>, has written another excellent treatise on quality education. In <italic>Multiplication Is for White People: Raising Expectations for Other People’s Children</italic>, Delpit discusses (a) the politics of education, (b) the impact of racism on education, (c) the achievement gap, (d) the attitudes of educators toward children who are different from them, (e) the impact of schooling on students, (f) issues in higher education, and (g) keys to success for all students. While Delpit focuses largely on the educational experiences of African American students, her tremendous insights are of benefit to all educators working with any group of students; the principles, guidelines, and advice have universal application.</p>
<p>Delpit, the Felton G. Clark Professor of Education at Southern University, speaks from two frames within the book. Her first context is drawn from the juxtaposition of her roles as a mother and as an educator. Second, she consistently makes use of her 10 essential features of quality education: (a) good teaching, (b) acknowledgment of students’ brilliance, (c) encouragement of critical thinking, (d) stimulation of emotional ego strength, (e) emboldening students’ strengths, (f) utilizing familiar metaphors and experiences, (g) emphasizing familyhood, (h) monitoring and assessing, (i) emphasizing students’ home culture, and (j) acknowledging students’ home community (pp. xix-xx).</p>
<p>In discussing politics and education, Delpit notes that while wealthy people in the United States typically send their children to private, elite institutions, they continue to control public education (p. xv). At another point, in discussing charter schools, she posits that, while these institutions were intended to help strengthen public schools, they have, instead, become competitors with community schools (p. xvi).</p>
<p>In considering the politics of education, Delpit discusses two other issues of relevance: the impact of desegregation and the repercussions of Teach For America (TFA). Many have discussed the impact of desegregation on African American students, teachers, and principals. However, Delpit rightfully reconsiders this reality, in light of the continuing challenges faced by African American people, in general, and African American students in particular.</p>
<p>Relatedly, Delpit discusses how school districts have intentionally created large numbers of positions for TFA teachers in urban schools—while simultaneously releasing large numbers of regular credentialed teachers. In addition to impacting the employment of large numbers of teachers, these actions affect the education of students, as TFA teachers usually stay for only 2 to 3 years, creating a revolving door in many urban schools (p. 114).</p>
<p>Delpit lists several reasons for her “anger” with regard to the education of African American students. In discussing one reason for her rage, Delpit says, “I am angry at the racism that, despite having a president who is half white and half black, still permeates our America” (p. xvii).</p>
<p>Incorporating the experiences of her daughter, Maya, Delpit makes several of her points quite effectively. In describing the invisibility that African American people (and particularly African American students) experience in U.S. society, she uses her daughter’s encounters in a predominately white preschool (p. 170). Delpit also talks about the notion of <italic>microaggression</italic>, a term coined by Chester Pierce. It is a set of factors that plague people who are oppressed: invisibility, devaluation, stigmatization, and stereotyping (p. 177). Delpit’s point is that we are in a society wherein people continue to be discriminated against—in part because of the color of the skin. And students, unfortunately, are not immune to racism.</p>
<p>Delpit quickly dismisses the notion of an achievement gap between the success of white and African American students. She does not deny, nor do I, that a significant—and growing—gap exists. Her dismissal refers to the assumption that the gap begins at birth. The truth is that it is the societal impact that brings about the gap at about age 5. As evidence, Delpit references studies comparing Ugandan and European infants as well as African American and white American infants; the Ugandan infants outperform their European counterparts and the African American infants outperform their white American counterparts (pp. 3-5).</p>

<p>If we do not recognize the brilliance before us, we cannot help but carry out the stereotypic societal views that these children are somehow damaged goods and that they cannot be expected to succeed. (p. 5)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Delpit spends quite a bit of time—appropriately—discussing the attitudes of educators toward students who are different from them. For example, according to Delpit, data show that as the number of African American students in a school district increases, high quality teachers—black and white—tend to leave (p. 16).</p>
<p>Education schools do not prepare students for the diversity that they experience once they join the ranks of full-time teachers. Consequently, when students do not learn in the way we teach, we assume that the problem is with the child. As Delpit says, educators assume that, when children do not respond to this one-model-fits-all approach, they cannot learn (p. 103). In fact, she argues that many African American students, whose learning styles are unique, are labeled as “incompetent, inadequate and damaged” (p. 94). The impact of this labeling, Delpit contends, is that students are assumed to be less brilliant and they become subject to remediation, teaching down and less teaching (p. 6).</p>
<p>The racism, teacher attitudes, and the political nature of education, all have an impact on African American students and other poor and minority students. One burden that Delpit describes is <italic>stereotype threat</italic>, a term coined by Claude Steele that refers to fear that a negative stereotype about you is at play (p. 17).</p>
<p>In the last two chapters, Delpit discusses challenges in higher education. While she does spend some time talking about the challenges that students of color face in higher education (emphasizing the need to value and welcome them, challenge and support them, take their racism concerns seriously, and include their culture), her main point in discussing higher education is that we do not effectively and efficiently connect universities to the communities in which they exist. She asks,<disp-quote>
<p>What would happen if we had an interdisciplinary course in which students from each discipline were exposed to professors from a range of disciplines in a yearlong community-centered, problem-solving course that would gather knowledge of how the client’s needs might be addressed from each discipline’s perspective? (p. 204)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In 224 pages, Delpit covers quite a bit of territory. While much of what she says is not new information, her organized, well-documented presentation, coupled with her relaxed and personalized style, provide a much more useful roadmap than we usually find in books about education. In addition, she draws upon the expertise of others who, like Delpit, have—for years—provided useful guidance in educating other people’s children. These include Irvine, who coined the notion of “other mothering,” that is, caring, demanding, and believing (p. 43). Delpit also draws on Vasquez, who speaks of “warm demanders”—individuals who expect much of their students and offer praise, while providing discipline and structure (p. 77).</p>
<p>Once again, Lisa Delpit has provided an outstanding set of instructions to enable us to effectively educate other people’s children. Her teachings are crystal clear and their essence is captured in the following two excerpts. At one point she says, “I believe the first step . . . is to become convinced of these children’s inherent intellectual capability, humanity, physical ability and spiritual character” (p. 30). At another point Delpit posits,<disp-quote>
<p>Successful instruction is constant, rigorous, integrated across disciplines, connected to students’ lived cultures, connected to their intellectual legacies, engaging, and designed for problem solving that is useful beyond the classroom. (p. 69)</p>
<p>Will we finally listen?</p>
