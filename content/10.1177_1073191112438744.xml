<abstract>
<p>Although most psychological assessments are based on measures related to an individual’s average level of performance, it has been proposed that measures of variability around one’s average may provide unique individual difference information and have clinical significance. The current study investigated properties of within-person variability in measures of performance accuracy in a sample of more than 1,700 healthy adults. Contrary to what has been reported with measures of within-person variability in reaction time, measures of within-person variability in performance accuracy from different cognitive tests had weak correlations with one another, very low stability across time, and near-zero correlations with longitudinal change in cognitive abilities.</p>

<p>In recent years, there has been a great deal of interest in within-person, or intraindividual, variability as a potentially important dimension of individual differences in cognitive functioning (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1073191112438744">Hultsch, Strauss, Hunter, &amp; MacDonald, 2008</xref>, for a review). Measures of within-person variability have been found to differ as a function of normal aging (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1073191112438744">Der &amp; Deary, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1073191112438744">Hultsch, MacDonald, &amp; Dixon, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1073191112438744">Nesselroade &amp; Salthouse, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1073191112438744">Williams, Hultsch, Strauss, Hunter, &amp; Tannock, 2005</xref>), clinical condition (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1073191112438744">Adams, Roberts, Milich, &amp; Fillmore, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1073191112438744">Bleiberg.

In addition, measures of within-person variability have been reported to be stable over short intervals (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1073191112438744">Hultsch et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1073191112438744">Nesselroade &amp; Salthouse, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1073191112438744">Rabbitt, Osman, Moore, &amp; Stollery, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1073191112438744">Saville et al., 2011</xref>) and to have a coherent structure in factor analyses (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1073191112438744">Hultsch et al., 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1073191112438744">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1073191112438744">Li, Aggen, Nesselroade, &amp; Baltes, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1073191112438744">Strauss et al., 2007</xref>). Taken together, these properties suggest that measures of within-person variability can provide valuable information about an individual’s cognitive status. That is, measures of variability in cognitive functioning could be an early indicator of impending change and might serve as a unique marker of certain clinical conditions.</p>
<p>Several characteristics are common to much of the prior research investigating within-person variability. First, although there are exceptions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1073191112438744">Hultsch et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1073191112438744">Li et al., 2001</xref>), most of the studies have investigated variability in reaction to time or other speeded tasks. Second, a large proportion of the studies have focused on short-term variability across trials within a single session rather than longer term variability across different sessions (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1073191112438744">Hultsch et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1073191112438744">Nesselroade &amp; Salthouse, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1073191112438744">Rabbitt et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1073191112438744">Salthouse &amp; Berish, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1073191112438744">Stuss et al., 2003</xref>). And third, the majority of the studies involved adults older than about 60 years of age (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1073191112438744">Der &amp; Deary, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1073191112438744">Williams et al., 2005</xref>). These characteristics lead to questions as to whether within-person variability is primarily meaningful as an individual differences measure when it is based on speeded tasks, when it reflects momentary rather than day-to-day fluctuations, and when the research participants are older adults.</p>
<p>A different, and in some respects more surprising, form of variability is the variation in the accuracy of performance of the same cognitive task across sessions separated by days or weeks. Because cognitive abilities are generally considered to be relatively stable traits, this form of variability is often assumed to be very small. However, recent research has revealed that short-term variability in level of cognitive performance can be substantial (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1073191112438744">Salthouse, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1073191112438744">Salthouse, Nesselroade, &amp; Berish, 2006</xref>). The goal of the current project was to investigate properties of this type of within-person variability to determine if it has some of the same characteristics as within-person variability in reaction time (RT) tasks and whether it may represent a meaningful dimension of individual differences. In particular, the magnitude, stability, and correlations of within-person variability in accuracy of cognitive performance were examined in 16 cognitive tests.</p>
<p>The analyses were conducted on data from the Virginia Cognitive Aging Project (VCAP), which is a mixed cross-sectional and longitudinal study involving a measurement burst design in which different versions of 16 cognitive tests were performed in each of three sessions. Participants in VCAP span a wide age range, and therefore separate analyses were reported for adults aged 60 to 95 years and 18 to 59 years. The former group is typical of most prior research, and the latter group allows the phenomenon to be examined at younger ages.</p>
<p>To summarize, the current study was designed to investigate the following properties of within-person across-session variability in accuracy of cognitive performance: magnitude (i.e., within-person variability relative to between-person variability), structure (i.e., interrelations of measures of within-person variability in different variables), longitudinal stability (i.e., correlations of within-person variability from Time 1 [T1] to Time 2 [T2]), and correlations of within-person variability with change in cognitive abilities from T1 to T2.</p>

<p>Participants were recruited from newspaper advertisements and referrals from other participants. Approximately 81% were Caucasian, about 10% African American, and the remaining distributed across other ethnicities or reporting more than one ethnicity.

<title>Cognitive Tests</title>
<p>Cognitive functioning was assessed with 16 tests selected to reflect 5 cognitive abilities (i.e., vocabulary, inductive reasoning, spatial visualization, episodic memory, and perceptual speed). The <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1073191112438744">appendix</xref> contains a brief description of the tests and their sources. Most of the test versions had internal consistency and test–retest reliabilities of .7 or greater, and loadings of .7 or greater on their respective ability factors in confirmatory factor analyses of these 16 tests (i.e., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1073191112438744">Salthouse, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1073191112438744">Salthouse, Pink, &amp; Tucker-Drob, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1073191112438744">Salthouse &amp; Tucker-Drob, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The tests were administered in the same order in each session, but different versions of the tests were performed in each of the three sessions. Because the test versions could differ in mean performance, which would preclude direct comparisons across versions, the three versions were administered in a counterbalanced order to a separate sample of 90 adults between 20 and 79 years of age to determine average performance in each version without confounding version with sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1073191112438744">Salthouse, 2007</xref>). Regression equations in this sample were used to predict performance in the original test version from scores on the second or third versions, and the intercepts and slopes of these equations were then used to adjust the scores on the second and third versions of every participant in the current study to remove any sequence-independent version differences in means. Detailed information on this calibration sample, including means and standard deviations (<italic>SD</italic>s) in each session, is reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1073191112438744">Salthouse (2007)</xref>.</p>
<p>Analyses reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1073191112438744">Salthouse and Nesselroade (2010)</xref> revealed that the average accuracy of performance increased across the three sessions within each measurement occasion. Because any systematic linear trends could inflate the estimates of within-person variability, and confound them with short-term learning, they were removed with regression equations applied to the data of individual participants, and then <italic>SD</italic>s of the residuals were used as the index of within-burst variability for each variable.</p>

<p>As noted above, regression equations were used to adjust the scores on the second and third test versions to have the same expected means as the scores on the first version. All adjusted scores for each variable were then converted into <italic>z</italic>-score units based on the distribution of scores on the first session of the first occasion (T11) for that variable to express scores on different test versions in the same units. Regression analyses were also conducted on each participant’s data relating test score to session number, with the <italic>SD</italic>s of the regression residuals used as the measure of within-person variability in each test for each participant. Note that two separate sets of regression equations were applied to the data, one set (which was the same for all participants) to equate the difficulty of the different test versions and a second set (consisting of different equations for each participant) to remove individual-specific across-session practice effects.</p>

Across the 16 tests, the median <italic>SD</italic> at the first (T1) occasion was .23. Because the T11 scores were in <italic>z</italic>-score units, the between-person <italic>SD</italic>s were very close to 1. The average within-person variability can therefore be inferred to be about 23% of the variation across people on the first assessment.</p>

<p>Another method of evaluating the magnitude of within-person variability is to contrast it with the magnitude of cross-sectional age differences in the sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1073191112438744">Salthouse, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1073191112438744">Salthouse et al., 2006</xref>). Slopes of regression equations relating T11 scores to age for the variables with negative age relations (i.e., all variables except the vocabulary variables) ranged from −.015 to −.033 <italic>SD</italic> per year, with a median of −.026 <italic>SD</italic> per year. Dividing the median within-person variability (.23) by the median annual cross-sectional difference (−.026) indicated that the within-person variability for these variables was equivalent to about 8.8 years of cross-sectional age difference. The median within-person variability and the number of years of cross-sectional age difference were smaller than in prior studies (i.e., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1073191112438744">Salthouse, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1073191112438744">Salthouse et al., 2006</xref>), likely because the linear across-session trends were removed before computing within-person variability.</p>
<p>Inspection of the values in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1073191112438744">Table 2</xref> reveals that the magnitude of within-person variability in each test was similar in the two age-groups and the effect sizes in <italic>d</italic> units for the group difference were all relatively small. Moreover, this was also true at both T1 and T2 for the longitudinal participants, whose data are presented in the bottom panel of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1073191112438744">Table 2</xref>. Correlations were also examined between age and within-person variability in the entire sample. All the correlations were relatively small, with a range from −.14 to .08 and a median of .01. Although within-person variability in cognitive performance was moderately large compared with both between-person variability and cross-sectional age differences, there was no evidence that these measures of within-person variability are related to the age of the participant.</p>

<sec id="section6-1073191112438744">
<title>Structure</title>
<p>An exploratory analysis was conducted to determine if there was structure in the measures of within-person variability. A principal components analysis on the T1 within-person <italic>SD</italic>s revealed that the first component was associated with 9.5% of the variance in the 18- to 59-year age-group and that the cumulative percentage of variance after two components was 17.3%. Corresponding values in the 60- to 95-year age-group were 9.1% and 16.9%, respectively.</p>
<p>For comparison purposes, similar analyses were conducted on the T11 scores representing average performance. In the 18 to 59 age-group, the first component was associated with 51.6% of the variance, and the cumulative percentage with two components was 63.7%. Corresponding values in the 60 to 95 age-group were 39.8% and 51.5%, respectively. The results with the T11 scores replicate the familiar pattern with cognitive test scores, but the weak interrelations with the measures of within-person variability in both age-groups suggest that they have little or no structure and weak relations with one another.</p>

<title>Stability</title>
<p>Correlations across the longitudinal interval were computed for the first session means (i.e., T11 and T21) and for the measures of within-subject variability at T1 and T2. It can be seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1073191112438744">Table 3</xref> that these stability coefficients were moderately high for the Session 1 scores, with medians of .72 and .71, respectively, in the 18 to 59 and 60 to 95 age-groups. However, the correlations were very low for the within-person <italic>SD</italic>s, with medians of only .07 and .08 in the two groups.</p>

<title>Correlations</title>
<p>A final set of analyses examined whether within-person variability at the first occasion (T1) predicted cognitive change from T1 to T2. A latent change model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1073191112438744">Ferrer &amp; McArdle, 2010</xref>) as portrayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1073191112438744">Figure 1</xref> was used in these analyses. The variables reflecting cognitive ability (e.g., word recall, paired associates, and logical memory for memory ability) are represented by squares, and the latent level (L) and latent change (C) constructs are represented by circles. Of primary interest in the current context are the relations between the measures of within-person variability for a given cognitive test variable (represented in the box at the top of the figure) and the latent change construct (the circle labeled C). Advantages of latent change models for the analysis of change are that change is evaluated in terms of latent constructs that theoretically have no measurement error and that all available data can be used in the analyses with the full-information maximum likelihood algorithm.</p>

</fig>
<p>A total of 65 (out of 160, consisting of 16 tests related to each of five cognitive abilities in the two age-groups) relations were significant in the prediction of the level parameter in these latent change analyses. Most of the relations were negative, indicating that greater within-person variability was associated with lower levels of cognitive ability. However, only 6 of 160 relations were significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) in the prediction of the latent change parameter, and they were distributed across different combinations of within-person variability measures and cognitive abilities. These results therefore provide little evidence of a systematic relation of the measures of within-person variability with longitudinal change in cognitive ability.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results reported above indicate that across-session within-person variability in accuracy of cognitive performance is moderately large, as it is almost one fourth the magnitude of the between-person variability in average performance in a given session and is equivalent to nearly 9 years of cross-sectional age difference. However, this type of variability appears to be unsystematic because the correlations with measures of within-person variability in other cognitive tests were very small, with little evidence of structure among the measures; the measures had almost no across-time stability; and the correlations with longitudinal change in cognitive abilities were all very small. Moreover, in each of these respects the pattern was very similar in independent samples of adults between 60 and 95 years of age and between 18 and 59 years of age.</p>
<p>Why is the pattern of within-person variability in accuracy of performance different from that reported with measures of within-person variability in RT, in which the measures of variability have been reported to have moderate stability and significant relations to one another and to other types of variables? Both methodological and substantive factors may be involved. For example, RT variability is sensitive to a few very slow RTs, and in some studies the elimination of extreme scores may have been incomplete because outliers were identified on the basis of group means rather than means of individual participants. It is also possible that in some studies the measure of variability might not have been independent of the mean, and therefore relations with measures of within-person variability may have indirectly reflected relations with the mean. To illustrate, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1073191112438744">Hultsch et al. (2000)</xref> attempted to remove the effects of mean RT by partialing the effects associated with group membership (and occasion and trial effects) before computing <italic>SD</italic>s of the residuals, but these “purified residuals” still had substantial correlations (ranging from .54 to .94) with mean RT. There is currently no consensus on the ideal method of controlling influences of the mean, and complicated methods may be needed because <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1073191112438744">Schmiedek, Lovden, and Lindenberger. (2009)</xref> recently reported that the relations between mean and variance can differ across individuals. Whatever method is used, however, before interpreting relations involving within-person variability, it is important to verify independence of mean and variability empirically because within-person variability may not be a unique dimension of individual differences if it is not independent of the mean.</p>
<p>Among the possible substantive reasons for the differences across studies are the time frame over which variability was assessed and the nature of the dependent variable. That is, variability across trials within a single session may reflect the ability to maintain attention over a brief period of time, whereas variability across days may reflect fluctuations in mood or in one’s general state. Another possibility is that RT and other measures of speeded processing are simply more sensitive than measures of accuracy of performance, such that subtle aspects of variability are more detectable with RT measures than with accuracy measures. For example, measures of within-person variability with RT can be computed across a few trials, whereas many trials must be aggregated to obtain a sensitive measure of accuracy, and even more are needed to allow within-person variability to be computed.</p>
<p>It should be noted that although not measured in units of time, three of the cognitive tests in this project were designed to assess perceptual speed (i.e., digit symbol, letter comparison, and pattern comparison). However, the results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1073191112438744">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1073191112438744">3</xref> indicate that the patterns for these measures were very similar to the others, and therefore the most relevant distinction regarding differential properties of within-person variability may be between RT and other measures of cognitive performance, not between speed and accuracy of performance.</p>
<p>Regardless of the reasons for the differences between RT and other measures of performance, it is important to recognize that other studies have reported results similar to those in this study. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1073191112438744">Hultsch et al. (2000)</xref> noted that their measures of within-person variability of memory accuracy were less sensitive to clinical group membership than RT measures of within-person variability, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1073191112438744">Li et al. (2001)</xref> reported very low values of stability and reliability of within-person variability for measures of memory accuracy. Furthermore, with data from a subset of the current sample, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1073191112438744">Salthouse (2007)</xref> reported reliabilities of within-person variability based on correlations of within-person <italic>SD</italic>s from odd-numbered and even-numbered items. The median reliabilities across the cognitive variables in the two studies, respectively, were .26 and .26, compared with median reliabilities of .94 and .92 for the mean scores in the same individuals. Although reliabilities and other psychometric properties of within-person variability of accuracy measures might be stronger with different cognitive variables, or with additional sessions of measurement, the assessment of cognition in this project was fairly broad, and in most testing situations it may not be practical to administer more than three separate versions of each test.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the results of this study suggest that it is important to distinguish different types of within-person variability, as variability in accuracy across three sessions appears to have different properties from variability in RT across multiple trials within a single session. In light of its weak psychometric properties, within-person across-session variability in accuracy of cognitive performance does not appear to provide unique information about an individual’s cognitive (and possibly clinical) status, and thus it may not be a useful individual difference characteristic.</p>
