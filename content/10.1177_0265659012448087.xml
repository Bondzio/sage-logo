<abstract>
<p>The current study was designed to examine the relationships between performance on a nonverbal phoneme deletion task administered in a dynamic assessment format with performance on measures of phoneme deletion, word-level reading, and speech sound production that required verbal responses for school-age children with speech sound disorders (SSDs). The study adds to existing literature by administering the nonverbal task to children with SSDs, and by incorporating the use of an error-specific prompting system in a dynamic assessment format to inform instructional decisions. Ten school-age children with various degrees of speech sound disorders participated in the study. Speech production, phonological awareness, and word-level reading skills were examined. Performance on measures of verbal and nonverbal phoneme deletion were significantly correlated; however, the measure of nonverbal phoneme deletion was not related to performance on measures of speech sound production. Both measures were related to word-level reading.</p>

<title>I Introduction</title>
<p>A number of linguistic abilities underlie proficient reading and writing skills, including phonological awareness. Phonological awareness refers to the awareness of the sound structure of spoken language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0265659012448087">Gillon, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0265659012448087">Schuele and Boudreau, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0265659012448087">Stackhouse and Wells, 1997</xref>) and is highly linked to reading proficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0265659012448087">Catts and Kamhi, 1999</xref>). It has been suggested that difficulties in the use of previously stored phonological information or ‘representations’ may be the basis of problems that some children have in learning to read and spell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0265659012448087">Carroll and Snowling, 2004</xref>). There are a number of tasks that are used to assess underlying phonological representations, most of which require verbal output on the part of the child.</p>
<p>Typical tasks used to measure phonological awareness include sound categorization or alliteration (e.g. <italic>cat</italic> begins with the same sound as which of the following words: <italic>leg, cup, man</italic>); blending (m + a + n = <italic>man</italic>) and phoneme elision or deletion (<italic>cold</italic> – [k] = old). Research suggests that the ability to perform various phonological awareness tasks emerges at different points in time, progressing from the awareness of larger to smaller sound units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0265659012448087">McNeill and Hesketch, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0265659012448087">Schuele and Boudreau, 2008</xref>). It is generally accepted that children are able to match similar sounds in words (sound categorization/alliteration) before they are able to segment words into their respective sounds (segmentation). The phoneme awareness tasks that have been shown to be most closely related to the development of early reading and spelling are those that require manipulation of phonemes such as blending, segmentation and deletion tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0265659012448087">Perfetti et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0265659012448087">Rosner and Simon, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0265659012448087">Schuele and Boudreau, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>There are a number of standardized assessments that are available to assess phoneme blending, segmentation and deletion, including the Test of Preschool Early Literacy (TOPEL; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0265659012448087">Lonigan et al., 2007</xref>). The TOPEL was designed for children between the ages of 3 and 5;11 and includes subtests that measure print knowledge, vocabulary and phonological awareness. Phonological awareness is measured through elision and blending tasks. The Comprehensive Test of Phonological Processing (CTOPP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0265659012448087">Wagner et al., 1999</xref>) is a similar measure designed for clients between the ages of 4 and 24 and includes composite scores for estimating skill in phonological awareness (categorization, blending, deletion/elision), phonological memory and rapid naming. The Preschool and Primary Inventory of Phonological Awareness (PIPA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0265659012448087">Dodd et al., 2000</xref>) is a phonological awareness measure appropriate for children between the ages of 3 and 7 and includes subtests for measuring syllable and phoneme segmentation, rhyme, alliteration, phoneme isolation and letter knowledge. A comprehensive measure of phonological skills is the Phonological Assessment Battery (PhAB; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0265659012448087">Frederickson et al., 1997</xref>), designed for children between the ages of 6 to 15; however, it does not include subtests for measuring blending, segmentation or elision/deletion.</p>
<p>Many of the subtests on available phonological awareness measures require that children respond verbally by producing a ‘free-response’ to a stimulus item. For example, on the CTOPP children are asked, ‘What is <italic>cold</italic> without /k/’ to elicit the response <italic>old</italic>. Scoring involves making a judgment as to whether a response is correct or incorrect. In the previous example, <italic>old</italic> is the correct response and any other response as incorrect. The sound segmentation subtest of the PIPA requires children to repeat words, inserting a clear pause between each phoneme. However, when a child’s speech contains errors – as is the case when children present with speech sound disorders (SSDs) – scoring may be less than straightforward. There are no guidelines in any of the manuals reported here to inform scoring or interpretation under these conditions.</p>
<p>Approximately 10% of preschool and school-age children demonstrate some form of speech sound disorder in the USA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0265659012448087">National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, 2007</xref>), and more than 92% of speech language pathologists (SLPs) will serve a child with SSD at some point in time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0265659012448087">Shewan, 1988</xref>). There is mounting research evidence that children with SSDs are at increased risk for demonstrating difficulty acquiring phoneme awareness and in learning to read (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0265659012448087">Anthony et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0265659012448087">Bird et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0265659012448087">Snowling et al., 2000</xref>). Therefore, measurement of phoneme awareness, or underlying phonological representations, for children with SSDs is a very important part of the assessment battery.</p>
<p>An alternative method to measuring phonemic awareness when children demonstrate a SSD is to use a receptive or nonverbal task that does not require a verbal response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0265659012448087">Larrivee and Catts, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0265659012448087">Rvachew, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0265659012448087">Sutherland and Gillon, 2005</xref>). This was the approach taken by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0265659012448087">Rvachew (2007)</xref>, who examined the relationships between phonological processing and reading skill for children with and without SSDs. Her findings revealed that phonological processing skill –; measured using nonverbal phonological awareness tasks from the Phonological Awareness Test (PAT; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0265659012448087">Robertson and Salter, 1995</xref>) – and not speech production was related to later reading ability. Nonverbal measures of phonemic awareness may provide better information regarding underlying phonemic knowledge or phonological representations than measures that require a verbal response for children with SSDs.</p>
<p>Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0265659012448087">Claessen et al. (2010)</xref> designed a task to measure underlying phonological representations that does not require verbal output. Researchers administered the task to 69 typically developing Year 2 (ages 7–8) children in Australia. Their tool, the Silent Deletion of Phonemes (SDOP), consists of 35 items administered on a laptop computer and asks children to delete and manipulate sounds silently or ‘internally’. Research suggests that tasks that require silent manipulation of sounds allow for more accurate measurement of a child’s stored phonological representations than those that require verbal output. The SDOP task is administered in two separate sessions. The first session is conducted to ensure comprehension for the pictures used as stimuli, and the second session consists of the actual administration of the SDOP. This procedure is undertaken to increase the likelihood that children will use their own ‘internal phonological representations’ to respond to the SDOP task than those spoken by the examiner and to reduce demands on working memory. The stimulus is presented, ‘Black without /l/ is ____,’ and children are asked to select from an array of four pictures to indicate the picture that represents the new word after deletion (e.g. <italic>back</italic>). The SDOP reports acceptable internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha = .85) and high correlations with word and passage level reading (<italic>r</italic> = .62). Concurrent validity was measured by correlating children’s SDOP scores with a standard measure of phonological awareness; the Sutherland Phonological Awareness Test: Revised (SPAT-R; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0265659012448087">Neilson, 2003</xref>) and was moderate (<italic>r</italic> = .63). The SDOP is an acceptable measure of phonological awareness that does not require a verbal response for use with children who demonstrate SSDs.</p>
<p>Recently, a receptive phoneme deletion task was developed that extends the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0265659012448087">Claessen et al. (2010)</xref> to older children and is administered in a dynamic assessment format (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0265659012448087">Gillam et al., 2011</xref>). The most familiar approach to dynamic assessment is the ‘test, teach, retest’ paradigm that involves using actual child responses to inform instruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0265659012448087">Laing and Kamhi, 2003</xref>). A child’s responsiveness to instruction during dynamic assessment is often a better way to diagnose problems in learning than performance on static assessments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0265659012448087">Gutierrez-Clellen and Pena, 2001</xref>). Dynamic assessment of phonological awareness has been shown to be a better predictor of reading performance than static measures for children with and without speech and language impairments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0265659012448087">Gillam et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0265659012448087">Laing and Espeland, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0265659012448087">Laing and Kamhi, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0265659012448087">Spector, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>Like the SDOP, the dynamic assessment of phoneme deletion is nonverbal and requires children to silently manipulate sounds in words in increasingly complex syllable contexts. Internal reliability for the dynamic assessment of the phoneme deletion task was assessed using Cronbach’s alpha and is: = .88. Concurrent validity was assessed against a standard measure of phoneme deletion (CTOPP) and is large (<italic>r</italic> = .84). The measure is unique because it incorporates a prompting system based on the errors children make on the task. The number of errors made on the task provides insight as to the quality of underlying phonological representations. Analysis of the types of errors informs remediation.</p>
<p>The current study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0265659012448087">Gillam et al., 2011</xref>) was designed to examine the relationships between performance on the nonverbal phoneme deletion task administered in a dynamic assessment format with performance on a measure of phoneme deletion requiring a spoken response rather than with performance on measures of phoneme deletion with a spoken response, word-level reading, and speech sound production for school-age children with SSDs. The study adds to existing literature by administering the nonverbal task to children with SSDs, and by incorporating the use of an error-specific prompting system in a dynamic assessment format to inform instructional decisions.</p>

<title>II Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-0265659012448087">
<title>1 Participants</title>
<p>Participants were recruited from the city school district in Logan, Utah. Educators were asked to refer children to the study who were being served by SLPs for primary speech impairment, who had no identified developmental delays, and who were monolingual English speakers. Parents who contacted the research team were invited to speak to research staff to decide whether they would be interested in having their child participate in the study. Parents were interviewed and students were consented and screened for participation in the study. Children who demonstrated a speech sound disorder (SSD) without associated cognitive or motor/physical impairments (complex communication needs) and were currently receiving services in the public schools for SSD were eligible for participation in the study. Children were excluded from participation in the study if their nonverbal reasoning ability fell below 1 standard deviation (SD) of the mean on the Test of Nonverbal Intelligence: 3 (TONI-3: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0265659012448087">Brown et al., 1998</xref>). Ten children between the ages of 5;0 and 10;9 (5 male; 5 female) participated in the study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0265659012448087">
<title>2 General procedures</title>
<p>Data collection took place at the Utah State University Speech and Hearing Center. Each child was seen individually for testing. The examiners were trained research assistants under the supervision of a certified speech language pathologist. Children were given breaks after each assessment to play in a clinic playroom and have snacks under supervision of research assistants and, in some cases, parents. Participants were given the Goldman Fristoe Test of Articulation (GFTA; Goldman-Fristoe, 2000), the word identification subtest of the Woodcock Reading Mastery Test: Revised (WRMT-R; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0265659012448087">Woodcock, 1987</xref>), the phoneme deletion subtest of the Comprehensive Test of Phonological Processing (CTOPP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0265659012448087">Wagner et al., 1999</xref>) and a nonverbal measure of phoneme deletion administered in a dynamic assessment format (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0265659012448087">Gillam et al., 2011</xref>). Participants were also given the Test of Nonverbal Intelligence: 3 (TONI-3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0265659012448087">Brown et al., 1998</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section5-0265659012448087">
<title>a Speech production tasks:</title>
<p>The GFTA was administered by three research assistants and was recorded with a digital recorder. As one research assistant administered the assessment using the standardized administration guidelines, recording the individual sound responses onto the GFTA protocol, the other research assistant recorded the whole-word verbal responses using broad IPA transcription. A third research assistant observed the session from an observation room, transcribed the students’ whole-word responses and scored the protocols after listening to the audio file. The research assistants met and reviewed the digital recording, the whole-word transcriptions, and the individual sound transcriptions. Scoring discrepancies were resolved by a trained research assistant, who was also a certified SLP. Scoring reliability for the GFTA was 100%.</p>
<p>The whole-word response data obtained from administration of the GFTA was used to calculate percent consonants correct (PCC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0265659012448087">Shriberg and Kwiatkowski, 1982</xref>). Percent consonants correct was calculated by adding the total number of consonants produced correctly for the whole-word transcriptions elicited from the GFTA, dividing by the total number of intended consonants and multiplying by 100. A trained research assistant calculated PCC. A second trained research assistant calculated PCC independently and compared scores to those of the first research assistant. Reliability of scoring was 100% for PCC. While we recognize that single-word samples are not optimal for the calculation of PCC, we used it here as a gross measure of ‘intelligibility’.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0265659012448087">
<title>b Phonemic awareness tasks:</title>
<p>The CTOPP elision subtest was administered to all children by the first author and contains 20-items arranged in increasing syllable complexity. CTOPP items are presented verbally to children and require verbal responses. For example, children are asked to delete monosyllabic words from multisyllabic words (e.g. <italic>popcorn</italic> without ‘corn’ = <italic>pop</italic>), and to delete initial and final phonemes from words as in ‘bold’ without /b/ = ‘old’ or ‘mike’ without /k/ = ‘my’. The items become increasingly more difficult requiring medial phoneme deletion (e.g. <italic>tiger</italic> without /g/) or cluster deletion in initial (e.g. <italic>strain</italic> without /r/), medial (e.g. <italic>winter</italic> without /t/) and final word positions (e.g. <italic>silk</italic> without /l/). Evaluators are instructed in the manual to provide verbal feedback on response accuracy for all 6 of the practice items and the first 5 of 20 test items, for a total possible of 11 prompts. The test is discontinued after children miss 3 test items in a row.</p>
<p>The nonverbal phoneme deletion task resembles the CTOPP elision task but includes 21 picturable items representing various syllable shapes requiring deletion of initial and final consonant singletons and clusters. Children are asked to indicate their response choice by pointing to one of a series of pictures. First, the examiner ensures that the child knows what the response choices are by naming them and asking for a pointing response. For example, the examiner says, ‘This is ice’ (pointing to the picture of ice), ‘This is dice’ (pointing to the picture of dice) and, ‘This is under’ (pointing to the picture of ‘under’). Now you show me ‘ice’. After the comprehension check, the stimulus item is shown to the child (e.g. <italic>This is mice</italic>) and a verbal query is given, ‘Can you show me ‘<italic>mice</italic> without /m/?’ The child is expected to point to the picture representing ice.</p>
<p>The nonverbal task incorporates a systematic, dynamic scoring system based on the use of corrective feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0265659012448087">Spector, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0265659012448087">Yopp, 1988</xref>). Scores reflect the number of prompts that a child requires to be successful and ranges from 1 (answered after no prompting) to 5 (answered after maximal prompting) for a total possible score ranging from 21 (perfect score) to 105 (worst possible score). Thus, a score of 1 on the CTOPP, a verbal measure of phoneme deletion, and a score of 1 on the nonverbal phoneme deletion task both represent the same level of performance. In both cases, scores reflect the fact that students were able to answer the question accurately without prompting. The prompted scoring system used on the nonverbal phoneme deletion task is indicative of the level of prompting required by the child to be successful (fewer prompts indicate higher skill) and provides the examiner with insight as to why the child responded incorrectly. This information is used to provide specific feedback to the child so that a correct answer is more likely on successive trials. The foils, prompts and scoring associated with the dynamic system are as follows:</p>
<list id="list2-0265659012448087" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Foil type 1, Same: No, (stimulus; <italic>goat</italic>) without (sound; /t/) isn’t (same; <italic>goat</italic>). <italic>Goat</italic> and <italic>goat</italic> are the same word. Listen (<italic>goat</italic>–<italic>goat</italic>). I want you to tell me which picture is (stimulus; <italic>goat</italic>) without (sound; /t/).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Foil type 2, Similar: No, (stimulus; <italic>goat</italic>) without (sound; /g/) isn’t (similar; <italic>coat</italic>). <italic>Goat</italic> and <italic>coat</italic> end with the same sound. Listen (<italic>goat</italic> /ttttt/), (<italic>coat</italic> /ttttt/) [examiner highlights the part of the similar word that is the same as in the stimulus word]. I want you to tell me which picture is (stimulus; <italic>goat</italic>) without (sound; /t/).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Foil type 3, Dissimilar: No, (stimulus; <italic>goat</italic>) without (sound; /t/) isn’t (dissimilar; <italic>bow</italic>). <italic>Goat</italic> and <italic>bow</italic> have the same middle sound. Listen (<italic>goat</italic> /o/), (<italic>bow</italic> /o/) [examiner highlights the part of the dissimilar word that is the same as in the stimulus word]. I want you to tell me which picture is (stimulus; <italic>goat</italic>) without (sound; /t/).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Score of 1: No prompt given.</p></list-item>

<sec id="section7-0265659012448087">
<title>c Word-level reading:</title>
<p>The word-level reading measure was the WRMT-R word identification subtest. The subtest contains 106 words arranged from simple (e.g. <italic>is, you, and</italic>) to complex (e.g. <italic>cygnet, taupe, dossier</italic>) presented on easel pages. There are 9 words on each easel page. Children are asked to read each word until they are unable to read 6 consecutive words on a single easel page. The standardized manual does not include any information stating that credit may be given for systematic speech sound errors children may produce. Therefore, incorrect productions were judged as incorrect as per the manual. A raw score is calculated which may be converted to a standard score. In the current study, we calculated raw scores for the word-identification measure for comparison with the other raw score data of interest. Descriptive data for individual participants on measures of phoneme deletion, word-level reading and speech sound production are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0265659012448087">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<p>The second research question examined the relationship between the verbal and nonverbal phoneme deletion tasks and the measure of word-level reading (WRMT-R; word identification). There was a highly significant correlation between the verbal measure of phoneme deletion and the measure of word-level reading (<italic>r</italic> = .91, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) and a moderate, significant correlation between scores on the nonverbal measure of phoneme deletion and the measure of word-level reading (<italic>r</italic> = .69, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05).</p>
<p>The third research question asked whether performance on the verbal and nonverbal phoneme deletion tasks correlated with performance on measures of speech production (GFTA, PCC).

<title>IV Discussion and summary</title>
<p>Our findings suggest that both measures of phoneme deletion (verbal, nonverbal) assessed a similar construct and correlated with a measure of word-level reading. The verbal elision task (CTOPP) and the measure of word-level reading were highly correlated. The correlation (<italic>r</italic> = .83) was slightly higher than correlations between the phonological awareness composite and WRMT-R composite scores reported in the CTOPP manual for kindergarten (<italic>r</italic> = .71) and first grade children (<italic>r</italic> = .80). Interestingly, the partial correlation controlling for age between CTOPP scores on the elision task and the WRMT-R word identification task (<italic>r</italic> = .65) more closely resembled the correlation between the nonverbal phoneme deletion task and the WRMT-R word identification measure (<italic>r</italic> = .61) for the current study and in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0265659012448087">Claessen et al. (2010)</xref>, which better reflects the nature of the relationship between phoneme awareness and reading.</p>
<p>Speech production ability was highly correlated with performance on the verbal phoneme deletion task and not to performance on the nonverbal task. This suggests that the verbal phoneme deletion task was also measuring aspects of speech production that presented a potential confound to the measurement of phonological awareness. For example, on the CTOPP, a child was asked, ‘Say popcorn. Now say popcorn without saying corn.’ His response to the question was, ‘bop’. A different child responded to this prompt saying, ‘bo’ substituting the intitial /p/ and leaving off the final sound. These responses illustrate the difficulty in scoring whether or not a child was able to carry out the deletion task, and this has important implications for the measurement of phoneme deletion skills in children for whom speech output is compromised. SSDs may place children at risk for reading difficulties including problems acquiring phonological awareness knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0265659012448087">Anthony et al., 2011</xref>), but that relationship is not a causal one. Therefore, SLPs must exercise caution when interpreting phonemic awareness results that require verbal output when children present with SSDs.</p>
<p>A separate issue has to do with the level of success young children may have in completing deletion or elision tasks, and how reflective their performance is of their underlying ability in phonological awareness. It may seem intuitive that children would perform better in the nonverbal dynamic assessment format than the verbal one because it incorporated the use of error-specific prompting. However, the CTOPP incorporates 6 practice items and verbal feedback for errors that occur on the practice items and the first 5 test items. It might be argued that if a child does not have an accurate internal phonological representation for the word in question and the ability to carry out the deletion task, no amount of prompting would result in a correct response. In other words, if a child is unable to ‘profit from a model’ then it is unlikely that the underlying skill or representation is readily available to the child for use in completing the task. This is the premise for the use of dynamic assessment. Data in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0265659012448087">Table 1</xref> illustrates this notion. Notice that participants 3, 7, 9 and 10 scored nearly perfect scores on the nonverbal task, indicating that they did not require excessive prompting to be successful. Younger participants 3 and 7 demonstrated significantly lower scores on the CTOPP than the nonverbal task, which required them to perform essentially the same skill using verbal output. The participants did not receive significantly ‘more’ prompting on the nonverbal task (score of 24 reflects 3 total prompts; score of 27 reflects 6 total prompts) than they received on the verbal task (11 prompts possible). However, children did receive ‘error-specific’ prompting. For example, children sometimes chose the foil that was the ‘same’ as the stimulus item, indicating that they either did not understand the nature of the task, or that they were not able to perform the phoneme manipulation to access the accurate underlying representation. The prompt given when children made this error was specific to the error; ‘Goat and goat’ are the same word. Listen (<italic>goat–goat</italic>). I want you to tell me which picture is (stimulus; <italic>goat</italic>) without (sound; /t/). In this way, children were given clear, consistent, and specific feedback relative to their own responses.</p>
<p>Participants 1, 2, and 4 received scores of 0 on the CTOPP and scores ranging from 41–64 on the nonverbal phoneme deletion task. Participant 1 required an average of 3 prompts, while participants 2 and 3 required an average of 2 prompts for every item in order to provide the accurate response. This suggests that even with significant prompting, some children may not have possessed an appropriate underlying representation and/or ability to delete the segments to allow them to be accurate in responding to the task and continued to make the same errors repeatedly. Participant 9 was accurate 100% of the time on the nonverbal task, requiring no prompting, and performed well on the CTOPP. Interestingly, participant 9’s only errors on the CTOPP involved cluster elision (e.g. <italic>flame–lame</italic>). Examination of participant 9’s GFTA showed consistent production errors on clusters. Performance on the nonverbal task for this participant suggested that the underlying phonological knowledge relative to cluster elision was present, even though performance on the verbal phonological awareness task did not reflect this knowledge.</p>
<p>The pattern of responses on the dynamic nonverbal task may be useful prescriptively to assist clinicians in making decisions about what feedback children need to be accurate. For example, participants selected the ‘similar’ foil more often than the other foil types. Similar foils rhymed or contained similar initial or final clusters as the stimulus item. Prompting for this error involved bringing attention to the part of the foil that was similar to the part of the stimulus that may have caused the error. For example, the examiner might say, ‘Goat and coat end with the same sound. Listen (<italic>goat</italic> /ttttt/), (<italic>coat</italic> /ttttt/). I want you to tell me which picture is (stimulus; <italic>goat</italic>) without (sound; /t/).’ Prescriptive information gained through analysis of a child’s response choices may be used to inform instruction through the use of specific feedback.</p>

<title>V Clinical implications</title>
<p>Measurement of phoneme awareness for children with SSDs is an important yet difficult task for SLPs because verbal responses may be difficult to transcribe, score and interpret. Similarly, research suggests that silent phoneme manipulation, or ‘receptive’ tasks, are more appropriate for assessing underlying phonological representations and phoneme awareness skills for children with SSDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0265659012448087">Sutherland and Gillon, 2005</xref>). Traditional, standardized, norm-referenced measures of phonological awareness do not always contain receptive items relative to blending, segmentation and elision of phonemes, nor do they offer suggestions for scoring verbal responses that contain substitution, deletion or distortion errors. A similar problem may exist when examining responses from children who are learning English as a second language, for children who do not use standard pronunciation patterns, or when pronunciation differs from the expectations of the examiner. Assessment of underlying phonological representation, and phonological and phonemic awareness is important for children who have SSDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0265659012448087">Blischak, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0265659012448087">Peeters et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0265659012448087">Sandberg, 2001</xref>) because they are at higher risk for reading problems than children with typical speech development. The nonverbal dynamic assessment of phoneme deletion may be a useful alternative to assessments that require verbal responses and are administered in a static fashion because it offers insight into the reasons children make errors on the task. The task is available for use by clinicians, does not have to be administered on a computer, and may be readily adapted and used in teaching as well as in assessment of phonological awareness. The error-specific prompting system that accompanies the dynamic assessment of phoneme deletion may provide clinicians with important prescriptive information related to phonological processing for use in ongoing intervention.</p>
