<abstract>
<p>This case deals with the specialties involved in project management (PM) communication. It purports that project communication has some nuances of emphasis that differentiate it from general business communication. PM has emerged from the discipline of Operations Management (OM), a branch of management science dealing with the hardcore scientific practices in executing work. Thus, like OM, PM quantifies, systematizes and documents almost all actions.</p>
<p>Therefore Project Communication (PC) too follows standardized procedures and manuals, as PM operates within constraints of budgets and deliveries, like in Operations Management. There is little scope for rework. It is even more acute in case of overseas projects, where challenges like differences in organization and project culture, time zones, language, technology and distance, etc. add to the enormous complexity. Thus, PC entails accuracy and systematic handling of communication networks. Constituent members in the network must follow strict documentation procedures. The project manager should display sophistication in handling interpersonal communication problems. In fact, he must even anticipate probable pitfalls and take proactive efforts to avoid them later in the process.</p>
<p>The present case depicts the efficient communication practices which Nitish followed for Wipro’s overseas project. His success is an outcome of following good interpersonal communication while adhering to the communication plan and the project framework.</p>
