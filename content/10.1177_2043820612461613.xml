It is even better when people who also care about what matters to us read what we write. The four people who have commented here on my book, <italic>Environmental Politics: Scale and Power</italic>, are colleagues whose work I have enjoyed reading and thinking about (and assigning to my students to read and think about). Therefore, it is an altogether satisfying endeavor to have this opportunity to respond to their comments on my book.</p><p>I turn first to comments from Simon Dalby who observes that the focus throughout the book tends to center on outcomes such as environmental spaces and regulations produced in the era of the Anthropocene Age. He notes that I devote less attention to the production of things that are contentious and less easily grasped. He raises the interesting point that, ‘environmental politics is also about matters that escape the attempts to control them precisely because they operate in ways that are frequently ill matched to the nature of that which is ostensibly to be governed’.</p><p>Yet, by utilizing Mann’s typology of power and considering multiple, simultaneous, spatial scales, I do consider such matters that have escaped or been overlooked by various forms of power. For example, the chapter on toxins considers that society tends to trust government regulation but illustrates the ways in which we are exposed (and expose ourselves to), a variety of potential hazards because we are not informed, labeling is misleading, regulation is too costly or complicated, businesses profit using grandfathered chemicals, and so forth. Here, the escaped spaces that I discuss are our bodies and the cocktail of toxins that we carry in our tissues because government regulation has not restricted chemicals and known toxic substances. Also, my discussion of the most recent iteration of the US Farm Bill considers how the dominant agroindustrial complex of the United States has been structured to favor a limited number of types of crops as well as the processed foods industry over the escaped health and well-being of citizens, ecosystems, soil, and water systems. In the chapter on garbage, escaped spaces are largely distant from US regulations and consumers of electronics. Places in China and Africa are discussed as the final destinations of e-waste that is processed through wholly inappropriate means and a stunning lack of human security. Visually, the map of the Soviet environmental legacy is another illustration of escaped spaces – areas of the former Soviet Union where environmental externalities of economic development are tangible. These spaces escaped sound management and are the spaces and environments produced by Soviet-era economic and political valuation of natural resources.</p><p>Dalby is correct that my interpretation of scale in this book is topological – that is, the focus is on spatial connectivity. Discussions throughout the book are also about disconnects. For example, the map of the US state boundaries overlaid with data on nitrogen loads in the Mississippi River watershed points to ways in which political systems (state governments and other regulatory bodies) are challenged to address environmental processes that are not confined to human-constructed containers of power.</p><p>A comment offered by Dalby and reiterated by Virginie Mamadough is that the theme of globalization and the interconnectedness of processes (both in different locations and in different chapters of the book) could have been highlighted more emphatically. In the concluding chapter, I include a brief discussion about how topics in the book do not necessarily appear in chapters where they might seem the most obvious. Tortilla riots in Mexico, for example, are discussed in the energy chapter rather than in the chapter on food security. I concede that the themes of globalization and connectivity could have been brought out more directly, but in this brief discussion in the conclusion, my aim is to suggest connectivity across space and spatial scale:<disp-quote><p>The examination of specific cases and examples has shown how our appreciation of environmental issues, human-environment relationships, and connection among places can be deepened by looking at spatial dimensions of power. Climate change is not necessarily best viewed at a global scale, energy issues are closely related to issues of food supply and waste, and toxins are a real threat at the scale of the body and are not particularly well controlled at government levels (p. 204).</p></disp-quote></p><p>Mamadough thoughtfully suggests ways that my book could be effectively adopted for classroom use. I (and perhaps readers of her review will) appreciate her comments particularly because the book was not written as a textbook. To that end, my aim was not to be exhaustive or comprehensive in subject matter but rather to examine a selection of topics to demonstrate how forms of power and spatial scale can be examined in conjunction with each other. She points, for example, to the absence of coverage of nuclear power and waste and suggests that this topic would be a useful entry point for a discussion of temporal scales. Her comment brings to mind a favorite quote from comedian Steven Wright: ‘You can’t have everything. Where would you put it?’ Had the allotted word count for the book allowed it, I would have liked to include a discussion of liquefied fluoride Thorium reactors (LFTR). LFTR technology offers many advantages over uranium-powered nuclear energy including the sourcing of material inputs and the relatively low volume and short half-life of waste generated. However, LFTR does not have weapons-building capacity and therefore lost out in the race to develop nuclear technology. This example certainly would have offered much potential to discuss temporal and spatial scales as well as power dynamics of agenda setting, decision making, and the ever present challenge of integrating science into the policy process. Mamadouh rightly suggests this book for a political geography class because, ‘it mainly helps students understand – through environmental issues – how scale and power work, which are first and foremost political geographical topics’.</p><p>In contrast to Mamadouh’s interest in expanding the book’s coverage of topics and geographers’ work on environmental issues, Jason Dittmer would have a more developed theorization of the spatiality of power. He recognizes that my book serves to interject, ‘geography where political science, public policy, and other disciplines have held sway’, but he suggests that a more explicit consideration of the spatiality of power throughout the book would demonstrate what geography has to offer to an interdisciplinary context. He suggests a more focused disentangling of relationships through which power is constituted: relationships within the military, between military and industrial interests, between local elites and news media, and so on. He points out that, ‘tracing these connections enables a greater understanding of resistance, collaboration, and subversion as political authorities undercut one another or perform end-arounds through the network’.</p><p>Indeed, both Mamadouh and Dittmer make excellent points about the possibilities of expanding the breadth and the depth of the material in the book. I heartily agree with both of them that their suggested adjustments would boost the book’s capacity to speak not only to students of political geography but also to the students and practitioners in other disciplines. The challenge, of course, is striking a balance between broad coverage and intense depth while at the same time leaving room for examples which provide lucid illustrations resonant of key ideas.</p><p>Finally, I welcome Mike Hulme’s suggestion that in addition to scale and power, ethics would have been a useful third lens through which to examine processes and outcomes of different forms of power. This point, and his encouragement to consider intergenerational equity, combines well with Mamadouh’s comments regarding avenues for collective action and the workings of political systems. How might these processes be guided by ethics?</p><p>I appreciate that Hulme zeroes in on precisely my motivation for writing this book. He writes, ‘I believe with O’Lear that all students of geography or environmental sciences should be required to take courses in environmental politics – but why? She offers one answer at the end of her book: “if we can understand more clearly why we believe what we believe, or why we do what we do, it is likely that we will make and encourage better choices in our interactions with the environment”’ (p. 207). All the comments from my colleagues aim to broaden, deepen, and bring new dimensions of appreciation to how we understand dynamics and processes of power, the production of space and the environment, and ways in which societies and individuals can respond to environmental issues. Clearly, there remains much to be written on (and done about) these urgent, complex, and compelling issues.</p></body></article>
