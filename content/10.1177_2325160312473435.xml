<p>The process of diabetes self-management education seems to be ever evolving. By utilizing new and creative approaches, we are helping those with diabetes live with more quality and happiness.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p><bold>This department, called <italic>Mind Sights</italic>, will explore the psychological, emotional, and behavioral aspects of life with diabetes.</bold></p>
<p>We will also highlight ways in which educators are becoming more effective with interventions in this area.</p>
<p>Why is this department called <italic>Mind Sights</italic>? “Mindsight” is a term coined by a psychiatrist named Daniel Siegel. It refers to how one can use self-awareness in learning to deal with one’s own reactivity to life. The practice of mindsight helps people develop and practice skills that literally strengthen the brain’s ability to respond to situations consciously rather than just react.</p>
<sec id="section1-2325160312473435">
<title>Replacing Reaction with Response</title>
<p>Those of us who work with people with diabetes know that one of the most important aspects of diabetes management is the ability to help people alter their behavior. So here is the dilemma: The more one practices a behavior, the better one gets at it. Eventually the brain builds a neuropathway that allows the behavior to be automatic and become a habit. Similar to building a super highway to travel upon, we create an efficient neuropathway to carry out these automatic behaviors. Once the pathway is there, we seldom take another way. The good news is we don’t have to re-think it every time we repeat a behavior. The bad news is that, if it is a negative behavior, it remains automatic.</p>
<p>An example may be helpful here. If I have learned to eat ice cream to sooth myself when I am stressed, then this practice becomes so well ingrained that it’s automatic for me to use it for self-calming. The problem is obvious to educators. With diabetes, these kinds of automatic behaviors are not likely to be helpful unless they relate to getting exercise, eating fruits and vegetables, taking care with carbohydrates, or successfully managing stress.</p>
<p>We are left with the question of how to replace old unhelpful behaviors with new healthy ones. Mindsight promotes building skills that help the brain develop new neuropathways and alter previous ones, a process known as neuroplasticity. This helps people learn to take the road less traveled rather than the super highways they are accustomed to using. This practice does in fact alter the brain in a way that can help people choose a different behavior that is responsive rather than reactive.</p>
<p>Although you may not be aware of it, you already practice mindsight in many ways. Diabetes educators have led the way in helping people change behavior, using skill-building techniques that are common to both mindsight and diabetes self-management. So you already know something about this concept.</p>

<title>Building a “Better” Brain</title>
<p>It’s useful to understand a bit about the brain to know why mindsight skill-building exercises are helpful and how, through practice, we can develop new neuropathways that can help us not be reactive.</p>
<p>The amygdala is the part of the brain that is primarily responsible for reactivity. It is about the size of a walnut and is located in the central part of the brain. When the amygdala is activated, the counter-regulatory system kicks in and stimulates the release of hormones that prepare us to fight, run, or freeze. The amygdala is essential for driving automatic responses that can help us when we need to protect ourselves and to do our best. It is not, however, helpful in getting us to change our behavior (although it might help to get our attention if we fear the consequences of not changing).</p>
<p>The prefrontal cortex is the part of our brain that can work with and protect the amygdala. The prefrontal cortex provides the conscious brain with the power of executive function (conscious decision making). It holds the knowledge and facts necessary to prevent the amygdala from getting too carried away. The concept of mindsight uses the prefrontal cortex and our awareness of choice to help deal with the amygdala’s tendency to be automatically reactive. It is this intentional use of what the prefrontal cortex has available that helps us contain and protect the amygdala.</p>
<p>So much for the brain! Let’s go scuba diving. ■</p>

<title>A Personal Account</title>
<p>Last spring I went diving in the Florida Keys. I hadn’t been diving in ten years, so I took a refresher course before going out and felt relatively confident. The seas were a bit rough, but I was very excited.</p>
<p>As we got in, my breathing was quite deep and my heartbeat was rapid. My wife was simply scared (although wouldn’t admit it). We moved out to the dive line. After my daughter and her husband went down, my wife and I started to descend. Unfortunately, we had forgotten that when you breathe deeply or rapidly (the amygdala in action) you are like a balloon—inflated. Once we realized this and began to exhale completely (the prefrontal cortex taking over), we were able to descend.</p>
<p>When we got down to the bottom, my daughter and her husband were already gone. Since neither my wife nor I had much skill in navigating, it was clear we were both a bit intimidated (amygdala at work again). But how lost could we get? We relaxed and started appreciating the incredible scene (prefrontal cortex in action).</p>
<p>It was beautiful—colorful fish, great coral, lovely sandscapes. Then a six-foot bull shark appeared. My amygdala went to work, and I was ready to take off as fast as possible—the exact wrong thing to do. The self-talk started. “Breathe, relax, he’s only watching (prefrontal cortex), bull sharks are aggressive (amygdala), breathe (prefrontal cortex).” My prefrontal cortex and amygdala were sharing space. I was settling down and the shark was keeping its distance. That was great! Self-calming worked to help us enjoy the dive and we managed to get back to the boat.</p>
<p>Once back on the boat, we shared our stories. They were mostly amygdala related, since who wants to hear about how you controlled your breathing and dealt with your fear? For me, in retrospect, this process would have been difficult to tolerate without appreciating and using mindsight and the skills contained in the prefrontal cortex that I have practiced.</p>

<title>CDEs and Mindsight</title>
<p>Diabetes educators develop skills to help patients problem-solve issues that are not readily resolved without some intentional planning and practice. The time and energy spent by educators gives patients the opportunity to use mindsight to develop creative solutions to life with diabetes. Patients learn to eat better, engage in exercise, understand how to manage medications, practice new stress-management skills, and become better at creative problem solving.</p>
<p>The process I am thinking about with this department called <italic>Mind Sights</italic> is much like diving. We are seeking articles that navigate the challenges we have with our patients’ emotions, motivations, new behaviors, and relationships. By doing this, we are using our collective prefrontal cortex and diving into a better understanding of methods that will help educators in dealing with those issues. We will identify methods, techniques, and ideas that can help patients fully live the life they want to live.</p>
<p>I invite you to submit articles of things you are doing (your mind sights) and ideas for articles in areas that challenge you, so we can explore these together. ■</p>
