        <p>We evaluated expression of TLR2, TLR4 and proinflammatory genes [NF-κB, TNF-α,
          cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)] in liver samples of patients in different stages of liver
          disease. Fifteen patients with unexplained transaminases elevation (reference group), 22
          with viral chronic hepatitis (hepatitis group), 14 with virus-induced severe
          fibrosis/cirrhosis (cirrhosis group) and 10 with hepatocarcinoma (hepatocarcinoma group)
          were consecutively included in the study. Quantification of TLR2, TLR4, NF-κB, TNF-α and
          COX-2 mRNA was done by real-time RT-PCR and TLR2 and TLR4 protein expression was evaluated
          by immunohistochemistry. Compared with reference, TLR2 and TLR4 mRNA was increased in
          hepatitis (TLR2: 2.66 ± 0.69; TLR4: 3.11 ± 0.79; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) and
          cirrhosis (TLR2: 2.14 ± 0.5; TLR4: 1.74 ± 0.27; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) and
          decreased in hepatocarcinoma (TLR2: 0.48 ± 0.15; TLR4: 0.54 ± 0.10;
          <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). This associated with increased TNF-α and COX-2 mRNA in
          hepatitis (TNF-α: 3.24 ± 0.79; COX-2: 2.47 ± 0.36; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) and
          cirrhosis (TNF-α: 1.73 ± 0.28; COX-2: 1.8 ± 0.35, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05), whereas
          NF-κB mRNA was increased in hepatitis (2.42 ± 0.31; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) and
          unchanged in cirrhosis (1.34 ± 0.17; <italic>P</italic> = 0.3). Hepatocarcinoma presented
          increased COX-2 mRNA (1.63 ± 0.15; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) and maintained (at
          decreased levels) mRNA of NF-κB (0.52 ± 0.12) and TNF-α (0.52 ± 0.12;
          <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05, all genes). Immunohistochemistry confirmed increased
          expression of TLR2 and TLR4 in hepatitis and cirrhosis and maintained expression in
          hepatocarcinoma. Upregulation of TLR2, TLR4 and their proinflammatory mediators is
          associated with virus-induced hepatic IFC sequence.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Chronic liver inflammation, irrespective of the underlying cause (metabolic, immune-driven
        or virus-induced), leads to fibrosis and/or cirrhosis, which are precancerous states in
        which the development of hepatocarcinoma is more likely. Some authors call this sequence the
        hepatic inflammation-fibrosis-carcinoma (IFC) sequence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753425912436762">1</xref></sup> Nevertheless, the cellular and molecular
        effectors mediating the interplay between the components of hepatic IFC sequence continue to
        be largely unknown.</p>
      <p>Recently, several studies implicated TLRs as potential key orchestrators of the hepatic IFC
            sequence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753425912436762">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753425912436762"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753425912436762"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753425912436762">5</xref></sup> TLRs are one of the most representative classes of pathogen-associated
        molecular patterns (PAMPs) receptors that play a critical role in innate immunity
            activation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1753425912436762">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1753425912436762">7</xref></sup> The human TLR family
        consists of 10 members that enable the innate immunity system to recognize different groups
        of pathogens while initiating appropriate and distinct immunological responses according to
        the recognized PAMP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1753425912436762">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1753425912436762">7</xref></sup> Besides immune cells, most
        liver cells (hepatocytes, Kupffer cells and stellate cells) also express TLRs and respond to
        their ligands.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1753425912436762">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1753425912436762">9</xref></sup> TLR2 and TLR4 have been the
        most studied TLRs in liver diseases as they sense bacterial components and, thus, may
        mediate liver injury associated with increased bacterial translocation that is present in
        many liver diseases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1753425912436762">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1753425912436762"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1753425912436762">12</xref></sup> TLR2 is essential for the innate immune
        response to Gram-positive bacteria, being activated by bacterial lipoproteins and
            peptidoglycan.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1753425912436762">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1753425912436762">7</xref></sup> TLR4 acts as a receptor for
        LPS, a cell wall component of Gram-negative bacteria.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1753425912436762">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1753425912436762">7</xref></sup> Besides exogenous ligands, TLR2 and TLR4 may also sense endogenous
        ligands initiating danger signals, such as high mobility group box 1, hyaluronan and heat
        shock protein 60, inducing an inflammatory response in the absence of microbial
            challenge.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1753425912436762">13</xref></sup>
        Stimulation of these two receptors initiates a signaling cascade that promotes activation of
        NF-κB and MAPK and, consequently, production of different pro-inflammatory mediators, such
        as TNF-α and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1753425912436762">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1753425912436762"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1753425912436762"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1753425912436762"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1753425912436762">18</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Recent animal studies and <italic>in vitro</italic> hepatocyte culture models suggest that
        TLR2 and TLR4 may play a key role in the hepatic IFC sequence. Modulation of TLR2 and/or
        TLR4 function was shown to influence liver inflammation in chronic liver diseases, such as
        alcoholic liver disease (ALD), nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), chronic hepatitis C
        and chronic hepatitis B.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753425912436762">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753425912436762">3</xref></sup></p>
      <p>There is also accumulating evidence that TLR4-induced activation and sensitization of
        hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) may constitute an important molecular link between hepatic
        inflammation and fibrogenesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1753425912436762">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1753425912436762"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1753425912436762"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1753425912436762">22</xref></sup> Moreover, a recent study has revealed TLRs, in particular TLR4, as
        major factors linking hepatic chronic inflammation and hepatocarcinoma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1753425912436762">23</xref></sup></p>
      <p>However, to date, the suggested implication of TLR2 and TLR4 in the pathogenesis of hepatic
        IFC sequence is principally based on evidence obtained from animal studies or
          <italic>in vitro</italic> hepatocyte culture models. Studies using diseased human liver
        tissue to confirm or refute the <italic>in vitro</italic> and animal findings are scarce and
        have evaluated TLR2 and TLR4 in each stage of IFC sequence separately.</p>
      <p>Therefore, in the present study, we evaluated the expression of TLR2 and TLR4 in liver
        samples from patients in each stage of virus-induced hepatic IFC sequence. The expression of
        NF-κB, TNF-α and COX-2 was also evaluated in order to characterize their association with
        TLR2 and TLR4 expression.</p>

        <p>This study included patients from two hospitals of the North of Portugal (Braga Hospital
          and Portuguese Oncology Institute of Porto). The study protocol respected the ethical
          guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Ethics Committee of
          Braga Hospital and Portuguese Oncology Institute of Porto. Informed consent was obtained
          from each patient.</p>
        <p>Patients were recruited consecutively during 2009. We defined four groups: reference,
          hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocarcinoma. Reference group included patients followed in
          the Hepatology Outpatient Clinic of Braga Hospital who underwent liver biopsy because of
          chronic unexplained transaminase elevation. We excluded from this group patients with
          alcohol abuse (&gt;30 g/d in males; &gt;20 g/d in females); analytical or histologic
          findings favoring hemocromatosis; autoimmune hepatitis; primary biliary cirrhosis; primary
          sclerosing cholangitis; and HIV infection or clinical, analytical, imagiological or
          histologic evidence of severe fibrosis/cirrhosis (METAVIR F3–4). The hepatitis group
          included chronic hepatitis B or C patients followed in the Hepatology Outpatient Clinic of
          Braga Hospital who underwent staging liver biopsy. The cirrhosis group was selected from
          the same group of patients but with histologic evidence of severe fibrosis/cirrhosis
          (METAVIR F3–4). The hepatocarcinoma group included chronic hepatitis B or C patients with
          diagnosis of hepatocarcinoma (according to the EASL 2000 Barcelona Guidelines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1753425912436762">24</xref></sup>) followed in the
          outpatient clinic of Portuguese Oncology Institute of Porto who underwent surgical
          resection of hepatocarcinoma. In these groups, patients must have had &gt;18 years
          serological evidence of chronic hepatitis B (HBsAg+) or C (HCVAb+) and clinical stability.
          Histologic evidence of cirrhosis and hepatocarcinoma was required in the hepatocarcinoma
          group. Patients with HIV infection or analytical or histologic findings suggestive of
          liver disease other than viral chronic hepatitis were excluded.</p>
        <p>Before liver biopsy or surgical intervention, blood samples were drawn from fasting
          patients for routine analysis (complete blood count, glucose, electrolytes, renal and
          liver function tests, and coagulation study) and viral load quantification. Liver tissue
          was obtained by percutaneous biopsy using a 16-gauge Menghini needle or by transjugular
          biopsy. In the hepatocarcinoma group, we obtained hepatocarcinoma tissue [for mRNA
          quantification (in 6 patients) and immunohistochemical evaluation (in 10 patients)] and
          adjacent liver tissue (for cirrhosis confirmation) from the surgical specimen. The
          collected tissue was divided into two fragments: one was immediately placed in RNAlater
          (Ambion, Madrid, Spain) and stored at −80°C for mRNA isolation and quantification; the
          other was fixed in 10% buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin for histologic and
          immunhistochemical analyses.</p>

        <title>mRNA isolation and quantification of TLR2, TLR4, NF-κB, TNF-α and COX-2</title>
        <p>Total mRNA was extracted from tissue samples using the TriPure isolation reagent
          according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). Concentration and
          purity were assayed by spectrophotometry (Eppendorf 6131000.012, Madrid, Spain). Two-step
          real-time RT-PCR was used to perform relative quantification of mRNA. For each studied
          mRNA molecule, standard curves were generated from the correlation between the amount of
          starting total mRNA and the PCR threshold cycle of graded dilutions from a
          randomly-selected sample from reference group. For relative quantification of specific
          mRNA levels, 100 ng of total mRNA from each sample underwent two-step real-time RT-PCR.
          GAPDH mRNA levels were similar in all experimental groups, which enabled the use of this
          gene as an internal control. RT (20 µl; 10 min at 22°C, 50 min at 50°C and 10 min at 95°C)
          was performed in a standard thermocycler (Whatman Biometra 050-901, Goettingen, Germany).
          Five percent of the cDNA yield was used as a template for real-time PCR (LightCycler II,
          Roche) using SYBR green (Qiagen 204143, Madrid, Spain), according to the manufacturer’s
          instructions. Specific PCR primers pairs for the studied genes (GAPDH, TLR2, TLR4, NF-κB,
          TNF-α and COX-2) are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1753425912436762">Table 1</xref>. Results of mRNA quantification were expressed as an arbitrary unit (AU)

        <title>Immunohistochemical evaluation of TLR2 and TLR4</title>
        <p>Tissue specimens were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for 24 h and paraffin
          embedded. De-paraffinized tissue slides were submitted to antigen retrieval using a high
          temperature antigen unmasking technique in a water bath, 95°C in citrate buffer pH 6.0,
          for 20 min. Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by incubating the slides with
          freshly prepared 0.5% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in distilled water for 20 min. After
          washing the slides in distilled water and PBS/0.05% Tween 20 solution, immunostaining was
          performed using an immunoperoxidase method according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
          The slides were incubated with normal horse serum (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA,
          USA) 1/50 in PBS-BSA 1% at room temperature (21–23°C) for 20 min in humid chamber.
          Sections were then incubated with primary Ab at 4°C for 16–18 h. The following primary Abs
          were used: rabbit polyclonal Ab anti-TLR2 (H-175, 1 : 50 dilution, Santa Cruz
          Biotechnology, CA, USA) and rabbit polyclonal anti-TLR4 (H-80, 1 : 100 dilution, Santa
          Cruz Biotechnology). The slides were then rinsed in PBS/0.05% Tween 20 solution and bound
          Ab was detected by applying biotinylated secondary Ab (Vectastain Universal Elite ABC Kit,
          Vector Labs, Peterborough, UK) for 30 min. After washing the slides with PBS/0.05% Tween
          20 solution the slides were incubated with ABC reagent (Vectastain Universal Elite ABC
          Kit) for 30 min. The slides were washed in PBS and incubated for 7 min in
          3,3-diaminobenzidine (DAB; Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) 0.05 g/PBS, 0.03%
            H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2.</sub> Following counterstaining with hematoxylin for 20 s, the
          slides were washed for 4 min in water, dehydrated and mounted with Entellan (Merck KGaA,
          Darmstadt, Germany). Normal gastric mucosa and lymph node tissue were used as negative and
          positive controls, respectively. An Ab diluent (non-immune IgG, TA-125-UD; Thermo
          Scientific, Erembodegem, Belgium) was used in some samples as additional negative control,
          confirming the specificity of our protocol. We evaluated immunostaining of hepatocytes for
          TLR2 and TLR4 in all the samples. In order to quantify TLR expression in tissue samples,
          three parameters were considered: (i) <italic>sample positivity</italic>—a sample was
          considered positive if hepatocytes were clearly marked by the Ab; (ii) <italic>grade of
            expression</italic>—a score of 0–3 was considered according to the number of epithelial
          cells marked (0 = no cells; 1 = less than 10% of epithelial cells; 2 = 10–75% cells;
          3 = more than 75% cells); and (iii) <italic>intensity of expression</italic>—a score of
          0–3 was considered according to a subjective evaluation of the intensity of marked cells
          (0 = no immunostaining; 1 = weak positive staining; 2 = moderate positive staining;
          3 = strong positive staining). Immunohistochemical evaluation was performed independently
          by two experienced pathologists.</p>

      <p>In the present study, we evaluated the expression of TLR2 and TLR4 in liver samples from
        patients in each stage of virus-induced hepatic IFC sequence. We found increased TLR2 and
        TLR4 mRNA and protein expression in virus-induced chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis, and a
        maintained TLR2 and TLR4 protein expression in virus-induced hepatocarcinoma.</p>

        results, none of these studies have evaluated simultaneously TLR expression in different
        stages of liver disease.</p>
      <p>To our knowledge the present study is the first to evaluate hepatic TLR2 and TLR4
        expression at different stages of the virus-induced hepatic IFC sequence. We found increased
        TLR2 and TLR4 mRNA and protein expression in virus-induced chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis
        and a maintained TLR2 and TLR4 protein expression in virus-induced hepatocarcinoma. Thus,
        upregulation of TLR2 and TLR4 is an early, and persistent, event in the virus-induced
        hepatic IFC sequence.</p>
      <p>Regarding TLR2 and TLR4 protein expression, the differences between the groups were more
        evident in terms of intensity of expression (which reflects the level of expression per
        cell) than in terms of grade of expression (which reflects the number of cells expressing
        the protein). The intensity of TLR2 and TLR4 proteins expression was in line with TLR2 and
        TLR4 mRNA expression, while the grade of TLR expression changed little between the groups,
        not accompanying the changes in mRNA expression. This finding suggests that the
        virus-induced hepatic IFC sequence is associated with changes in the level of TLR2 and TLR4
        protein expression per cell and not with changes in the number of cells expressing these
        proteins.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, we found reduced TLR2 and TLR4 mRNA and protein expression in the
        hepatocarcinoma group when compared with the hepatitis and cirrhosis groups. Although we
        have no definite explanation for the reduced expression of TLR2 and TLR4 in hepatocarcinoma
        cells, we believe it is likely a consequence of loss of differentiation of hepatocarcinoma
        cells. This is suggested by the finding that in most samples of hepatocarcinoma tissue there
        were well-differentiated areas with high staining alternating with poorly differentiated
        areas with low staining. This finding likely means that at late stages of the hepatic IFC
        sequence, the role of these receptors in this sequence becomes smaller.</p>
      <p>However, our study has some limitations. Firstly, most patients included in the reference
        group have evidence of NAFLD and it was demonstrated that NAFLD is associated with increased
        hepatic TLR2 and TLR4 mRNA expression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1753425912436762">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1753425912436762">29</xref></sup> This suggests that the increase in hepatic
        expression of TLR2 and TLR4 in chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocarcinoma may, in
        fact, be underestimated. Moreover, the hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocarcinoma groups
        included both patients with HBV infection or HCV infection. Nonetheless, statistical
        analysis revealed no difference between HBV and HCV patients. Moreover, as we included only
        patients with virus-induced chronic hepatitis in this study, our data cannot be generalized
        to other chronic hepatic diseases that follow IFC sequence. Another limitation of our study
        is that the method we used for quantification of protein expression was semi-quantitative.
        Although this could contribute to the lack of difference in terms of grade of protein
        expression, we were able to obtain significant differences in terms of intensity of protein
        expression. The validity of the protein quantification by this method is supported by the
        overall agreement between protein (grade of expression) and mRNA data. Furthermore, the
        method was validated in a previous study with consistent results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1753425912436762">30</xref></sup></p>
      <p>In the present study we have not explored the mechanisms underlying increased hepatic
        expression of TLR2 and TLR4. Nonetheless, previous studies have shown that HBV and HCV may
        upregulate TLR2 and TLR4 through direct and indirect mechanisms. <italic>In vitro</italic>
        studies have shown that HCV nonstructural protein NS5A upregulates TLR4 expression and that
        HBeAg upregulates TLR2 expression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1753425912436762">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1753425912436762">31</xref></sup> In
        chronic hepatitis B and C, besides up-regulated expression of TLR2 and TLR4 by the virus,
        other factors, such as augmented exposure to their ligands, can also contribute to increased
        activation of these TLRs, especially in later stages of hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis. In
        fact, several studies have demonstrated that bacterial translocation is increased in
        patients with cirrhosis, resulting in augmented exposure of hepatic TLRs to their
            ligands.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1753425912436762">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1753425912436762">11</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Herein, we did not search for liver cell-specific expression of TLR2 and TLR4, but instead
        we have focused on total hepatic mRNA expression and protein expression of hepatocytes. This
        may be an important issue as it has been demonstrated that HCV and HBV may affect TLRs
        expression in a cell-specific manner.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753425912436762">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753425912436762"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753425912436762"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753425912436762">5</xref></sup> Nevertheless, the immunohistochemistry that we performed in this study
        suggests that, at least in part, this increase in TLRs expression occurs significantly in
        hepatocytes.</p>
      <p>Previous studies on human samples have shown that hepatic expression of TLR2 and TLR4 in
        HCV cirrhosis was unchanged compared with the reference group, which is in disagreement with
        our results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1753425912436762">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1753425912436762">27</xref></sup> The reasons for this
        disagreement are unclear, but our data are consistent with a previous
          <italic>in vitro</italic> study showing that hepatocyte-specific transgenic expression of
        the HCV nonstructural protein NS5A upregulates TLR4 expression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1753425912436762">23</xref></sup> Regarding chronic hepatitis B, Visvanathan
        et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1753425912436762">31</xref></sup> have shown
        that expression of TLR2 on hepatocytes and Kupffer cells was significantly reduced in
        patients with HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B in comparison with HBeAg-negative chronic
        hepatitis B and controls, whereas it was significantly increased in HBeAg-negative chronic
        hepatitis B compared with controls. The level of TLR4 expression did not differ
        significantly among the groups. Downregulation of TLR2 was also demonstrated in HepG-2 cells
        transduced with wild-type HBV (HBeAg-positive) but not in cells transduced with pre-core
        mutant HBV (HBeAg-negative). Regarding TLR2, our data are consistent with the study by
        Visvanathan et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1753425912436762">31</xref></sup>
        as most of our chronic hepatitis B patients were HBeAg-negative and have increased TLR2. We
        could not compare HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative patients owing to the limited number of
        HBeAg-positive patients in our study.</p>
      <p>In order to clarify TLR2- and TLR4-induced proinflammatory genes expression we also studied
        NF-κB, TNF-α and COX-2 mRNA expression. We found that hepatic TNF-α and COX-2 mRNA
        expressions are increased in virus-induced chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis, whereas hepatic
        NF-κB mRNA is increased in virus-induced chronic hepatitis, but maintained in virus-induced
        cirrhosis. This is an interesting finding as these proinflammatory genes have been
        implicated in hepatic inflammation, fibrogenesis and carcinogenesis interplay.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753425912436762">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1753425912436762">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1753425912436762">33</xref></sup> Interestingly, hepatocarcinoma samples
        presented increased COX-2 expression, despite lower expression of other studied genes,
        suggesting, in line with previous studies, that this enzyme may have an important role in
            hepatocarcinogenesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1753425912436762">33</xref></sup> Although we have not investigated the functionality of TLR2 and TLR4,
        increased expression of TLR2 and TLR4 proteins and of NF-κB, TNF-α and COX-2 (key mediators
        of TLR2 and TLR4 signaling pathway) mRNA expression suggest augmented signaling of TLR2 and
        TLR4. When comparing hepatitis with cirrhosis we found a tendency towards lower expression
        of inflammatory genes mRNA; however, we cannot dismiss the possibility that this tendency is
        not related to a higher inflammatory cell infiltrate observed in the hepatitis group. In
        fact, we did not find any clear tendency in the hepatocyte immunohistochemistry results,
        suggesting that the difference, if any, between the two groups is not significant.</p>
      <p>In summary, in patients with HCV or HBV chronic infection, hepatic expression of TLR2 and
        TLR4 is increased in chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis and is maintained in hepatocarcinoma.
        This is associated with increased TLR2- and TLR4-induced proinflammatory gene expression.
        Overall, this study suggests that TLR2 and TLR4 may be key players in the human hepatic IFC
        sequence associated with viral chronic hepatitis.</p>
