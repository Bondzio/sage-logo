<p><italic>Spirit Speech: Lament and Celebration in Preaching</italic></p>
<p>Luke Powery</p>
<p>Nashville: Abingdon, 2009. 184 pp. $19.99</p>
<p>Luke Powery begins <italic>Spirit Speech</italic> with a personal account of being disappointed by the lack of lament expressed during the funeral of a young member of his family. Celebration of the resurrection, he says, and of lives committed to Christ at the funeral kept mourners from engaging in “the sighs of the Spirit” (xiii). Focusing primarily on the religious experience and traditions of African Americans, Powery believes that both celebration and lament are faithful aspects of worshiping God and that both are embedded in the cultural fabric of African Americans; celebration, however, has been “the main attraction” in African American homiletics, while lament has been overlooked. In this book, Powery seeks, as the subtitle suggests, to pair celebration and lament in discerning the Spirit at work in preaching. To accomplish this task and to provide a holistic understanding of the work of the Spirit, he sets grace, unity, and fellowship alongside celebration and lament to provide the “theological-hermeneutical lens for discerning the presence of the Spirit in preaching while providing a theological language for speaking about the Spirit in relation to sermons” (xv).</p>
<p>Beginning with the acknowledgements and woven all through <italic>Spirit Speech</italic> is evidence that the author takes a confessional stance toward his topic—the Spirit. This book will certainly appeal to readers who come from traditions that, like his, emphasize the Spirit in worship. Powery, however, insists that manifestations of the Spirit in preaching can be expressed differently in various cultures. Those of us whose worship emphasizes the Word or the Eucharist without giving much direct attention to the Spirit can be challenged by this book without feeling pressured to worship in the particular manner described by Powery. Furthermore, all Christians can be challenged by Powery’s insistence that lament is a manifestation of the Spirit that needs to be recovered in church practices, including preaching. Luke Powery is a highly skilled homiletician. This book deserves the attention of Christians open to learning more about Spirit speech.</p>
