<abstract>
<p>The following fillers were added to rigid polyurethane–polyisocyanurate foams in the amount of 2,5-10wt%: silica, kaolin and epoxy resin. The effect of these fillers on the thermal resistance of the foams was studied. The biggest influence on the temperature of the first loss in foam mass (beginning of change in mass) is addition of silica. The temperature increased from 44℃ (foam without filler W) to 88℃ (foam containing 10% wt/wt of silica S10). The temperature at the extrapolated beginning of the first mass loss in the foam (beginning of decomposition) increases from 102℃ (Wfoam) to 110℃ (K10 foam), to 222℃ (S10 foam), to 144℃ (E10 foam). The temperature of the highest speed of loss in mass (beginning of rapid decomposition) increases from 220℃ (W) to 425℃ (S10) and to 243℃ (E10) for foams with kaolin and Epidian 5, respectively. As the content of silica and epoxy resin (Epidian 5) were increased in foam composition, softening point of foams increased from 230℃ (foam W) to 239℃ (foam K10) and to 244℃ (foam E10). Addition of kaolin resulted in softening point decrease to 198℃ (foam S10).</p>

<sec id="sec1-0021955X13477671" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Polyurethanes are the most versatile class of polymers because of their wide variety of types and molecular weights as well as functionality of the basic components.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021955X13477671">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021955X13477671"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021955X13477671"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021955X13477671"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021955X13477671"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021955X13477671"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021955X13477671">7</xref></sup> This simple technology and easy methods to modify their properties led to their rapid development. Properties of polyurethanes depend on their structure, which in turn depends on the type of monomers used: diisocyanates and polyols. Strength and chemical resistance depend on character and functionality of polyol.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021955X13477671">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021955X13477671">9</xref></sup> The type of polyol determines the resistance of the polyurethane to biological agents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021955X13477671">10</xref></sup> Polyesterurethanes are resistant to oxidizing agents; however, they are susceptible to hydrolytic degradation. Polyetherurethanes, however, are resistant to hydrolysis but they are susceptible to oxidation. Polycarbonateurethenes are characterized by resistance to oxidizing agents and higher hydrolytic resistance than polyesterurethanes.</p>
<p>Properties of polymers (including polyurethanes) can be modified by addition of other polymers (such as for example epoxy resins). Preparation of different compositions or filled polymers is usually associated with development efforts for materials that address disadvantages of the non-filled polymers. Furthermore, mixing in less costly additives may offer cost reductions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021955X13477671">11</xref></sup> Modification of polyurethanes using various cheaper materials, often with waste or byproducts, helps new products to be competitive in the marketplace.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021955X13477671">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021955X13477671">13</xref></sup> Reduction of production costs is very helpful for applications such as in furniture, automotive and building industries, and especially in industrial air conditioning and refrigeration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021955X13477671">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021955X13477671">15</xref></sup> Addition of fillers can change almost all physical properties such as density, hardness, impact strength, strength, chemical and thermal resistance and processing properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021955X13477671">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021955X13477671">17</xref></sup> Not all filler materials produce positive results and therefore they should be applied by taking into account their effect on properties. Some of them, for example, can deteriorate mechanical properties or cause difficulties in foaming process by extensive thickening of the foamed system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021955X13477671">18</xref></sup> The physical fillers can increase specific gravity and hardness but can also reduce the flammability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021955X13477671">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>Products made of polyurethanes should also meet criteria related to environmental protection. Silica materials improve appearance of the product surface.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021955X13477671">20</xref></sup> Kaolin is an overheated refractory clay. Kaolin products are characterized by high resistance to rapid temperature changes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021955X13477671">21</xref></sup> Epoxy resin (Epidian 5) is a perfect material with a very broad possibility of applications. Among others, it is applied to produce kits (cements) and chemohardenable putties, castings, paints and lacquers with a very wide range of applications in electrical engineering and other industries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021955X13477671">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0021955X13477671">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>The use of polyurethane foams is associated with limitation in their properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0021955X13477671">24</xref></sup> In the case when foams are used as insulation, in addition to price, an important parameter limiting their use is thermal and heat resistance.</p>
<p>Heat resistance is associated with physical changes occurring in foams under the influence of temperature and imposed forces. It is often described by the so called “softening temperature” and the way of determining that temperature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0021955X13477671">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>Thermal resistance refers to deterioration of properties connected with loss in mass. Properties change as a result of changes in temperature during operation under particular conditions. Material is decomposed to form molecules of lower molecular weight.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0021955X13477671">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>Thermal resistance is mainly related to temperature of thermal dissociation of the weakest bonds present in the foam, which is accompanied by reduction in plastic weight. Ester, ether, allophanate, urea, biuret, carboimide, isocyanurate and other bonds can occur in foams besides urethane bond, depending on the raw materials used and the equivalent ratio of −NCO to −OH groups. Their temperatures of dissociation are: 200℃, 260℃, 350℃, 106℃, 250℃, od 130℃, do 145℃, 240℃ and 300℃, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0021955X13477671">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0021955X13477671">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>The aim of this study was to assess the impact of silica, kaolin and epoxy resin (introduced in amounts of 0, 2.5, 5.0, 7.5 and 10 wt% in relation to amount of polyol and diisocyanate) on heat, thermal and other utility properties of polyurethane–polyisocyanurate foams. The usefulness of the foams modified with the above-mentioned physical fillers, e.g. as insulation material, was tested.</p>

<sec id="sec3-0021955X13477671"><title>Characteristics of raw materials</title>
<p>The polyether with trade name Rokopol RF-55 (product of oxypropylation of sorbitol L<sub>OH </sub>= 495.0 mg KOH/g, produced by NZPO "Rokita", Brzeg Dolny, Poland) and Ongromat CR 20-30 (technical polyisocyanate whose main component is diphenylmethane 4,4′-diisocyanate, made in Hungary) were used to prepare the rigid polyurethane–polyisocyanurate (PUR–PIR) foams. The density of Ongromat CR 30-20 at 25℃ was 1.23 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, its viscosity was 200 MPa and the content of NCO groups was 31.0%. Polyether and diisocyanate were characterized according to the following standards: ASTM D 2849-69 and ASTM D 1638-70.</p>
<p>Anhydrous potassium acetate (POCh, Gliwice) was added via 33% solution in diethylene glycol (catalyst-12) and DABCO 33LV (triethylenediamine, Hülls, Germany) was also added by means of a 33% solution in dipropylene glycol. Polysiloxanepolyoxyalkylene surface-active agent (Silicone L-6900, Witco, Sweden) was used as a stabilizer for the foam structure.</p>
<p>The blowing agent was carbon dioxide formed during the reaction of water with isocyanate groups.</p>
<p>Moreover, a liquid flame-retandard, i.e. tri(2-chloro-1-methyl-ethyl) phosphate (Antiblaze TMCP, Albright and Wilson, United Kingdom) was introduced into foams.</p>
<p>The following fillers were used: (a) silica containing 76.6% SiO<sub>2</sub> (Chemical Plant, Gliwice); (b) kaolin finer than 2 mm with a moisture content of 2% (Kaolin, Gniezno) and (c) Epidian 5, epoxy resin (Organika-Szarzyna SA, New Szarzyna).</p>
<p>Fillers were added in amounts of 2.5–10 wt% relative to the sum of the masses of polyol and diisocyanate. Larger amount of the modifier was not used, as it created a problem of mixing the compound and, as a result, the compound would lack its homogeneity.</p>

<p>The recipes of rigid PUR–PIR foams were prepared on the basis of literature data.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021955X13477671">19</xref></sup> The basis for the calculations was hydroxyl number of polyol. Equivalents of diisocyanate and polyol were calculated as follows:

</p>
<p>The quantity of isocyanate was selected taking into account the ratio of diisocyanate to hydroxyl groups, which for rigid PUR–PIR foams is 3:1.

</p>
<p>The quantity of diisocyanate was increased by the weight of diisocyanate required for reaction with water resulting in evolution of CO<sub>2</sub> (gas foaming the reaction mixture).</p>
<p>The successive point of calculations was to determine the content of auxiliary agents, which generally do not have hydroxyl groups, i.e. catalysts, nonreactive flame retardants, surfactants and other fillers expressed in parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of polyol. Then, the amount of water required to achieve the assumed density of foam was determined. All the above-mentioned substances, after mixing them in the calculated quantities, were the polyol premix (component A), which, when mixed with isocyanate (component B), allowed us to obtain rigid PUR–PIR foams.</p>
<p>The fillers (silica, kaolin and epoxy resin) were introduced in quantities increased from 0.5 to 10 wt% with respect to the sum of diisocyanate and polyol masses (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021955X13477671">Table 1</xref>).

<p>The type of polyol premix has a huge impact on all the properties of PUR–PIR foams. The viscosity of the premix can be adjusted, among others, by addition of different quantities of fillers. In the case of application of modifiers (in amount from 2.5 to 10 wt%) to polyol premixes, it was observed that higher quantity of the modifiers resulted in increase of density (from 1.09 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, premix of foam W, to 1.14 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, premix of foam K10) and viscosity (from 9200 Mpa, premix of foam W, to 10,300 Mpa, premix of foam K10).</p>
<p>Further research showed impact of the amount and type of fillers on the basic utility properties of rigid foams.</p>
<p>It is favourable that the fillers affect the properties of foams; however, they have no effect on change in linear dimensions and volume of foams after 48 h of conditioning.</p>
<p>The processing parameters of foams containing the fillers are slightly longer (start times, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0021955X13477671">Table 3</xref>). Time of expansion is several times longer and time of gelation is about twice longer. Times of gelation of foams with silica (K10), kaolin (S10) and epoxy resin (E10) are prolonged to 43, 55 and 70 s, respectively (compared with time of gelation for foam W equal to 36 s). Times of expansion are prolonged from 18 s (foam W) to 50, 54 and 68 s for K10, S10 and E10 foams, respectively– (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0021955X13477671">Table 3</xref>). In the case of foams with silica, their times of expansion are longer than their times of gelation; however, in other cases (foams with kaolin and Epidian), they are shorter.

<p>The prolonged processing times can affect the shape of the cells (the longer the time of reaction, the more spherical shape of cells observed). This imparts improved physical and mechanical properties to foams. Because of the higher viscosities of the polyol premix, the longer parameters of processing are preferable.</p>
<p>Apparent density of foams should increase with increasing content of some physical fillers in accordance with the rule of additivity.</p>
<p>In foams synthesized by us, apparent density of foams with silica slightly increased by about 4 kg/m<sup>3</sup> (K10) in comparison to standard foam W (without filler); however, it decreased for foams containing kaolin by over 10 kg/m<sup>3</sup> (S10) and foams containing Epidian by 18.5 kg/m<sup>3</sup> (E10). It demonstrates the effect of modifiers on the foaming process and consequently on properties of the modified PUR–PIR. For example, the increase in density should have an effect on decrease in brittleness and increase in compressive strength of foams.</p>
<p>The structure of foams was studied in order to determine the effect of the quantity and type of modifier on their properties.</p>
<p>Structure of standard foam W is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021955X13477671">Figure 1</xref> and foams containing 10 wt% of fillers (E10, K10 and S10) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021955X13477671">Figure 2</xref>.

<p>Microscopic pictures of the cellular structure reflects the positive changes in pore size and their closure as a result of increasing amount of modifiers in foams (especially for foams with kaolin). It can be observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021955X13477671">Figure 1</xref>) that standard foam (W) contains some open cells. As the higher quantities of filler are introduced into the foam, cells become closed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021955X13477671">Figure 2</xref>). It can be observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021955X13477671">Figure 2</xref> that cell walls become thicker and more covered probably with filler as the quantity of modifiers is increased. The thickest walls are observed in foams with silica (K10). The type of filler also has an effect on cell size. Foams with silica (K10) are characterized by the smallest cells and foams with Epidian (E10) have the larger ones. The structure shows graphically the impact of modifiers on properties of foams (e.g. water absorptivity).</p>
<p>The effect of fillers on the shape of the cells was also studied. On the basis of microscopic images of foam made in opposite direction of their expansion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021955X13477671">Figure 3</xref>), it was found that increasing the quantity of fillers (silica, kaolin and Epidian) resulted in a distinct change in shape of cells from slightly elongated pear-shaped (foam with kaolin S2,5) to spherical (foam S10). In the case of foams containing silica (K25 and K10), it was observed that these cells from the very beginning had a spherical shape and it did not change with increasing quantity of this modifier in foam composition. In the case of foam with Epidian, elongation of cells is maintained even at 10% content of the modifier, which may indicate that an increasing quantity of the filler has no apparent effect on the properties of foams. On the basis of these images, it can be concluded that the quantity of kaolin in the foam composition results in clear changes to its properties. The foams with spherical cells are characterized by the best properties since their characteristics are the same in all directions.
<fig id="fig3-0021955X13477671" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Structure of foams in the direction opposite to the direction of their growth—K2.5: foam containing 2.5 wt% of silica; K10: foam containing 10 wt% of silica; E2.5: foam containing 2.5 wt% of Epidian 5; E10: foam containing 10 wt% of Epidian 5; S2.5 foam containing 2.5 wt% of kaolin; S10: foam containing 10 wt% of kaolin.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021955X13477671-fig3.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>Thickness of walls in foams depends, among others, on viscosity of polyol mixture (so-called premix). Premix W was characterized by the lowest viscosity (9200 MPa). It is clearly seen that this foam is characterized by the thinnest cells in comparison to other foams (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021955X13477671">Figure 1</xref>) whose viscosity increased to 10,300 MPa (premix of K10 foam).</p>
<p>Thermal conductivity slowly decreases from 33 mW/m·K (foam W) to 30.1 mW/m·K (foam E10), to 30.0 mW/m·K (foam S10) and to 31.9 mW/m·K (foam K10), as seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0021955X13477671">Table 4</xref>. The better thermal insulating properties of foams are due to their closed cellular structure and increasing thickness of pore walls in foams.

<p>Content of closed cells increases from 91.5% (W) to 95% (S10). Among all the fillers tested, Epidian 5 in the slightest degree affects the closing of cells.</p>
<p>Increase in the quantity of kaolin in foam reduces compressive strength in the direction of foam expansion from 210 kPa (foam W without modifier) to 160 kPa (foam S10 containing 10% wt/wt of chamote). Reduction in strength occurs in spite of the increase in apparent density of foams in series S. Addition of epoxy resin and silica results in higher reduction of strength, i.e. to 55.9 kPa (foam K10) and to 48.2 kPa (foam E10). Reduction of strength is caused by decreasing apparent density in foams of E and K series. Decrease in apparent density could be due to low homogeneity of premix, too short time of mixing and too short parameters of processing.</p>
<p>In the foams obtained, high decrease in brittleness was observed, i.e. from 41.9% (foam W) to 14% (foam K10), to 9.7% (foam S10) and to 26.2% (foam E10), as seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0021955X13477671">Table 4</xref>.</p>
<p>Absorptivity of water was reduced from 1.2% v/v (foam W) to 0.5% v/v (foam S10). Absorptivity of water was reduced in spite of decrease in density that usually worsens this property in foams. Decrease in absorptivity of water results from closed-cell structure, spherical shape and increasing thickness of pore walls. Foams with kaolin are characterized by the lowest absorptivity. It can be due to their compact, densely packed structure. Decrease in absorptivity of water can also result from the nature of hydrophobic fillers.</p>
<p>Addition of all the three modifiers (silica, kaolin, Epidian 5) favourably affects the flammable properties of foams. Retention (residue after combustion) determined by vertical Butler’s test increases to 87.3% (foam K10), to 88.9% (foam S10) and to 95.3% (foam E10), in comparison with standard foam W (equal to 76.6%). All the foams were self-extinguishing.</p>
<p>The foams were analyzed by IR spectroscopy and the obtained spectra are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021955X13477671">Figure 4</xref>. On the basis of spectra, the type of bonds present in the analysed product (foam) was determined. The bands characteristic for isocyanurate marked as 2 and 3 (1690 cm<sup>−1</sup> and 1410 cm<sup>−1</sup>) and urethane marked as 1 (1720 cm<sup>−1</sup>) bonds were recorded in IR spectra of standard foam and foam containing starch. Moreover, vibration band at wavelength of 3360 cm<sup>−1</sup> was recorded, which proves about appearance of hydroxide group −OH (marked as 4) that comes from unreacted polyol. Addition of starch does not affect the type and size of the bands.

<p>Decrease in softening point could be caused, among others, by formation of urea bonds contributing to deterioration of operational characteristics of foams.</p>
<p>Then thermogravimetric analysis of the foams was performed. Example of thermogram of standard PUR–PIR foam is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021955X13477671">Figure 5</xref>. On the basis of TG (change in mass) and DTG (derivative of change in mass) curves, the following characteristics were determined: temperature at the beginning of change in mass (<italic>T</italic><sub>1</sub>,℃), temperature at the beginning of rapid decomposition (<italic>T</italic><sub>2</sub>,℃, determined according to standard ISO 7111 as a point of intersection of tangents) and temperature at the highest rate of loss in foam mass (<italic>T</italic><sub>max</sub>, ℃, corresponding to extreme on DTG curve) (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0021955X13477671">Table 5</xref>).

<p>Introduction of fillers into foam compositions has an effect on increase in temperatures characterizing thermal resistance (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0021955X13477671">Table 5</xref>). The exception is temperature at the highest speed of loss in mass (beginning of rapid decomposition) for foams with silica.</p>
<p>Thermogravimetric analysis showed that temperature at the first loss in foam mass (beginning of change in mass) increased from 44℃ to 88℃ (foam with kaolin S10), to 55℃ (foam with silica K10) and to 53℃ (foam with Epidian 5, E10) as the quantity of modifiers was increased.</p>
<p>Temperature at extrapolated beginning of the first loss in foam mass (beginning of decomposition) increases from 102℃ (W) to 110℃ (K10), to 222℃ (S10) and to 144℃ (E10).</p>
<p>Temperature at the highest speed of loss in mass (beginning of rapid decomposition) increases from 220℃ (W) to 425 (S10) and to 243℃ (E10) for foams with kaolin and Epidian 5, respectively. However, it decreases to 185℃ (foam K10) for foams with silica.</p>
<p>The first loss in mass is probably caused by diffusion of carbon dioxide (acting as porophor) from foam. Carbon dioxide is formed in reaction of the excess of isocyanate groups (−NCO) with water.</p>
<p>Among others, extrapolated temperature at the main loss in foam mass is probably related to decomposition of urethane groups (temperature of thermal dissociation, about 200℃).</p>
<p>Temperature at the highest loss in mass (beginning of rapid decomposition) can be associated with decomposition of carboimide bonds (temperature of dissociation above 240℃), which are formed in reaction of diisocyanate excess with respect to polyol.</p>
<p>This temperature can also be connected with decomposition of urea groups (temperature of dissociation 250℃), which are formed when water is applied as a blowing agent. The chains of foams obtained contain isocyanurate rings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021955X13477671">Figure 4</xref>), whose temperature of dissociation is 300℃.</p>

<sec id="sec8-0021955X13477671"><title>Summary</title>
<p>The rigid PUR–PIR were obtained. Their nomenclature was determined on the basis of polyurethane and polyisocyanurate bonds (IR analysis). Three types of fillers (kaolin, Epidian 5 and silica) were introduced into foam compositions in quantities ranging from 2.5 to 10 wt%. Increase in viscosity of polyol premix was observed after addition of modifiers.</p>
<p>It was found that addition of modifiers caused closing of cells, reduction in their size and increase in thickness of pore walls. It resulted in improvement of other properties such as absorptivity of water and thermal conductivity. Addition of fillers affects a fourfold decrease in brittleness of foams (foams K and S); however, compressive strength of the filled foams was not improved. In spite of the favourable foam structure, the density of the foams decreased (foams with Epidian 5 and silica), which is the reason for decrease in compressive strength in direction of foam expansion.</p>
<p>Addition of fillers to foam compositions has a positive effect on temperatures characterizing thermal and heat resistance of foams (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0021955X13477671">Table 5</xref>). Softening points increased by 9℃ (foams with silica) and by 14℃ (foams with Epidian 5), as the content of fillers was increased in foam compositions.</p>
<p>It was found that foams with kaolin (series of S foams) were characterized by over twice the increase in temperature of the first loss in mass, temperature of extrapolated beginning of the first loss in mass and temperature of the highest rate of loss in mass. These temperatures increase by about 30–40℃ in the case of foams filled with Epidian 5 (series E). Addition of silica causes increase in temperature of the first loss in mass by 9℃, increase in temperature of extrapolated beginning of the first loss in mass by 8℃ and decrease of the highest rate of loss in mass by 35℃ (series K).</p>
<p>It was found that foams filled with kaolin were characterized by the best properties at high temperatures. The best insulators were foams with kaolin and slightly worse were foams with Epidian 5. The highest thermal conductivity (the worse usefulness as insulators) was observed in foams modified by silica. Thermal conductivity of the latter foams is reduced by elongated shape of foam cells.</p>
<p>To summarize, addition of kaolin and Epidian 5 improves characteristics of foams; however, silica can be introduced into foam composition as unreactive filler in order to reduce the price of foam.</p>
