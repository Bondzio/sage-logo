<abstract>
<p>Ever since the end of the Cold War and, in particular, since the terrorist attacks of 9/11, a fierce debate has been taking place both in the academic and the political world about the problems traditional concepts and theories of international relations and foreign policy have in explaining change in international politics. Complexity as a conceptual framework for explaining international politics emerged as a result of this debate and has been making important contributions to it.This article is intended to assess the impact complexity has had on this debate over the last 20 years. It is argued that one can identify three distinct phases of complexity’s emergence into the field of international politics. Whilst the framework has been quite successful in explaining change in international politics and developing concepts to adjust foreign policy to the existence of self-organising complex-adaptive systems, the framework still has some way to go in developing clear alternative strategies for the development of foreign policies processes which not only take account of the complexity encountered by policy-makers but use this complexity to improve policy-outcomes. To this end, the article concludes by suggesting areas for further research.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Ten years after the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 (9/11) and 20 years after the end of the Cold War policy-makers still seem to be struggling to adjust their thinking to the ‘new’ international environment these events represented. During this time, a fierce debate has been conducted about whether the traditional concepts and theories of international relations are adequate for this new environment.</p>
<p>Out of this debate have come various new conceptual frameworks for the analysis and conduct of international politics, including complexity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0010836712454274">1</xref></sup> Advocates of complexity make significant claims about how this approach can help policy-makers and analysts make sense of the puzzles presented by contemporary foreign policy.</p>
<p>The aim of this article is to critically evaluate the emergence of complexity into the field of international relations. Using a historical approach, it will be argued that one can identify three distinct, yet overlapping, phases of this process. During the first, from the end of the Cold War to the beginning of the 2000s, advocates developed complexity-inspired concepts to better explain change in international politics. During the second, spanning the last 10 years, the consequences of this reconceptualization for foreign policy have been debated. Finally, recent complexity literature has begun to develop toolkits so that foreign policy-making processes can be reformed to take account of these consequences.</p>
<p>It will be argued that complexity has been quite successful in relation to the first two phases but needs to do more in order to be taken seriously in relation to the third phase. To do so, areas of further research will be identified.</p>

<sec id="section2-0010836712454274">
<title>The first phase of complexity and international politics: explaining change</title>
<p>One can trace the emergence of complexity into the field of international relations to the end of the Cold War. The sudden collapse of the Soviet Union at the end of the 1980s ‘astonished almost everyone, whether in government, the academy, the media or think tanks’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0010836712454274">Gaddis, 1992</xref>: 6). The ‘failure’ of traditional international relations theories to predict the end of this conflict led to a period of soul-searching and recognition of the problems international relations has in dealing with change. History had a habit of ‘leaving scholars and commentators in its dust’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0010836712454274">Doyle, 1995</xref>: 65). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0010836712454274">Kavalski (2007</xref>: 442) this problem was because traditional approaches to international relations had an ‘inability to conceive [of the] dynamics [of International Relations]’, dynamics which occur even within seemingly stable systems such as the Cold War.</p>
<p>Policy-makers were equally embarrassed. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0010836712454274">Cox (2009</xref>: 164) quotes one senior US official as saying that ‘it hadn’t occurred to any of us that [the Cold War] ever would end’. As the 1990s wore on, the ‘pace of change in the international system accelerated’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0010836712454274">Lebow, 1994</xref>: 258), creating an opening for new conceptual approaches to deal with the ‘problem’ of change. It is here that one can find the origins of complexity as a framework for international politics.</p>
<p>The key argument put forward by proponents of complexity is that international politics is not only ‘complex’ in a descriptive sense but a ‘complex adaptive system’ (CAS), defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0010836712454274">Dooley (1997)</xref> as ‘a collection of semi-autonomous agents with the freedom to act in unpredictable ways and whose interactions over time and space generate system-wide patterns’.</p>
<p>Key to this was the fact that
<disp-quote>
<p>[i]n the social world […] causation is complex. Outcomes are determined not by single causes but by multiple causes, and the causes may, and usually do, interact, in a non-additive fashion. In other words the combined effect is not necessarily the sum of the separate effects. [As such] complex causes can easily generate chaotic outcomes.</p>
<attrib>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0010836712454274">Byrne, 1998</xref>: 20)</attrib>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Complex adaptive systems are characterised by a large number of elements which interact across time and space; rich interaction with many elements influencing, and being influenced by, many others; interaction which is often non-linear, making the development of the system only partially predictable; continuous feedback loops, which can be both positive and negative and extend across multiple and massively entangled levels of analysis in what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0010836712454274">Arthur (1989</xref>: 125) has called a ‘self-referential’ process; their openness to, and interaction with, their environment; the fact that they operate under conditions far from equilibrium; their evolution over time, meaning they have a history which has a significant impact on their current and future state; and the evolution of their elements according to local boundary conditions, ignorant of the behaviour of the system as a whole and their non-teleological nature, meaning that CASs are not moving towards a predetermined end-point, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0010836712454274">Jacobson and Kozma (2000)</xref> have demonstrated.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0010836712454274">Cederman (1997)</xref> has shown that one can identify all these elements in international relations, making uncertainty an <italic>inherent</italic> condition of international politics. Every political action potentially has ‘unintended consequences’ because
<disp-quote>
<p>we cannot look at one side while holding the other constant because even to explain one side’s decisions, we need to capture its estimate of the other side’s likely response, which in turn is influenced by what it thinks the other thinks the state will do.</p>
<attrib>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0010836712454274">Jervis, 1997</xref>: 85)</attrib>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>International politics develops through a constant interplay between ‘generalities’ and ‘particularities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0010836712454274">Gaddis, 2002</xref>: 63) in a process called ‘self-organisation’ whereby the ‘internal dynamics of a system generate system-wide patterns’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0010836712454274">Eoyang, 2001</xref>: 27).</p>
<p>This meant that both scholars and policy-makers had to abandon, or at least modify, their belief in the scientific (or ‘Newtonian’) approach to international politics, described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0010836712454274">Schroeder (1994</xref>: 115) as ‘ahistorical and strange’. This approach was based on four basic principles: order, whereby known causes lead to known effects under all circumstances; reductionism, whereby, through the observation of the behaviour of its parts, the behaviour of a system as a whole could be understood clockwork fashion, free of surprises, and the whole was the sum of its parts; predictability, in that, once the behaviour of a system is understood, the future course of events can be predicted by application of the appropriate inputs to the model; and determinism, whereby processes flow along orderly and predictable lines with clear beginnings and rational ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0010836712454274">Geyer and Mackintosh, 2005</xref>: 34).</p>
<p>Casting this framework aside and recognising international politics as a CAS had far-reaching consequences for the analysis of – and action within – such a system. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0010836712454274">Kavalski (2007)</xref> argued that the emergence of complexity into the fields of international relations signified nothing less than a ‘fifth debate’ about the study of international life, with specific focus on the tension between ‘linear’ and ‘non-linear’ paradigms and the associated significant implications for both the epistemology and the ontology of international relations. Surveying the scene of IR after the Cold War, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0010836712454274">Bernstein et al. (2000)</xref> claimed that ‘God gave Physics the easy problems’.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0010836712454274">
<title>The second phase: foreign policy and complexity</title>
<p>The events of 9/11 gave a boost to the advocates of complexity because they seemed to re-affirm the inherent uncertainty of international politics, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0010836712454274">Jervis (2005)</xref> pointed out. However, they also increased the pressure on proponents of the approach to develop more robust and practical concepts which could contribute to the process of adapting to the changes they had identified.</p>
<p>Critics, such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0010836712454274">Cudworth and Hobden (2009</xref>: 59), labelled complexity a ‘meta theory which does not pass the level of a, perhaps useful, metaphor to describe what international politics is’. That the world is ‘complex and dynamic there is no doubt; less clear is the extent to which complexity theory can fill the gap’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0010836712454274">Levy, 2000</xref>: 74). Kissane agreed that, as it is ‘impossible to account for the actions of every human on the planet and the implications of all their actions on the wider system […], the theorist has to make a choice as to which actors or level of interdependence they will restrict their analysis to’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0010836712454274">Kissane, 2007</xref>: 100).</p>
<p>In response, advocates of complexity began a debate about the importance of complexity for the analysis of – and response to – international political problems. In particular, literature focused on the implications of the concept of self-organisation. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0010836712454274">Eoyang (2001</xref>: 27) states:
<disp-quote>
<p>Because system boundaries in a CAS are multiple, fluid and massively entangled, the ‘internal interactions’ happen at various scales and interlocking patterns emerge at various places across the system and throughout the time period of the self-organizing process. Clusters of agents form micro-patterns continually. The micro-patterns interact to form larger, more comprehensive patterns or disrupt each other during the on-going evolution of the system. At the same time, emergent patterns in a super-system influence the emerging patterns in sub-systems and in individual agents by either reinforcing or disrupting their local self-organizing process.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Since such a process is a <italic>permanent</italic> feature of a CAS there is no possibility of totally controlling its development. Given this, one of the key values of the complexity approach is to allow for a new way of thinking about how global politics unfolds in an environment in which ‘uncertainty is the norm and apprehension is the mood’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0010836712454274">Rosenau, 2003</xref>: 208).</p>
<p>Within such an environment the key challenge facing political actors, therefore, is to develop and pursue clear political objectives whilst maintaining enough flexibility to be able to respond to unexpected changes and unintended consequences of their actions. How to achieve such a balancing act became one of the key debates over the last few years, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0010836712454274">Gaddis (2004)</xref> has shown.</p>
<p>The first issue to emerge out of this debate was the question of problem definition and policy objectives. If one cannot control the development of a CAS over time and space, and if one cannot foresee the unintended consequences that may arise out of any given political action, how can one determine clear political objectives or evaluate the effectiveness of a particular policy? In response, proponents of complexity have argued that policy-makers have to encourage locally based processes of development that occur on ‘the edge of chaos’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0010836712454274">Ford, 2011</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0010836712454274">Eoyang (2001)</xref> proposes that policy-makers maintain a process of self-organisation of ‘medium constraint’ whereby clearly defined general objectives are pursued through a variety of different strategies according to local circumstances, in which changes can occur and best practices be exchanged through open channels of communication between the different parts of the CAS. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0010836712454274">Gaddis (2002)</xref> stresses the need for theoretical and methodological tolerance. This would allow for a ‘coalition of professional communities with a wide range of conceptual stance and technical skills’ to tackle complex issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0010836712454274">Bobrow, 1996</xref>: 436).</p>
<p>Policy-makers, then, become facilitators of differing processes of self-organisation across time and space with the aim of producing results that are ‘good enough’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0010836712454274">Geyer, 2011</xref>: 22) according to the particular local boundary conditions within which policies have to be implemented. The key question to be asked becomes not what needs to be done to ‘resolve’ any given problem. Political problems are expressions of particular states of self-organisation at a particular time. Thus, the most important question to be answered becomes what can be done to change the pattern of self-organisation which led to the problem being addressed in the first place.</p>
<p>The above led to a second debate concerning the question of <italic>how</italic> political action is decided upon, the methods used to develop and apply policies and the areas where they are applied.</p>
<p>Bearing in mind the massively entangled nature of social CASs and the differences that exist within them across time and space one common theme of complexity is the idea that acting within such a system should be a social rather than a political activity. Policies should actively involve the population to which they are applied so that new patterns of self-organisation can emerge at a local level. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0010836712454274">Rihani (2002)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0010836712454274">Ramo (2009)</xref> have shown, in essence this means governments providing a framework for other actors to be able to try and test methods to deal with the particular local expression of particular problems. Given this, there is a need for the <italic>decentralisation</italic> of political action, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0010836712454274">Albert et al. (2010)</xref> have argued.</p>
<p>How, though, does one know what constitutes ‘good’ or ‘good enough’ policy? Advocates of complexity would point to the above as criteria for evaluation. Good policies are those which move the process of self-organisation away from the state in which it was considered to represent a problem, and which provide a stable framework within which people and groups can act to change their own local boundary conditions. Applying complexity to the challenge of maintaining security within the international system, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0010836712454274">Kavalski (2008</xref>: 434) argued that policy-makers should encourage the emergence of resilient processes of self-organisation, as opposed to processes that can be controlled, so that one has the ‘ability to cope successfully with challenging or threatening circumstances, <italic>to defy</italic> destructive pressures and <italic>to construct</italic> new proficiency out of unfavourable conditions’ (emphasis in original). One has to ‘generate uncertainty’ in order to allow for adaptation and change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0010836712454274">Harrison, 2006</xref>: 186).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0010836712454274">
<title>The third phase: applying complexity to foreign policy-making processes</title>
<p>Complexity, then, has made considerable progress in certain areas, especially in the sphere of redefining the basic concepts of international politics and, as a result, of how one ought to deal with change.</p>
<p>However, advocates of complexity still confront some formidable problems for being accepted into the ‘mainstream’ of the discipline and, therefore, gaining more influence on policy-makers.</p>
<p>First, and crucially, just like many of its ‘traditional’ rivals, complexity literature on specific foreign policy issues has often been backward looking. Whether it be in relation to the War on Terror (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0010836712454274">Geyer and Rihani, 2010</xref>), Iraq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0010836712454274">Ramo, 2009</xref>) or, more recently, the ‘Arab Spring’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0010836712454274">Lust, 2011</xref>), there is a tendency to outline what went wrong, why it went wrong and what <italic>should have been</italic> done. Although this is useful, it still leaves the question of whether the concepts applied can serve as a reasonably reliable guide to the future in order to <italic>prevent</italic> problems from occurring in the first place.</p>
<p>In addition, important cultural factors stand in the way of a complexity-inspired paradigm change in the field of foreign policy-making. As has been shown by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0010836712454274">Owens and Pelizzo (2010)</xref>, not only are highly hierarchical and centralized foreign policy-making processes deeply enshrined in most democratic societies and backed by constitutional provisions, but this process of centralization has actually accelerated over the last 10 years in a host of countries. This has enshrined ‘role expectations’ about who does what (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0010836712454274">Cashman, 1993</xref>: 92).</p>
<p>These role expectations point to a critical tension which complexity advocates need to overcome. On the one hand, as shown, there has been recognition of complexity as a descriptive reality of international politics. On the other, based on these role expectations, this recognition has led to <italic>increased</italic> centralisation of foreign policy-making processes. There is an enormous reluctance on the part of policy-makers and their advisors to embrace complexity as a way of increasing adaptability and flexibility, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0010836712454274">Meyer (2009)</xref> has shown in relation to British foreign policy or <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0010836712454274">Johnson (2004)</xref> in relation to US foreign policy. Ironically, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0010836712454274">Meyer himself (2006)</xref> acknowledges that some of the decisions that have come out of these traditional processes have been poor, for instance in relation to Iraq, yet does not agree that this indicates a systemic problem. Rather, like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0010836712454274">Stothard (2003)</xref> he argues that these decisions were the result of bad use of the existing structures and processes.</p>
<p>Bearing the above in mind, complexity advocates face a three-pronged challenge. First, they have to show more clearly that such processes of centralisation are counterproductive, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0010836712454274">Geyer and Rihani (2010)</xref> demonstrate. They also need to stimulate a debate about what political leaders are here for and what expectations one should have of them. Second, they have to encourage civil society to actively <italic>seek</italic> participation in political processes, especially at the local level, from within a politically guaranteed framework of stable rules. Third, a lot of research has to go into the question of how one can reform existing foreign policy-making processes in order to make them ‘complex adaptive’ and allow for policy-making on the ‘edge of chaos’. In other words, how can the principles established by complexity advocates be incorporated into policy-making processes? Such literature has recently emerged in several spheres of public policy, especially health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0010836712454274">Hill, 2010</xref>) and social policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0010836712454274">Eoyang and Yellowthunder, 2005</xref>). These attempts have also brought about a number of complexity-inspired policy tools to guide political action, such as the so-called CDE model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0010836712454274">Eoyang, 2001</xref>), but attempts to design such processes for foreign policy are still at an early stage, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0010836712454274">Lehmann (2011)</xref> has shown.</p>
<p>To take this work further, complexity advocates have to be much clearer about the actual <italic>benefits</italic> of uncertainty. It allows, for instance, for multiple approaches and solutions to particular problems. It can help to break down bureaucratic and political boundaries. Crucially, accepting complexity can help one to deal with the acute sense, exemplified by 9/11, of always following events.</p>
<p>To encourage such changes, advocates of complexity also need to be very clear about what the approach is not: it is <italic>not</italic> a coherent theory intended to <italic>replace</italic> others. Rather, it ought to serve as a framework to utilize a variety of theoretical perspectives. It is also <italic>not</italic> intended as an approach which can predict the future across time and space. Rather, it helps policy-makers and analysts to deal with ‘not knowing’.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0010836712454274">
<title>Areas for further research</title>
<p>Therefore, incorporating complexity fully into the existing frameworks for IR will require some fundamental reforms, both theoretically and practically. This will not be an easy or quick process precisely because it will itself take place in the context of a self-organising CAS.</p>
<p>Thus, one critical area of further research is the question of how to raise <italic>awareness</italic> that political leaders are acting within a CAS. Given this, further case studies on what political responses to complex problems would look like when informed by a complexity framework are vital.</p>
<p>A further aspect which needs more work in order to facilitate these debates is an acceleration of the reform of the framework used to both debate and respond to contemporary international political challenges. How can one encourage more interdisciplinarity and, therefore, change patterns of thinking? How, in short, can one adapt the context of debate to complexity and self-organisation? All of these issues need further consideration within the parameters suggested here.</p>
<p>To make more progress, however, requires, in particular, active engagement with the diplomatic community and their political masters in order to overcome the gut reaction of state bureaucracies to react to uncertainty by developing ever more elaborate rules and procedures in the hope of eliminating surprise and uncertainty, a process which, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0010836712454274">Hamilton and Langhorne (2011)</xref> point out, has gone on for centuries. Complexity-informed academic work on foreign policy <italic>has</italic> to show its practical applicability to become interesting for policy-makers and, therefore, overcome the mistrust already referred to above.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This review article was intended to assess the ‘state of play’ in relation to the emergence of complexity into the study of international politics. The article suggests that one can identify three phases of this process: development of new concepts; implications of these concepts for the definition of – and response to – political problems; and the practical issue of making foreign policies self-organising.</p>
<p>It has been shown that complexity has achieved two fundamental things. First, it has contributed significantly to the debate about how to deal with change and the ‘unexpected’ in international politics by introducing some important concepts around which the analysis of international politics can be remodelled.</p>
<p>As a second important point, complexity has taken these concepts and applied them to foreign policy-making to establish some basic principles which policy-makers should take into account, such as the importance of local boundary conditions, the need for political decentralisation and the importance of making policy development and implementation a social activity.</p>
<p>However, there is an urgent need for advocates of complexity to continue to work on ideas for reforms both in the structure of foreign policy decision-making processes and in the context within which problems and their possible solutions are defined, including possible constitutional reforms. More research is needed on how such reforms can be instigated and up to which points they can be carried, bearing in mind the resistance they will encounter. However, the urgency of such a debate cannot be understated. As the last few years have shown, politicians and their bureaucracies are increasingly overtaken by events. In order to change this, more of the same is not an option. Complexity, therefore, represents a potentially fruitful approach to allow policy-makers and analysts to once again become more proactive.</p>
