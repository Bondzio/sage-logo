<sec id="sec1-1077546311421946"><title>1. Introduction</title>
<p>Earthquake simulators, also known as shake tables, are essential experimental facilities in earthquake engineering. To date, a number of earthquake simulators have been constructed, developed, and utilized for seismic performance assessment of structural and geotechnical systems all over the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077546311421946">Roth and Cheney, 2001</xref>). In particular, large-scale earthquake simulators that have been developed in recent years have significantly improved dynamic testing capabilities, addressed scaling issues, and provided the most direct means for assessment of seismic performance of structures. Those include, but are not limited to, the E-defense facility in Japan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1077546311421946">Ohtani et al., 2003</xref>); a six degree-of-freedom shake table at the University of California, Berkeley (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077546311421946">Dixon and Penzien, 1974</xref>); an outdoor shake table at the University of California, San Diego (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077546311421946">Luco et al., 2009</xref>); two relocatable shake tables at the University of Buffalo, The State University of New York (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1077546311421946">Reinhorn et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077546311421946">Bruneau et al., 2002</xref>); and three bi-axial shake tables at the University of Nevada, Reno (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1077546311421946">Johnson et al., 2007</xref>). Earthquake simulators are also used for the verification of new approaches in structural design such as those in structural control. For such purposes, small-scale earthquake simulators are particularly suitable. While small-scale dynamic tests do not always represent realistic structural response in detail (e.g. local damage), they provide an essential means to prove concepts and identify potential challenges prior to full-scale investigation. A good number of small-scale earthquake simulators for such purposes can be found in the American Society of Civil Engineers 12th Engineering Mechanics conference in 1998 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077546311421946">Abdulla et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077546311421946">Dyke, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1077546311421946">Gavin et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1077546311421946">Kuehn et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1077546311421946">Nagarajaiah and Gozdowski, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1077546311421946">Spencer and Yang, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1077546311421946">Symans and Twitchell, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1077546311421946">Trombetti et al., 1998</xref>). The other important use of earthquake simulators is in education. Earthquake simulators provide an excellent demonstration and hands-on experience to facilitate students’ learning in structural dynamics and earthquake engineering. Because of safety and easy operation, small-scale electromechanical earthquake simulators are usually used for educational purposes. Community-wide educational programs using such electromechanical earthquake simulators include University Consortium on Instructional Shake Table (UCIST) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1077546311421946">Dyke, 2000</xref>) and undergraduate seismic design competitions organized by Earthquake Engineering Research Institute (EERI) Student Leadership Council (SLC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077546311421946">Earthquake Engineering Research Institute, 2010</xref>). The UCIST has expanded to over 100 universities within the US and abroad including the three US national earthquake centers. The EERI SLC seismic design competitions have created great opportunities for students to apply their knowledge in structural design as well as to expand their social networks. One of the technical challenges in shake table tests is the reproduction of reference accelerations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077546311421946">Twitchell and Symans, 2003</xref>). Acceleration control of shake tables is difficult due to inherent nonlinearities in servo hydraulic systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1077546311421946">Zhao et al., 2005</xref>), control-structure interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077546311421946">Dyke et al., 1995</xref>), and dynamics of the base support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077546311421946">Conte and Trombetti, 2000</xref>). Although measured accelerations at the table can be used as the input acceleration in the performance assessment, it is essential to have an acceptable acceleration control to assess the true impact of the reference accelerations on structures. While the control performance of earthquake simulators can be improved to some extent by modifying the reference displacement signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1077546311421946">Spencer and Yang, 1998</xref>), improvement is rather limited within the low frequency range. Acceleration control in the high frequency range is particularly critical for the seismic assessment of acceleration-sensitive nonstructural components such as computer servers and medical devices that account for a significant portion of economic loss. Most earthquake simulators including those introduced above are fabricated by manufacturers (e.g., MTS, Inc., Shore Western, Inc., Servotest, Inc., Quanser, Inc., etc.). Control systems and associated software applications are generally designed to be easy to utilize. Servo control loops for actuators (referred herein as inner-loops) in these commercially available control systems are embedded with the conventional Proportional-Integral-Differential (PID) controller. These control systems provide access to parameters in the inner-loops (i.e., control gains, amplifier gains, etc.) to tune the dynamic performance of earthquake simulators. They also allow external control of the reference signal to the actuators (often referred to as outer-loops). However, because the software applications are generally proprietary, customization in controller designs is not usually possible, especially in the inner-loops. In short, these proprietary software applications are not well suited for the development of acceleration control to enhance accuracy in shake table tests. This paper presents a recently constructed uniaxial earthquake simulator and a flexible development platform for actuator controller designs. The earthquake simulator is designed, machined, and fabricated at the Johns Hopkins University. The development platform is built on commercially available off-the-shelf products without proprietary components. The platform provides a full access to the actuator inner-loop, allowing the development of high-fidelity controller designs including model based approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1077546311421946">Kuehn et al., 1999</xref>). This paper is intended to provide information that is necessary to build similar earthquake simulators elsewhere, covering construction details, hydraulic components, dynamic specifications, an integrated control and data acquisition system, and example applications of the earthquake simulator at the Johns Hopkins University.</p>

<sec id="sec2-1077546311421946"><title>2. Construction details of the earthquake simulator</title>
<p>The earthquake simulator is constructed in Latrobe 15 at the Homewood Campus of the Johns Hopkins University. Latrobe 15 is a 70 m<sup>2</sup> laboratory space dedicated to structural testing with a 20 m<sup>2</sup> isolated concrete slab. A corner section of the isolated concrete slab with 1.22 m × 2.44 m area is allocated for the earthquake simulator. The foundation of the earthquake simulator consists of high-strength self-leveling hydro-stone, a thin layer of fiber reinforced rubber sheet, and a 1.22 m × 2.44 m steel plate of 25.4 mm thickness. The self-leveling hydro-stone of approximately 40 mm thickness is used to provide a flat surface to mount the steel plate, accommodating unevenness of the isolated concrete slab. The rubber layer is added to fill the remaining gap between the hydro-stone and the steel plate as well as to reduce vibration propagation and noise generation. The steel plate provides a workable solid anchor to mount a hydraulic actuator and linear guides for the shake table. The steel plate is tied down to the concrete slab using eight 12.7 mm-diameter threaded rods. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1077546311421946">Figure 1</xref>(a) shows the rubber sheet and the steel plate prior to the foundation assembly. A 1.2 m × 1.2 m × 50 mm square aluminum plate is used as the shake table. The aluminum plate is mounted on two high-precision stainless-steel linear guides with four ball bearings manufactured by Pacific Bearing Co. The aluminum plate has a 152.4 mm square grid of 6.4 mm threaded holes for mounting test specimens. An actuator support is made of 6.4 mm steel plates welded together with stiffeners. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1077546311421946">Figure 1</xref>(b) shows a completed earthquake simulator with a scaled model building. The construction assembly of the earthquake simulator took approximately two months.

</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1077546311421946"><title>3. Hydraulic components and dynamic specifications</title>
<p>The earthquake simulator here is driven by a hydraulic system that consists of a hydraulic power supply (HPS), a hydraulic service manifold (HSM), and a hydraulic actuator. Those hydraulic components are manufactured by Shore Western, Inc., and their specifications are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1077546311421946">Table 1</xref>. The 911D actuator is fatigue rated and designed for high-speed dynamic testing. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1077546311421946">Figure 2</xref> shows the 911D actuator attached to the base and the shake table. The preloaded swivel base and rod end of the actuator allow pivoting to accommodate imperfection in construction and provide backlash-free reversals of dynamic loading. An internally demodulated direct current (DC) linear variable differential transformer (LVDT) is embedded in the actuator cylinder to measure the actuator piston displacement. A current-driven servo valve and a differential pressure (delta-P) transducer manufactured by MTS Systems, Corp. are installed on the 911D actuator. Specifications of the servo valve are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1077546311421946">Table 1</xref>. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1077546311421946">Table 2</xref> shows specifications of the earthquake simulator at the Johns Hopkins University<bold>.</bold> With a maximum payload of 500 kg, the earthquake simulator can generate an acceleration of 1.8 g. Without a payload, the earthquake simulator can increase maximum acceleration to 5.5 g. Stable high-speed, long-stroke, dynamic loading can be achieved with 3.8 liter accumulators in both pressure and return lines. The earthquake simulator can shake the table up to 50 Hz without causing vibrations or noise problems.

<sec id="sec4-1077546311421946"><title>4. An integrated control and data acquisition system</title>
<p>The main contribution of this paper is to present a flexible and modular platform that facilitates development of actuator controller designs including model-based high-fidelity control. As mentioned earlier, proprietary control systems are not well suited for this purpose due to limited configurations in the actuator inner-loop. Requirements for the development platform are LVDT-embedded dynamic actuators and current- or voltage-driven servo valves. With these requirements, the development platform can be adopted in any earthquake simulator; it should be mentioned that the development platform is not specific to the hydraulic components in the earthquake simulator at the Johns Hopkins University. The development platform consists of an integrated control and data acquisition system described below.</p>
<sec id="sec5-1077546311421946"><title>4.1. Hardware system architecture</title>
<p>Hardware components of the control and data acquisition system include a number of electrical and computer devices. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1077546311421946">Table 3</xref> shows major hardware devices for the earthquake simulator at the Johns Hopkins University. A schematic of the hardware system architecture is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1077546311421946">Figure 3</xref>. National Instruments (NI) PXI Express systems provide high-speed, high-performance, synchronized, digital control and data acquisition. During operation of the earthquake simulator, all of the sensor signals in shake table tests including the LVDT in the hydraulic actuator are multiplexed through a signal conditioner (NI SCXI-1000) and are sampled by a high-speed multi-channel data acquisition board (NI PXI-6251). Sampled data is made available on a 2.3 GHz real-time dual-core controller (PXIe-8130) that can perform digital signal processes with 4 GB/s system bandwidth. Based on a target reference, feedback sensor signals, and a control algorithm, the real-time controller computes and generates a command signal from a high-performance servo motion controller (PXI-7358) in a form of DC voltage. The DC command signal is delivered through a universal motion interface (UMI-7774), and then converted into a DC current signal by a conversion circuitry (USC-CVB225-01). The electrical signal is sent to the MTS 252 servo valve to change the position of the valve spool that regulates the oil flow into actuator chambers. A differential pressure between the actuator chambers caused by the oil flow drives the actuator piston's movement. All of the processes above can be performed within a time increment of 0.5 msec (2 kHz). A system delay of the earthquake simulator, including sequential delays from hardware, software and electro-mechanical systems, is experimentally identified as 0.01 sec. In addition to the command signal to the hydraulic actuator, the PXI-7358 can write digital output signals. Digital output ports are connected to the HPS and HSM through electrical relays to control the devices from application software. A software-based automatic emergency shut-down of the HPS and HMS is implemented to provide additional safety to manual emergency switches.

<sec id="sec6-1077546311421946"><title>4.2. Application software design</title>
<p>To enable high-speed, high-performance control as well as real-time monitoring of sensor data in shake table tests, the proposed control and data acquisition system employs two computers, namely a target machine and a host PC. The target machine must be a controller or a PC with real-time operating system. It is recommended that the target machine has a multi-core processor to perform parallel processing. The PXIe-8130, an embedded real-time controller in the PXI Chassis, is adopted as the target machine in the earthquake simulator at the Johns Hopkins University. The host PC is a Windows-based desktop machine that runs application software. See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1077546311421946">Figure 3</xref> for configuration of those machines in the hardware system architecture. All of the time critical tasks in shake table tests are implemented in an application on the target machine that is developed as a part of this study<bold>.</bold> Those tasks include data acquisition, signal processing, calculation of target reference point, determination of command signal (i.e., inner-loop control), and its generation. The application on the target machine is written in NI LabVIEW, which is a graphical programming environment. LabVIEW provides flexible design of experimental processes with full access to signal inputs and outputs, supporting the development of innovative controller designs for earthquake simulators. With a multi-threaded programming capability in LabVIEW and a dual-core processor on the PXIe-8130, multiple tasks can be processed simultaneously and independently without interference. The application is compiled and deployed on the real-time operating system that provides guaranteed execution of those time critical tasks at a deterministic rate. The application software on the host PC is also developed in this study. It provides a user interface to operate the shake table and control the HPS and HSM. The application software is written in NI LabVIEW. However, tasks in the application software are implemented using different approaches in the application on the target machine. For example, a process to feed inputs through the user interface is written in an event-driven manner. Once changes are made on the interface, then updated inputs are sent to the real-time application on the target machine. On the other hand, sensor data is continuously streamed out from the real-time application on the target machine. Continuous monitoring is written as an independent process from the event-driven process. The application software also includes an optional process to save data into a file in either binary or ASCII format. Communication between the target machine and the host PC utilizes a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol based technology called a shared variable. Shared variables are developed in LabVIEW and provide secure communication for distributed applications. In the applications developed for the earthquake simulator, network traffic is kept to a requisite minimum to allocate more resources on the time critical processes.</p>

<sec id="sec7-1077546311421946"><title>5. Example applications</title>
<p>The earthquake simulator developed here has been used in tests with different purposes. This section presents example applications of the earthquake simulator.</p>
<sec id="sec8-1077546311421946"><title>5.1. Development of experimental methods: acceleration trajectory tracking control</title>
<p>The author has been working on a development of acceleration control strategies to improve reproducibility of reference acceleration in shake table tests. To investigate conventional and newly developed approaches for acceleration control, the earthquake simulator has been utilized. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1077546311421946">Figure 4</xref> shows a block diagram for acceleration trajectory tracking control developed by the author (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1077546311421946">Nakata, 2010</xref>). The proposed method is a model-based approach, and incorporates a Kalman filter in the actuator inner-loop. Furthermore, the proposed method incorporates an acceleration feed-forward and a command shaping technique that is based on the inverse of the system dynamics. It should be mentioned that implementation of such a highly sophisticated inner-loop controller design is either impossible or extremely cumbersome with proprietary software applications. The system presented here provides a flexible environment as well as direct access to various sensor data, facilitating development, implementation, and verification of control strategies for hydraulic actuators. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1077546311421946">Figure 5</xref> shows a comparison between the acceleration trajectory tracking control and the conventional feedback control with command shaping. It can be seen that the model-based inner-loop control design has better performance than the conventional control design in both time and frequency domains.

<sec id="sec9-1077546311421946"><title>5.2. Proof-of-concept tests: system identification of model structures</title>
<p>The earthquake simulator has also been used as an excitation source in proof-of-concept tests including system identification, structural health monitoring, and structural control. Among those, applications in system identification are presented here. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1077546311421946">Figure 6</xref> shows scaled model structures that are constructed for system identification studies at the Johns Hopkins University. These structures are instrumented with accelerometers at critical response points. Dynamic characteristics of the structures (i.e., natural frequencies, damping ratios, and mode shapes) are estimated from acceleration time-histories using vibration based techniques. The earthquake simulator is used to apply controlled ground excitation of arbitrary wave forms (e.g., earthquake motions, harmonic waves, and random disturbances) to those structures. Experimental studies in system identification includes verification of identification algorithms, investigation of the effect of excitation types and levels on estimated dynamic characteristics, and evaluation of repeatability in system identification of structures. In a preliminary study using a linear shaker with focus on the effect of excitation level on confidence level, estimated dynamic characteristics from earthquake simulator tests are used as references. The earthquake simulator has dynamic capacities for these structures to develop material inelasticity and geometric nonlinearity. With such capacities of the earthquake simulator, proof-of-concept tests can be extended to a nonlinear realm of the structural response.

<sec id="sec10-1077546311421946"><title>5.3. Education and outreach: experimental demonstration and hands-on experience</title>
<p>Experimental demonstration and hands-on experience facilitate students’ interest as well as their understanding in structural dynamics and earthquake engineering. For such purposes, the earthquake simulator has been used in education and outreach activities at the Johns Hopkins University. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1077546311421946">Figure 7</xref>(a) shows four simple wooden stick and weight systems that are used in an undergraduate Dynamics laboratory. Each system has a unique set of a stick length and the weight: system 1 has a longer stick and a smaller weight; system 2 has a longer stick and a larger weight; system 3 has a shorter stick and a smaller weight; and system 4 has a shorter stick and a larger weight. In this laboratory, natural frequencies are estimated from free vibration tests. Then, dynamic amplifications are evaluated from forced vibration tests. In the forced vibration tests, the earthquake simulator is used to generate harmonic excitations at various frequencies. Experimentally evaluated vibration characteristics are compared with the vibration theories to validate mathematical representations as well as to enhance students’ learning. Outreach activities at the Johns Hopkins University include Engineering Innovation Day for high school students. The program provides a short seminar and hands-on experience in building design for earthquake loading. The earthquake simulator is used to show experimental demonstration of dynamic structural response (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1077546311421946">Figure 7</xref>(b)).

<sec id="sec11-1077546311421946"><title>6. Conclusions</title>
<p>This paper presented a uniaxial earthquake simulator that was recently constructed at the Johns Hopkins University. The earthquake simulator is coupled with a flexible platform that facilitates development of actuator control designs to improve accuracy in shake table tests. The earthquake simulator was designed, machined, and fabricated on site. The flexible development platform was developed on an integrated control and data acquisition system using commercially available off-the-shelf products. The paper provided information necessary to build earthquake simulators and development platforms without proprietary components, covering construction details, system designs, and example applications of the earthquake simulator at the Johns Hopkins University. Example applications included the development of acceleration control strategy, proof-of-concept tests, and educational activities. This paper also demonstrated the versatility of the earthquake simulator and the development platform. The earthquake simulator is currently utilized for the development of acceleration trajectory tracking control. Furthermore, the use of the earthquake simulator will be extended to a development of substructure shake table test methods.</p>
