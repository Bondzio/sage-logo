<p>As you review this issue of <italic>JAPNA</italic>, you will notice that the topic of mentoring is addressed more than once. Indeed, as members of APNA you most probably have received several communications recently about mentoring both in the form of requests to volunteer to serve as a mentor, as well as encouragement to take advantage of the opportunity for mentoring currently being offered by APNA. Why all this recent attention on mentoring in our clinical specialty?</p>
<p>I believe there are several important reasons why psychiatric mental health nurses have taken up mentoring of junior colleagues as a priority. First and perhaps foremost, the shortage of psychiatric mental health nurses in the United States is a primary force driving our focus on recruitment and preparation of the next generation of psychiatric and mental health nurses (PMNHs). Using data from 2004 National Sample Survey of Registered Nurses (NSSRN), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1078390313499302">Hanrahan (2009)</xref> reported dire statistics about our PMHN workforce: (a) the average age of the PMHN population is 50.3 years; (b) using an estimate of 65 years for retirement, by 2018 approximately 50% of PMHNs will be retired; and (c) currently only 4.2% of our PMHN population is under 30 years of age. There is no question that we are facing a manpower crisis as fewer nurses are entering our specialty, and this crisis is occurring within the context of a dramatic increase in service needs. Current estimates suggest that The Patient Protect and Affordable Care Act, when fully implemented, will provide access to health care coverage for approximately 32 million people who currently are not covered and benefits will include treatment for mental health and substance use disorders at parity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1078390313499302">Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 2010</xref>). Together these facts suggest a very significant increase in service needs with a potentially very serious shortage of qualified PMHN providers.</p>
<p>Given these facts, there is no question that recruiting and preparing the next generation of PMHN providers and leaders is crucial. Although the concept of mentoring had been defined repeatedly in the literature, the definition of mentoring articulated by Holland stands out as extraordinary. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1078390313499302">Holland (2009)</xref> identified two distinct forms of mentoring described in the literature: (a) the functionalist approach and (b) the relational approach. Whereas the functionalist approach is grounded in a formal hierarchical relationship between the mentor and mentee and an emphasis on identified outcomes, the relational approach emphasizes dialogue, the value of both the mentor and mentees’ knowledge and creativity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1078390313499302">Kobeleva and Strongman (2010)</xref> describe mentoring as “a structured dialogue between a more knowledgeable party and a less knowledgeable subject that sets goals for positive attainment in a learning environment” (p. 7). Relational mentoring results in mutual benefit with insights and knowledge gained not only by the mentee but also by the mentor. Finally and perhaps most important, relational mentoring is generative, leading to the creation of new ideas that ultimately may advance the science and practice. Certainly from this view, involvement in a mentoring relationship is an exciting opportunity for interpersonal connection, personal growth, and creative generativity.</p>
<p>Why then has it been difficult to engage member of our specialty in mentoring relationships? In my role as editor of <italic>JAPNA</italic>, I have had multiple opportunities over the past 7 years to offer mentoring to junior authors. In each case, a manuscript was submitted to <italic>JAPNA</italic> that held promise but was not yet ready to move to press. Often the ideas put forth in the manuscript were new, exciting, and held potential for making a significant contribution to our field. But as is often the case, the ideas were not fully fleshed out, sufficient supporting evidence was not provided, and some wandering of ideas or problems with presentation style or format were also present. In these situations, senior colleagues served as reviewers and were excited about the work . . . AND offered to mentor the author to help bring the paper to publication. Each time this offer was made, I received no response from the author.</p>
<p>Offers for <italic>JAPNA</italic> author mentoring were not a unique situation. Opportunities for mentoring in grant writing were also offered by the APNA Research Council after APNF grant applications were reviewed. But again our junior colleagues were unable to take advantage of the opportunity.</p>
<p>Clearly there are many barriers that would make taking advantage of mentoring opportunities difficult. Indeed, time is a precious resource of which we all have far too little. Work demands, family pressures . . . innumerable competing demands. It is also possible that interaction with and feedback from a senior colleague is intimidating and this may be especially true when the senior colleague is unknown. In addition, the role of the mentee carries responsibilities including a commitment of time, openness to learning, and motivation to continue working hard to achieve the goal. And, of course, not all mentoring relationships are a success.</p>
<p>Yet despite the potential drawbacks, a mentor–mentee relationship offers a unique opportunity for personal growth and interpersonal connection. It provides the opportunity for reflective dialogue, exploration, and the creation of new ideas that otherwise may not emerge. It is an opportunity to develop a rewarding new relationship with a colleague who may become your collaborator and friend. And best of all, a mentoring relationship may well provide you with a unique opportunity to stretch yourself beyond your comfort zone . . . an opportunity for you to achieve what you are not yet able to imagine.</p>
<p>The APNA is working hard to provide opportunities for all members to be involved in a mentoring relationship. The <italic>Mentor Match</italic> program is an online mentor–mentee database that provides access to a list of APNA members with an interest in engaging in a mentoring relationship. The recently announced APNA Board of Directors Student Scholarship Program is an exciting new initiative designed to provide undergraduate and graduate nursing students who are interested in PMHN the opportunity to participate in organization activities and mentorship with an APNA member. In response to the letter to the editor that appears in this issue, the <italic>JAPNA</italic> Editorial Board is working to develop a student mentorship role on the Editorial Board. Opportunities for PMHN mentoring abound! The next time you are offered the chance to work with a mentor, I am hopeful that you will view it as an exciting opportunity and be ready to engage in what may well become an amazingly satisfying and enriching journey.</p>
