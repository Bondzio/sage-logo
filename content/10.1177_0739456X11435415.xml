<abstract>
<p>This article claims a place for nonhuman things in the worlds of planning theory and practice. Using a fragment from a dialogue between a group of planners and a developer, I explore how things—apartment buildings, site plans, scale models, and parking spaces—shape planning practice. My concern is the micropolitics of planning and the way in which people interact with objects to convey authority and commitment and to establish mutual understandings.</p>

<body>
<p>The world of planning is a world filled with office buildings and stop signs, cellular telephone towers and housing estates, sewers, train stations and airports, hydroelectric dams, and plazas. This is obvious, and would hardly come as a surprise to any practicing planner. Most planners spend their days thinking and talking about the things—buildings, structures, land forms, and infrastructures—that give the city physical presence.</p>
<p>In fact, the history of planning is replete with examples of the importance of such objects. Outdoor privies spurred housing reformers in the late nineteenth century. Skyscrapers and the spread of garment factories a few decades later motivated citizens in New York City to call for zoning regulations. Bombs and rubble led to reconstruction efforts in European cities after the Second World War, and suburban shopping malls in the 1960s and 1970s in the United States induced planners to worry about the visual clutter of commercial strips. In these and numerous other instances, planners acted in response to problems inseparable from physical objects. Their solutions, in turn, added new things to the world: playgrounds, greenbelts, office plazas, bike lanes, and retention ponds.</p>
<p>This talk and this history are ignored by most planning theorists. They spin their theoretical webs without ensnaring the physical objects that make planning both necessary and useful. The things that are planned, the tools that are deployed, and the spaces of practice are of little theoretical interest. Rather, planning theorists privilege human actors. Their objective is to explain how planners might change the world and, because planning is inherently prescriptive, change it for the better. But, for theorists then to ignore much of that world seems irresponsible. By omitting the material world from their theories (i.e., by treating it as contextual or epiphenomenal and thus causally irrelevant), planning theorists neglect the important role that things play in mediating the social interactions without which planning itself could not exist. Consequently, the planning practices that they propose, whether they center on negotiation, analysis, or community organizing, are incomplete.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0739456X11435415">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>The purpose of this article is to begin to rectify this shortcoming. My goal is to convince the reader that nonhuman things matter. In doing so, I privilege planning deliberations, what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0739456X11435415">Forester (1999</xref>, x) has labeled the micropolitics of practice. Grounding the argument is a “typical” planning event in which a group of planners and a developer and his consultants negotiate the composition of a proposed apartment complex. My interpretation of the event focuses on how the presence or absence of nonhuman things affects the content of deliberations, each participant’s perception of the others’ commitments, and their mutual understanding of the project. Without substantive deliberations, commitment, and shared perspectives, acting together is near impossible. In such situations, planning deliberations are, at best, unproductive and, at worst, an impediment to future collaborations.</p>
<sec id="section1-0739456X11435415">
<title>A Lost World</title>
<p>In the practice realm of planning theorists, humans are the only meaningful actors. Businesses, organizations, social groups, and government agencies contend with and contribute to decentralization, predatory lending, blight, sprawl, and traffic congestion. Planners engage these actors to create sustainable environments, walkable cities, congestion-free roadways, and affordable housing. The purpose of theory is to understand how planners interact with nonplanners to do so. Only human actors matter.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0739456X11435415">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>And yet, things are not wholly absent from the writings of planning theorists. Theorists situate planners in actual settings, comment on the things being planned, and reflect on planning’s consequences. In explaining the intricacies of persuasive argumentation, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0739456X11435415">Throgmorton (2000)</xref> sets his readers first in Iowa City (Iowa) and then in citizen forums and the chambers of the city council. There, we hear about a water treatment plant, a neighborhood creek, a 41-unit housing project, and business firms. To convey to his readers what planners do, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0739456X11435415">Hoch (1996)</xref> not only locates them in specific places but also surrounds them with the things of planning. His story of Jorge Cruz begins with Cruz relating why he quit his previous position, a tale that pivots on a meeting in the city manager’s office, construction documents, and a poorly built City Hall. Cruz’s subsequent job entails holding discussions in the Mayor’s chambers, making presentations to residents in community halls, and referring to apartment buildings, parking spaces, and streets. Planning takes place in “real time and space,” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0739456X11435415">Forester (2009</xref>, 29) has written; acknowledging this, planning theorists set practice in a material world.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0739456X11435415">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Places and things also enter planning theories when theorists focus on planning’s consequences. For just city and right-to-the-city theorists (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0739456X11435415">Fainstein 2010</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0739456X11435415">Marcuse 2009</xref>, respectively), these consequences include social housing, public transit, inclusive public spaces, mixed land uses, and unpolluted rivers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0739456X11435415">Fainstein 1997</xref>) along with transit-oriented development, compact cities, and racially integrated and income-integrated neighborhoods. These are the desired outcomes of progressive state interventions and populist social movements and comprise the “just city,” a place where equity, diversity, and democracy reign. And while the latter qualities are not physical things, they can only be realized, these theorists argue, through affordable housing, mixed land uses, public transit, and other physical objects and conditions. In short, along with other planning theorists, they use places and things to give a sense of reality to their reflections on practice and to connect to a world they find unjust and intolerable.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0739456X11435415">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>The physical world is thereby acknowledged by planning theorists, but then cast as a mere consequence of social action. Spaces and things passively await manipulation. In rational model approaches to planning practice, the physical world is relevant only because it is the object of planning expertise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0739456X11435415">Black 1990</xref>). Planners know how housing markets work, how to enliven spaces with activities, and where light-rail lines will be most effective. Whether the object of planning is affordable housing, a downtown plaza, wetlands, or an industrial park, though, has little effect on how analysis is done or plans produced. Communicative action theorists are equally blind to places and things. They focus on how people come together to negotiate understandings, with planners often serving as mediators of specific planning events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0739456X11435415">Forester 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0739456X11435415">Innes and Booher 2004</xref>). The emphasis is on shared experiences, honest communication, respectful listening, and the search for mutually beneficial actions. People might speak of dangerous intersections or shadow-casting office buildings, but the mention of things has no theoretical weight. Marxist political-economists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0739456X11435415">Fainstein and Fainstein 1979</xref>) and their descendents, the just city and right-to-the-city theorists, treat spaces and things as the outcomes of the actions of capitalists and planners, the consequences of just or unjust relationships, but not objects to be theorized. For planning theorists, the material world has no theoretical value.</p>
<p>Within planning theory, then, humans are given ontological status and nonhumans are denied it. Nonhuman things from a city to a light-rail line are passive, material objects to be molded through regulations, negotiations, informal agreements, and incentives or, in the case of just-city theorists, macropolitics. They are epiphenomena. Only humans are actors and, consequently, only humans have theoretical significance.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0739456X11435415">5</xref></sup></p>

<title>A Planning Event</title>
<p>To redress this blind spot in planning theory, I offer an interpretation of a typical planning event that illustrates the role of nonhuman things in planning practice.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0739456X11435415">6</xref></sup> The specific example I have selected focuses on the micropolitics of planning and comes from the writings of John Forester, arguably one of our major planning theorists and an avid collector of planning stories. The event is a “project review negotiation” between a team of local planners and a developer who is proposing to build 180 units of middle-income housing in an unnamed U.S. city. The developer has brought his architect and real estate lawyer to the meeting in the offices of the city’s planning department.</p>
<p>Consider this edited excerpt from the transcript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0739456X11435415">Forester 1996</xref>, 244):</p>
<speech>
<speaker>CHRIS (architect):</speaker>
<p>We have three buildings here, at five, eight, and twelve stories, set back [he explains as he points to the pictorials and a site plan], with an oasis here. . . . These buildings allow entrance from Broad Street and let us put the parking below the buildings . . . To allow the 180 units, we have the twelve-story tower, which allowed us to maximize the greenery around it. The twelve stories then becomes an issue, so we’ve done some photo studies. [He shows a view of the proposed project from the major intersection at the corner of the site.]</p>

<speaker>TIM (planner):</speaker>
<p>Is that taken from Broad Street?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>JAN (planner):</speaker>
<p>No, from Commons Avenue.</p>

<speaker>BARBARA (planner) [pointing]:</speaker>
<p>Is this the Burger King?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>CHRIS (architect):</speaker>
<p>No, here [pointing].</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>BARBARA (planner):</speaker>
<p>I see—so the playground is over here [pointing over the plans]?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>CHRIS (architect):</speaker>
<p>Yes [Showing the approach to the project on the model]. We tried to get a picture from here [pointing] too.</p>
</speech>
<p>The transcript goes on in a similar vein with the developer and his architect presenting the proposed scheme, the planners commenting, and the participants jointly exploring various ways of achieving an acceptable site plan. The planners make it clear that they are interested in making the street a desirable pedestrian space that conveys an “urban” rather than “suburban” feel. Their attitude is prescriptive, underpinned (we might imagine) by a sense of what a good city should be. No resolution is achieved, however, and at the end of the meeting Tim, the lead planner, encourages the developer’s team to pursue additional alternative site designs and massing studies.</p>
<p>Forester interprets this situation in terms of his interest in planning as a series of practical assessments made in fluid social settings. He is concerned with how planners’ judgments are anticipatory (i.e., look toward the future) and how talk is used to shape attention, formulate arguments, and negotiate as well as build workable relationships. The planners are both searching for a resolution and learning what actions are feasible. Moreover, “their talk is not just ‘mere talk,’” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0739456X11435415">Forester (1996</xref>, 249) writes, “but action for which they are responsible.”</p>
<p>What Forester mentions but does not discuss are the nonhuman things without which this planning event would not have happened. Because the material world is considered epiphenomenal—that is, subject solely to the actions of humans—things are not theorized as part of how planners behave. What if, though, we re-interpreted this planning event, paying greater attention to the role of things in the interactions between the developer’s team and the planners? What could we learn about planning practice by giving nonhuman things theoretical status?</p>
<p>Three planning tools were identified in the excerpt from Forester’s transcript: a site plan, a three-dimensional model, and photographs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0739456X11435415">7</xref></sup> Without these things in the meeting room, the discussion that took place would not have occurred. Another discussion, with a likely different outcome, would have taken its place. And a different relationship would have been established between the planners and the developer’s team. Among other consequences, things focus deliberations.</p>
<p>Without the site plan, the planners would have been unable to visualize and thus fully understand the relationship of the buildings to the street, the “suburban” feel of the proposed site, or the relationship of the site’s access points to the surrounding roads. Without the three-dimensional model, discussions of height, massing, and the spatial relationship among the three residential buildings would have lacked clarity. For example, when the planner Barbara asked about the relationship of the site to the adjacent playground and Burger King, her concerns would have been less obvious to others. Doing so questioned the representational validity of the model and the site plan. The site, a thing no longer obvious or unmediated, was now being contested.</p>
<p>Absent these objects, the discussion would have proceeded with greater uncertainty. Talk would have been highly speculative, with each participant unsure as to the references made by others. For the planners, the lack of these two nonhuman things would have made planning terminology less useful and thereby undermined their expertise. Terms like set-back, visual buffer, plaza, density, and parcel are more compelling and more useful when accompanied by material representations. The things reinforce the words.</p>
<p>From the developer’s perspective, the site plan and model are crucial for conveying commitment. They represent incurred costs that signal the developer’s intent to do the project. They are also a measure of the friction involved in making changes to the proposal. Throughout the transcript, Don, the developer, refers to banks and his financing. He notes that changes at this stage would be difficult and would jeopardize financial agreements he has worked hard to obtain. Delay breeds delay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0739456X11435415">Pressman and Wildavsky 1973</xref>, 87-124) and to go back to his investors and renegotiate the contracts would threaten prior arrangements. The developer signals this to the planners with the site plan and the model. These alliances between people and things are the material indications of his commitment. At the same time, they silently reinforce his resistance to major modifications. The planners implicitly recognize this. Without these things, the developer’s interest in doing the project would be less convincing.</p>
<p>The photographs join the site plan and the three-dimensional model to enable the discussion, but they also do something even more important. Photographs allow the “place” to be brought into the conference room by adding a level of realism to the other two objects.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0739456X11435415">8</xref></sup> A photograph contains details that a site plan or scale model often lacks and provides glimpses of off-site conditions that they often exclude. Everyone now shares the same visualization of the site, even though each might interpret the photographs differently. Without the photographs, the detailed discussion that each participant expected to occur would have been less easy and less likely. The planners, of course, could, and probably did, visit the site, but this is not the same as viewing these representations in the presence of the developer and the architect.</p>
<p>Of course, an alternative to the photographs would have been to hold the meeting on-site; that is, in a different place. This, however, has two undesirable consequences from the planners’ perspective. First, it weakens their technical comments by confronting codified planning ideas with the site’s particularities. Planning knowledge is formulated so as to apply to multiple instances and to allow routine (i.e., bureaucratic) rather than discretionary decisions to be made. Like “state” knowledge in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0739456X11435415">Scott 1998</xref>, 53-83), it is simplified and standardized, and the role of the planner is to interpret standardized knowledge in specific situations. Doing so, however, is fraught with uncertainties. Thus, it is useful to begin with a model and a site plan, both standardized in form and stripped of the bothersome particularities of the actual site.</p>
<p>Adjusting such knowledge to an actual place and an actual project is always a matter of judgment and, thus, discretion. Awareness of that discretion by nonplanners puts standardized, planning knowledge into question and weakens planners’ arguments. At some point in the review process, site specifics have to be addressed, but they are best addressed later in the deliberations so that planners can first establish the legitimacy of their technical position.</p>
<p>Holding the meeting on-site has a second consequence; it moves the negotiations outside the planning department’s offices. Being in the planning conference room conveys the formality of the occasion and the importance of the municipality in the development process. It reminds the developer that his project depends on permissions from the government. In addition, this is a professional venue where offensive language, threats, and frivolous talk are inappropriate. Here, planners must behave like planners, developers like developers, and architects like architects. In a confined space, moreover, confrontation is muted. Conflict within meeting rooms often results in people leaving the room, for they need to relieve the social pressure that the room imposes on them. The site is the developer’s venue and confers legitimacy on him and his experts; the planners’ office is where planning authority reigns.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0739456X11435415">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Consider the presence and absence of things in the second sense—things as the objects being planned. In this case, the objects are the apartment buildings, parking garages, plazas, parking lots, street walls, driveways, and turnarounds. What might happen if these things were transformed or even eliminated?</p>
<p>At one point during the meeting, when Don, the developer, was becoming frustrated with the suggestion that more work was needed on the site plan and concerned about his financial commitments, he commented: “I have limited time; I’ll lose the project and you’ll lose 180 units [of housing].” Now this captures well, even if elliptically, the central theme of the relationship between him and the planners. Don makes money by building housing while the planners’ goals are to meet the needs of an expanding population and improve the city’s property tax base. These goals can only be met when housing is built and built in the correct—planned—way. Things—180 housing units—are the glue that holds the relationship together. If the 180 units are subtracted, this planning event evaporates. Without the 180 units, there is no meeting. While Don’s threat is serious, then, it also needs to be discounted. The planners know that Don is unlikely to walk away from a project on which he has, as he states more than once, obtained financing, hired an architect and a lawyer, and paid for photographs, a site plan, and a three-dimensional model. The developer is already too connected to the “world” of this project to easily withdraw. Doing so would unravel an alliance in which he has made a significant investment and anger or alienate his many partners from banks to consultants.</p>
<p>When Don made the threat, he “broke the frame” of the conference room; he strayed from the civility and formality that such a space represents. In fact, Don comes across in the transcript as emotionally as well as financially committed to the project, an observation that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0739456X11435415">Forester (1999</xref>, 201-20) uses to note the importance of passions in planning deliberations.</p>
<p>Prior to his threat, Don had mentioned that he had tried to buy two adjacent parcels which would have enabled him to develop the site more in conformance with the planning guidelines. If he had purchased those parcels and directed his architect accordingly, this whole meeting would have been different in tone and intent. The thing—the site—would have been more appropriate for the program and the planners would have had less leverage over the project and less of a basis on which to negotiate. Moreover, the balance of influence within the meeting would have shifted from the planners to the developer.</p>
<p>As a final example of the meaningfulness of things in these deliberations, toward the end of the meeting Walt, one of the planners, comments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0739456X11435415">Forester 1996</xref>, 245): “Well, this is complicated. We’d like to see more options; I can see twenty-five footprints [of the buildings] that might work here. We want to see more ideas.” Walt wants more site plans and models—more objects. He also wants more options, which expanding the number of things will probably provide. In complex situations where no one knows in advance the solution with which they will be comfortable, more options are highly valued. Additional options hold out the promise of a missed opportunity and thus a heretofore unrecognized solution.</p>
<p>More options, though, will cost the developer time and money, threaten his financial arrangements by delaying the project, and cause him to reconsider his commitment. His alliances are fragile. Asking for more options is also a not-so-subtle rejection of the current site plan and thus of the developer’s idea and the architect’s work. It risks weakening trust between the two parties. “We have concerns, but let’s work with this site plan” would have been a much different statement, allowing the developer and the architect to feel that they had made progress and sense a solution, thereby enabling negotiations to continue amicably. The point is that the consequences of these statements are inseparable from the things to which they refer.</p>

<title>Lessons for Practice</title>
<p>This example demonstrates, I believe, the importance of things—and of setting—to the deliberations of planners. Things are participants of sorts, and they carry with them information, arguments, and commitments that shape talk and action. They empower and they disempower, as when a photograph enables planners to comment on site externalities, when a bank commitment letter makes planners more aggressive in asking for concessions or, to shift the setting, when archaeologists discover antiquities on a planned tourist site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0739456X11435415">Forester 1999</xref>, 68). In the absence of things, there is silence. And, as things are modified—for example, the site expanded when new land is purchased—the deliberations are transformed.</p>
<p>From this, we can draw lessons for planning practice. The first has to do with the tools that planners, developers, and architects use to enact their roles. What objects should be brought to a meeting? What qualities should these objects have? Should they be more or less detailed, more evocative (such as photographs), or more open to interpretation (such as a diagram)? In what spaces should meetings be held? The answers to these questions will depend on the relationship between the planners and those with whom they are deliberating as well as the stage of the deliberations. Stronger relationships and later stages can tolerate more substance and detail. In fact, any relationship becomes more defined as more things—humans and nonhumans—and more substance and detail are entered into it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0739456X11435415">Forester 2009</xref>, 183-84). Commitment solidifies through the connections that people establish with each other and with the things that define the planning event. This is what it means to form the alliances without which planners would be ineffective.</p>
<p>Second, the quality of planning deliberations is a function of the things entered into them. A planning discussion without physical representations of the objects being planned—that is, without visual images, a copy of the report, a zoning map—is going to be abstract and general. Without things to point to and collectively peruse, the conversation loses specificity and precision. Planning talk is about things that can only partially be represented with the spoken word. Words need help. Triangulating among talk, things, and mutual understandings is what makes planning deliberation fruitful. If deliberations are to be appropriately substantive, physical objects need to be present.</p>
<p>Such objects also “make present the possibilities that are not there yet.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0739456X11435415">10</xref></sup> They bring the future into the room as well as into the deliberations. This is central to what it means to plan—to imagine the future and find ways to achieve it. Scale models, drawings, plans, and montages do not just “stand in” for a reality, they extend the present of the meeting forward.</p>
<p>Third, changes in the objects being planned transform relationships among the actors. Planning negotiations are about the material world. As the material world evolves, the actions that make sense need to be recalibrated. Much planning deliberation, in fact, is about the malleability of the physical world and, specifically, about using that malleability to enable private gains while capturing public benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0739456X11435415">Hommels 2008</xref>, 21-37). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0739456X11435415">Hoch (1992</xref>, 209-10), for example, tells two stories: one of a planner faced with a building foundation that was built prematurely in violation of the city’s zoning code and second about a planner engaged in adjusting the set-back of a building. To be effective, these planners had to engage with the social and material malleability of things. They had to learn how to use such malleability to shape deliberations and, correspondingly, learn how to adapt when things changed. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0739456X11435415">Schon (1982)</xref> relates another telling instance. It involved a planner and a developer jointly negotiating the site coverage, number of apartment units, size of a landscaped area, and amount of parking in order to develop a plan that could be approved by the Zoning Board of Appeals. In this instance, planning was nothing but manipulating things. As a general rule, malleability expands options and enables more relationships to form; obduracy reduces options and constricts relationships. Moreover, the joint reshaping of things reflects the level of trust in a relationship as well as the confidence that participants have in each other and in their evolving positions.</p>
<p>As a fourth and final lesson, planners need to heed the way in which things affect the authority of those participating in deliberations. Things can enhance credibility and project knowledge. Bringing reports to the meeting, even if just placed discretely on the conference table, having diplomas or awards on the office walls, and sitting behind an impressive desk are all signs of technical or political authority. And although a flawed “hand-out” can erode credibility, this possibility does not negate the potential authority of things and thus their usefulness to planning.</p>

<title>Final Comment</title>
<p>In ending, I want to return to the claim I used to justify this article. The justification was that planning theories have given little—actually, no—theoretical attention to nonhuman things. This general claim concerning the failures and ignorance of others appears frequently in the social science literature and I normally avoid it. It falsely equates the lack of attention with the quality of the issue. Most often, it mainly points to—unintended I presume—the limits of the author’s reading and thus knowledge, or to an unseemly need for a “straw man.” Hence, we might consider the possibility that planning theorists are correct to ignore things. Maybe nonhumans are epiphenomenal and of no theoretical relevance. And maybe planning is a social mechanism independent of its objects—a universal tool. I find it difficult—impossible in fact—to accept that things have no practical significance and that planning practice can take place in an abstract world. I can only conclude that a theory of planning practice has to theorize the objects that populate it and the places in which it occurs. In a world filled with things, there is no other way to act.</p>

<sec id="section5-0739456X11435415">
<title>Postscript: Toward a Theory of Worldly Action</title>
<p>The above argument emerged from a theoretical project whose initial and vague goal was to bring the physical world into planning and strip it of its epiphenomenal status. I believe that it can be understood and found useful without attending to its theoretical origins. Some readers, though, might wish to know the thinking (and the literature) on which the argument is based. For them, there is this postscript.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0739456X11435415">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Planning theory, I argue, must be about humans and things and, more specifically, about how planners engage with the things and places that make up the world. This need to engage engenders a corresponding obligation to attend to action. Planning theory, then, must be a theory of (collective) action. Simply to imagine a new waterfront park, more units of affordable housing, or the just city leaves the act of planning unfulfilled. The purpose of planning is to realize these conditions, not simply to propose them. For this reason, action is at the center of planning theory—not the planning process, not analytical procedures, not communicative encounters, and not ideological positions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0739456X11435415">Friedmann and Hudson (1974</xref>, 2) many years ago claimed that “planning is . . . located precisely at the interface between knowledge and action.” My position is slightly different: the point of practice is to engage in collective action; consequently, the prime object of planning theory must be action itself, with ideas only one means to this end.</p>
<p>To think in terms of action means thinking of planning practice as situated; that is, always embedded in specific, historically conditioned places and surrounded by the objects that constitute those places. For this to happen, theorists need to recognize the influence that places and things have on practice and the extent to which they are not just topics of conversations but actual participants in deliberations; that is, actors of sorts. Theory must probe deeply into the meaning of action and explore how talk, action, and things are mutually constitutive. Consider the broad outlines of one such approach.</p>
<p>Action has three qualities pertinent to planning: intentionality, reflexivity, and accountability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0739456X11435415">Giddens 1982</xref>, 28-32).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0739456X11435415">12</xref></sup> For practitioners, action is purposive, involves learning from experience, and entails giving reasons to others for why specific actions are being proposed or taken and others not. Actions that are unintentional, unreflective, and unaccountable fall outside the definitional realm of planning. Unreasoned behavior violates planning’s inherent instrumentality and promise of rationality. Consequently, thoughtless and instinctual actions, along with emotions, are untheorized by most planning theorists.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0739456X11435415">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Within planning practice, action cannot occur without deliberation. Planning action is always relational; it is always a matter of working with others. Talk and deliberation are how planners learn about the world, share knowledge, exert authority, organize attention, and establish commitments. For these reasons, “what gets done depends heavily on what gets said” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0739456X11435415">Forester 1989</xref>, 23). Thus the importance of talk. Planners must converse among themselves and with others before acting together. This is particularly the case if they wish to do so intentionally and with accountability.</p>
<p>A theory of action must also attend to the inherently prescriptive nature of planning. This includes not just the morality central to public deliberation—its inclusiveness, openness to different types of knowledge, presumption of mutual respect, and sensitivity to emotions—but also to the morality embodied in the actions and consequences being deliberated. Talk about marginalizing others or taking from those with few resources to enhance those with many is as morally unacceptable as a discussion of housing policy that excludes its affordability and accessibility to those with limited financial means. To make the world better, practice has to attend to its values.</p>
<p>Planning talk, moreover, is almost always about some thing. It is talk about shopping malls, traffic diverters, green markets, and storm barriers. It is also talk accompanied by maps and documents. Without talk, planners would stop acting. “[W]ithout things, [planners] would stop talking” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0739456X11435415">Daston 2004</xref>, 9). All human action is action facilitated and mediated by tools, from cell phones to laser pointers. Objects affect how deliberations unfold and do so through their social connections, political connotations, and emotional resonances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0739456X11435415">Winner 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0739456X11435415">Joerges 1999</xref>). Things embody social relations, even substitute for them, and appear to us encased in meanings that need to be interpreted. They are “a crucial part of the performance of subjects” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0739456X11435415">Thrift 1996</xref>, 41). Without them, planning would be impossible.</p>
<p>Things directly enter planning in one of two ways: either as objects being planned or as objects being used to plan. In the first category we find parking garages, exit-ramps, school buildings, retail malls, wetlands, housing units, and bus rapid-transit stops. Zoning officials take responsibility for the height and bulk of buildings, transportation planners for the spacing of buses, environmental planners for soil quality, housing planners for dwelling units, and economic development planners for new office buildings. In each instance, the object of planning is a thing. In the second category we find maps, telephones, conference room tables, pens, three-dimensional models, GIS software, planning documents, and presentation screens. There, also, are the shelves where planning reports go to die, never to be implemented, at least according to a cliché heard often in U.S. planning circles. For planners to be planners, they need the tools of their profession. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0739456X11435415">Callon (2002</xref>, 214) notes, “the agent who [acts] is not the human being, but the human being equipped with tools.”</p>
<p>What constitutes a thing, within planning and without, is, of course, neither obvious nor consensual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0739456X11435415">Jubien 2001</xref>). Not all places and things are relevant to planning and, of those, not all of their qualities are pertinent to the task. Things—soil erosion, traffic congestion, an illegal billboard—need to be observed, named, and brought into planning discourse. Doing so makes certain qualities (e.g., size, location) the subject of measurement and deliberation, leaving other qualities (e.g., color) irrelevant. Attention needs to be paid to how one thing (e.g., a landfill) differs from another (e.g., an illegal dump), the functions things serve, and how things came to be (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0739456X11435415">Bibby and Shepherd 2000</xref>, 583-84). The last is particularly important given the constant change experienced by places and things. An ever-present slippage exists between our representations of things and their current state, a problem particularly apparent in historic preservation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0739456X11435415">Tait and While 2009</xref>). A thing is “a contested gathering of many conflicting” claims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0739456X11435415">Latour and Yaneva 2008</xref>, 86).</p>
<p>Places are also things. They are material objects invested with history, social meanings, and resources. Action occurs, and can only occur, in a place. Because buildings and cities inevitably contribute to “the meaning of speech that unfolds within them” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0739456X11435415">Mitchell 2005</xref>, 4), it matters where something happens. A planner strolling the canals of Amsterdam is just a tourist, but in her office at City Hall, she is an authority. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0739456X11435415">Gieryn (2006</xref>, 21) reminds us: “place is normative: certain behavior patterns and dispositions are expected from people in part because of where they happen to be.” Similarly, a thing out of place—a zoning map as wall decoration in the municipal cafeteria—no longer resonates with the meanings it has if located in its “proper” place (e.g., at a planning commission meeting).</p>
<p>Most important for a theory that embeds action in the material world is the possibility that things enter into planning as actors having influence, not just as passive objects. At issue is the ontological status of nonhumans. Can they be—are they—more than mere things? <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0739456X11435415">Latour (2005</xref>, 63-78) offers a compelling way to think about this. He claims that things are actors to the extent that they transform relationships among the people and things with which they are connected. Consider the soil at a former manufacturing site “resisting” remediation, directional signs “diverting” traffic patterns, and a defective levee “destroying” a neighborhood. This insight points to how social responsibilities are divided among people and things as, for example, when our civic duty to provide housing for the less fortunate is shared with homeless shelters.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0739456X11435415">14</xref></sup> Of course, this does not mean that nonhuman things have the qualities—intentionality, reflectivity, accountability—that we associate with human actors. It does, though, infuse things with the theoretical value that they have rightfully earned.</p>
<p>Places and things also play a central role in the relationships that planners establish among themselves and with others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0739456X11435415">Harman 2009</xref>, 19-20). For planners to act with authority and certainty, they must create alliances, and to create alliances they must gather people and objects to them. By enrolling people and things in their projects, planners become influential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0739456X11435415">Callon and Latour 1981</xref>). Take, for example, a planner working in a planning agency of a medium-size city and lacking an office that provides for private conversations, a conference table on which to pore over maps, access to the government’s databases and communication system, a vehicle to take planning commissioners to view the site conditions for a proposed hotel, and friendly relations with clerical personnel. This planner has no alliances. As a result, she has little, if no, authority and no influence. Only having gathered around her these things and people, and then stabilized these relationships, will she be able to plan effectively.</p>
<p>The stability of alliances, though, is always problematic. Trust must be maintained, relationships nurtured, and commitments constantly reaffirmed. No future can be pursued absent durable networks. Energy must be expended to reproduce alliances and replace relations that have irretrievably decayed. If, for example, a storm destroys much of the city, how the planning department relates to other government agencies will have to change, the substance of planning deliberations be refocused, and the usual role of the department reevaluated. Existing relationships will be destabilized, and the planners’ current influence eroded. Or, consider what likely happened when computers replaced drafting tables in planning agencies and the embedded software of mapping was substituted for the manual manipulation of paper. The mapping process became less visible and less public. The locus of knowledge and authority shifted inside a machine and to the technicians who understand the code. This widened the gap between the knowledge of the technical staff and their nontechnical supervisors. Moreover, it reduced the ability of supervisors to “know” how maps were created, thus conferring greater autonomy and power on the GIS staff. New alliances were formed.</p>
<p>Things matter in how we relate to others. When they change, our relationships are altered. Consequently, a planning theory that omits most of the world—that leaves out nonhuman things—misrepresents planning practice while severely limiting the ability of planners to act effectively and with influence.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0739456X11435415">15</xref></sup></p>
