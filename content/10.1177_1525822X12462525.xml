      <abstract>
        <p>This article examines the use of probing techniques in web surveys to identify validity
          problems of items. Conventional cognitive interviewing is usually based on small sample
          sizes and thus precludes quantifying the findings in a meaningful way or testing small or
          special subpopulations characterized by their response behavior. This article investigates
          probing in web surveys as a supplementary way to look at item validity. Data come from a
          web survey in which respondents were asked to give reasons for selecting a response
          category for a closed question. The web study was conducted in Germany, with respondents
          drawn from online panels (<italic>n</italic> = 1,023). The usefulness of the proposed
          approach is shown by revealing validity problems with a gender ideology item.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>In this article, we explore a new method to implement cognitive interviewing techniques,
        namely probing in web surveys with respondents drawn from online panels, to assess item
        validity. We focus on testing the applicability of the method by addressing hypotheses on
        the functioning of gender ideology items. Although we concentrate on the validity assessment
        of existing items, the method could equally be implemented at the pretesting stage.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="section2-1525822X12462525">
      <title>Theoretical Background</title>
      <p>Establishing validity of indicators is a necessary prerequisite of any substantive
        analysis. Otherwise, methodological artifacts might be interpreted as substantive results.
        To solve these problems, several data analytic approaches have been proposed for assessing
        measurement quality, such as correspondence analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, and
        multitrait-multimethod studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1525822X12462525">Blasius
          and Thiessen 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1525822X12462525">Saris and
          Gallhofer 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1525822X12462525">Vandenberg and
          Lance 2000</xref>). Although the application of data analytic procedures is often an
        appropriate means for detecting problems in items and item batteries, they lack the power to
        explain the causes of these problems. Knowledge of these causes, however, could be used to
        improve questions for future use and to support substantive data analyses with existing
        data. With the dramatic increase of secondary analyses in the last decades, background
        information on interpretation patterns or interpretation differences for existing data is
        especially needed in the social sciences.</p>
      <p>A possible solution for detecting methodological artifacts and their causes is to use
        cognitive interviewing techniques. These techniques are used to reveal cognitive processes
        in survey responding as well as unintended item interpretation. There are two major
        cognitive interviewing techniques used in survey research, namely the
          <italic>think-aloud</italic> technique, in which respondents verbalize their thoughts
        while they answer survey questions, and the <italic>probing</italic> technique, in which
        interviewers ask follow-up questions to obtain more specific information relevant to a
        specific item (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1525822X12462525">Beatty and Willis
          2007</xref>).</p>
      <p>Among the various probing types, “category-selection probing” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1525822X12462525">Prüfer and Rexroth 2005</xref>) is a particularly
        appropriate means to assess validity. In category-selection probing, respondents are asked
        why they selected a certain answer category for a closed question. Category-selection
        probing can be used to analyze different interpretation patterns among respondents. In
        particular, “silent misinterpretations” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1525822X12462525">DeMaio and Rothgeb 1996</xref>) can be detected, that is, when respondents seemingly do
        not have problems with the interpretation of an item but actually misinterpret its meaning
        in an unintended way. On the negative side, it has to be acknowledged that respondents may
        have problems answering “why” questions appropriately if, for example, the basis for their
        attitudes is not accessible to them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1525822X12462525">Willis 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1525822X12462525">Wilson et al.
          1996</xref>).</p>
      <p>Cognitive interviewing techniques are typically used in cognitive interviews that are part
        of the pretesting process prior to an actual survey but they can also be applied within or
        after a survey. In the following, we describe the conventional implementation of cognitive
        interviewing techniques. Based on this, we propose a supplemental approach to implement
        cognitive interviewing techniques.</p>
      <sec id="section3-1525822X12462525">
        <title>The Conventional Implementation of Cognitive Interviewing Techniques</title>
        <p>Cognitive interviewing techniques are mainly used in cognitive interviews (see reports at
          National Center for Health Statistics 2011). Despite the uncontested value of cognitive
          interviews, there are some limitations regarding their implementation.</p>
        <p>First, cognitive interviews are mainly used to detect bad items and improve a
          questionnaire. That is, they are mainly used as a pretesting device and not as part of a
          post-survey assessment. Second, cognitive interviews are often conducted in a lab. This
          leads to questioning whether results in the lab transfer to the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1525822X12462525">Willis and Schechter 1997</xref>). Third,
          cognitive interviewing is conducted by an interviewer. However, the more interviewers are
          supposed to play an active role in the sense of proactively investigating hidden
          comprehension problems, the lower the comparability of the results obtained by different
          interviewers might be (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1525822X12462525">Conrad and Blair
            2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1525822X12462525">2009</xref>). Fourth,
          cognitive interviewing is traditionally based on small quota samples of 5–15 interviews
            (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1525822X12462525">Willis 2005</xref>), a fact that is
          challenged, for example, by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1525822X12462525">Blair et
            al. (2006</xref>). Although even few interviews can help detect major problems with
          items (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1525822X12462525">Beatty and Willis 2007</xref>),
          low case numbers do not allow quantifying the findings in a meaningful way, assessing the
          prevalence of problems, or unraveling interpretation patterns of special subpopulations
          characterized by their response behavior. Small sample size is possibly the major
          limitation of traditional cognitive interviewing.</p>
        <p>To obtain more generalizable results or information on rare cases, respondent debriefing
          is occasionally used as a supplemental testing method. This includes follow-up probes with
          all or a sample of respondents after completion of a pilot survey interview (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1525822X12462525">DeMaio and Rothgeb 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1525822X12462525">Hess and Singer 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1525822X12462525">Nichols and Hunter Childs 2009</xref>). In
          a similar vein, random probes have been asked as part of the actual interview to allow
          assessment of item validity in the actual survey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1525822X12462525">Schuman 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1525822X12462525">Smith 1989</xref>).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="section4-1525822X12462525">
        <title>Supplemental Implementation of Cognitive Interviewing Techniques: Web Surveys</title>
        <p>Methods for analyzing cognitive processes do not have to be restricted to conventional
          cognitive interviewing or to respondent debriefing and random probes with (pilot) survey
          respondents. On the contrary, the methods could usefully be extended to probing in web
          surveys with respondents from online panels.</p>
        <p>Web surveys allow us to cost effectively survey a high number of cases. Thus, they pave
          the way for meaningful quantification of results and for tackling special or rare response
          combinations. They also guarantee standardization of probing and hence prevent potential
          interviewer effects. Research on open-ended questions on the web has started only
          recently, but first results are encouraging. Narrative open-ended questions in web surveys
          have been found to fare as well as or better than open-ended questions in paper-and-pencil
          self-administered surveys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1525822X12462525">Denscombe
            2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1525822X12462525">Holland and Christian
            2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1525822X12462525">Smyth et al.
            2009</xref>). Admittedly, open-ended questions on the web can also cause drop-out or
          item nonresponse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1525822X12462525">Galesic
          2006</xref>). In addition, the answer quality of these open-ended questions is affected by
          education, age, sex, or respondents’ interest in the topic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1525822X12462525">Denscombe 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1525822X12462525">Holland and Christian 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1525822X12462525">Oudejans and Christian 2010</xref>).</p>
        <p>With appropriate design and wording, as well as proper use of interactive features,
          however, the chances of obtaining meaningful answers can be enhanced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1525822X12462525">Dillman et al. 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1525822X12462525">Behr et al. (2012</xref>) have demonstrated
          this, particularly with regard to category-selection probing. Furthermore, web surveys
          provide respondents with time to answer, the possibility to elaborate or modify their
          statements, and anonymity of answers. The latter, of course, hinges on the level of trust
          that respondents have with surveying agencies or general data protection procedures. If
          respondents can be motivated to answer probing questions in the first place, probing in
          web surveys seems promising overall. Last but not least, web surveys are a suitable means
          to bring probing into the field context. Category-selection probing especially can fit
          perfectly into the normal process of responding, under the condition that respondents are
          not required to reiterate the same justification several times (i.e., the probed items
          should not be too similar). At the same time, the number of probes should remain
          restricted to prevent artificiality and reactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1525822X12462525">Oksenberg et al. 1991</xref>) and to keep response burden
          low. Web surveys could run during the development stage of a questionnaire to inform
          questionnaire design but equally alongside or after regular surveys to assess measurement
          error with actual survey items.</p>
        <p>Nowadays, online panels (i.e., pools of registered persons who have consented to
          regularly participate in web surveys) offer a convenient way to sample respondents for a
          web survey from a wider segment of the population. However, since almost all of these
          panels take a nonprobability approach in recruiting respondents, they should not be used
          to estimate general population values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1525822X12462525">Baker et al. 2010</xref>). In Germany, where this study was carried out, a
          probability-based panel is not yet available, which explains the focus on nonprobability
          panels in this article. If over- or underrepresentation of certain subgroups and related
          bias is adequately taken into account in the analyses of online panel survey data,
          academics and other researchers can still profit from using nonprobability online panels,
          especially with regard to exploratory studies and experiments.</p>
        <p>A good online panel with a sound quality assurance system excludes panelists who
          continually provide questionable data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1525822X12462525">Baker et al. 2010</xref>). Also, it provides information on data protection procedures
          and laws during the recruitment stage, which leads to a bond of trust between the panel
          provider and respondents. Despite this, uncertainties remain as to what extent respondents
          from a panel predominately dedicated to market research—the nonprobability panels usually
          belong to this segment—are willing to usefully answer social science items and, in
          particular, probes about these items. The panelists might satisfice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1525822X12462525">Krosnick 1999</xref>) by giving less elaborate answers,
          which eventually may be useless to the researcher, or by not answering at all. While <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1525822X12462525">Behr et al. (2012</xref>) demonstrate that
          online panelists are indeed willing to answer category-selection probes on social science
          items (roughly between 70% and 80% of panelists provided basic or more elaborate
          substantive answers across three category-selection probes), no assessment has yet been
          made as to whether the substantive answers given are sufficiently elaborate in order to
          answer research questions. </p>
        <p>In summary, probing in online panel web surveys seems to be a promising approach to
          assess item validity, especially when quantification of results or the tackling of
          specific response combinations is sought. However, uncertainties remain, particularly with
          regard to answer quality. This article, therefore, focuses on hypotheses on the
          functioning of gender ideology items and thereby puts the probe answers to the test.</p>

      <title>Validity Problems: The Case of Gender Ideology</title>
      <p>Gender ideology, that is, attitudes regarding the proper roles of men and women in family
        and working life, is a regularly investigated topic in social research. Frequently, it is
        measured with traditionally slanted items, that is, items that focus on traditional
        perspectives and that posit, for instance, that the primary responsibility of the woman
        should be the home and that of the man to earn a living. Although these items permit
        respondents to reject a traditional stance, they do not allow them to explicitly express an
        egalitarian view. This limited perspective has been criticized by social scientists and
        respondents alike.</p>
      <p>Against this backdrop, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1525822X12462525">Braun
          (2008</xref>) explored the use of egalitarian slanted items (i.e., those depicting a
        particular nontraditional role model) and investigated the difficulties involved in using
        these items as opposed to those with a traditional slant. Based on a multimode probing
        study, including conventional cognitive interviewing, probing in telephone surveys, and
        probing in web surveys mainly based on family-related discussion lists, he found that less
        traditional respondents, as measured through a traditional benchmark item, do not exhibit
        particularly strong agreement with egalitarian items that lay down specific egalitarian
        stances.</p>
      <p>Gender egalitarianism is obviously not simply the reverse of gender traditionalism.
        Instead, it includes very different stances, such as reaching gender equality or
        facilitating individual solutions for each couple. These different positions are connected
        with different responses to egalitarian slanted items such that the answers of
        nontraditional respondents are spread across the entire range of the respective answer
        scale. In addition, some traditional respondents have been found to agree with egalitarian
        items. For example, they simply ignore parts of an egalitarian item and focus their answers
        instead on what is compatible with their traditional view.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="section6-1525822X12462525">
      <title>Goals and Hypotheses</title>
      <p>We aim at replicating substantive findings from Braun’s multimode probing study (2008) in
        our web survey. A successful replication of results would speak in favor of using probes in
        web surveys. Our analysis focuses on respondents that have a
        particular—contradictory—response combination with two gender ideology items. For these

          (2008</xref>) identified several answer patterns among probe answers that were not
        intended by the researcher. We expect to replicate these patterns, under the condition that
        substantive answers given by the panelists are sufficiently elaborate and certain subgroups
        (such as traditional respondents or respondents with new emerging egalitarian stances) are
        sufficiently covered in online panels. The answer patterns we intend to replicate are:<list list-type="simple"><list-item><p><italic>Error pattern:</italic> Agreement with a
              traditionally slanted benchmark item combined with agreement to an egalitarian item
              runs counter to measurement goals. We posit that this contradiction can be explained
              by misunderstandings of (at least one of) the items (e.g., by a particular
              idiosyncratic reinterpretation of the egalitarian item by traditional respondents).
              Such responses can be categorized as being “wrong,” given the measurement intentions

              egalitarian stance is equally troubling at first sight. However, we suggest that this
              pattern can be explained by the emerging preference for individual solutions for each
              couple. Such responses cannot be regarded as being “wrong.” On the contrary, they
              might reflect a well-considered personal position: rejection of the traditional role

            all.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Middle response pattern:</italic> Respondents

              individual solution model for whom even a strict rejection of the traditional role

        <title>Data Source</title>
        <p>The data in this article come from two identical web surveys conducted in Germany in
          June/July 2010. Respondents for these surveys were drawn from two different online panels
          (around 500 cases were targeted in each panel). Quotas for the samples were based on
          region (eastern vs. western Germany), sex, age (18–30 years, 31–50 years, 51–70 years),
          and education (less than university entrance requirement vs. university entrance
          requirement). The commissioning of two different panels was part of a panel experiment
            (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1525822X12462525">Behr et al. 2012</xref>), but the
          experiment does not play a decisive role in the substantive analysis presented in this
          article. The data from the two web surveys were merged for the purposes of the
          analyses.</p>

        <title>Questionnaire</title>
        <p>The questionnaire covered the topics of gender, family, and immigrants. In total, it
          comprised 33 closed-ended questions and six probes per respondent. Among the closed items,
          this article focuses on 2 items from the gender and family block, namely
            <italic>egalitarian division</italic> (A man and a woman should share housekeeping
          chores and taking care of the children equally, so that both can combine work and family
          life) and <italic>role segregation</italic> (A man’s job is to earn money; a woman’s job
          is to look after the home and family). The latter is a traditionally slanted item from the
          International Social Survey Program (International Social Survey Programme [ISSP] 2002),
          which, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1525822X12462525">MacInnes
            (1998</xref>:243) “is not only a classic statement of male breadwinner ideology, but
          captures one of the essentials of a patriarchal sexual division of labour: that men are
          naturally suited to public activity and women to private nurturance.” As such, it can be
          regarded as a benchmark item.</p>
        <p>The role segregation item is widely used in the literature to represent gender role
          attitudes. The item egalitarian division avoids the traditional slant by presenting a
          nontraditional division of labor that nontraditional respondents do not have to reject to
          express their egalitarian stance. However, while on the surface this item might be a
          perfect operationalization of an egalitarian stance, it contains multiple stimuli that are
          likely to cause difficulties in interpretation, as will be seen below. Both items are
          measured on a 5-point scale (1 = <italic>strongly agree</italic>, 2 =
            <italic>agree</italic>, 3 = <italic>neither agree nor disagree</italic>, 4 =
            <italic>disagree</italic>, 5 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic>).</p>
        <p>With regard to the probes, this article focuses on the<italic> category-selection probe
          </italic>following the<italic> egalitarian division </italic>item. Respondents were asked,
          for example: “Please explain why you have chosen [answer value inserted].” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1525822X12462525">Behr et al. (2012</xref>) explain in detail

          probe and their impact on answer behavior.</p>

      <sec id="section10-1525822X12462525">
        <title>Coding Procedure</title>
        <p>The answers to the probing of the egalitarian division item were coded. The coding schema
          differentiated between nonsubstantive answers (such as “?,” “no answer,” “ccc,” “why not,”
          or “it simply is like that”), three substantive codes, and an “other” code. The
          substantive codes are as follows: (1) positive consequences for the children/joint
          responsibility in child-raising (e.g., “children need both parents”), (2) equality
          arguments (e.g., the catchword “equality”), and (3) the necessity of finding individual
          solutions (e.g., “each couple must decide for themselves”).</p>
        <p>The restriction to these three substantive codes was motivated by the focus on the
          hypotheses. They helped us explain discrepancies between the answers to the two
          closed-ended items role segregation and egalitarian division. The code “other” included
          mixed arguments that would not have been incompatible with the answers given to the closed
          items as well as arguments not covered by the three substantive codes. The answers within
          the category “other” are definitively not useless but could become the main source of data
          for further research questions. Independent coding by two coders of 10% of the answers
          resulted in an agreement of 0.87, an acceptable value given that the answers can be
          regarded as data with medium complexity.</p>

        <title>Data Analysis</title>
        <p>The existing time series for the ISSP item role segregation from 1988 until 2002 will
          serve as a benchmark to gauge the plausibility of the traditionality level obtained for
          the web surveys compared to the general population (the next relevant ISSP module will be
          fielded in 2012). An accord between the data sources would indicate that the web survey
          results in terms of traditionality are realistic to some extent. Directly corresponding to
          the hypotheses formulated for nontraditional and traditional respondents, we will then
          analyze patterns of the responses to the probing question. This will be done
          quantitatively and illustrated with citations from the probing answers.</p>

      <title>Results</title>
      <p>In total, 1,023 respondents completed our two web surveys. The drop-out rate was at 7.1%,
        and the median response time amounted to 10:39 minutes. The probe to egalitarian division
        was answered by 82% of respondents on a (basic) substantive level. The remaining 18% of
        answers were nonsubstantive. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1525822X12462525">Behr et al.
          (2012</xref>) address in detail design, panel, and individual characteristics that
        influenced the chances of providing (non)substantive answers.</p>
      <p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1525822X12462525">Table 1</xref> shows the means of role
        segregation in western and eastern Germany for the ISSP studies 1988, 1994, and 2002 as well
        as for our merged web surveys. For the benchmark item for gender ideology, western Germany
        scores 3.8 in the web. Given the ISSP time series, which shows a strong nontraditional
        trend, the web sample is in line with this trend. For eastern Germany, there is hardly any
        difference between the web sample and the ISSP time series, which does not show any trend.
        Thus, our web surveys provide us with a good approximation of the plausible traditionality
        level in Germany. Nevertheless, we are unable to establish representativeness of our data:
        The comparability of the traditionality levels does not preclude that the web sample might
        still differ with regard to other variables. </p>

      <p>First, how can respondents who clearly prefer the traditional role model, characterized by
        role segregation, at the same time be in favor of an equal division of tasks? Second, why is
        the agreement of the nontraditional respondents with an egalitarian division not even
        stronger? The answers given to the probing question provide us with insights about what is
        happening here.</p>
      <p>Given the skewed distributions of both items and very small case numbers in some
        categories, we collapsed some categories within the error, individual solutions, and middle
        response patterns for further analyses (see gray-shaded boxes in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1525822X12462525">Table 2</xref>). Having few case numbers is a disadvantage;
        at the same time, this show the merit of using web probing compared to conventional probing.
        Quotas for conventional cognitive interviewing are normally not based on the combinations of
        two closed-ended items, so it is unclear whether conventional cognitive interviewing would
        have allowed us to examine specific response combinations at all.</p>
      <p>With regard to role segregation, we do not differentiate between those who strongly agree
        and agree (and for symmetry reasons, we also do not differentiate between those who disagree
        and strongly disagree). With regard to egalitarian division, due to the extremely skewed
        distribution and the different meanings the response categories might have compared to the
        role segregation item, we keep the distinction between those who agree and those who
        strongly agree (large enough case numbers in each cell). However, we collapse the remaining
        three categories, which are neither/nor, disagree, and strongly disagree.</p>

        <title>Error Pattern</title>
        <p>The error pattern subsumes those respondents that (strongly) agree to both closed-ended
          items. When looking into the answers of these respondents for the probe egalitarian
          division (left gray-shaded cells in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1525822X12462525">Table 3</xref>), the following argumentation strands are revealed: Some respondents (6%
          and 14%, respectively) exclusively refer to positive consequences for the children or the
          joint responsibility in child-raising. They offer comments such as “Children need both
          parents” or “because child-raising is the task of both parents.” This is compatible with a
          preference for traditional gender roles but shows a narrow interpretation of the item
          egalitarian division that does not match the measurement goals of the researchers any
          more. A nonnegligible part of respondents who combine (strong) agreement with traditional
          gender roles with (strong) agreement to an equal division of labor refers to equality
          arguments (e.g., “gender equality” or “gender equality should prevail nowadays” [28% and
          16%, respectively]). Although such reasons perfectly fit to the scale value respondents
          have selected for egalitarian division, they are entirely incompatible with the answer
          these respondents have selected for role segregation. Respondents in this combination
          should simply not mention equality reasons. For these respondents, we cannot deduce from
          the two closed-ended items alone what their gender ideology is or whether they have a
          consistent concept at all.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="section14-1525822X12462525">
        <title>Individual Solution Pattern</title>
        <p>On the opposite end (right gray-shaded cell in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1525822X12462525">Table 3</xref>), respondents reject traditional gender
          roles without agreeing to an equal division of labor. Almost half of these respondents
          (45%) establish a reference to individuality or individual solutions. Virtually no one
          refers to equality arguments—which are the single most frequently given justification by
          nontraditional respondents who are in favor of an equal division of labor.</p>
        <p>It is worth noting that respondents have a variety of individual solutions in mind,
            <italic>depending on the job</italic> (If one of them has no or only a less well-paid
          job, the other one [irrespective whether this is the husband or the wife] should be the
          main breadwinner.), <italic>personal preferences</italic> (This is the ideal solution;
          however, only if both want this. Maybe one of them likes to be househusband/-wife?), or
            <italic>external restrictions</italic> (This entirely depends on the particular case,
          e.g., the job someone has. Sometimes it is not possible today to freely decide who goes
          out to work and who cares for the children, because not everyone who wants to work can get
          a job and not everyone who wants to take care of the children is able to get a part-time
          job or time off from the job.)</p>
        <p>Another reason pertaining to the individual solution pattern is the <italic>preference
            for completely unrestricted freedom of decision making</italic> (It does not matter who
          stays at home and who goes out to work, irrespective of whether this is the man or the
          woman [. . . ]. No one has to do both things or share anything. Everyone should be free to
          decide what he or she wants to do, as long as this can be properly organized.).</p>
        <p>Some of these respondents—though clearly opposing traditional roles—are in favor of an
          asymmetric role assignment. These respondents mention, for instance, the <italic>advantage
            of role specialization</italic> (Specialization is better than if everyone does
          everything.) or the <italic>constancy of one reference person for the children</italic> (I
          think it is important that one parent can stay at home, such that the children always have
          a contact person.). Since these respondents do not prescribe a specific role for a
          specific gender, their answers can be regarded as supporting individual solutions.</p>
        <p>These argumentation patterns illustrate a possible fallacy for researchers: The more
          respondents favor individual solutions, the weaker the support for an egalitarian division
          of tasks becomes. That is, respondents would increasingly disagree with an item depicting
          such an egalitarian way of life. Researchers would then conclude a traditional trend if
          they knew nothing of the respondents’ reasoning. This, however, would not be in line with
          “reality.”</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="section15-1525822X12462525">
        <title>Middle Response Pattern</title>
        <p>Finally, we look at those respondents who offer a “neither–nor” response for both closed
          questions (gray-shaded cell in the middle column, Table 3). This combination displays the
          highest percentage of nonsubstantive answers. Half of these respondents, therefore, seem
          to have no opinion on this issue—or are not willing or motivated to voice it (51%). A
          closer investigation of these respondents shows that 85% of them answer none in three
          category-selection probes in the survey on a substantive level. Also, 50% of them belong
          to the 10% of respondents who finish the survey the quickest. The second most important
          argumentation pattern is for respondents mentioning individual solutions (38%). Thus,
          choosing the middle response for both items is, in this instance, mainly a mixture of
          no-opinion/no-motivation and individualism.</p>
        <p>Again, respondents preferring individual solutions mention a variety of reasons that are
          very similar to the reasons of the individual solution response pattern and that can also
          explain the choice of the middle response category of the role segregation item:
            <italic>time availability</italic> (The decision should be based on who has more time
          [contingent on the job].), <italic>resource dependency</italic> (This is always a
          case-by-case decision—often based on financial considerations: As the woman
          [unfortunately] often earns less than the man, it is easier for the family if the woman
          cares for the children.) or <italic>completely unrestricted freedom of decision making
          </italic>(Everyone should decide on his or her own and find the best variant for herself
          or himself without pressure from society.).</p>
      </sec>
    </sec>
    <sec id="section16-1525822X12462525">
      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We were able to demonstrate that category-selection probing can usefully be implemented in
        web surveys with respondents drawn from online panels. A majority of respondents answered
        the category-selection probe in a substantive way rather than just clicking through the
        survey or giving nonsense answers.</p>
      <p>By focusing on specific combinations of response categories selected for a traditionally
        slanted benchmark item and an egalitarian item, we were able to reproduce findings by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1525822X12462525">Braun (2008</xref>) and thus to confirm our
        hypotheses. Agreement with a traditionally slanted item combined with agreement to an
        egalitarian item can be explained by misunderstandings of (at least one of) the items
          (<italic>error pattern</italic>). Disagreement with a traditionally slanted benchmark item
        combined with disagreement (or neutral stances) with an egalitarian item, which presents a
        specific egalitarian model, can be explained by the emerging preference for individual
        solutions (<italic>individual solution pattern</italic>). This preference reflects a
        well-considered personal position that combines a rejection of the traditional role model
        with a rejection to make one specific egalitarian model binding for all. Finally, we
        demonstrated that respondents selecting middle values for both the traditional and the
        egalitarian items mainly belong to two types: the no-opinions/those who were not motivated
        to write text and strong supporters for an individual solution model. The no-opinions and
        unmotivated respondents especially require further investigation in future studies. The
        successful replication of Braun’s findings (2008), which were based on a multimode probing
        study, backs the feasibility and usability of our web-probing method. At the same time, the
        probing results emphasize that the egalitarian item warrants improvements for future
        surveys.</p>
      <p>If the web-probing method is implemented alongside or after major (population) surveys, the
        information gathered can be used to evaluate actual survey data. It can then guard against
        drawing wrong conclusions. If the method is implemented as part of a pretest and validity
        problems are uncovered, items can still be rephrased and improved to increase validity. The
        open answers can then serve as a pool of what is relevant and important for respondents and
        what might be worth being explicitly mentioned in items.</p>
      <p>An important limitation of this study pertains to using a nonprobability sample that does
        not allow conclusions on the general population. However, compared to conventional cognitive
        interviewing, the use of online panels has the clear advantage of resulting in a markedly
        higher case number that can be used to clarify the meaning of (relatively) rare response
        combinations or assessing the prevalence of certain interpretation patterns. When
        probability-based online panels become available in countries other than the United States
        and the Netherlands, the representation problem might be mitigated in the future.</p>
      <p>Another important limitation is the lack of interactivity in our study: Nonsense,
        insufficient, or incomprehensible answers were not followed up by additional probes. Here,
        in particular, we see areas for further research, for example, with regard to motivational
        texts, better instructions, or follow-up probes to initial probes.</p>
      <p>Sample size and interactivity needs are certainly major determinants when choosing between
        conventional probing and web probing. We do not recommend replacing conventional cognitive
        interviewing with web probing. However, we understand web probing as a supplemental method
        when the investigation of response combinations or the prevalence of problems and
        argumentation patterns is needed and when in-depth information, which might only be obtained
        with intensive and repeated probing, is not necessarily sought. Furthermore, we see web
        probing as a possibility to assess item validity if cognitive labs or interviewers are not
        available.</p>
