<p>Since the publication of Michael Geyer’s <italic>Aufrüstung oder Sicherheit</italic> in 1980, historians of the German military in the era of the two world wars have recognized the centrality of military professionalism and planning to the politics of the army. Civil-military relations were shaped by notions of military efficiency, rather than concerns about the social position of the officer class and the aristocratic elites more generally. This insight has led historians to take military doctrine seriously. They stress the modernity of the German officer corps, its openness to innovation, and its lethal effectiveness at developing new modes of offensive warfare. Studies, notably by James Corum and Robert Citino, locate the successes of the <italic>Wehrmacht</italic> in 1939 and 1940 in the doctrinal innovations undertaken under the aegis of Hans von Seeckt, head of the <italic>Reichswehr</italic> between 1920 and 1926.</p>
<p>Strohn’s book, based on extensive archival research and the effective use of professional military journals, adds a new twist to the debate about German military doctrine during the interwar period. He argues that focus on the origins of <italic>Blitzkrieg</italic> has obscured the importance attached to defensive battle doctrine in the 1920s and 1930s. The leaders of the <italic>Reichswehr</italic> were realistic thinkers, who recognized the impossibility of the offensive under the restrictions of the treaty of Versailles. Training manuals and exercises devoted considerable space and effort to honing the skills necessary for the conduct of defensive battles.</p>
<p>The German army chopped and changed its doctrine throughout the interwar period. For example, Strohn charts the emergence of the manual <italic>Führung und Gefecht</italic> (FuG or Leadership and Combat) between 1919 and 1921. Seeckt set up 57 different committees and FuG represented a statement of general principles, not a detailed working out of specific actions. Strohn argues that Seeckt was the ‘central figure’, whose ideas had a ‘deep impact’ on the conduct of war (86–92). But he also demonstrates that just two years after FuG was issued, senior officers turned against Seeckt’s ideas, which appeared redundant during the French and Belgian occupation of the Ruhr (170). Germany responded to this with a campaign of passive resistance, underlining the ineffectiveness of the <italic>Reichswehr</italic>. However Seeckt’s challengers, notably Joachim von Stülpnagel, also failed to offer a realistic alternative. By the late 1920s, the <italic>Reichswehr</italic> Minister, General Wilhelm Groener, saw defensive battle as a means to buy time in a war, during which German diplomats would bring international pressure to bear on the invading forces to halt their attack on the Reich. By 1933 a new manual was issued, <italic>Truppenführung</italic>, which, Strohn argues, adopted a balanced approach to defensive battle.</p>
<p>Flexible defence in mobile warfare characterized German doctrine during the interwar period. Strohn avoids the trap of seeing offence and defence as mutually exclusive. He shows how German defensive doctrine in the First World War aimed to fall back and then recapture ceded ground.</p>
<p>Flexible defence was a broad concept and military thinkers came up with radically different approaches to the conduct of the defensive battle. Indeed the evidence presented by Strohn suggests a highly flexible, even unstable, approach to the formulation of military doctrine. Seeckt’s position as the central figure is fundamentally challenged by this book. Strohn claims that his vision of the relationship between the regular army and militia was ‘blurred’ (128) and that his focus on solving future problems, rather than immediate ones, led to ‘building castles in the air’ (140). The constant changing of doctrine should be recognized for what it was: a response to the rapidly shifting international and domestic politics of the interwar period. The military, like other professional groups during the period, were experimenting and adapting.</p>
<p>Although Strohn is primarily concerned with the development of defensive doctrine, he pays close attention to the relationship between the army, the state and society. He demonstrates that the fall of Seeckt led to a change in civil–military relations. The mobilization of the civilian population to defend German borders required cooperation with local civilian authorities. On several occasions the <italic>Reichswehr</italic> proposed the formation of a Reich Defence Council, but politicians remained cautious. The Council was set up in October 1932, but only met once during the Third Reich. Strohn’s research reinforces the argument that the officers viewed civil–military relations through the prism of concepts of military efficiency rather than class interest.</p>
<p>The book concludes with an assessment of German defensive warfare in the Second World War. Strohn shows how Hitler rejected doctrines of flexible defence. By late 1944 any successes could only be tactical, delaying inevitable defeat. Operational innovation paled beside political miscalculation.</p>
