<p><italic>Contemporary Music: Theoretical and Philosophical Perspectives</italic> essentially contains the proceedings of a colloquium organised by ESCOM, the European Society of the Cognitive Sciences of Music in Brussels, in March 2000. It was published originally in French as <italic>Musique Contemporaine: perspectives théoriques et philosophiques</italic> (Mardaga, 2001). This is a revised and expanded English version, edited by Max Paddison and Irène Deliège. The two original sections, centred around theoretical and philosophical issues of contemporary music respectively, are now enriched by a third part in which the floor is handed over to some prominent composers such as Boulez, Lachenmann and Ferneyhough.</p>
<p>The title of this book is quite vague and could cover an immense variety of perspectives. However, as Max Paddison points out in his substantial introduction, some clear concerns are considered as central. In the first, theoretical part, the authors not only offer perspectives but also retrospectives. Célestin Deliège, for instance, underlines the importance of the musical developments from the late 1940s up to the early 1960s and focuses on the post-Webern Darmstadt years. Another important point of interest is the impact of the technological development of society on the technical development of music. In his essay, the composer and philosopher Hugues Dufourt gives a historical overview of this development, while focusing on French Spectralism. It comes as no surprise that considerable attention is also given to the discussion of musical material. Several essays deal with harmony and more generally with the systematicity and consistency of musical structures. While François Nicolas writes about musical logic, Célestin Deliège introduces a sophisticated alternative to set theory for the analysis of atonal harmony. Pascal Decroupet and Rudolf Frisius elaborate different implications of the broadening and stylistic diversification of musical material. Unsurprisingly, Decroupet and Frisius also touch upon some philosophical topics. Here – as in the second part, where Paddison, Herman Sabbe and Richard Toop discuss musical material from a philosophical point of view – the coherence of this publication is underlined. This “trans-disciplinary” approach (by musicologists, composers and philosophers) is one of the strengths of this volume.</p>
<p>Due to the omnipresent adherence to Theodor Adorno’s critical theory, the philosophical section of the book seems even more consistent than the first. In his introduction, Paddison underlines the undiminished relevance of Adorno’s writings to contemporary music. Of course, Sabbe, when trying to identify a common denominator within the cultural philosophies which sustain the “New Music” of the past century, could not keep silent about Adorno. In their contributions, Paddison and Anne Boissière explicitly focus on Adorno.</p>
<p>One of the important achievements of Adorno was his call for <italic>une musique informelle</italic> in 1960. Adorno argued against the total rationalisation of music and underlined the need for the unknown and unforeseen in composition. This search for a balance between control and freedom leads us directly to the new, third part of this volume: <italic>Creative orientations</italic>. The editors selected four composers (Lachenmann, Boulez, Ferneyhough and Rihm) and asked them for an interview. In addition, the section opens with an essay in which Jonathan Harvey reflects upon the transcendent and mystical character of (basically) his own music and concludes with an analysis by Alastair Williams of German contemporary music, in relation to what happens in the rest of Europe and in America.</p>
<p>The structured and well-illustrated statements by Harvey and the other composers immediately show their long-standing experience in writing and talking about (their own) music. With his succinct answers, only Wolfgang Rihm breaks this rule. However, this has more to do with his view on composition (“The process of composition is such an intimate thing”) and his rather poor English (“It’s difficult for me in English”. Why could he not be interviewed in his mother tongue?) than with a lack of interesting ideas. The virtuosity with which especially Boulez and Lachenmann switch from one domain to another is amazing. It honours them that they do this without becoming unnecessarily complicated. Moreover, Helmut Lachenmann’s words could appeal to a large public of music amateurs and performers. He not only dwells on his own music (with interesting excursions on <italic>musique concrète instrumentale</italic>, “broken magic” and the “energy” and materiality of sounds) but also goes into topics such as political music, musical citation, the behaviour of the audience and Adorno. The interview with Brian Ferneyhough is of a totally different calibre and mainly focuses on the compositions he was working on at the time of the interview (2006).</p>
<p>It must have been an extremely time-consuming activity to translate the original essays, most of which were in French. Hats off to Max Paddison, who acted as an overall translator and translations editor. With great devotion he looked for English equivalents of sometimes almost untranslatable terms. This renders the essays of among others Deliège and Decroupet (who mostly publish in French and German) accessible to Anglophone readers in the best possible way.</p>
<p>By using <italic>Contemporary Music: Theoretical and Philosophical Perspectives</italic> as the title of their book, Irène Deliège and Max Paddison left the door wide open to (easy) critics. It is of course an audacious enterprise to edit a book with such an exuberant and all-inclusive title. Taking into account the immense variety and rapid evolution of contemporary music, we can hardly blame the editors for not having given an exhaustive survey of what has been going on in this domain. First, such a venture could easily deteriorate into a hollow collection of meaningless generalities. Second, the present publication contains enough variety in itself to underline the wealth of contemporary music.</p>
<p>In their choices, the editors show a clear predilection for West European and especially German, French and English composers of the Darmstadt generation (and their students: Lachenmann studied with Nono, Rihm with Stockhausen). Wolfgang Rihm (b. 1952) being the youngest amongst them, the junior generation was given no chance. The same goes for the music from outside Western Europe.</p>
<p>Many of the authors are Belgian musicologists who once belonged to the circle of Henri Pousseur. Decroupet studied with him, Sabbe and Decroupet wrote their thesis about him and Irène and Célestin Deliège were close friends of the composer. Hence, it certainly is no coincidence that topics such as harmony (Pousseur’s hobbyhorse) receive so much attention.</p>
<p>Be that as it may, what remains is a coherent collection of essays and interviews. Thanks to the way it is rooted in the past and thanks to its sometimes polemic character, it opens many tracks for further theoretical and philosophical reflection.</p>
