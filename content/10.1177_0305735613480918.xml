<p>Anne Dhu McLucas was Professor of Music and Dean Emerita of the School of Music and Dance, University of Oregon. McLucas tragically died on 8 September 2012 in Eugene. Along with her partner, James Gillette, she was a victim of a double homicide. In a sad turn of events, Gillette’s son, Johan, was arrested on suspicion of the murders. McLucas studied Italian and German languages at undergraduate levels at the University of Colorado, to which she later added Gaelic in order to study the music of her Scottish ancestry. She subsequently turned her attention toward music, gaining a PhD from Harvard. Her career as an ethnomusicologist was extremely impressive; she held positions at Boston College, Wellesley and Harvard. It was clear that the study of traditional and popular music, their cultural connotations and practices were both a lifelong pursuit and great love. Her recent publications included <italic>The Song Repertoire of Amelia and Jane Harris</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0305735613480918">2002</xref>, with Emily Lyle and Kaye McAlpine) and her final work, <italic>The Musical Ear: Oral Tradition in the USA</italic> (2010). It is this latter tome that is the focus of this review.</p>
<p><italic>The Musical Ear</italic> is a multifaceted exploration of orally-transmitted folk and popular musical traditions. These contrast with Western classical traditions, which are predominantly transmitted through print notation. The book commences with a proposition: ‘<italic>The power of American music exists chiefly in its oral traditions</italic>’ (p. 1). It sets about illustrating this notion with wide-ranging music from seventeenth-century religious songs, to twenty-first-century hip-hop “beat” producers; there is a helpful compact disc, which accompanies the manuscript. McLucas’s rationale for such an in-depth study is that “the grand textbook histories of American music” have grossly underestimated and overlooked the significance of oral traditions (to prove this point, she cites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0305735613480918">Chase, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0305735613480918">Crawford, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0305735613480918">Hamm, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0305735613480918">Hitchcock, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0305735613480918">Mellers, 1987</xref>; and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0305735613480918">Nicholls, 1998</xref>). McLucas effortlessly threads into her arguments recent psychological and neurological research into memory and musical creation; moreover, she reflects on the impact of recorded sound. An extensive exploration of this topic is both timely and highly germane; there has been a great deal of recent attention to the potential educational benefits of ideas drawn from popular styles, notably ear-playing and “informal learning” (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0305735613480918">Baker, in press</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0305735613480918">Boespflug, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0305735613480918">Dunbar-Hall &amp; Wemyss, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0305735613480918">Evelein, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0305735613480918">Green, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0305735613480918">2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0305735613480918">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0305735613480918">Jaffurs, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0305735613480918">Johansson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0305735613480918">Karlsen, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0305735613480918">Lebler, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0305735613480918">Lines, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0305735613480918">Mans, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0305735613480918">O’Flynn, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>In the first chapter, McLucas raises the question of whether or not there are cross- cultural traits of oral transmission. She remarks that: “. . . there do seem to be some common elements . . . These elements have to do with the human mind, the limits of memory, the power of repetition, and the urge toward creativity” (p. 5).</p>
<p>In making her point, McLucas refers to four case-studies. Three of these are of vocalists: a Native American (Willetto Antonio), an African-American blues singer (Autry McNeace, or “Eagle Park Slim”) and an Appalachian-raised musician (Hazel Dickens). An Irish-American fiddler is also discussed here (Kevin Burke). CD tracks of the artists bring additional life to the writing (e.g., Antonio’s “Dawn song;” McNeace’s “Goin’ back to Eugene;” “Conversation with death” and “Pretty bird” by Dickens; and Burke’s “The long set” and “Across the black river”). A common thread is how all of the musicians have absorbed and sustained the style of their regional music while exercising creativity.</p>
<p>Following this opening discussion, there is the first of four “interludes,” which the author has interspersed between the main chapters. This opening reflective passage concerns the brain and music. These interludes serve the purpose of bringing together various research fields persuasively, including cognitive neuroscience, focusing these down on themes discussed in the preceding chapter. In structuring her book in this manner, McLucas brings together recent work by the likes of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0305735613480918">Ian Cross (1999)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0305735613480918">David Huron (2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0305735613480918">2006</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0305735613480918">Sandra Trehub (2006)</xref>. She writes that oral traditions are an important medium for the distinctive mental activity of music-making: “. . . and to begin to understand it from a scientific as well as a descriptive point of view has been a breakthrough for me personally, and I hope it will be for the reader as well” (p. 6).</p>
<p>Chapter 2 is concerned with oral tradition in popular music followed by Interlude 2, which spotlights creativity and the brain. In this second chapter, helpful real-world examples and contrasts assist readers in grasping the fine differences between idioms and the historical changes to their compositional practices. The author compares, for example, the “intermediary” role of Hollywood transcriber/arranger Lou Halmy (“The Lone Arranger”) with Pat Monahan’s modus operandi as a member of the rock band Train since the 1990s. After this, McLucas turns her attention to hip-hop and garage bands. Some characteristics of popular music, she affirms, may tend towards the simple, yet the procedures resulting in the finished product are complex; within these, “all is tested by ear” (p. 68). Additionally, the arrival of digital technologies has altered the manner in which music is conceived; the changing landscape of music-making is conveyed in an engaging fashion here.</p>
<p>The third chapter explores oral tradition within American musical history, including its impact upon America’s concert or “art” music. Interlude 3 then concentrates on the interactions of written and oral traditions in cognitive processes. The chapter itself recounts moments in US history when oral traditions have had a particularly strong influence. The author points out that knowledge of how a particular instrument or piece is performed is, in itself, part of an oral tradition and, therefore, this applies to art music too. McLucas commences with the melodies brought by early colonists, through regional folksong to the rise of ragtime, blues and jazz, to art composers as beneficiaries of what she describes as these “grassroots” influences. For example, she references the musical quotations of Charles Ives (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0305735613480918">Burkholder, 1995</xref>). McLucas covers new historical ground built around her primary focus of the oral; it is a well-drawn history that, no doubt, will be referenced frequently by both academics and university students.</p>
<p>Chapter 4 considers oral traditions in the lives of ordinary humans, those who perhaps consider themselves “non-musicians,” again making reference to several case studies. Thereafter, Interlude 4 explores the mental capacities of <italic>all</italic> humans, both as listeners and musical purveyors, and how these capacities help define us. This is a profound subject and, like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0305735613480918">Harold Fiske (2008)</xref>, she rightly counters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0305735613480918">Steven Pinker’s (1999)</xref> view that music is merely “auditory cheesecake.” Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0305735613480918">Fiske (2008)</xref> argues that “. . . for the professional musician [this] is a denigrating and insulting comment on an activity requiring supreme skill, practice, knowledge, and expertise” (p. 11). Drawing on various writers, McLucas crafts her arguments under subheadings of “Music and meaning,” “Music and emotion,” “The musical brain and evolution” and, a title borrowed from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0305735613480918">Ian Cross (1999)</xref>, “Is music the most important thing we ever did?” She looks, for instance, at infant musical discrimination, music and its connection with the development of speech and communication; she also touches on how music is used for mood enhancement and mood alteration. Arguably, there is nothing new added to territory covered by equally-accessible volumes such as <italic>Music and Mind in Everyday Life</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0305735613480918">Clarke, Dibben, &amp; Pitts, 2010</xref>) or heavy-duty works such as Fiske’s, but, nonetheless, it is a well-developed part of the book.</p>
<p>The final chapter restates the importance of oral tradition and evaluates what the processes of oral tradition contribute to culture. It also brings together the earlier considerations of music and the brain. Furthermore, there is speculation about how oral tradition may operate in the future, e.g., the consequences of new technologies.</p>
<p>Championing oral traditions was patently an utter “mission” for McLucas. She wrote:
<disp-quote>
<p>. . . my aim has been toward influencing and educating members of my own sub-culture of the music profession, academia, and music-lovers of various sorts who have been taught to value written music above the oral—an attitude which, as we have seen from many people interviewed, still prevails and has served to make some of them feel musically inferior. In my years of study of American music I have seen that the oral nature of much of it has led to its denigration in the face of a seemingly superior European written tradition. . . . I feel compelled to champion the rights of today’s oral cultures . . . I am not among those who are ready to say that America no longer has a strong musical culture simply because symphony orchestras are on the wane or because record sales are down. Nor do I criticize the listening habits of the younger generation . . . (p. 163)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Undoubtedly, it was: breadth of knowledge; great intellect; embrace for a spectrum of musics; substantial immersion in her field; and her enormous passion that made McLucas outstanding. It was also her capacity to look beyond personal “positioning,” to reveal how various cultural products and practices relate to society in general. Her book is rhapsodic, with many eloquently-made points. McLucas’s prose draws readers into her rounded, compelling and passionate worldview: <italic>The Musical Ear: Oral Tradition in the USA</italic> is a superb composition and the culmination of a life’s work – it is a fitting epitaph for a notable scholar who will be woefully missed.</p>
