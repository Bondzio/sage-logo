<p>We thank Dr Tourtier and colleagues for their insightful comments on our recent article describing a program to improve the quality of emergency endotracheal intubation (EEI). They call attention to our selection of propofol as the sole induction agent used in our intubation protocol, particularly in view of the hypotensive effect of the medication. This has special relevance in view of the critical patients, many of whom were hemodynamically unstable at the time of endotracheal intubation. However, we reported a low rate of hypotension in this vulnerable population; despite the use of propofol. The reason for this is that we use vasoactive medication (eg, norepinephrine or phenylephrine) to block the predictable vasoplegic effect that may occur with the use of propofol.</p>
<p>As to the dose of propofol used, we do not have a set induction dose and did not record the dose used in each patient. This is a decision made by the team leader within the clinical context. For example, the patient who is already in coma related to neurological injury may require a minimal dose (0.25-0.5 mg/kg) in preparation for endotracheal intubation; whereas a combative muscular young patient with the history of recreational drug use might require a much higher dose (2.0-3.0 mg/kg). In the hemodynamically unstable patients, several cautious doses might be administered with adjustment of pressor dose before definitive attempt at endotracheal intubation. We rely on a well-trained “bagging” team to support oxygenation function in this patient group.</p>
<p>Regarding the high rate of difficult intubation, this speaks to the accuracy of our data recording as well as to the fact that the primary intubator was often relatively inexperienced. Could the use of lower than standard doses of propofol made some patients more difficult to intubate? This is also possible. Training the fellows in EEI is challenging but necessary.</p>
<p>Dr Tourtier and colleagues present a strong defense for rapid sequence intubation (RSI) as well as for alternative hypnotic agents to facilitate endotracheal intubation. However, they will acknowledge that there has never been a well-designed trial comparing RSI with the simpler use of a single sedative/hypnotic. Opinion runs strong on both sides of the controversy, and we are waiting for a definitive prospective controlled trial. In the meantime, our results indicate that propofol as the sole induction agent is associated with an excellent safety profile when compared to other literature describing complications of EEI. We have continued to use this approach for the past several years with similar results. The most important issue is that whatever medications the critical care team decides to use, they standardize the protocol in order to become completely familiar with the side effect profile that is peculiar to each approach. No induction method is without risk.</p></body></article>
