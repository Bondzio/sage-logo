<abstract>
<p>This article argues that the traditional political science definition of clientelism is insufficient for explaining how the media fit in with clientelistic systems in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). It is suggested that a broader understanding of clientelism, looking in particular at how media are used as elite-to-elite communication tools as well as elite-to-mass communication tools, better explains the place of the media in the clientelistic systems of the CEE nations. Empirically, it is based on a set of 272 elite and expert interviews conducted across ten CEE countries (Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia) in 2010 and 2011. The article presents some general findings on the nature and character of the linkages between political elites and the media, and the extent to which such linkages can be considered clientelistic. Then follows a discussion of specific practices of media instrumentalization, charting the many ways in which the media can function as a resource in conflicts and negotiations between clientelistic elite networks, directly as well as indirectly. Particular attention is given to the phenomena of <italic>advertorials</italic> and <italic>kompromat</italic>.</p>

<title>Introduction: Clientelism and the Media in Central and Eastern Europe</title>
<p>This article argues that the traditional political science definition of clientelism is insufficient for explaining how the media fit in with clientelistic systems in the CEE region—and there is a growing body of work suggesting that the media have an important place in clientelistic systems of political organization (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1940161212454329">Hallin and Papathanassopoulos 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1940161212454329">Hallin and Mancini 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1940161212454329">Roudakova 2008</xref>). It is suggested that a broader understanding of clientelism, looking in particular at how media are used as elite-to-elite communication tools as well as elite-to-mass communication tools, better explains the place of the media in the clientelistic systems of the CEE nations.</p>
<p>In political science, <italic>clientelism</italic> is commonly understood as a <italic>relationship between politicians and voters</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1940161212454329">Kitschelt and Wilkinson (2007</xref>: 2) define the phenomenon as “the direct exchange of a citizen’s vote in return for direct payments or continuing access to employment, goods and services.” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1940161212454329">Weingrod (1968</xref>: 379) notes that for the political scientist, clientelism is “largely the study of how political party leaders seek to turn public institutions and public resources to their own ends, and how favors of various kinds are exchanged for votes.” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1940161212454329">Medina and Stokes (2002</xref>: 2) list four different definitions of clientelism, which differ in terms of the exact nature and character of the exchange, but are all based on the idea that clientelism is a relationship between politicians and citizens where citizens vote in exchange for some kind of material benefit provided by the politician(s). In the modern era, this relationship is commonly mediated by political parties, as expressed through concepts such as <italic>machine parties/politics, cartel parties</italic>, or parties as <italic>patronage networks</italic> (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1940161212454329">Scott 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1940161212454329">Banfield and Wilson 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1940161212454329">Katz and Mair 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1940161212454329">Kopecký and Scherlis 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1940161212454329">Shefter 1977</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1940161212454329">1994</xref>).</p>
<p>To the extent that the media are even mentioned in political science studies of clientelism, their role is largely taken for granted. Given the definition of clientelism, media can be cast in two main roles: (1) as resources used by parties to communicate with voters and thus largely outside the domain of clientelistic exchanges—if you can affect the voter via the media, there is no need to buy his or her vote—and (2) as part of the forces arrayed <italic>against</italic> clientelism, with the media acting as a Fourth Estate exposing clientelistic practices and networks (as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1940161212454329">Kitschelt 2007</xref>: 307, who lists the activities of the media as one of the reasons for the weakening of clientelism in advanced industrial democracies—without providing any empirical evidence).</p>
<p>The concept of clientelism, however, comes to political science from anthropology, and in anthropology the term has a much wider meaning—it is seen as a system for social organization that stretches from the micro level of interpersonal exchanges to the macro level of societal governance (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1940161212454329">Bailey 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1940161212454329">Boissevain 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1940161212454329">Sahlins 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1940161212454329">Wolf 1966</xref>). Early works on clientelism in political science embraced this wider meaning and held clientelism to be a more general system for political organization built on <italic>particularistic, unequal</italic>, and <italic>informal</italic> exchanges between <italic>patrons</italic> (who control resources or access to resources) and <italic>clients</italic> (who do not), where patrons provide resources in exchange for deference, support and/or other services (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1940161212454329">Clapham 1982</xref>: 4-5; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1940161212454329">Eisenstadt and Lemarchand 1981</xref>: 271-3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1940161212454329">Eisenstadt and Roniger 1984</xref>: 43-44; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1940161212454329">Landé 1977</xref>: xii-xxxvii; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1940161212454329">Scott 1969</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1940161212454329">1972</xref>: 101, 104-5; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1940161212454329">Weingrod 1968</xref>: 377-9; also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1940161212454329">Roniger 1994</xref>: 3-5; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1940161212454329">Piattoni 2001</xref>: 9-12. for more recent overviews of the concept). That is to say, clientelism was seen as a more holistic system or cultural feature that involved more than just politician–voter exchanges.</p>
<p>In more recent work in political science that deals with the intersection of clientelism, corruption, and informality, particularly in the region of postcommunist Central and Eastern Europe (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1940161212454329">Böröcz 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1940161212454329">Gallina 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1940161212454329">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1940161212454329">Grødeland 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1940161212454329">McMenamin 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1940161212454329">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1940161212454329">Meyer 2006</xref>), it is acknowledged that informal clientelistic networks can be involved in many different types of exchanges, not only involving politicians and citizens in election times, and that while political parties may well be key intermediaries of clientelistic exchanges, they are not the only possible intermediary, nor always the most powerful one. Informal clientelistic networks that straddle politics, business, and other sectors (including the media) may be involved in many exchanges of favors involving resources and types of support that are unrelated (or only indirectly related) to securing votes in elections, for example, converting public resources for private gain, getting preferential treatment in public tenders, and influencing policy making.</p>
<p>The present study thus follows recent work that attempts to link and integrate the concepts of <italic>clientelism, informality</italic>, and <italic>corruption</italic>. Clientelism is about the <italic>conduct and framework</italic> of certain exchanges in the political arena, informality describes the <italic>nature and character</italic> of these exchanges, and corruption highlights both the <italic>result and purpose</italic> of such exchanges (again, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1940161212454329">Gallina 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1940161212454329">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1940161212454329">Grødeland 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1940161212454329">Meyer 2006</xref>; as well as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1940161212454329">Helmke and Levitsky 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1940161212454329">Kārkliņs 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1940161212454329">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1940161212454329">Stefes 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1940161212454329">Wedel 2003</xref>). Using a wider definition of clientelism in this way provides a better framework for explaining how and why the media are used by clientelistic networks for purposes unrelated or only indirectly related to electoral communication.</p>

<title>Media, Clientelism, and Elite-to-Elite Communication</title>
<p>Two recent, widely quoted comparative works that touch on media clientelism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1940161212454329">Hallin and Mancini 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1940161212454329">Hallin and Papathanassopoulos 2002</xref>) largely assume that clientelism is a <italic>stable</italic> system where loyalties and relationships between media and political parties and/or individual political actors are seen as long-term and predictable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1940161212454329">Roudakova 2008</xref>: 43, 55). But in the case of many other countries, clientelistic links between media and political actors can be clearly observed but are transitory and contingent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1940161212454329">Roudakova 2008</xref>: 43-5). Roudakova’s description of media in clientelistic systems as opportunist and disloyal echoes anthropologist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1940161212454329">Duncan McCargo’s (2011)</xref> use of the concept of <italic>partisan polyvalence</italic> to characterize media–politics links in Southeast Asia: instead of particular media being loyal to particular political actors in the long term, media loyalties shift depending on economic support as well as general power shifts within the clientelistic system.</p>
<p>The possibility of such rapid shifts make the media attractive tools for elite-to-elite communication as well as for elite-to-mass communication. Following the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1940161212454329">Davis (2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1940161212454329">2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1940161212454329">2007</xref>), we can see how the media in “Western” societies are in many ways used for communication between elites, and the goal of (political as well as business) PR often is communicating with other elites rather than directly with the general (voting) public. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1940161212454329">Davis (2003</xref>: 669-70) points out that “most negotiation [between elites] takes place outside the public sphere of the mass media and without reference to the mass of consumer-citizens.”</p>
<p>Many trends present in “Western” political systems are even more pronounced in postcommunist Central and Eastern Europe, for example, the relative lack of transparency in political processes, the often polarized and strongly competitive political culture, and the centralization and personalization of politics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1940161212454329">Gallina 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1940161212454329">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1940161212454329">Korkut 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1940161212454329">Szablowski 1993</xref>). These trends are also emphasized by Davis (in the context of the United Kingdom) as contributing to an increased elite focus of political communication—lack of transparency, polarization, intense competition, personalization and political centralization all make elite-to-elite communication via the media more attractive as well as more important (in particular, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1940161212454329">Davis 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1940161212454329">2003</xref>). He discusses a number of media practices and uses of media for communication primarily aimed at other elites, for example, getting positive media coverage as part of internal party leadership struggles or struggles over ministerial appointments, blocking public debate (by blocking media access) on strategically problematic or risky political issues, influencing policy decisions by leaking information to either boost the own side or discredit/weaken the other side in policy conflicts, and “floating”/“kite-flying” ideas to see how other elite groups will react (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1940161212454329">Davis 2002</xref>: 171-3. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1940161212454329">2003</xref>: 679-80).</p>
<p>In a clientelistic system, particularly one that may be somewhat unstable, these types of elite-to-elite communication would arguably be even more important: power shifts between clientelistic network may well (and often do) occur <italic>between</italic> elections, and thus safeguarding the clientelistic network itself and its ability to grant favors and extract resources becomes a constant preoccupation—and one that generally does not involve the general public at all.</p>
<p>The following sections describe and analyze some general patterns and practices of media-political clientelism in the CEE region. First, however, a few words must be said about the data on which this examination is based.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1940161212454329">
<title>The Empirical Material: Elite Interviews</title>
<p>This article is based on a data set consisting of 272 elite and expert interviews conducted in 2010–11 in all ten postcommunist nations that have joined the EU since 2004 (i.e., Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia). These interviews were conducted as part of the ERC-funded research project Media and Democracy in Central and Eastern Europe (grant reference no. 230113). The main field interview periods were April–October 2010 and April–October 2011.</p>
<p>The interviewees can be grouped into five main categories: politicians, political communicators, media representatives, experts, and regulators (a more detailed table of interviewees can be found in the <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1940161212454329">appendix</xref>). This article mainly draws on the interviews with politicians, media representatives, and experts for the analysis, but important background information provided by political communicators and regulators is also presented.</p>
<p>The research project as a whole covers a wide range of issues, and all interviewees were not always asked the same questions, as the project researchers sought out different interviewees to talk about different things; representatives of regulatory bodies were mostly interviewed about regulatory issues, for example. Most key issues of the project were however covered by asking different interviewee categories to characterize a particular issue or phenomenon according to their unique vantage point to take advantage of their particular position in relation to the issue or phenomenon.</p>
<p>In regard to <italic>clientelism</italic>, politicians were asked about the nature and character of the political process, the nature and character of political parties, the existence and influence of informal networks in politics, and the nature and character of media coverage of politics. Media representatives were asked about the existence and practice of “paid news,” undue state/corporate influence on the news, the existence and influence of informal networks in politics and other sectors, and the relative “professionalism” of the journalistic corps. Political communicators were asked about the nature and character of media coverage of politics, the nature and character of political communications, and how they and others act to get their message across on the media. Experts (primarily academic experts in the field of media, politics, public administration and business management) were asked about the existence and influence of informal networks in politics and other sectors, the typical conduct and “normal functioning” of media/politics/public administration/business, and general issues of corruption. Regulators were asked about undue influences on regulatory processes by political, business, and media actors.</p>
<p>As the interviews dealt with sensitive issues, such as clientelism, informal networks, and sometimes even outright corruption, there are limits to the kinds of information one can get through elite interviews, in particular since almost all of our interviewees agreed to be on the record. Often, the interviewees spoke in generalities (or even platitudes) or did not directly answer questions. That said, however, some interviewees were remarkably open. It was also possible to some extent to mitigate against response biases in this regard by asking questions indirectly or using hypotheticals, for example, “Would it ever happen that . . .” or “Do you know if <italic>other</italic> people/parties are known to [use various illegitimate or semilegitimate practices]?” Again, there are biases at work as some politicians pretty clearly took this as an opportunity to smear political opponents. Still, such statements also say something about the communication climate in which the political elites are active.</p>
<p>In this article, all interviewees have been anonymized and are referred to only by country of origin and general respondent category, for example, “Polish politician,” “Slovenian political communicator,” “Latvian expert/public administration.”</p>
<p>The interviews were conducted locally, that is, in the countries and cities where the respondents live and work. In the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Slovakia, interviews were conducted in the native language of the respondents (because members of the research team speak these languages), then were transcribed and translated into English. In Poland, the 2010 interviews were conducted in English and the 2011 interviews were conducted in Polish. In all other countries interviews were conducted in English, except in a few cases where interviews were conducted with the help of a translator. All interviews were recorded digitally and then transcribed. The interviews vary in length; the shortest interview lasted about twenty-five minutes, and the longest just under two hours. The median interview length was between forty-five and fifty-five minutes.</p>
<p>Despite the obvious limitations of the material (i.e., nonrepresentativeness, possible translation/comprehension issues), it also has obvious strengths given the research goals of the project. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1940161212454329">Aberbach and Rockman (2002</xref>: 673) note on elite interviews, “Interviewing is often important if one needs to know what a set of people think, or how they interpret an event or series of events, or what they have done or are planning to do”—and it is precisely what various elite actors think about and interpret clientelism and clientelistic practices and the role of the media in this regard that we are interested in here. Taken together, these elite interviews provide good insight into what activities informal clientelistic networks engage in and how these activities manifest in on-the-ground practices and exchanges between political and media actors. However, given the relatively small number of interviewees in each country (twenty to thirty individuals), in this article I have chosen to focus on general features of the CEE region as a whole rather than providing an extensive comparative analysis. I do, however, note in the text where it has been indicated that certain practices are more widespread or nonexistent in certain countries.</p>

<title>Clientelism and the Media in Central and Eastern Europe: Empirical Observations</title>
<p>First of all, we can note that one of the key elements of clientelism in the traditional political science sense, namely <italic>patronage</italic>, hardly applies to media institutions at all. The media in general do not seem to be an important source of patronage jobs. The financial crisis have caused massive layoffs in media organizations (sometimes as much as between one-fourth to one-third of editorial staff), and most media markets in the region are competitive enough that it would be difficult to guarantee the remaining jobs to loyalists (even though some interviewees suggested that such layoffs had been used to get rid of people who were perceived as disloyal against clientelistic political backers). In some instances public service broadcasting was still seen as sources of patronage jobs, but most observers agreed that the main source of patronage jobs, where such existed, was not the media but rather various state-owned industries or parts of the state administration and service provision. The transport sector, the energy sector, and the health care sector were singled out as particularly penetrated by clientelistic networks in many countries, for example, the Czech Republic, Latvia, and Lithuania. This is consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1940161212454329">Kitschelt’s (2007</xref>: 311-12) observation that an important power base of clientelistic networks has generally been “traditional” state-owned sectors like heavy industry and infrastructure.</p>
<p>In a few countries (notably Bulgaria, Romania—in the latter case, also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1940161212454329">Coman 2010</xref>) interviewees observed that while the media were not important sources of patronage jobs, it had happened that media elite members had <italic>received</italic> patronage jobs (as senior public administrators or senior political advisors) as a reward for their loyalty—a clear indicator of clientelistic linkages between political elites and media elites.</p>
<p>Next, we look more closely at the linkages between politics and the media, focusing on the elite level. Then follows a discussion of how the media may also function as resources for elite-to-elite communication needs of rival informal clientelistic networks, with particular attention paid to the phenomena of <italic>advertorials</italic> and <italic>kompromat</italic>.</p>
<sec id="section5-1940161212454329">
<title>Political–Media Linkages: The Elite Level</title>
<p>In the broader sense outlined earlier, clientelism is linked to informal networks engaged in exchanges of favors and resources, often nontransparent, where the main goal of the network is to increase/retain the power and resources of its leading actor(s). In the cases where such clientelistic networks are linked to political parties (which they often but not always are), getting votes in elections is often a means to an end rather than an end in itself: the overarching goal of the network is resource extraction, which is easier to do if the party that the network is linked to is in government.</p>
<p>Across all countries, interviewees from all categories agree that clientelistic networks of this kind still exist and play a role in politics (in particular where politics overlaps with business). Such clientelistic networks are strongly associated with corruption and corrupt practices:
<disp-quote>
<p>There is a number of lobbies, circles, including businessmen, politicians, judges, prosecutors, and media owners. Sometimes they fight among themselves, but most of the time they don’t fight, they sit at a table, and they distribute the wealth. (Bulgarian expert on elites)</p>
<p>These ministries are essentially feudalized by these patronage networks, in the sense that all the state agencies, all the state secretaries, and so on, this party tries to promote its own people into these positions, and also to use different kinds of money through the ministries, including European structural funds, these are often taken and let’s say managed by these patronage networks on the side, or let’s say behind the official stage and the civil service and so on. (Latvian expert on public administration)</p>

<p>Interestingly, when asking <italic>general</italic> questions about clientelistic/informal networks, the media are rarely mentioned (the above quote from the Bulgarian expert is something of an exception): instead, the interviewees associate such networks with the worlds of politics and business in particular. This is consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1940161212454329">Grødeland’s (2007)</xref> extensive study of informal networks in seven different societal sectors in four CEE countries (Czech Republic, Slovenia, Bulgaria, and Romania), which found that the media were perceived as among the sectors <italic>least</italic> influenced by informal networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1940161212454329">Grødeland 2007</xref>: 224, 244).</p>
<p>That said, when turning to the role of the media specifically in the political process in general and network exchanges in particular, it is clear that the media do have a role and are perceived as linked to this overall clientelistic structure. The dominant perception, particularly common among politicians, is that media influence is sought because the media are very powerful in shaping public opinion and the media are important tools for elite-to-mass communication, especially in election times. The following quote is typical:
<disp-quote>
<p>I’m pretty convinced that the big majority of Bulgarian citizens believe or have a confidence in the media, and they admit what they read or hear on the radio or see on television as the strict truth, the reality of things. The media here have a big, big influence on how public opinion is formed. (Bulgarian politician)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Therefore, it becomes important to incorporate media institutions into the network and to have “friendly” people in the media with whom favors/resources can be exchanged at critical junctures, in particular at elections.</p>
<p>However, many actors also point to the fact that political elites sometimes are more sensitive to media opinion than the public is, for example (as noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1940161212454329">Davis 2003</xref>: 672-73), and one Latvian interviewee also neatly captures how clientelistic linkages have purposes beyond electoral politics:
<disp-quote>
<p>If company A has a conflict with company B, and it is covered by a newspaper that is linked to company A through their owner, company C—a very common situation in Latvia, then the friendly company, company A, will be presented in a much broader way, there would be a picture with smiling company people, the owner of company B might also be represented with a picture, but with a very un-pretty face, and there will always be selective quotes used for information, court proceedings quoted selectively, and so on. (Latvian editor-in-chief)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The conflict described here is not political per se, but it is still clear that the framework of the actors is one where informal clientelistic networks count on media favors to enact their conflicts. Media institutions are often perceived as linked to particular political and/or business interests, which in turn determines how the media are seen as fitting into the overarching clientelistic system. A Hungarian interviewee, when asked why commercial radio station licensing was such a hot-button issue for political parties (considering that commercial radio in Hungary is not very profitable, nor does it carry very much political content), responded,
<disp-quote>
<p>How shall I put it? If it’s not mine, it will be other people’s. Even if I don’t have any visible benefit having it, it’s better if other people can’t have it. If a company is not my client, it must be someone else’s. Sometimes companies cannot win an application for the simple reason that they are believed to be linked with other parties. (Hungarian politician)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This kind of zero-sum attitude, where media institutions may be seen as of limited utility but are still fought over as it is important to deny resources to rival networks, was touched on by many more interviewees from across the region.</p>
<p>Control over the media by the network is commonly enacted at a high elite-to-elite level, where the media owners either are linked personally to political/business elites or are themselves members of the political/business elite:
<disp-quote>
<p>I don’t see these connections so much between individual journalists and individual politicians, even if both sides sometimes try to establish them. However, I can see them on the level of media owners. (Slovakian politician)</p>
<p>And the private media owners, and all the managers of the public media, are in very close contact with politicians. So most of the journalists are forced to follow some kind of policy, the policy of the newspaper or the television channel. (Bulgarian expert on political parties)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This phenomenon of media “moguls” or “oligarchs” is well known in many CEE nations. They personify the clientelistic linkages between media and politics. These persons own media mainly to protect their own business interests by intervening in politics. Some examples include Aivars Lembergs in Latvia (who has wide-ranging business interests including shipping and petrochemicals, is mayor of the city of Ventspils, and is linked to the party Union of Greens and Farmers as well as the newspaper <italic>Neatkariga Rita Aviza</italic>), Dan Voiculescu and Dan “Dinu” Patriciu in Romania (both have media holdings and other business interests and are closely linked to political parties, Voiculescu being the leader of the Conservative Party and Patriciu being a former MP of the National Liberal Party), and Irena Krasteva in Bulgaria (who owns the New Bulgaria Media Group and is widely believed to be acting as a proxy for banking magnate Tsvetan Vasilev and is linked to the Turkish minority party Movement for Human Rights and Freedoms through Krasteva’s son, an MP) (for more detailed information on these moguls, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1940161212454329">Bajomi-Lazar 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1940161212454329">Dreifelds 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1940161212454329">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1940161212454329">Örnebring 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1940161212454329">Gross 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1940161212454329">Štětka 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>While holding on to political power and maintaining political links are central concerns for such moguls (and thus using the media for elite-to-mass communication to secure votes), their uses of the media go beyond this. For example, securing lucrative state contracts is an important method of state resource extraction, and so the networks of these moguls must also ensure that their businesses get positive coverage (and avoid negative coverage) to be in a position to get such contracts. The “targets” of such communication are not members of the public (who are not directly involved in public tender decision making) but rather other policy makers, administrators, and decision makers (see the section on advertorials).</p>

<title>The Media as Clientelistic Resource: Advertorials and Kompromat</title>
<p>The most persistent use of media by informal clientelistic networks instead seems to be two practices that have as much or more to do with the elite-to-elite communication needs of such networks than their elite-to-mass communication needs. These two practices are <italic>advertorials</italic> and <italic>kompromat</italic>.</p>
<p>Advertorials are a form of media content oriented toward <italic>promotion</italic> and <italic>positive</italic> content, whereas <italic>kompromat</italic> (a Russian word but widely understood in the entire CEE region) refers to a form of media content oriented toward <italic>smearing</italic> and <italic>negativity</italic>. Both forms of content are nontransparent, that is, they are commonly either paid for or ordered by political or business interests, but for all intents and purposes appear like regular news content.</p>
<p>A typical advertorial could for example be a news article about how a road-work project has finished on time, with one or more representatives of the company responsible for the project quoted saying positive things about the process and how happy they are to be able to contribute to the infrastructural development of the nation. In other words, the advertorial is essentially an advertisement for a company or political party but is presented as a regular news article.</p>
<p>A typical kompromat feature would report how a web page (whose provenance and ownership is often unclear) alleges that a politician has taken bribes; the politician would then be confronted with these statements and asked to confirm or deny, whereas the online accusers are not quoted and generally remain anonymous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1940161212454329">Ledeneva 2006</xref>: 75; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1940161212454329">Koltsova 2006</xref>: 108). In many ways, advertorials and kompromat are thus similar but represent different informational orientations: an advertorial is positive, a kompromat is negative.</p>
<p>Advertorials thus refer to the practice of journalists and/or news organizations taking money (often offered through the intermediary of a PR professional or PR company) to write puff pieces for businesses or political interests without indicating that the content is in fact paid for. Other terms for this include <italic>black PR, hidden advertising</italic>, and <italic>paid news</italic>—this practice has been well documented in research (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1940161212454329">Bærug 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1940161212454329">Erjavec 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1940161212454329">Erjavec and Kovačič 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1940161212454329">Harro-Loit and Saks 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1940161212454329">Nevinskaitė 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1940161212454329">TI Lithuania 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1940161212454329">Tsetsura 2005</xref>). The existence of the practice in at least one country (Lithuania) has also been independently confirmed through documents leaked via WikiLeaks (the so-called U.S. embassy cables), in which U.S. embassy staff reported conversations with Lithuanian politicians discussing fairly detailed “price lists” of what buying positive coverage in the two main national newspapers (<italic>Lietuvos rytas</italic> and <italic>Respublica</italic>) cost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1940161212454329">Jegelevicius 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>According to the most extensive academic studies of this phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1940161212454329">Bærug 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1940161212454329">Erjavec 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1940161212454329">Erjavec and Kovačič 2010</xref>), the media are clearly the subordinate party in the production of advertorials: the initiative almost always comes from the advertisers (“advertisers” in this instance also include politicians), and it is then up to the media actors whether they will refuse or accept payment.</p>
<p>A few interviewees alleged that some media outlets were purposefully “neutral” vis-à-vis clientelistic networks to be able to capitalize on advertorial production from the widest possible range of sources, though if the WikiLeaks documents are to be believed, “discounts” for members of parties who are clientelistically linked to the media owners or to senior editors are also available (Lithuanian Social Democratic Party members allegedly have to pay less than Labour Party members; again, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1940161212454329">Jegelevicius 2011</xref>). While this practice thus strictly speaking may not require clientelistic exchanges (i.e., the politician may not need to be linked to the same network as the journalist—she or he just has to pay the fee), the interviews as well as earlier research seems to indicate that having some kind of linkage (between a politician or a PR intermediary and a “friendly” journalist/editor) is the norm (also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1940161212454329">Erjavec and Kovačič 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1940161212454329">TI Lithuania 2007</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>Kompromat</italic> is a Russian word that has no direct English translation; it “refers to discrediting information that can be collected, stored, traded, or used strategically across all domains: political, electoral, legal, professional, judicial, media, or business” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1940161212454329">Ledeneva 2006</xref>: 58). Ledeneva closely links media kompromat (i.e., kompromat that appears in the media) to affecting public opinion in election times (i.e., elite-to-mass communication), and she also notes that while other forms of kompromat consist of actual evidence of wrongdoing (i.e., evidence that would stand up in court), media kompromat may be based on rumor, innuendo, or gossip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1940161212454329">Ledeneva 2006</xref>: 69-86; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1940161212454329">Koltsova 2006</xref>: 108). From the descriptions of the phenomenon among interviewees, it is clear that it is nowhere near as widespread in the studied countries as it is in Russia, but it does exist and is recognized:
<disp-quote>
<p>The climate in general of the media is the climate of war, with insinuations, different mixtures of real scandals and fake ones, and the arena of media have become some kind of place for psychological warfare where you fight your opponents, not just trying to advertise how good you are yourself but also to buy fake stories, humiliating stories about your opponents, and what is worse is that the system, the scheme of participation, is that the media themselves propose to do these ugly things, <italic>Respublika</italic> and <italic>Lietuvos rytas</italic> as well as other newspapers. (Lithuanian expert on elites)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This quote highlights the elite-to-elite nature of much of these so-called kompromat wars—or rather how elite-to-mass communication interacts with elite-to-elite communication. By turning public opinion against someone, you may prevent that person from being appointed to a post you desire (either for yourself or for one of your clients), for example.</p>
<p>Kompromat can range from the relatively mild to very destructive—the following two examples illustrate this range:
<disp-quote>
<p>Occasionally, I remember some time ago a yellow newspaper published a photo of a guy who they believed looked like me. Some resemblance, yes, he had a beard and a bald head but that’s all the resemblance, and he was playing in a casino, and they published his photo and a photo of me sitting in Parliament, there was some distant similarity but . . . they asked, how is it that this guy can be in two places simultaneously, sitting in the Saeima and playing in the casino? It’s stupid. (Latvian politician)</p>
<p>I had strong reasons to suspect that [another political actor] was behind an attack on me personally, he lost to me in [our] constituency [in the parliamentary elections], and the fact that I do not have any children of my own was used to imply that I was a homosexual, even though I have been married for six years, and various links to . . . friendships were used to demonstrate that these people were my male partners, and this was done via a website that was registered in the United States, so it is impossible to take any legal action, it was an awful insinuation. . . . And this was done in public, it was picked up by some other papers and journals, and no legal way to get out of this. So not only can your private life be used against you, but your private life can also be fabricated with such subtlety that the legal advice I got was that it was impossible to bring libel law to bear. (Lithuanian politician)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1940161212454329">1</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The first case may be seen as an example of kompromat aimed at diminishing the reputation of a politician in the eyes of the public (elite to mass), whereas the second example clearly originated in a personal, elite-level conflict (elite to elite). Some interviewees note that kompromat is also a kind of marketable good:
<disp-quote>
<p>For example, certain scandals are revealed at the “correct” moment only. . . . It is also not entirely clear how the journalists get to their sources, which can create certain form of dependence. When you work with a material which somebody gives you secretly, you are always playing part in somebody else’s game. I often feel that the “revealing of [corruption] scandals” is not so much a service to the society, but a good product to be sold in the first place. (Czech politician 2)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This quote also hints that political communicators in Central and Eastern Europe are as adept as their Western colleagues in using leaks strategically to release information for maximum impact. The phenomenon of scandals breaking at the “correct” moment is certainly not limited to postcommunist nations.</p>
<p>It is important to note that while incidences of both advertorials and kompromat in the news media may increase in the run-up to an election (as suggested by several interviewees), such content is a constant feature in most news media outlets and is not limited to election times. In fact, there are many features of a clientelistic system that make advertorials and kompromat attractive tools in exchanges and situations that do not involve voters at all. Advertorials and kompromat can be weapons in conflicts within a clientelistic network over “promotion” in the network hierarchy: advertorials can for example be used to raise the profile of a politician within a party or coalition to strengthen his or her position for ministerial or other senior appointments or to ensure that clients linked to the politician or his or her network get certain appointments or strengthen their position for such appointments (and conversely, kompromat can be used against opponents in such conflicts). Such practices were reported by some interviewees in Lithuania, for example. It is clear that in such cases the main targets of the communication are other elites rather than the general voting public.</p>
<p>As has already been pointed out, positioning companies connected to the informal clientelistic network so that they can extract state resources via state contracts (or extract EU resources via EU structural funds) is another important communication goal. The practice of creating advertorials for specific companies as well as negative coverage of business rivals (a kind of “corporate kompromat”) was reported in Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, and Slovakia, and has been independently confirmed by other studies in the cases of Bulgaria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1940161212454329">Voltmer and Dobreva 2009</xref>: 19-20), Lithuania (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1940161212454329">Muravjov 2009</xref>), and Slovenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1940161212454329">Erjavec 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1940161212454329">Erjavec and Kovačič 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1940161212454329">Hrvatin and Petković 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1940161212454329">Voltmer and Dobreva (2009</xref>: 13-17) further link this practice closely to the strong culture of informal networks (though they do not use the specific term <italic>clientelism</italic>) in Bulgaria. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1940161212454329">Hrvatin and Petković (2008</xref>: 76-104) also clearly demonstrate that advertorials and other irregularities in the advertising market are strongly linked to informal networks centered around the major political parties in Slovenia. Again, the target of such communication is not the voting public but rather other elite members, primarily policy makers and those who are involved in decision making on public tenders and state contracts.</p>
<p>In summary, advertorial and kompromat techniques are important tools not only for elite-to-mass communication but also for elite-to-elite communication. Key goals are, for example, promotion within the network hierarchy, ensuring the appointment of clientelistic allies to key positions (and conversely, preventing the appointment of rival network members), and ensuring preferential treatment for allied companies.</p>

<title>Concluding Remarks</title>
<p>The clientelistic system in any given country may be widespread but is rarely all-encompassing. Critical, investigative journalism sometimes gets done, revealing the practices of clientelistic networks and thus fulfilling the Fourth Estate role assumed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1940161212454329">Kitschelt (2007</xref>: 307). Investigative journalism is clearly fragile in the region, however, and it cannot be assumed that the media as a rule will be a force acting against clientelism: this study found more evidence to support <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1940161212454329">Meyer’s (2006</xref>: 53-54) view that the media are complicit in the informal clientelistic exchanges common to the region. While one might for example cite the recent revelation of the so-called Gorilla scandal in Slovakia (where intelligence was leaked allegedly based on high-level wiretaps on leading political and business elites, revealing extensive corruption and clientelism in the 1998–2006 Mikuláš Dzurinda government—businessmen allegedly bribed politicians to win public tenders, with the active involvement of the then head of the state privatization agency; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1940161212454329">Economist 2012</xref>) as an example of successful investigative journalism revealing wrongdoings, but one can just as well see it as a sign of the strength and influence of the clientelistic networks in question that these files had circulated among politicians and media insiders since 2009, without any media organization acting on the information, until they were published online in 2012 and freelance investigative journalist Thomas Nicholson (a Canadian living in Slovakia), who had been trying to draw attention to the story since 2009, finally was able to publish the information (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1940161212454329">Buláková 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1940161212454329">Euractiv 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1940161212454329">Economist 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>This article confirms earlier findings that clientelistic links between political elites and the media do exist on the top level, mainly between politicians and media owners—or in the form of media owners who may themselves be politicians. The fact that battles over media resources often intensify when an election draws near clearly demonstrates that the media are <italic>seen</italic> as having an important role in elite-to-mass communication. However, as these assumed effects on the electorate often fail to materialize, clientelistic power games involving the media take on a zero-sum character, where it is as important to deny the media resource to your rival as it is controlling it yourself.</p>
<p>The media are also clearly integrated into the clientelistic system as a tool or resource used for the <italic>elite-to-elite communication needs</italic> of clientelistic networks. Advertorials are used for promoting the interests of the own network and kompromat is used to smear rival network members. Such practices occur with regularity outside the election cycle as they serve other network needs, for example, positioning allied companies and actors to get public tenders; placing allies in strategic positions in policy making, the legislature, and public administration; and generally affecting policy making and policy decisions.</p>
<p>This study demonstrates the limits of the traditional political science definition of clientelism in explaining the place of the media within the clientelistic systems of the CEE region. The traditional definition can and does account for the use of media as an elite-to-mass communication tool (particularly in elections), and we have seen that this is still seen as important by politicians of the region. Other uses of the media as clientelistic resources as suggested by traditional studies, that is, for patronage and direct financial resource extraction, are not as widespread and are limited to particular countries (Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania). A wider definition of clientelism, viewing the phenomenon as more encompassing and linked to informality and corruption, better accounts for the widespread use of media for elite-to-elite communication, mainly through the linked practices of advertorials and kompromat.</p>

<p>The “politician” category consists mainly of parliamentarians but also includes a few cabinet ministers. The “political communicator/PR” category consists of people who work in the PR/press/communication offices of political parties, who work in the PR/press/communication offices of ministries, and who represent the PR industry in general. The “media actors” category includes media owners, senior media managers, senior editors/editors-in-chief, senior journalists/columnists, representatives of journalists’ unions, representatives of media employers’ organizations, and representatives of advertising associations. The key “expert” categories include political scientists, media scholars, media economists, experts on political transparency, and experts on corporate governance. The “regulators” category includes representatives from self-regulatory bodies (i.e., media ethics councils/press councils), from various official media-regulatory bodies, and from general telecoms and competition regulators. In the case of regulators, the varying number of interviewees in each country largely reflects the different regulatory contexts (some countries lack some regulatory bodies, others have several overlapping regulatory bodies). The low number of politician interviewees in Estonia, as well as the slightly lower interviewees in total, was due to a computer crash that wiped out half of the interviews conducted in 2011.
