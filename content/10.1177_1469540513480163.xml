<abstract>
<p>This article focuses on examining and understanding the way motherhood and babyhood are constituted in the midst of cultural practice and particularly though consumption as a fundamental and constitutive element of modern-day definitions and understandings of motherhood and babyhood. More specifically, the article focuses on how middle-class first-time (to be) Greek Cypriot mothers acquire a sense of motherhood and simultaneously construct notions of babyhood as their pregnancies unfold; how the experience of pregnancy is lived and perceived by expectant mothers as a state of anxiety and a condition of risk; and, finally, how all these processes are mediated by consumption broadly conceived. Findings of this qualitative study show that the experience of pregnancy for these women was associated with feelings of acute anxiety for the amelioration of which they engaged in a variety of consumptive practices, especially medically related, which served to further institute consumption as a constitutive element of ‘motherhood proper’.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1469540513480163" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Any exploration of motherhood requires inadvertently a focus on its relational counterpart – babyhood or childhood. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1469540513480163">Murphy (2007: 106)</xref> argues, it is childhood that is prior to motherhood as a social category and that is why ideological discourses on motherhood are primarily informed by what are framed as ‘children’s needs’. Moreover, in the contemporary world neither motherhood nor babyhood can be fully grasped without the constitutive role of consumption in relation to both. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1469540513480163">Thompson et al. (2011: 8)</xref> explain, it is the market itself that provides for most mothers a ‘common culture of motherhood’ and that subsequently frames their otherwise diverse journeys and situated experiences of motherhood; maternal identity is defined within this context of consumptive practices as these unfold during the experience of pregnancy, themselves situated within larger ideologies of consumption that circumscribe individual choice (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1469540513480163">Martens et al., 2004</xref>: 168; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1469540513480163">Taylor, 2008</xref>: 51). It is within this ‘common culture of motherhood’ that shapes their own desires and their expected babies’ needs that pregnant women find themselves and feel called upon <italic>to be good at being mothers</italic>; in this sense<italic>,</italic> the maternal project is fundamentally carried out in the sphere of consumption, be it of commodities, information, or expert advice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1469540513480163">Thompson et al., 2011</xref>: 13, 18; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1469540513480163">Harris et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1469540513480163">Taylor et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Drawing on the theoretical assumption that socially speaking mothers ‘make’ babies and ‘babies’ make mothers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1469540513480163">Miller, 1997</xref>), our article focuses on examining and comprehending the way motherhood and babyhood are constituted in the midst of cultural practice and particularly through consumption as a fundamental and constitutive element of modern-day definitions and understandings of motherhood and babyhood. Our discussion draws from an ongoing longitudinal project (see below) that studies the two concepts – motherhood and babyhood – side-by-side and in relation to one another on the basis of two assumptions: (1) that both notions are part and parcel of the same larger process which gives both their respective meanings; and (2) that the social construction of motherhood and babyhood begin long before the child is born, at the stage of pregnancy or, as some have argued, even before. This article focuses on how first-time (to be) mothers acquire a sense of motherhood and simultaneously construct notions of babyhood as their pregnancies unfold; how the experience of pregnancy is lived and perceived by expectant mothers as a state of anxiety and a condition of risk; and, finally, how these processes are mediated by consumption broadly conceived. We situate our discussion at the intersection of theorizations of the medicalization of pregnancy (and the discourses of risk inherent within it), social constructions of motherhood, and the consumptive relations that envelop the technological mediations between the mother, the fetus, and a medically significant other (usually the gynecologist or the sonographer).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1469540513480163"><title>The theoretical context</title>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1469540513480163">Fletcher (2006: 35)</xref> has argued, the naturalization of reproduction (i.e. as a fundamentally biological process) has limited its investigation in relation to consumption. Consumption is, of course, implicated in reproduction in a very direct and obvious way; that is, through the way that pregnant women choose to consume or refrain from consuming certain products (e.g. certain kinds of food or medicine) and less visibly through the way they consume expert medical advice and diagnostic and reproductive services on behalf of the fetus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1469540513480163">Fletcher, 2006</xref>: 27; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1469540513480163">Taylor, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite the common popular discourse about the naturalness of reproduction, the medicalization of pregnancy is for many women in the western world a taken-for-granted condition. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1469540513480163">Lazarus (1994: 25–26)</xref> explains, though women in her study referred to childbirth as a natural process, they also accepted the view that they had to depend on expert medical knowledge and technology to make sure that everything would go well and that the baby would be born healthy. Moreover, though they had limited, if any, control over the medical procedures they had to undergo, they still felt responsible for their outcome. Feminists have argued that the appropriation, medicalization, and pathologization of pregnancy and childbirth needs to be put in historical context and within a patriarchal model of gender relations where men seek to exercise more power and control over women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1469540513480163">Cahill, 2001</xref>). Among others, this has been facilitated by the development of gynecology as a medical specialty and its association with obstetrics resulting from advancements in medical technology and the trend towards the medical recognition and labeling of psychological problems experienced during pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1469540513480163">Cahill, 2001</xref>: 335, 338–339). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1469540513480163">Lee (2006)</xref> illustrates how a variety of illnesses related to pregnancy have been ‘invented’ or recognized in recent years such as <italic>tokophobia</italic> (‘an unreasonable fear of childbirth’) and <italic>maternal anxiety and mood imbalance (MAMI)</italic> to account for pregnant women’s experiences. This contributes in its own way to women seeing pregnancy as a medical problem that needs to be attended to by experts, namely doctors and obstetricians.</p>
<p>Inadvertently, this is seen as disempowering women of their agency and of the control they can potentially have over their experience of pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1469540513480163">Teman, 2003</xref>: 81). However, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1469540513480163">Root and Browner (2001)</xref> show, how women respond to the medicalization of their pregnancies can and does range from compliance to resistance. For some women resistance may signify a turn to midwifery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1469540513480163">Parry, 2008</xref>), while for others, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1469540513480163">Teman (2003)</xref> shows in her study of surrogate motherhood in Israel, it may mean creative use of their agency from within the existing medicalized framework that they operate to serve their own purposes.</p>
<p>The almost complete absence of children as well as their caretakers (mothers in particular) from studies of consumption and consumption theory at large, pinpoints an orientation that fails to acknowledge the constitutive role that children play in consumer culture, indirectly through their caretakers during pregnancy and while they are too young to exercise their direct influence on consumption choices, and more directly later on when they are able to exercise their agency as shoppers themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1469540513480163">Cook, 2008</xref>: 221). When fetuses/babies/children are brought into the picture, the corresponding role of their caretakers and of the mothers in particular becomes central to any analysis of consumer culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1469540513480163">Cook, 2008</xref>: 222). This shifts the focus away from consumption as an individualistic act by autonomous, independent consumer-actors (i.e. mother and child), towards a relational act that involves diverse interactions, social contexts and subject positions all placed within an overall discourse of caring (for the unborn baby or the family) where the mother’s consumptive choices are made with others in mind (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1469540513480163">Cook, 2008</xref>: 234–235, 237), thus constituting a transformation for the woman, from being an individual consumer to becoming a mother-as-consumer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1469540513480163">Taylor, 2000</xref>: 403; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1469540513480163">Taylor et al., 2004</xref>). We argue that it is principally through consumption that pregnant women come to act out their emerging role as mothers both for themselves and for others, be it the fetus, their families and friends, or society at large. Though the needs of the fetus might be interpreted primarily through the medium of medical knowledge, they are ultimately the outcome of the ‘choices’ mothers make to consume or refrain from consuming such knowledge. These choices should in turn be seen as embedded within particular cultural and historical contexts that render them (and not others) as possible meaningful ways of being in the world. As Layne shows, even in cases of pregnancy loss, women engage in consumptive practices (i.e. buying and displaying things for the baby) that allow them to imagine their lost babies as ‘real babies’ and to construct identities for themselves as ‘real mothers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1469540513480163">Layne, 2000</xref>: 321)</p>
<p>It is in this sense that ‘Consumption becomes not simply a choice about goods and services, but a choice about a style of life’ and about a particular identity image that a mother wishes to have (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1469540513480163">Martens et al., 2004</xref>: 168). This inadvertently creates anxiety, as one tries to make the ‘right choices’, that is, those choices which allow one to reduce anxiety and be accepted in the desired social group. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1469540513480163">Kringeland and Moller (2006: 190)</xref> argue ‘Normality, complication and risk are central concepts in modern maternity care’ and ‘Childbearing is not expected to be a normal part of life, but as nine months of risk.’ As a result, notions of health risks leave little room for pregnant women in contemporary society to avoid medical intervention during pregnancy and childbirth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1469540513480163">Possamai-Inesedy, 2006</xref>). Drawing on the work of Beck and Giddens, who see risk as a force of social change, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1469540513480163">Possamai-Inesedy (2006)</xref> argues that expectant mothers draw on a risk discourse that defines pregnancy and childbirth as medical events and though the risks are rarely real, they feel compelled to act responsibly and to minimize such perceived risks through monitoring their pregnancy and birth medically. During the process, the consumption of authoritative medical advice and high-tech tests and procedures is used to establish in a scientifically convincing manner that the baby is indeed healthy and normal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1469540513480163">Gammeltoft, 2007</xref>). Paradoxically, it is this scientific–technological nexus that simultaneously reinforces the notion of risk in pregnancy and the realization that there is no pregnancy that is absolutely risk-free (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1469540513480163">Harris et al., 2004</xref>: 38–39). In fact, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1469540513480163">Kringeland and Moller (2006: 188)</xref> suggest, medical screening examinations may end up increasing pregnant women’s anxiety, sense of helplessness and dependency on medical technology.</p>
<p>Anxiety, in this sense, is fundamental to the modern-day maternal project: to be a proper and good mother is to be anxious; to be without anxiety is to lack the motivation to address the risks inherent in having a baby. The pregnant woman is motivated to reduce the anxiety she experiences about her baby’s health by monitoring her pregnancy and acting responsibly. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1469540513480163">Remennick (2006)</xref> observes in her research among Jewish Israeli women, compliance with (and therefore consumption of) all medical requirements and technological means in order to rule out a non-positive result of pregnancy is increasingly seen as an act of a ‘good mother’. Depending on prevalent context-specific social and cultural perceptions of physical ability, research tells us that in fact such discourses of ‘good motherhood’ are entangled with social attitudes towards disability, at times even verging on the side of eugenics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1469540513480163">Mitchell and Georges, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1469540513480163">Remennick, 2006</xref>). Coupled with unreserved endorsements of prenatal tests by physicians in the context of increased privatization and commercialization of health care, dominant prescriptions of good motherhood, and a growing mode of living dictated by the consumer economy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1469540513480163">Gammeltoft, 2007</xref>), mothers’ anxieties drive their motivation to consume sonograms (and genetic tests) not only to gain pleasure out of ‘seeing the baby’ but to also ‘know’ the baby is ‘perfect’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1469540513480163">Harris et al., 2004</xref>). This model of ‘individualized risk management’ puts a great deal of responsibility in the hands of the pregnant woman as an individual who must follow closely all the medical advice and carry out all the necessary diagnostic tests to reduce, to the maximum extent possible, any potential risks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1469540513480163">Harris et al., 2004</xref>: 31).</p>
<p>For many women who live in the developed world and certainly for the women who participated in our study there is a great deal of trust in expert medical knowledge and technology and a sense of security and protection from risk that comes from participating in such a regime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1469540513480163">Kringeland and Moller, 2006</xref>: 186). For instance, diagnostic tests (e.g. sonograms) serve, apart from their obvious role in identifying potential fetal problems, another role, that of reducing mothers’ anxieties about the health of the baby and reassuring them that all is well while also providing them with an opportunity to develop a relationship and bond with the baby (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1469540513480163">Taylor, 2000</xref>: 406–407; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1469540513480163">Thompson et al., 2011</xref>: 198).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1469540513480163">Kroløkke (2010: 139–140)</xref> reviews three models for interpreting the use of visualization technologies in pregnancy: (1) the technocratic model, which emphasizes the role of technology and to a lesser extent of the doctor-interpreter; (2) the holistic model, which emphasizes women’s perspectives and embodied experiences of their pregnancies; and (3) the consumer model, where pregnant women choose to consume those pregnancy and birthing experiences they wish to have and which fulfill their desired notions of motherhood. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1469540513480163">Kroløkke (2010: 142)</xref> borrows the term ‘biotourism’ from Sawchuck (2000) to illustrate what she terms ‘the visual consumption of the fetus’. Visual technologies such as 3D/4D ultrasound allow pregnant women and guests to travel metaphorically as ‘tourists’ into the bioscapes of the inner body to see the baby and transform themselves into mothers, fathers, and so on. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1469540513480163">Layne (2003)</xref> has shown, this is even true in cases of pregnancy loss where parents use ultrasound images to provide proof that there was indeed a real baby and that they, therefore, are truly parents albeit of a lost child.</p>
<p>In her analysis on the use of sonograms during pregnancy, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1469540513480163">Taylor (2000: 392)</xref> seeks to connect reproduction with consumption by putting forth the argument that ‘(1) reproduction has increasingly come to be constructed as a matter of consumption; and in the process (2) the fetus is constructed more and more as a “commodity” at the same time and through the same means that it is also constructed more and more as a “person” ’ (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1469540513480163">Taylor, 2008</xref>: 21, 64–65). Drawing on the work of various scholars, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1469540513480163">Taylor (2000: 392–393)</xref> explores the analogy between production and reproduction as an entry point for understanding the consumptive relationships that unfold between the doctor, the pregnant woman and the fetus during pregnancy. Taylor argues that the relationships that exist in the world of industrial production become reflected in the management of reproduction where ‘Doctors have come to be positioned as “managers” relative to reproduction, fetuses appear as valuable “products,” and women are like reproductive “workers” ’. Put another way, doctors intervene in the course of the pregnancy to manage the work of pregnant women by exercising quality control which ensures that what is produced (i.e. the baby) is of high quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1469540513480163">Taylor, 2000</xref>: 394). In theory, at least, the medicalized model, through its provision for prenatal genetic testing, allows for the possibility of selecting the ‘perfect baby’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1469540513480163">Remennick, 2006</xref>). The process results in the commodification of both the pregnancy experience and the fetus, which are turned into commodities that are to be consumed in the marketplace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1469540513480163">Taylor, 2000</xref>: 415). It was this exact nexus of motherhood, babyhood and consumption we set out to explore, employing a frame and a methodological design to encompass experiences from in utero to toddlerhood.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1469540513480163" sec-type="methods"><title>Methodology</title>
<p>This study draws on qualitative methods of inquiry particularly aiming at eliciting participants’ views, notions, and interpretations of their experience of/with motherhood during their pregnancy. It adopts a longitudinal endeavor covering three discrete phases with a span of roughly 2.5 years devoted to working with each participant: phase 1: during pregnancy; phase 2: during the first year of the baby’s life; and phase 3: during the second year of the baby’s life. For the purposes of the current discussion only data collected through interviews during the first phase of the project will be presented and analyzed.</p>
<p>Specifically, in-depth, semi-structured personal interviews with 15 Greek Cypriot pregnant women who were in the third trimester of their first pregnancy were conducted in the period November 2010 to January 2012 and constitute part of an ongoing analysis. The specific gestational period was selected because by that time prospective mothers were expected to have gone through the experience of most tests and baby scans and to have been engaging in finalizing their preparations for the arrival of the baby. Interviews were arranged at a place and time of the participants’ convenience, which in most cases ended up being their home. Participants were recruited through snowball and purposive sampling and were of White, middle class, Greek Cypriot background with a median age of 31 years old. With the exception of one who was living with her partner, all women were married and residing with their partner in privately owned housing, either an apartment or a house. The fact that one of us (ET) was also in her third trimester of pregnancy during data collection significantly aided the recruitment of participants and the building of rapport between them and the researchers. All participants were fully informed about the study before they provided their written consent to participate in it while detailed written information was provided to all to assure them about our commitment to protecting their anonymity and keeping all data confidential. It was also reiterated to all participants that they had the right to withdraw from the study at any point without any penalties.</p>
<p>Thematic analysis was utilized for the analysis of the interviews, which allowed the identification of patterns and themes in mothers’ experiences and their perceptions of motherhood and babyhood as these related to their consumptive practices and their ideas over consumption. In this sense, emphasis was given to the ways pregnant women talked about their emerging role as mothers and their relationship with the baby during the pregnancy, their fears and anxieties, and their consumptive acts and choices, especially as these related to medical tests and procedures or other medically related decisions.</p>

<sec id="sec5-1469540513480163"><title>The ‘risky’ business of becoming a (good) mother</title>
<p>For most women we talked to, the initial reaction to finding out they were pregnant was one of shock. This would soon give way to a reported feeling of happiness and joy at the realization that they were going to be mothers. But as soon as they were able to make sense of this new reality, for many a feeling of anxiety would also surface. This could be a generalized feeling of worry about all the unknowns that were ahead of them, or more specific worries about the sense of responsibility that comes with being a mother and the life changes that one has to make or anxieties about the course of the pregnancy and the health of the baby. As Elena explains, her initial reaction to finding out she was pregnant was a roller coaster of emotions: ‘I was happy, initially I was happy, then I became anxious, then I was happy again, then I became anxious again [laughs] …’ Katerina’s reflections below are illustrative of the kind of anxiety that might accompany women when they first find out they are pregnant:<disp-quote>
<p>I was feeling anxiety […] because I have to start being careful, because […] I need to move [to a new house], and what if I cannot move, what if I have to stay in bed? In other words, negative thoughts started surfacing. […] I felt I should not be very enthusiastic. First of all, I had to get over the [first] three months to be sure, it was fear based on what you hear from here and there that you have to be careful during the first three months, and about the responsibilities that await you. […] And I felt this pressure, that I had to be careful about my diet […] and I had panic attacks and then I would get over them and I was happy because that is what I wanted [i.e. to have a baby] from my life. […] I also think about the distant future, that is, about what I can offer to my baby, if s/he will be happy […] And if my baby will be totally healthy, if s/he will be OK. The unknown, the unknown scares me basically.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Though Katerina described herself as ‘a very anxious person’ and was perhaps one of the more extreme cases of reported anxiety, some form of anxiety and worry was reported by almost all the women. Rather than being a temporary or extreme reaction to the pregnancy news, it seems clear that anxiety was a defining marker and a fundamental feature of the maternal project. As Rena poignantly put it: ‘until the baby is born and all the necessary tests are performed by the pediatrician, you are always worried, but I think from the moment that you have a baby you won’t stop thinking [i.e. worrying]’.</p>
<p>In most women’s accounts, these anxieties were often linked to a heightened feeling of responsibility of a kind that these women experienced for the first time. They described this as the sense of responsibility that comes with carrying a baby and with the realization that you are creating a family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1469540513480163">Harris et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1469540513480163">Possamai-Inesedy, 2006</xref>). The realization that one’s individuality cannot be taken for granted gives rise to an acute sense of awareness about the existence of another person, namely the baby, whose life is now central to the mother’s existence and whose needs are prioritized over and above hers. As Nadia put it: ‘OK, I feel that I think about two [people] now. I feel that my plans are different, my priorities are different. Even when I think about some of my future plans, I always think about them also in relation to the baby.’ This heightened sense of responsibility towards the fetus is fed by strong cultural beliefs that the unborn baby is completely dependent on the mother, that what the mother does impacts the baby, and that it is the mother above all, through her own behavior, who has the ultimate responsibility for protecting the baby. Many of the pregnant women decided to make life changes that would allow them to play this protective role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1469540513480163">Possamai-Inesedy, 2006</xref>: 412). Such life changes included cutting down on work to avoid exhaustion, which they believed could have adverse effects on the baby, quitting smoking and avoiding smoky areas, avoiding dying their hair, eating healthier and avoiding certain kinds of food that may put the baby at risk (e.g. sushi, nuts, etc.), or driving slower and more carefully to avoid car accidents (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1469540513480163">Possamai-Inesedy, 2006</xref>: 412). As Katerina explains:<disp-quote>
<p>I feel the responsibility to take care of the baby, to give my child everything even while being in my womb, to be OK in terms of my diet, to avoid inhaling the smoke when my husband smokes (I ask him to go out of the house), to avoid drinking alcohol, not even a glass … I won’t drink it because you don’t know what might happen. He [i.e. the doctor] told me that if I have a headache I could take a Panadol but I do not, even if I have a headache because I do not want to influence in any negative way my child.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Perhaps unavoidably, to handle this acute sense of anxiety for the baby’s health, mothers turned to ‘science’, surrendering themselves and their babies, almost completely, to the gynecologist’s hands, the sonographer’s expertise and the tests’ ‘truth’.</p>

<sec id="sec6-1469540513480163"><title>Treating the patient: Consuming (the medicalized) pregnancy</title>
<p>To reiterate what we stated above, the feeling of anxiety for the baby’s health was a common thread in all prospective mothers’ justifications for requesting sick leave, monitoring their nutrition, adjusting their lifestyles and caring for themselves through the use of particular products especially marketed for pregnant women. It further appears to be linked to the idea of maternal sacrifice in the form of consuming or abstaining from consuming certain products, medicine or foods for the sake of the baby’s well-being reflecting the notion of pregnancy as a stage of vulnerability. For instance, discourses of vulnerability mixed with perceptions of risk were reflected in the choice some women made to stay at home for a certain period of time as a precaution against minor incidents, as they themselves characterized them, that occurred during their pregnancy.</p>
<p>Treating the pregnant woman as a patient who is unable to socially function at the fullest of her capacity and who needs to be curfewed and monitored derives from but also feeds into notions of pathologization of pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1469540513480163">Cahill, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1469540513480163">Lee, 2006</xref>). In our study, all mothers-to-be with the exception of one ascribed to the conception of pregnancy as an illness and subscribed to practices, technologies and ideologies that, as their pregnancy progressed, increasingly led to its medicalization. Only one of the women we talked to reflected on this model’s underlying assumptions and critiqued it, but even then she admitted that she could not escape from its prescriptions:<disp-quote>
<p>The fact that you have to do a thousand things let’s say … . I consider it [i.e. pregnancy] to be a much simpler thing and birth ended up being such a great science at the end of the day, but as a matter of fact you can’t avoid following them [i.e. what the doctors say]. It is an outcome of our times, you know. I am more of the opinion that we should let nature do what it knows how to do. On the other hand, when you are in this position [i.e. pregnant] you think ‘I should do everything [they tell me], to be sure’. Therefore, it is a bit of a dilemma. (Nadia)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>As she further explained, she would, for instance, prefer to take the vitamins she needs from natural foods. But she cannot allow herself to decide not to take the vitamin pills the doctor prescribes to her ‘just in case’ and at the end she follows exactly what the doctor tells her. The latter indeed appeared to be playing a definitive role in creating and sustaining a medicalized model of pregnancy and in cultivating bonds of dependency between the doctor and the ‘patient’, namely the pregnant woman who counted nearly blindingly on the expert’s advice.</p>
<p>In fact, out of all types of expert advice available to pregnant women, the doctor was clearly positioned as the most credible and trustworthy source. Many women, actually, sought information from other sources to enhance their understanding of pregnancy and their new, emerging role as mothers. Most attended seminars offered by professionals on topics such as nutrition, breathing, breastfeeding or baby care. Many also frequently visited, and some subscribed to, specific websites that provide information on fetal development, receiving weekly emails about the changes they should expect. And most read books on pregnancy, birth and babies as part of their overall effort to become educated about motherhood and to better prepare themselves to perform that role. Local knowledge was also tapped into, as other female friends or family members and acquaintances who were also pregnant or had recently given birth were frequently consulted and their experiences compared and evaluated in relation to their own. Yet, and despite the important role of these sources of information, for most pregnant women, it was the doctor who would ultimately have the most influential say on decisions having to do with their pregnancy.</p>
<p>Women were clear in their accounts that they followed closely what their doctor recommended whether that had to do with changes in their habits to ensure the health and safety of the baby and their own (e.g. consuming or avoiding particular kinds of food and drinks, following particular kinds of exercise regimes, quitting smoking, etc.) or whether it had to do with reaching important decisions that would affect themselves and the baby (e.g. performing an amniocentesis, having a cesarean, saving the umbilical cord, etc.). Thus, Xenia, who was over 35 years of age at the time, performed an amniocentesis following her doctor’s advice after her doctor realized that she was very worried about the possibility of her baby having Down syndrome. In fact, for all important medical issues and concerns, most women contacted their doctor, in whom they placed complete trust, and only subsequently consulted other sources of expert advice such as internet websites or books. In those cases where they first sought information from other sources, they always ended up taking the advice of their doctor. Nefeli for example prefers to look things up on the internet or refer to a book before she calls her doctor because she wants to be informed and ‘I want to do my own research’. Nevertheless, she explains that ‘it is different when the doctor provides you with information’ and that acquiring background information is not for her a replacement for the doctor’s advice. It is interesting to note that for some women, the trust they placed in their doctor was total. As Maria explained she followed faithfully her doctor’s advice: ‘Basically, I followed everything my gynecologist told me. That is, if she told me ‘Drink Coca-Cola and it’s fine’, I would. ‘ And later added: ‘I only did what my gynecologist told me. I did not try anything on my own.’</p>
<p>Other facets of the medicalized experience of pregnancy included the regular intake of supplements, such as vitamins, prescribed by doctors, the frequent tests and ultrasound exams women underwent during their pregnancy, and decisions regarding the type of childbirth and the saving of the umbilical cord, all practices of which were talked about by women as natural accompaniments of their pregnancy. For the most part the various blood and other tests women had to undergo during different phases of their pregnancy did not invoke any particular stress or worry. In fact, very few women spoke of anxiety in relation to these tests, which were conceived as part of the process of monitoring the baby’s and the mother’s health, especially so if these occurred after the ‘big’ as they called them (3D/4D) ultrasound exams typically occurring at the third and fifth month of gestation, during which the mother was reassured of the baby’s smooth development. Enveloped by discourses and practices of (minimizing) risk and motivated by the need to reduce their level of anxiety concerning the baby’s health, these expectant mothers never questioned or challenged the necessity and usefulness of the tests, their associated costs, or the doctors’ decision to prescribe them: ‘it [i.e. the test] did not stress me out, I consider it as a standard part of the process, I did not question it. When the doctor told me what to do next, I would do it’ (Nefeli).</p>
<p>Katerina’s words below are telling of the paradox whereby increased reliance on tests to eliminate any possibility of fetal abnormality, which to a large extent is being supported by physicians, spurs further anxiety (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1469540513480163">Taylor, 2008</xref>: 63) and dependency on them (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1469540513480163">Mitchell and Georges, 1997</xref> for similar results); they are also illustrative of the way as of the way compliance with medical requirements and use of all available technologies to ensure the ‘normality’ of the fetus has become part of the definition of ‘good motherhood’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1469540513480163">Remennick, 2006</xref>): ‘Whoever wants has them done [the tests] and I will do all of the ones she [gynecologist] tells me to do to make sure that … that I am OK. […] It [a non-positive outcome of pregnancy] can happen to anyone. It doesn’t only happen to some people, so why shouldn’t I be one of them to whom it can happen, let’s say?’</p>
<p>Mothers’ fixation on having ‘a perfect’ baby and the routinization of genetic and other tests form a stark contrast to the intensity of these women’s experience with the 3D/4D ultrasound exams that were reported to have been one of the most vivid, touching, stressful and powerful experiences of their pregnancy. Indeed, women spoke of these exams with mixed feelings of joy and worry, particularly referencing the effects of visualization on the personification of the baby (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1469540513480163">Harris et al., 2004</xref>: 40). As Rena explained, although she was very anxious and nervous during the two 3D/4D ultrasound tests, she also found them to be joyful experiences: ‘[I had] mixed feelings. That is [I felt] emotional because you can see the baby well let’s say, you can see the baby’s little face but also [I felt] a lot of anxiety. Until he [i.e. the doctor] tells you let’s say that her fingers are five, that everything is OK, there is a great deal of stress.’</p>
<p>The personification of the baby was the result of seeing a fully formed human body in such detail, which permitted not only the monitoring and measurement of her growth but mainly the detection of facial features that evoked family resemblance and was ‘evidence’ of the existence of the inseparable kinship/parental bond. For some women the baby’s visualization – a combination of the baby’s vision constructed by the mother, the image provided by the 3D/4D ultrasound exam and the mother’s interpretation of that image – functioned as a rite of passage for acquiring the social role of motherhood, either ascribed by others or embraced by the women themselves. As Maria explained:<disp-quote>
<p>[when] I heard a heartbeat, I said ‘OK, you have a baby’, but when I went [to do the 3D/4D test] and I saw it move and yawn and move its legs and hands, I haven’t to this day realized, ‘you have a baby’, I am trying to understand it but I [still] don’t. [Author B: So something clicked instantly]. Yes, right at the time when I went and saw it move and it was sleeping and it woke up and the doctor told him [inaudible], ‘come on, pumpkin, wake up so that mom and dad can see you’, right then, I don’t know, it hit me.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>And Dina recalls the enthusiasm she felt at the baby’s sight:<disp-quote>
<p>and as soon as he [the sonographer] placed that thing [the transducer] on my belly and I saw the baby and I saw first its little face as soon as he placed it [the transducer], and I say to him [the sonographer] ‘Holy Mary, what a beautiful baby! It takes after me’, I said to him [laughs]. […] You are thinking, ‘oh it’s a baby, it’s become a baby!’</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Through the sonogram, pregnancy becomes a reified mediated experience and the fetus a commoditized product to be consumed by the mother, close others (father, friends or relatives), and the sonographer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1469540513480163">Kroløkke, 2010</xref>). The visual encounter with the baby had the trifold function of providing a pleasurable experience for mothers and others to ‘meet’ her/him; constituting an opportunity for the mother to lay claim to responsible motherhood for managing pregnancy in a medically prescribed manner, itself a product of the risk discourse surrounding pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1469540513480163">Harris et al., 2004</xref>: 40–41; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1469540513480163">Taylor, 2008</xref>: 60), as well as operating as the means and medium for the simultaneous personification and commoditization of the fetus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1469540513480163">Taylor, 2000</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1469540513480163">Taylor (2008: 61)</xref> explains, prescribing a sonogram is also recognized as providing ‘psychological benefits’. On the one hand, this is done by encouraging bonding and compliance with medical prescriptions that potentially help ensure the health of the fetus. On the other hand, it is achieved by providing the pregnant mother with reassurance that the baby is indeed healthy. Interestingly, as Taylor further explains (2009: 65), the ever-present possibility that the sonogram will reveal an abnormality and the mother will be faced with a decision to abort or not turns an otherwise routine diagnostic experience into a highly anxious and agonizing one.</p>
<p>For many of the prospective mothers the first ‘big’, as they referred to it, 3D/4D ultrasound test around the third month of pregnancy also formed a turning point in going public with their pregnancy. Mothers-to-be spoke of how anticipating the particular exam induced great anxiety and how once reassured of the baby’s health they could finally announce their pregnancy to people who were not part of their inner or immediate family circle. Within the model of ‘individualized risk management’, carrying a less than ‘perfect baby’ reflects on the mother, who is held primarily responsible for the baby’s health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1469540513480163">Remennick, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1469540513480163">Harris et al., 2004</xref>), but that burden is exacerbated in a sociocultural context such as Cyprus where disability still carries a social stigma. Establishing, therefore, the baby’s ‘perfection’ was a condition that enabled prospective mothers to endure public scrutiny. As Niki explains:<disp-quote>
<p>When I was about to do the big ultrasound, the one they do at three months, I was very nervous, initially I hadn’t told anyone I was pregnant, I mean to friends, I didn’t make it public, I wanted to be completely sure and then [announce it]. And hearing all these things about all these syndromes that exist now, I was very stressed, but when it [the result] came out and it was all fine, OK.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Considering the less than insignificant cost (not only financial but also emotional) incurred by the tests and ultrasound exams (2D and 3D/4D) the participants underwent, it is interesting that it was barely mentioned as an issue by the expectant mothers. Indeed, in the context of naturalization of the medical approach to pregnancy, the underlying consumptive choices and practices these women assumed were rendered essentially invisible (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1469540513480163">Ivry and Teman, 2008</xref> for similar findings). In fact, the power of the ideology of ‘proper motherhood’ expressed in the prototype of the mother who takes all measures to minimize the risk of any unwanted outcome of the pregnancy sanctifies the measures’ (undisputed) adoption and constitutes their contemplation as consumptive practices essentially profane (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1469540513480163">Fletcher, 2006</xref>). Similarly, in unfolding their thoughts regarding childbirth, women generally expressed a desire for natural birth, which was seen as the most beneficial for the baby, for bonding with the baby and for providing for the baby, especially through breastfeeding. However, this was so only if it was seen as not endangering the mother and, principally, the child. In any alternate case, the preference for a caesarean birth was unquestionable with the substantial increase in cost appearing not to even slightly factor into the mother’s decision (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1469540513480163">Beckett, 2005</xref> for a discussion on mothers choosing caesarean). It would be safe to assume that such feelings represent the norm given that statistical data for the period 2007–11 in Cyprus show that 25.8 percent of live births (still births being 0.7%) occurred in public-sector healthcare facilities, leaving close to three out of four live births in the private healthcare sector. The extremely low percentage of births at home (0.1%) suggests that Greek Cypriot pregnant women do not, as a rule, consider alternatives to the medical approach while they, by and large, prefer private sector healthcare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1469540513480163">Statistical Service of Cyprus, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>It was only in the women’s narrative regarding the decision to save (or not) the umbilical cord with privately owned companies that the processes of normalizing and invisibilizing reproductive consumption were exposed and to a (limited) degree destabilized. At the time of the interview, the majority of women had already contemplated the option of paying a significant amount of money to private companies for the storage of the umbilical cord until their child becomes of legal age, with several of them having already decided in favor. Only two women had opted for donating the umbilical cord to a non-profit institution where it may be kept free of charge in a donor’s bank without, however, any guarantee as to the availability of the specimen: parents might be able to retrieve and use their donation provided that it has not been used by someone else by the time of request. Information garnered from the doctor, friends who had recently gone through the experience of pregnancy, and through third sources such as the internet or marketing leaflets was evaluated and weighted before reaching an informed decision. As women explained the logic behind their decisions, they frequently made reference to the high cost requested by private companies especially in conjunction to what they saw as questionable necessity, usefulness, usability and scientific credibility of the particular practice. They were also quite reflective on how businesses preyed on their fears and insecurities regarding the health of this or future babies and their emotional need to control any element of risk to the greatest degree possible, thus acknowledging the inconspicuous processes of reproductive consumerism. However, even though they were critical of the motives and the scientific basis of the claims made by the various private institutions, and recognized the issue as part of a marketing scheme promoted by particular businesses, many of these women could not escape from eventually succumbing to the emotive consumerism dictated by the urge to manage and confine (future) risk and live up to the expectations of ‘good’ motherhood. For these middle class Greek Cypriots, ‘good motherhood’ extended beyond the often romanticized motherly provision of unconditional care, affection, love and support, to normalize and legitimize the idea of the motherly obligation as financial contribution, deprivation, and sacrifice. With the medicalization of the family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1469540513480163">Harris et al., 2004</xref>) as the backdrop and abiding by social expectations of good motherhood for ensuring the provision of utmost care to children at all costs, most mothers played into and propagated the commodification of not only their children but also of their own bodies by turning to consumption to appease their anxieties and perform motherhood. Rena’s rationale for choosing to privately save the umbilical cord is revealing of the interplay between ideas and ideologies of motherhood, babyhood and consumption:<disp-quote>
<p>Though the cost is high [we decided to go with a private company] mainly for psychological reasons, because I do not believe that during this phase of research for the specific issue let’s say there is a great deal of chance that it will help in case something happens, but for psychological reasons let’s say, in case, God forbid, something happens and then you end up saying let’s say ‘Why didn’t we do it?’ And so we ended up doing it.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>In juxtaposing the public vs. private options, the two women who opted for the donation justified their choice on the basis of a collectivist ideal for the broader good and as a form of resistance to consumptive and marketing forces and practices which derived from and promoted individualistic values.<disp-quote>
<p>They even called me to come and talk to me, a woman I know who works at a company, and I told her I am not interested because I had decided to give it to [the non-profit institution] and she launched a whole attack on me and I didn’t like their approach. […] I mean it was like ‘they are going to sell the baby’s things and you don’t even care, and you are going to sell off the baby’s things’. I decided I was going to give it to [the non-profit institution] because for me, it is more correct because at least someone may benefit [inaudible], their baby might need it, and God forbid we need it, they will find us a compatible [donor] first. (Dina)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Interestingly, the women who decided in favor of the private option acknowledged the predicament of the private vs. the public good but felt overwhelmed by the prospect of being unable to react to a potential threat to the health of their baby. Commodifying life by investing in what they saw as enhanced chances for their offspring to live and, by implication, buying away one’s (relative) peace of mind, becomes a vehicle for embodying motherhood through maximizing the protection one could offer to one’s baby, even if conditional upon certain technological advances down the road and upon specific resources only the few can mobilize and afford, thus hinting at the classed, racialized and exclusionary nature of consumerist constructions of motherhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1469540513480163">Beckett, 2005</xref>).</p>

<sec id="sec7-1469540513480163"><title>Concluding thoughts</title>
<p>The present discussion was the result of an investigation into the experiences of motherhood among primiparous Greek Cypriot middle-class women as a lens through which one could interrogate the intersection of motherhood, babyhood and consumption as mutually constituted ideologies and practices. Rather than a blissful phase in their lives, as often romantictized (and market-oriented) representations of pregnancy posit, pregnancy for these women was associated with acute feelings of anxiety, fear and worry about its outcome, that is to say for the ‘normality’ of their child. Encircled by highly medicalized and pathologized notions of pregnancy that both fed into and fed off their anxieties, mothers were caught in a cycle of consumption on behalf of, in the name of, and of the baby itself. Taking consumption in its literal sense, mothers reported significant changes in their lifestyles as they, like mothers in other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1469540513480163">Harris et al., 2004</xref>), engaged in the micro-regiments of care by consuming or abstaining from consuming certain foods, medicine or other medical products with the intent of securing the baby’s healthy development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1469540513480163">Harris et al. 2004</xref>: 41). Taken in its commercial sense (aside from equipment, furniture, accessories and clothes bought in anticipation of the baby, all of which were mentioned by the mothers but did not constitute the focus of this article), mothers frequently mentioned purchases of particular products for their care during pregnancy, reference books and particular services such as exercise tailored to pregnancy by professionals. In addition to the aforementioned more obvious forms of consumption, however, mothers also engaged in consumptive practices that were embedded in a medicalized version of pregnancy that dictated the execution of a series of antenatal tests (genetic tests and ultrasound exams) to secure the ‘normality’ of the fetus. As other researchers have shown, such medicalized models of pregnancy both perpetuate and are sustained by discourses that conceptualize pregnancy as a condition of risk that needs to be monitored and controlled. Enter consumption: the maternal project is essentially constituted at the nexus of consuming certain medical services and products, and dominant ideologies of motherhood as self-sacrificing demonstrations of care – effectively to consume is to be good at being a mother. This resonates with the argument put forth by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1469540513480163">Voice Group (2010: 385)</xref>, who posit that as mothers-to-be are in a state of significant transition, they experience ‘liminal vulnerability’, which provides fertile ground for experiencing ‘consumer vulnerability’. This is achieved as ‘[m]arketing takes up and amplifies the dominant ideologies and ties them into their brands, products, and services, signaling to mothers that the way to live up to and align with these ideologies is through the market’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1469540513480163">Voice Group, 2010</xref>: 392).</p>
<p>Mothering by means of caring through consuming leads to the commodification of the fetus, which, as aptly revealed through the processes of the ultrasound exams, becomes a product to be monitored in order to ensure it is of high quality. By consuming the sonogram, mothers (as well as close others and sonographers) consume the fetus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1469540513480163">Taylor, 2000</xref>) and in the process acquire social identities of motherhood (and kinship) while bestowing social membership to the fetus, which in the course of the sonogram is being transformed into a baby (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1469540513480163">Gammeltoft, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1469540513480163">Mitchell and Georges, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>As the market increasingly encroaches on territories previously thought of as neutral in terms of marketplace interventions, it may actually exacerbate women’s consumer vulnerability under the pretext of providing increased ‘choice’ and ‘information’ that, in turn, is narrowly made to fit the logic of the marketplace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1469540513480163">Voice Group, 2010</xref>). Hence, the ramifications of the connection between motherhood, babyhood and consumption are far-reaching if ‘good motherhood’ is to become a privilege of the few, particularly so in difficult fiscal times such as the ones the world is currently experiencing. If motherhood is increasingly defined by one’s ability to consume, what kind of possible identities are there left for women who cannot afford to do so? In an increasingly stratified distribution of healthcare, what kind of privileges, exclusions, hierarchies and abjections are being (re)produced? If consumption is employed to secure ‘fetal normality’, what kind of constructs are being conceived and which ethical issues are being raised in relation to people who for whatever reason might deviate from the norm? It is for all these reasons (or questions rather) that the class and racial nature of reproductive consumption needs to be identified, analyzed and interrogated as it fundamentally raises issues of social justice.</p>
