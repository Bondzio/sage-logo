<abstract>
<p>Single-subject experimental designs have long been used in special education to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions for exceptional children. However, the design has not been used widely in gifted education. In this article, an overview of the main features of single-subject design is presented, and its potential for application in gifted education is discussed. The article concludes with a report of a preliminary single-subject study, conducted with a young gifted child, in which the effects of higher order questioning are investigated.</p>

<p>Single-subject research designs (also known as single-case, intrasubject, and <italic>N</italic> = 1 designs) have a long history in special education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0016986212466259">Barlow &amp; Hersen, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0016986212466259">Kennedy, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0016986212466259">Riley-Tillman &amp; Burns, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0016986212466259">Tawney &amp; Gast, 1984</xref>). Despite calls for single-subject designs to be used in gifted education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0016986212466259">Foster, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0016986212466259">Simonsen &amp; Little, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0016986212466259">Swassing &amp; Amidon, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0016986212466259">Tieso, 2009</xref>), a search of the literature revealed only one published single-subject design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0016986212466259">Simonsen, Little, &amp; Fairbanks, 2010</xref>). The main features of single-subject experimental research and its appropriateness for use in the field of gifted education are presented in this article, followed by an example of its application in the form of a pilot study conducted with a young gifted child.</p>
<sec id="section1-0016986212466259">
<title>Main Features of Single-Subject Design</title>
<p>The fundamental approach of single-subject design is to study individuals in a nontreatment (baseline) condition, and in a treatment condition, with measurement of the dependent variable systematically applied across both conditions. Single-subject designs have the potential to demonstrate a strong cause-and-effect relationship. Provided that the experiment is well designed and the dependent and independent measures are defined operationally and reliably implemented, we can be relatively sure that the changes in behavior in the subject are a direct result of the intervention. Although the term <italic>single-subject</italic> might seem to suggest that only one subject is studied, it in fact refers to the method by which the results are presented and analyzed, that is, on an individual basis. Single-subject design is quantitative and experimental in nature and should not be confused with case study approaches, which are qualitative research methods.</p>
<p>A variety of different types of designs are used in single-subject research, but according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0016986212466259">Neuman and McCormick (1995)</xref>, there are some features common to most single-subject designs. These are outlined in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0016986212466259">Table 1</xref>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0016986212466259">Riley-Tillman and Burns (2009)</xref> have stated that in an educational context, single-subject designs allow educators to make research-based observations and judgments about the effectiveness of interventions. One major limitation of single-subject designs is poor external validity. Generalizability of results can only be obtained by replication with other subjects and in different settings. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0016986212466259">Simonsen and Little (2011)</xref> have offered an excellent and detailed discussion of the different types of single-subject designs, along with potential applications for gifted education.</p>

<title>The Usefulness of Single-Subject Designs in Gifted Education</title>
<p>Those working in the field of gifted education have long advocated the importance and effectiveness of individualized approaches to instruction for children displaying gifted behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0016986212466259">Rogers, 2002</xref>). There is, however, little research that reports on the effectiveness of interventions used with gifted students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0016986212466259">Johnsen &amp; Ryser, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0016986212466259">Jolly &amp; Kettler, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0016986212466259">White, Fletcher-Campbell, &amp; Ridley, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0016986212466259">Ziegler &amp; Raul, 2000</xref>). One of the main reasons that a single-subject approach may be appealing to educators in gifted education is the lack of homogeneity within the gifted population. Just as children with different disabilities manifest different symptoms and behaviors, not all intellectually gifted children behave and react in the same way to educational interventions. The tendency of researchers to use group comparisons, in which results are averaged, can in fact mask the effectiveness, or lack thereof, of certain interventions for gifted individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0016986212466259">Barlow &amp; Hersen, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0016986212466259">Neuman &amp; McCormick, 1995</xref>). Single-subject research allows the researchers to carefully examine the effectiveness of the intervention for the individual child.</p>
<p>Gifted education research is often criticized for having small sample sizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0016986212466259">Ziegler &amp; Raul, 2000</xref>). The exceptional nature of the population can make finding suitable children difficult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0016986212466259">Walsh, Kemp, Hodge, &amp; Bowes, 2012</xref>). This can mean that studies with large sample sizes are restricted to being conducted in areas or contexts where large groups of gifted children are readily found, for example, in city high schools where there are numbers of gifted students already grouped for instruction. In the field of early childhood, where children may be in a variety of settings prior to school, it is also difficult to obtain sufficiently large sample sizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0016986212466259">Walsh et al., 2012</xref>). Generally, successful single-subject research can be achieved with small sample sizes; the power of the design is the potential to achieve high levels of internal validity through this type of research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0016986212466259">Simonsen &amp; Little, 2011</xref>). Replication of the experiments can be used to provide evidence for generalizability.</p>
<p>Ethical concerns can be problematic in educational research when a group is denied access to an intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0016986212466259">Barlow &amp; Hersen, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0016986212466259">Riley-Tillman &amp; Burns, 2009</xref>). For example, random assignment of gifted children to either an enrichment intervention class, or to a regular class, in order to compare the educational effectiveness of the enrichment class means that a whole group of gifted students are deprived of potentially appropriate instruction. The use of single-subject research eliminates this dilemma by ensuring that all participants involved in the research experience the intervention.</p>
<p>Finding suitable control and/or comparison groups for large group experiments can also be challenging, especially in gifted education, as it can involve recruiting and tracking gifted children not involved in a gifted program. In a single-subject design, the subject acts as his/her own control, thereby eliminating the need for a control group. In the following section, a single-subject study, in which a differential questioning intervention was implemented, is reported. This study, which included a young potentially gifted child, allowed the viability of a single-subject design for the population of young gifted children to be tested.</p>

<sec id="section3-0016986212466259">
<title>Rationale for Study</title>
<p>Using questioning strategies to facilitate higher order thinking is frequently cited as a recommended practice for use with young intellectually gifted children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0016986212466259">McCollister &amp; Sayler, 2010</xref>; A. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0016986212466259">Robinson, Shore, &amp; Enersen, 2007</xref>). Despite this, there is no research that has investigated the effectiveness of higher order questioning techniques with gifted children in the early childhood context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0016986212466259">Walsh, Kemp, Hodge, &amp; Bowes, 2012</xref>). Current research in early childhood education has generally found that early childhood professionals tend to use lower level thinking questions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0016986212466259">Siraj-Blatchford &amp; Manni, 2008</xref>) and that cognitively challenging talk is infrequent in early childhood settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0016986212466259">Massey, 2004</xref>). For example, Massey found that the teacher talk associated with storybook reading in preschool classrooms tended to focus on organizing the reading task, asking students for simple feedback and on naming activities. Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0016986212466259">Zucker, Justice, Piasta, and Kaderavek (2010)</xref> found that preschool teachers tended to use more cognitively challenging questions when reading informational texts as opposed to narrative texts, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0016986212466259">Bortenem (2008)</xref> suggested that the majority of books read to young children in early childhood settings are likely to be narrative fiction.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0016986212466259">Siraj-Blatchford and Sylva (2004)</xref> suggested that quality child care is linked to teachers and children engaging in âsustained shared thinking,â that is, âan interaction where two or more individuals âwork togetherâ in an intellectual way to solve a problem, clarify a concept, evaluate activities, or extend a narrativeâ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0016986212466259">Siraj-Blatchford &amp; Sylva, 2004</xref>, p. 718). This was found to occur more often when effective questioning techniques were used. Although commonsense would suggest that asking a higher order question should elicit a higher order response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0016986212466259">Barden, 1995</xref>), research has been equivocal on whether or not this is true in practice, with some researchers suggesting that the level of student response corresponds to teacher question only about half the time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0016986212466259">Dillon, 1982</xref>). Using a single-subject methodology, the purpose of the study reported below was to investigate whether asking higher order thinking questions would produce more complex answers from one young potentially gifted child.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section5-0016986212466259">
<title>Participant</title>
<p>Three children, two girls and one boy, were nominated by the director as having advanced intellectual development and all three were assessed on the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, Version 4 (PPVT-4; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0016986212466259">Dunn &amp; Dunn, 2007</xref>) and Ravenâs Coloured Progressive Matrices (CPM). Rose (a pseudonym) was selected for the study based on her score of 138 (99th percentile) on the PPVT-4. She scored at the 50th percentile on the CPM. The other two children did not fall in the gifted range on either instrument. Roseâs age at the commencement of the study was 4 years and 11 months.</p>
<p>Following Roseâs assessment, parent validation was sought through use of Saylerâs Things My Young Child Has Done questionnaire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0016986212466259">Sayler, 2003</xref>), which was completed by her father. The Sayler questionnaire consists of 15 items describing various research-based characteristics of young gifted children (e.g., uses advanced vocabulary, has an advanced sense of humor) that parents are required to rate on a scale of 0 (<italic>strongly disagree</italic>) to 10 (<italic>strongly agree</italic>). Space is provided for parents to record personal examples of each behavior. Roseâs father strongly agreed that Rose had quick and accurate recall of information, intense curiosity, and used advanced vocabulary. The only items on which he scored Rose lower than 7 out of 10 were early motor development, which he stated he was unsure about, and leadership abilities. He provided examples of Roseâs advanced development from early childhood including that she could already read and write many words and that these were mainly self-taught. The results of this questionnaire supported the child care center directorâs nomination and the results of the PPVT-4. Roseâs parents both held PhDs and English was her first and only language.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0016986212466259">
<title>Setting</title>
<p>The study was conducted in a university-based child care center catering for children aged 6 weeks to 5 years. The center had a strong child-centered, play-based, and antibias approach to programming, along with staff-to-child ratios of 1:6, in excess of state-mandated requirements. Most children at the center had at least one parent who was employed at the university in either an academic or general staff role. Rose attended the child care center 4 days per week.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0016986212466259">
<title>Experimental Design</title>
<p>A single-subject reversal design (ABA) was used in this study. In a reversal design, a baseline (A) is established, the intervention (B) is applied, and finally the intervention is withdrawn and there is a return to the baseline (A) condition. This design was chosen as it was not anticipated that learning following the intervention would persist after the withdrawal of the treatment. In some circumstances, a reversal design is not possible, as the skills taught during the intervention phase are impossible to reverse, for example, teaching reading or spelling strategies. In this case, however, the higher order questioning technique could be confidently withdrawn. Typically, in single-subject research, the research will be replicated with one or more participants. As this was a preliminary study, designed to trial the intervention, materials, and methodology, only one participant was included for this phase of the research.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0016986212466259">
<title>Independent Variable</title>
<p>The intervention included in the treatment phase of the research involved the use of higher order questioning during a one-on-one story reading session. Higher order questions were defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0016986212466259">Barden (1995)</xref> as âthose that require more than simple recall to produce an answerâ (p. 423). Barden defined lower order questions as âthose that require responses either recalled directly from memory or cited explicitly in textâ (p. 423). All questions were open-ended. Lower level thinking questions, which were the only questions used during the baseline phase, were constructed using the first three levels of Bloomâs Taxonomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0016986212466259">Anderson et al., 2001</xref>): Remembering, Understanding, and Applying. The higher order thinking intervention questions were constructed using teaching strategies from Frank E. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0016986212466259">Williamsâs (1972)</xref> <italic>Total Creativity Program for Individualizing and Humanizing the Learning Process</italic>. Although Williams acknowledged that the model was not designed specifically for use with gifted children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0016986212466259">Williams, 1993</xref>), and a search of the literature in gifted education revealed no studies in which its application with gifted children was evaluated, these strategies were chosen as they had been identified previously as suitable for use with intellectually gifted children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0016986212466259">Gross, Macleod, Drummond, &amp; Merrick, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0016986212466259">Maker, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0016986212466259">Maker &amp; Nielson, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0016986212466259">Maker &amp; Schiever, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0016986212466259">VanTassel-Baska, 1994</xref>) and because of their perceived novelty in the prior-to-school setting. The teaching strategies chosen were Analogy, Provocative Question, Paradox, Attribute Listing, and Tolerance for Ambiguity. Definitions and examples of the questioning techniques appear in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0016986212466259">Table 2</xref>.</p>

<title>Dependent Variable</title>
<p>Complexity of answer was determined by measuring mean length of communication unit. Communication units or c-units were defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0016986212466259">Loban (1976)</xref> as âeach independent clause with its modifiersâ (p. 9). For example, âI see a dogâ is a single c-unit, as is âI see a dog with yellow and brown furâ as the phrase âwith yellow and brown furâ makes no sense without the initial sentence âI see a dog.â However, the phrase âI see a dog and it has yellow and brown furâ would be considered two c-units as the second part of the phrase âit has yellow and brown furâ can stand alone.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0016986212466259">Loban (1976)</xref> conducted longitudinal research that demonstrated that the mean number of words per c-unit increased as children matured. This meant that linguistic development could be measured through the increase in the number of words per c-unit. Furthermore, Loban found that there were differences between the mean number of c-units used by high-achieving and low-achieving children. High-achieving children were between 1 and 3 years ahead of a control group of randomly assigned children as measured by the number of words they produced per c-unit. For example, in first grade Lobanâs high-achieving children were producing, on average, 7.91 words per c-unit, whereas the random group children were producing just 6.88, and children in the low-achieving group less than 5.91. By sixth grade this had increased to 10.32 for the high achievers, 9.82 for the random group, and 8.57 for the low-achieving group.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0016986212466259">Loban (1976)</xref> stated that although a high mean number of words per c-unit might simply indicate verbosity, his research suggested otherwise, with high mean c-unit being linked to more effective use of complex language. In the example above, âI see a dog with yellow and brown furâ is considered a more mature and complex utterance than âI see a dog and it has yellow and brown fur.â The mean length of c-unit was calculated by dividing the number of words uttered by the number of c-units for each session. This technique has been used in analyzing the complexity of childrenâs responses to storybook reading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0016986212466259">Kertoy, 1994</xref>), the complexity of response to questioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0016986212466259">Smith, 1977</xref>), and production of analogies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0016986212466259">Rummel &amp; Dykstra, 1983</xref>) with elementary schoolâaged children.</p>

<title>Other Study Variables</title>
<p>Other variables that could arguably have an impact on the dependent variable were also measured. These were the length of each storybook session and previous exposure to storybooks. It was hypothesized that previous exposure to the storybook might produce more complex answers in the treatment phase as the child might have already discussed the book with adults. Given that gifted children usually have excellent memories, it would not be unreasonable to suggest that these possible conversations and interpretations may well have been remembered and translated into more complex answers to questions in the treatment phase. The length of the storybook reading session could have affected the dependent variable in a variety of ways; if a session were particularly long, the child may have experienced a fatigue effect and, therefore, the quality of answer may have been diminished or, alternatively, the length of the session may indicate that the child was particularly engaged and verbose during that particular reading and the number of words uttered may have increased.</p>

<title>Materials</title>
<p>Thirty books for young children were selected for inclusion in both the baseline and treatment phases of the study. These were selected from the Childrenâs Book Council of Australia Award winners and shortlisted books from 2002 to 2009 (these books appear in the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0016986212466259">appendix</xref>). All books were narrative fiction recommended for young children.</p>

<title>Measures of Giftedness</title>
<p>It is widely accepted that identification of potential giftedness in young children should not rely on one single measure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0016986212466259">Borland, 2008</xref>; A. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0016986212466259">Robinson et al., 2007</xref>). Therefore, a variety of subjective and objective measures of giftedness was employed, as well as instruments that assessed different aspects of development, verbal and nonverbal. Care was taken to develop a rapport with the children prior to testing, to administer the tests in the morning on different days to minimize any fatigue effect that might depress scores, and to meet with the children in a familiar place.</p>
<p>In the current research, teacher nomination was used as an initial identifier of potential giftedness. The director of the child care center was approached to recommend children whom she believed demonstrated âadvanced intellectual development.â Although teacher nomination has been demonstrated to have varying levels of reliability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0016986212466259">Ciha, Harris, Hoffman, &amp; Potter, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0016986212466259">Gear, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0016986212466259">Scheblanova, 1996</xref>), it was felt that in this situation the director had sufficient understanding of the characteristics of young gifted children to be able to make appropriate judgments.</p>
<p>Two tests were chosen to measure the potential giftedness of the nominated participants: the PPVT-4 and CPM. Both tests (and earlier versions thereof) are accepted as appropriate measures for screening the abilities of young potentially gifted children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0016986212466259">Karnes, Manning, Besnoy, Cukierkorn, &amp; Houston, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0016986212466259">Mills, Ablard, &amp; Brody, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0016986212466259">Porter, 2005</xref>; N. M. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0016986212466259">Robinson &amp; Robinson, 1992</xref>). The criterion for inclusion in the study was a score of 130 or above (two standard deviations from the norm) on either one of the instruments. The decision to accept scores on either measure was in line with the idea of âbest performance,â which suggests that for young potentially gifted children measures of intellectual giftedness are not always reliable and, therefore, decisions about inclusion in a program for gifted children can be based on superior performance on any one of a number of measures that might be used to identify giftedness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0016986212466259">Roedell, Jackson, &amp; Robinson, 1980</xref>).

<title>Phases of the Study</title>
<p>The study included three phases: a baseline phase, a treatment phase, and a return to baseline. The first author implemented both baseline and treatment phases. For each phase, before story reading commenced each day, Rose was asked whether she had previously read the story. This was noted when transcribing the data from the video recordings. The length of each story reading session was measured using the video data. The time codes from the selection of the book to the end of the reading session were noted, and the length of the session calculated by deducting the start time from the finish time. All sessions were recorded using a Canon XL1 digital video camcorder placed on a tripod directly in front of the researcher and the participant. Back-up audio recordings were made using an iPhone.</p>
<p>Lower level and higher order thinking questions were developed for all 30 books that Rose would be offered as choices for reading. These included a range of lower level questions and five higher order thinking questions, one for each Williamsâs Model category (analogy, paradox, tolerance for ambiguity, attribute listing, and provocative question).</p>
<sec id="section16-0016986212466259">
<title>Baseline</title>
<p>Baseline data (i.e., responses to lower level questions) were collected over four sessions for 4 days before the intervention began. Rose was offered a selection of books and was asked to choose a story to be read. Lower level questions were asked during the story reading. Each session was videotaped (with the exception of the first session, which was only audiotaped due to a camera fault, and the eighth session in which the video tape ran out and the backup audio tape had to be used for analysis) and the data transcribed and analyzed by the first author (the primary rater) immediately following the session.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0016986212466259">
<title>Intervention</title>
<p>During the treatment phase Rose selected a book and only Williamsâs Model higher order thinking questions were asked during the reading of the story. Responses were analyzed following each session. The plan was that the intervention should span eight sessions. Rose refused to participate during Session 6 (the second treatment session) as it was her birthday and she was anxious to participate in making a cake with the other children at the center. This reduced the number of treatment sessions to seven.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0016986212466259">
<title>Return to baseline</title>
<p>Conditions in the return to baseline phase were the same as those in the initial baseline phase, that is, only lower level questions were asked during the story reading. This phase lasted for four sessions.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0016986212466259">
<title>Reliability</title>
<p>Data were analyzed for interrater agreement and treatment integrity. Interrater agreement data were collected for the number of words uttered by the child in response to questions, the number of c-units, and the accuracy of transcripts. The data provided by the primary rater were used to report the results of the study.</p>
<sec id="section20-0016986212466259">
<title>Interrater agreement</title>
<p>Transcripts of six randomly selected sessions (40%), a combination of three baseline and three treatment sessions, were given to an independent rater with a postgraduate qualification in communication disorders and 23 years of teaching experience. The rater was asked to count the number of words uttered by the child and to calculate the number of c-units. The percentage agreement between the primary rater and the independent rater was calculated using the total agreement approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0016986212466259">Kennedy, 2005</xref>), that is, dividing the smaller total by the larger total and multiplying by 100. The interrater agreement was 98% for the number of words uttered by the child and 94% for the number of c-units.</p>
<p>Another independent rater, with an honors degree in early childhood and 10 years of teaching experience, was asked to check the reliability of the transcripts that the researcher had prepared. To do this, the independent rater was given a copy of three of the transcripts (20%), a combination of one baseline and two treatment sessions, and asked to watch the videotaped story reading sessions and note any discrepancies between the transcript of the participantâs responses and the video recording of sessions. Percentage agreement between the first and second raters was again calculated using the total agreement approach. The interrater agreement for the transcription of the childâs utterances was calculated to be 98%.</p>

<sec id="section21-0016986212466259">
<title>Treatment integrity</title>
<p>Treatment integrity (also known as treatment fidelity) refers to âthe extent to which the intervention is delivered as intendedâ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0016986212466259">Kazdin, 2011</xref>, p. 194). To determine the fidelity of the implementation of the intervention with regard to the level of the questions delivered in baseline and treatment phases, an independent rater was asked to rate each question asked as either higher order or lower level. The independent rater was a PhD candidate in the field of early childhood. The rater was given the aforementioned definitions of higher order and lower order questions and a random sample of six books (40%) from baseline and treatment phases, and the questions for each book. The point at which each question had been asked in each book was marked with a yellow sticky note and numbered to match the appropriate question on the list to ensure that the rater was able to see the context in which the question was asked, as this can have an impact on the level of questioning. The books were placed in a random order and the rater was not informed of the design of the study so that there was no discernible pattern in the questioning. The rater was asked to read each book and to mark on the question sheet whether the question asked was a higher order or lower order question. The interrater agreement between the primary rater and the independent rater was again calculated using the total agreement approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0016986212466259">Kennedy, 2005</xref>) and found to be 100%. Following this, to ascertain the treatment fidelity (i.e., that the correct level of question been asked in the correct phase of the study), the same independent rater was given a list of higher order and lower order questions and transcripts from six randomly selected sessions (40%). The rater was asked to indicate which list the questions in each session came from. The fidelity of the treatment was calculated using the interval agreement approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0016986212466259">Kennedy, 2005</xref>), which is found by dividing the total number of agreements by the total number of agreements and disagreements and multiplying by 100. Treatment integrity was found to be 100%. A level of 80% or greater is deemed to be acceptable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0016986212466259">Kennedy, 2005</xref>).</p>

<title>The Effect of Higher Order Thinking Questions on Complexity of Language</title>
<p>The effect of higher-order questioning on the complexity of language demonstrated by a young potentially gifted child was investigated using a single-subject reversal (ABA) design. The complexity of language, as measured by mean length of c-unit, did increase when higher order thinking questions were asked of this young potentially gifted child. This is supported by the fact that Roseâs complexity of response increased noticeably in the treatment period and that the mean number of words per c-unit was higher for all treatment sessions compared with baseline sessions. The functional relationship between higher order questioning and mean length of c-unit is further supported by the fact that in the return to baseline condition the length of c-unit reverted to pre-intervention levels.</p>
<p>Although there has been a presumption that that there is a link between level of questioning and complexity of response (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0016986212466259">Barden, 1995</xref>), no study has been found that has investigated a causal relationship between these two variables. For this reason, it is not possible to compare the results from the current study with those of other researchers. However, it is worth noting that, in Roseâs case, the mean length of c-unit for the intervention phase (6.84) was comparable to Lobanâs random group of first-grade children (6.88; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0016986212466259">Loban, 1976</xref>). This indicates that, during the intervention phase, Rose was potentially performing at the same level as the first-grade children in Lobanâs study (i.e., children 1-2 years older).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section28-0016986212466259">
<title>Other Study Variables</title>
<p>The results indicate that the mean number of c-units, used in response to the questions asked, was comparable across the three phases of the study. In contrast, the mean number of words used in Roseâs responses was comparable for both baseline phases but was 36% greater in the treatment phase than in Phase 1 (Baseline 1) and 29% greater in the treatment phase than in Phase 3 (Baseline 2). This is not an unexpected result given that the complexity of language, as measured by the mean number of words per c-unit, increased during the treatment phase and that, given that the number of c-units used by the participant in response to questions was comparable across both baseline and treatment phases, there was likely to be a relationship between the mean number of words used in response to questions and the mean number of words per c-unit.</p>
<p>The mean session length for the first (Baseline 1) and second (Treatment) phases differed by less than 1 minute. The mean length of the third phase (Baseline 2) was more than 2 minutes less than the treatment phase (Phase 2) and 3 minutes less than the first phase (Baseline 1). Although there was some variability in the number of questions asked during the two baseline phases, only five questions were asked during each of the treatment sessions. This may be partially attributed to the differing lengths of the storybooks read in the phases. Overall, the time taken to implement the questions did not differ much from the first baseline to treatment, even though there were, on average, twice as many questions asked in the baseline phases than there were in the intervention phase.</p>
<p>It was not possible to ensure that the participant had no exposure to the selected books prior to the implementation of the research. Even if this had been checked prior to commencement of the baseline phase, given that (a) time was needed to find appropriate books and to write the range of lower level and higher level questions and (b) the study was conducted over a 4-week period, it could not be guaranteed that the child would not have exposure to one or more of the books subsequent to a prebaseline check. The fact that a small to negligible effect size was found for prior exposure to books indicates that this variable does not explain the differences in complexity of language found between the baseline and intervention phases.</p>

<p>As others have previously stated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0016986212466259">Gross, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0016986212466259">Harrison, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0016986212466259">Porter, 2005</xref>), it may be unclear what a potentially gifted child can do, unless that child is presented with opportunities to demonstrate his or her advanced abilities. Rose gave relatively uncomplicated and direct answers when the lower level questions were asked. It was not until questions of a more complex nature were asked that she was able to demonstrate fully her verbal and cognitive abilities. One could argue, therefore, that for a young child of Roseâs ability, higher order questioning is useful not only in enabling the child to demonstrate more sophisticated skills but also in providing an opportunity for further developing intellectual thinking. What is not known, however, is whether this will prove to be true for all children who are intellectually advanced or, indeed, whether it will also be true for children of lesser ability.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that Rose had demonstrated an ability to respond to higher order questioning with more sophisticated language, she often answered a higher order question with âI donât knowâ and then went on to further elaborate, for example,</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Question:</speaker>
<p>So if Grandma knows that Dad couldnât really have a horse, how come sheâs knitting things for a horse?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Response:</speaker>
<p>I donât know. (Pointing to the picture) âCause those wonât fit a big horse. That wonât fit its body. And that wonât fit its arms. And that wonât fit its tiny, tiny feet.</p>
</speech>
<p>It has been suggested that children who have not been exposed to challenging material can sometimes avoid engaging with challenge due to perfectionist tendencies or fear of failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0016986212466259">Gross, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0016986212466259">Harrison, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0016986212466259">Porter, 2005</xref>). It is possible that âI donât knowâ was a stalling strategy thereby providing Rose with more thinking time.</p>

<sec id="section30-0016986212466259">
<title>Contribution of the Study to Gifted Education</title>
<p>This study has demonstrated how a single-subject reversal (ABA) design can be used in the field of gifted education to demonstrate the effectiveness of an intervention recommended in the literature. The advantages of the research design are that the experiment could be carried out relatively easily, with recruitment and testing taking a relatively short period of time. The actual implementation of the research took a period of 4 weeks, and a documented effect could be determined after this period. No control group was needed, as the subject acted as her own control through the collection of baseline data.</p>
<p>Perhaps most interesting is that even a child of advanced verbal ability will not readily demonstrate his or her higher level language ability when given lower order questions. This idea clearly challenges the idea that a child-centered, open-ended curriculum is all that is needed in the early childhood context to challenge and develop children with advanced language abilities. Although there have been calls for higher order thinking skills to be taught to young gifted children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0016986212466259">Maker, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0016986212466259">McCollister &amp; Sayler, 2010</xref>; A. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0016986212466259">Robinson et al., 2007</xref>), there is no research that has demonstrated the ways in which young gifted children respond to higher order thinking questions in the preschool or child care setting. This preliminary study provides a useful platform for building an evidence base for the effectiveness of this type of intervention with young potentially gifted children.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section31-0016986212466259">
<title>Limitations and Future Research</title>
<p>The most obvious limitation of this research is that it is a preliminary study involving a single child. The intervention needs to be systematically replicated with other potentially gifted children to determine whether the effect can be generalized to others within this population. This requires research using multiple subjects and a stronger reversal design (ABAB), with an additional treatment phase.</p>
<p>Because external validity cannot be demonstrated easily using single-subject research, it is important that internal validity is strengthened by controlling variables, other than the independent variable, that could account for changes in the dependent variable. An attempt was made to enhance the internal validity of the current research by ensuring that teacher and time-of-day variables were constant across all three phases of the study and that measures of the fidelity of the implementation of the intervention, and rater reliability, were also gathered. Other variables, such as length of sessions, familiarity with books, and number of questions asked, were also examined to determine whether there were differences across the phases of the study. It was important to see whether these could be linked to differences in the complexity of Roseâs language. In the current study, these variables did not offer an alternate explanation for the increase in language complexity in the treatment phase.</p>
<p>Although a one-on-one situation is useful in a research context, it is unlikely to occur in a regular preschool or child care classroom. A trial of the higher order questioning in a group situation would be needed, therefore, to establish the social validity of the higher order questioning intervention. It might also be of interest to investigate the effect of higher order questions on children of average ability. Are children of average ability able to respond to these questions in a meaningful way, or are the questions too difficult and, if so, what effect does this have on group dynamics? Teachers would undoubtedly need time to learn to implement an intervention using higher order questions, and their ability to faithfully implement it (treatment fidelity) would need to be measured. Further research could also address the usefulness of Williamsâs strategies as âconversation startersâ for early childhood teachers learning how to engage young children in sustained shared thinking.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The purpose of this study was to investigate whether a young gifted child could answer higher order thinking questions during story reading and what effect answering such questions would have on the complexity of language used. Despite the studyâs limitations, in the case of Rose, it was clearly demonstrated that a young potentially gifted child is capable of answering higher order thinking questions and that her language, as measured by c-units, became more complex when she was presented with more challenging questions.</p>
<p>Single-subject research designs are potentially very useful for those working in the field of gifted education, where a small and exceptional cohort is being studied. In particular, they hold promise for those looking to evaluate educational interventions for gifted children by offering research that has the potential to achieve high internal validity and at the same time can be implemented in educational settings.</p>
