<title>Background:</title>
<p>Breastfeeding practices might be influenced by migration to another country. Although the “healthy migrant effect” is commonly reported in epidemiology, evidence for it in breastfeeding practices is weak.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0890334413475838">
<title>Objectives:</title>
<p>This study aimed to compare the initiation and duration of breastfeeding between Chinese Australian migrants and Chinese mothers in mainland China and test the healthy migrant effect in Chinese Australian migrants in Perth, Western Australia.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0890334413475838">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>A survey was undertaken of 239 Chinese mothers living in Perth and 1844 mothers living in Chengdu, Sichuan Province, PR China, with a response rate of 96.7% and 87.8%, respectively.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0890334413475838">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>The breastfeeding initiation rate in Chinese Australian mothers (94.1%) was higher than in mothers in China (86.2%, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). Chinese Australian mothers also had a longer breastfeeding duration, greater “full breastfeeding” rate at 6 months, and greater “any breastfeeding” rates at 6 and 12 months. After controlling for potential confounding variables, the results of the binary logistic regression analysis showed that the location of the mother (Australia or China) was associated with breastfeeding practices. Chinese mothers living in Chengdu were less likely to initiate breastfeeding (odds ratio = 0.47, 95% confidence interval, 0.25-0.89) and breastfeed their babies at 12 months (odds ratio = 0.48, 95% confidence interval, 0.33-0.69) than Chinese mothers in Perth.</p>

<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>The higher breastfeeding initiation and longer breastfeeding duration by Chinese migrant mothers in Perth than mothers in Chengdu suggest a “healthy migrant effect.”</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>The type and duration of infant feeding may have an important role in the development of biological and behavioral processes and epigenetic modification affecting subsequent growth and health.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0890334413475838">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0890334413475838"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0890334413475838"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0890334413475838"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0890334413475838">5</xref></sup> The World Health Organization recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months of life and continued breastfeeding up to 2 years of age or beyond.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0890334413475838">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Australian population has a high proportion of migrants, and nearly 29% of residents aged 15 years and over were born overseas.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0890334413475838">7</xref></sup> In recent decades, the focus of Australian immigration has shifted from Europe to Asia, and China is now the largest source of migrants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0890334413475838">8</xref></sup> In the 2006 Australian Census, 669,890 residents identified themselves as having Chinese ancestry, and that number is increasing by 7.7% per year.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0890334413475838">9</xref></sup> There were 53 390 Chinese-born residents in Perth in 2006, including 5527 children, about 2.9% of the city’s population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0890334413475838">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>A review of health statistics has found that most migrants enjoy health that is as good as, if not better than, that of the Australian-born population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0890334413475838">11</xref></sup> Overseas-born people are admitted to the hospital at lower rates than the Australian-born population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0890334413475838">12</xref></sup> In 2005-2006, the age-standardized total hospital separation rate for Australian-born patients was 20% higher than for the overseas-born population (367 compared to 300 per 1000 population).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0890334413475838">13</xref></sup> Compared with other “country of birth” groups, those born in northeast Asia, which includes China, Japan, the Republic of Korea, and Taiwan, had the lowest hospital separation rate at 225 per 1000 population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0890334413475838">12</xref></sup> This rate could reflect either “healthy migrant effect”—that is, migrants tend to be better educated, highly motivated, and in better psychological and physical health than nonmigrants—or underuse of “mainstream” health services because of language and cultural barriers, or a mixture of both.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0890334413475838">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0890334413475838">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>There is also evidence that migrants, whether temporary or permanent, tend to be healthier than the population from which they originate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0890334413475838">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0890334413475838"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0890334413475838"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0890334413475838">17</xref></sup> To some extent, the “healthy migrant effect” can be partly explained by the fact that most migrants are selected by the recipient country on the basis of their health and, in some cases, their relatively high socioeconomic status. The “healthy migrant effect” is also the result of a self-selection process, as the chronically ill and disabled are less likely to want to migrate. People who are able to migrate and be mobile are more likely to be healthier when compared with their native-born counterparts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0890334413475838">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>In China, the “any breastfeeding” rates in the majority of cities and provinces, including minority areas, have been above 80% at 4 months since the mid-1990s.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0890334413475838">19</xref></sup> The mean duration of “any breastfeeding” in the majority of cities or provinces was between 7 and 9 months, but only a small portion of Chinese mothers are still exclusively breastfeeding their infants at 6 months.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0890334413475838">19</xref></sup> It was reported that the “exclusive breastfeeding” rates in the Han, Uygur, and “other ethnic groups” at 6 months in Xinjiang Province, PR China were 4.8%, 0.4%, and 16.8%, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0890334413475838">20</xref></sup> Another cohort study undertaken in Zhejiang Province, PR China reported the “exclusive breastfeeding” rates by 6 months were 0.2%, 0.5%, and 7.2% in city, suburban, and rural areas, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0890334413475838">21</xref></sup> The breastfeeding initiation rate in Chengdu was reported as 92.6 %-96.5 % in different studies, which was similar to the average level in large cities in China.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0890334413475838">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0890334413475838">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0890334413475838">23</xref></sup> At 4 months, about 40%-54% infants had been introduced to foods other than breast milk in Chengdu.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0890334413475838">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0890334413475838">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0890334413475838">23</xref></sup> A recent cohort study from Chengdu reported that 96.5% of mothers gave their infants prelacteal feeds, which means the “exclusive breastfeeding” was less than 3.5% at discharge.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0890334413475838">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>Migration to another country has potential influences on breastfeeding practices.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0890334413475838">24</xref></sup> In Australia, approximately 96% of women initiate breastfeeding, but initiation rates are not consistent across all ethnic groups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0890334413475838">25</xref></sup> Mothers from non-English–speaking backgrounds had lower breastfeeding initiation rates than their Australian-born counterparts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0890334413475838">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0890334413475838">27</xref></sup> In particular, Chinese-speaking women were reported to have a lower initiation of breastfeeding compared with other ethnic groups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0890334413475838">28</xref></sup> A survey of the initiation and duration of breastfeeding in Chinese mothers in Perth, Western Australia revealed that less than 7% of Chinese mothers were still fully breastfeeding at 6 months.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0890334413475838">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>The aim of this study was to compare the initiation and duration of breastfeeding between Chinese Australian migrants and Chinese mothers in mainland China. We hypothesized that a “healthy migrant effect” would be reflected in the Chinese mothers in Australia, who would have greater “any breastfeeding” rates and longer “any breastfeeding” duration.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>A self-reporting survey was undertaken of Chinese mothers living in Perth, Western Australia and mothers living in Chengdu, Sichuan Province, PR China. The participants in Perth were mothers with children under 5 years old who were recruited from the Perth Chinese community, including Chinese schools and community organizations. If the mother had more than 1 child under 5 years old, the youngest child was chosen as the “index child” for inclusion in the study. A total of 239 mothers agreed to participate, with a response rate of 96.7%. Participants in China were recruited from 14 kindergartens in 7 districts of Chengdu. A total of 2100 questionnaires were distributed by kindergarten teachers to mothers whose child was under 5 years old, and 1844 were returned by the mothers, a response rate of 87.8%.</p>
<p>The study was approved by the Curtin University Human Research Ethics Committee. An information letter in English and/or Chinese, with an explanation of the project, was given to each mother.</p>
<p>Demographic and breastfeeding information was collected by a validated and reliable questionnaire previously used in Chinese breastfeeding studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0890334413475838">30</xref></sup> Precoded questions were asked to classify income into 3 groups using categories based on local annual household income surveys.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0890334413475838">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0890334413475838">32</xref></sup> “Full breastfeeding” was defined by the World Health Organization as “exclusive (no other liquid or solid is given to the infant) or almost exclusive (vitamins, mineral water, juice, or ritualistic feeds given infrequently in addition to breastfeeds).”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0890334413475838">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0890334413475838">34</xref></sup> Those mothers who were still breastfeeding were all followed until they stopped breastfeeding. The mothers’ attitudes toward infant feeding were measured using the Iowa Infant Feeding Attitude Scale (IIFAS).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0890334413475838">35</xref></sup> The IIFAS contains 17 items with a 5-point Likert scale that ranged from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree” for each item. Total attitude scores range from 17 to 85, with higher scores reflecting attitudes more positive to breastfeeding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0890334413475838">35</xref></sup> The reliability and validity of the scale has been assessed by studies undertaken in English-speaking populations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0890334413475838">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0890334413475838"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0890334413475838"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0890334413475838"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0890334413475838">39</xref></sup> It has been translated into several languages, including Romanian and traditional Chinese, and showed good reliability and validity. In this study, the IIFAS was translated into simplified Chinese by 3 bilingual translators and subsequently back-translated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0890334413475838">40</xref></sup> For the purposes of the bivariate regression analysis, mothers were split into 2 groups: those with an IIFAS score at or above the median (58) and those with a score less than the median (58).</p>
<p>Data were analyzed using the IBM Statistical Package for Social Sciences (version 20.0, SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois, USA, 2012). Descriptive statistics were calculated for variables of interest. Continuous variables (eg, mother’s age and breastfeeding duration) are presented as mean ± standard deviation and categorical variables (eg, mother’s working status, household economic status, infant feeding methods) as number (%) in relevant categories.</p>
<p>The independent samples <italic>t</italic> test was used to compare means between groups, and the Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test was applied when the distribution of variables was not normal. The chi-square (χ<sup>2</sup>) test was used to test associations between categorical variables. Potential influencing variables were chosen based on the results of previous studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0890334413475838">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0890334413475838">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0890334413475838">41</xref></sup> A multiple binary logistic regression model was performed to evaluate the influence of potential risk factors on “breastfeeding initiation” and “any breastfeeding” at 6 months and 12 months, respectively. A backward elimination procedure was then applied to obtain final models. <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05 was considered statistically significant.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>There were no differences in marital status between the 2 countries, and the average age of Chinese mothers in Perth was 33.5 ± 5.0 years, significantly older than mothers in Chengdu (31.3 ± 4.3 years, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). Australian mothers had a higher education level compared to Chinese mothers and higher economic status, according to the local household economic standard (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0890334413475838">Table 1</xref>). The majority of Perth mothers were not employed, but in Chengdu, the majority of mothers worked full-time. The percentage of cesarean delivery was nearly double in Chengdu compared to that of the Perth Chinese mothers. The result of the Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test shows that the age of the “index child” in the Chengdu sample (median age = 3.70 years, interquartile range = 1.11 years) was older than in the Perth sample (median age = 1.59 years, interquartile range = 1.88 years, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001).</p>

<p>Most Chinese mothers initiated breastfeeding, both in Australia (94.1%) and in China (86.2%). Australian mothers were more likely to initiate breastfeeding (χ<sup>2</sup> = 11.7, df = 1, <italic>P</italic> = .001) and they had a longer “any breastfeeding” duration (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). In Australia, the median duration of “any breastfeeding” was 9.25 months (interquartile range = 7 mo), which was significantly longer than the 8 months in China (interquartile range = 5.62 mo, <italic>U</italic> = 75187, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). There was no difference between the “full breastfeeding” duration in Australia and in China, as both samples had a median “full breastfeeding” duration of 4 months and an interquartile range of 5 months (<italic>U</italic> = 94451, <italic>P</italic> = .15). Australian mothers also had a higher “full breastfeeding” rate at 6 months and higher “any breastfeeding” rates at 6 and 12 months (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0890334413475838">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Mother’s age, mother’s location (Australia or China), infant feeding attitudes, marital status, household economic status, working status, level of education, and delivery method were entered into a binary logistic regression model using backward elimination (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0890334413475838">Table 2</xref>). After controlling for potential confounding variables (eg, mother’s age, education level, infant feeding attitude), the results of the binary logistic regression analysis showed that the location of the mother (Australia or China) was associated with breastfeeding practices. Chinese mothers living in Chengdu were less likely to initiate breastfeeding (odds ratio [OR] = 0.48, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.33-0.69) and be breastfeeding their infants at 12 months (OR = 0.48, 95% CI, 0.33-0.69) than mothers in Perth. Chinese women with higher IIFAS scores (mean IIFAS score &gt; 58) that favored breastfeeding were more likely to initiate breastfeeding (OR = 2.22, 95% CI, 1.52-3.24) and continue breastfeeding at 6 months (OR = 2.18, 95% CI, 1.64-2.90) and at 12 months (OR = 1.97, 95% CI, 1.39-2.80) than those with lower scores.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>These results demonstrate a “healthy migrant effect” for breastfeeding by Chinese immigrant mothers now living in Australia. In the present study, we found that the initiation rate of breastfeeding of Perth Chinese mothers (94%) was higher than that of Chengdu mothers (86.2%, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .01) and close to the rate of Australian women (approximately 96%).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0890334413475838">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0890334413475838">42</xref></sup> The “any breastfeeding” rate at 6 months for Chinese mothers in Perth was 75.7% in this study, which is higher than the rate of 45.9% reported for all Australian mothers in Perth.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0890334413475838">37</xref></sup> It is also higher than the rate for Chinese mothers living in Chengdu (69.1%, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05). In this study, the “full breastfeeding” rate in Chinese mothers in Australia was 33.8% compared to the 7% found in an earlier study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0890334413475838">30</xref></sup> This difference may be caused by a combination of increased emphasis on breastfeeding in Australian hospitals, the availability of multicultural health education programs, and possibly sampling errors.</p>
<p>The findings from this study show that after controlling for potential confounders, Chinese mothers’ location (Australia or China) was still a predictor for breastfeeding initiation (OR = 0.48, 95% CI, 0.33-0.69) and “any breastfeeding” after 12 months (OR = 0.48, 95% CI, 0.29-0.67). This finding could be partly explained by the “health selection process” when these mothers migrate to Australia. Mothers in Perth might be healthier and have a healthier lifestyle than mothers in Chengdu, which would affect their children’s health. This finding could also reflect the benefits of their higher household income than participants in Chengdu, which would reflect the local economic levels in Perth and Chengdu. Many studies have reported that health, including child health, is positively related to household income.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0890334413475838">43</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0890334413475838"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0890334413475838">45</xref></sup></p>
<p>These findings could also be explained by the influence of the new environment, including better infant feeding education and information that is available to mothers in Australia. Both Australian and Chinese mothers are officially encouraged to exclusively breastfeed their infants to around 6 months of age, although antenatal care and education would appear to be more intensive in Australia. In this study, the “healthy migrant effect” and the breastfeeding education in Australia were reflected in the higher “any breastfeeding” rate in Chinese-Australian mothers compared to Australian-born mothers, and the higher breastfeeding initiation and duration of Chinese mothers in Australia compared to those living in China.</p>
<p>There are several limitations that need to be considered when interpreting the results of this study. This is a cross-sectional study that is subject to recall bias, but this limitation applies to both samples. Because of the possibility of recall bias, we did not measure exclusive breastfeeding in this study. Instead, we use the term “full breastfeeding,” where an infant may also receive small amounts of culturally valued supplements—water, water-based drinks, fruit juice, or ritualistic fluids.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0890334413475838">46</xref></sup> Although it also has the potential of recall errors, the use of “full breastfeeding” is less misleading. Another limitation of this study is that the percentage of missing values in the “China” group in some variables is higher than the “Australian” group.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Because of the distinctive identity of migrants, their multicultural background, and the integration of Western and Eastern culture and lifestyle, the breastfeeding practices of Chinese migrants in Australia were different both from Chinese living in China and from other Australians. The higher breastfeeding initiation and longer breastfeeding duration in Perth Chinese mothers than in Chengdu mothers and/or Australian mothers in Perth also suggest a “healthy migrant effect” on breastfeeding for Chinese mothers living in Perth.</p>
