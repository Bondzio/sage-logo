<p>I am both proud and honored to be writing as the incoming Editor-in-Chief of the <italic>Journal of Management</italic> (<italic>JOM</italic>). Although this is the first <italic>JOM</italic> issue showing the incoming Editorial Board on the masthead, this and the next several issues continue to represent the strong leadership and dedication of Talya Bauer and her team, as well the support of and collaboration with both the Southern Management Association (SMA) and SAGE Publications. Talya Bauer, Chris Shook, and Layla Mansfield have been instrumental in guiding us through our “baton-passing” period and have left us with a powerful infrastructure for continuing to offer the scholarly community highly influential research on a broad range of management topics including business strategy and policy, entrepreneurship, human resource management, organizational behavior, organizational theory, and research methods.</p>
<p>This issue is a testament to this. First, we have a Guest Editorial by Albert Bandura that invites an ongoing discourse on the study of self-efficacy, motivation, and personality in the organizational sciences. Second, January is always our Annual Review Issue, which contains some of the most cutting-edge and high-impact theory pieces available to date. Although this issue bears our names, it is truly a “Team Bauer” product and sets a beautifully high bar for future high-impact research to come.</p>
<p>With that, I would like send a heartfelt welcome and statement of appreciation to our incoming team, who are listed and pictured below. I want to especially recognize Senior Associate Editor Pat Wright and the entire Associate Editor Team. This team represents our wide scope and an amazingly deep base of knowledge and expertise. They are already working around the clock to process the large number of submissions and reviewer reports we receive each and every day, and the positive feedback we continue to receive from authors and reviewers illustrates the huge commitment they have already made in the short time we have been up and running. We are further blessed with a literal powerhouse of board members, all of whom are listed on the masthead. <italic>JOM</italic> runs on the efforts of this volunteer army—we can’t thank them enough. Finally, it is a pleasure to introduce our office staff here at Purdue University, Meghan Thornton (Managing Editor) and Julie Smith (Editorial Assistant). They, too, are superbly qualified for the work they do and are already doing an amazing job facilitating our peer-review and production processes. Finally, we depend on an amazing SAGE team, led by Cynthia Nalevanko, as well as guidance and support from SMA leadership—currently Peg Williams, Mark Gavin, Ben Tepper, Tim Barnett, and Chris Shook.</p>
<p>In closing, thanks to all who have been contributing to the continued success of <italic>JOM</italic> and welcome to those who are new to our team. I look forward to the next three years with all of you.</p>
