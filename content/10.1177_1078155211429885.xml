<p>Pseudohyperkalemia is an in vitro effect of artifactually elevated serum potassium values that do not correspond to the actual systemic potassium level or clinical evidence of hyperkalemia. The most common cause of pseudohyperkalemia is potassium release secondary to in vitro platelet degranulation occurring during the clotting process. Potassium release from white blood cells and erythrocytes can also yield pseudohyperkalemia.</p>
<p>Clinical recognition of pseudohyperkalemia is essential to prevent medical mismanagement of erroneous hyperkalemia. This case describes a case of pseudohyperkalemia attributed to malignant leucocytosis in a patient with chronic lymphoblastic leukemia (CLL) and tumor lysis syndrome. Methods for determination of pseudohyperkalemia are discussed.</p>

<sec id="sec2-1078155211429885"><title>Case</title>
<p>A 75-year-old male with progressive CLL presented to the outpatient clinic for a planned chemotherapy treatment. The patient’s only new complaint was fatigue. Admission for medical evaluation and chemotherapy administration was done for his worsening clinical condition and laboratory results indicating leukemic blast crisis with tumor lysis syndrome. The patient’s initial diagnosis of CLL was made approximately 9 years prior to admission. Previous treatments include chlorambucil, cyclophosphamide/vincristine/prednisone, and fludarabine/cytarabine. A bone marrow biopsy performed 1 week earlier demonstrated progressive CLL with morphologic changes demonstrating transformation to diffuse large-cell non-Hodgkins lymphoma. The bone marrow evaluation reported 80% cellularity with extensive CLL involvement (60%–70%) and sheets of large cells. The patient’s past medical history was significant for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary tuberculosis, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and colonic fistula formation.</p>
<p>Notable laboratory findings at admission included white blood cell count of 479 × 10<sup>3</sup> cells/µL (4.00 × 10<sup>3</sup> cells/µL–10.80 × 10<sup>3</sup> cells/µL) with 95% lymphocytes (20%–50%) and 5% blasts (zero) present in the differential, serum potassium 9.8 mM/L (3.4 mM/L–5.0 mM/L), uric acid of 11.8 mg/dL (3.5 mg/dL–8.0 mg/dL), serum creatinine 1.47 mg/dL (0.60 mg/dL–1.30 mg/dL), and lactate dehydrogenase of 2529 IU/L (100 IU/L–220 IU/L). The patient was anemic (Hb 7.6 g/dL (14.0 g/dL–18.0 g/dL)) and thrombocytopenic (17 × 10<sup>3</sup> platelets/μL (140 × 10<sup>3</sup> platelets/μL– 400 × 10<sup>3</sup> platelets/μL)). A single dose of sodium polystyrene sulfonate 30 g was administered at admission. An electrocardiograph (ECG) demonstrated sinus tachycardia and a pre-existing right bundle branch block. There were no ECG findings consistent with systemic hyperkalemia; the T waves were not elevated and there was no shortening of the QTc or P-R intervals. Repeat analysis of the blood potassium level using a heparinized tube assayed immediately after specimen collection demonstrated a plasma potassium level 4.1 mM/L. Subsequent analysis of specimens using similar methodology demonstrated potassium results within the normal limits despite continued evidence of pseudohyperkalemia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1078155211429885">Figure 1</xref>). Based on the patient’s conscious and interactive condition, ECG findings, and normal plasma potassium level following immediate analysis the diagnosis of pseudohyperkalemia was made. Laboratory findings of pseudohyperkalemia persisted throughout the period of leukocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1078155211429885">Figure 2</xref>).

</fig></p>
<p>Interventions for tumor lysis syndrome included allopurinol, hydration with diuresis, urinary alkalinization, and electrolyte management. According to the patient’s and family’s informed wishes, aggressive chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin/etoposide/vincristine/prednisone) was administered. On hospital day nine, the patient developed respiratory failure and became unresponsive, at which point his family changed the resuscitation status to comfort care measures.</p>

<sec id="sec3-1078155211429885" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>Pseudohyperkalemia is an in vitro effect of artifactually elevated serum potassium values that do not correspond to the actual systemic potassium level. Pseudohyperkalemia is generally attributed to release of potassium secondary to platelet degranulation during the clotting process as it takes place within specimen tubes. It is most likely to occur in serum specimens collected from patients with thrombocytosis or activated platelets.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1078155211429885">1</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1078155211429885">3</xref></sup> During the in vitro clotting process, approximately 0.7 mMol of potassium is released per each 1000 × 10<sup>3</sup>/μL of platelets.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1078155211429885">1</xref></sup> Albeit, in vitro potassium release is a time-dependent phenomenon, so the duration of time from specimen collection to laboratory analysis will influence the degree of pseudohyperkalemia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1078155211429885">2</xref></sup> Additional causes of pseudohyperkalemia include hemolysis, erythrocytosis, leucocytosis, specimen mislabeling, traumatic specimen collection, excessive fist clenching prior to specimen collection, and prolonged tourniquet application.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1078155211429885">1</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1078155211429885">4</xref></sup> Familial pseudohyperkalemia is a genetic disorder affecting erythrocyte membrane permeability that yields spuriously elevated potassium results due to in vitro monovalent electrolyte leakage from red blood cells stored at ambient room temperature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1078155211429885">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Determination of pseudohyperkalemia requires identification and mitigation of the underlying cause. Recognition of pseudohyperkalemia due to in vitro platelet degranulation is possible by comparison of potassium concentrations in simultaneously collected plasma versus serum samples. Specimen tubes for plasma samples contain heparin or lithium to inhibit the clotting process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1078155211429885">1</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1078155211429885">3</xref></sup> Demonstration of the serum potassium concentration exceeding that of a simultaneously collected plasma specimen by a value of at least 0.4 mM/L meets criteria for pseudohyperkalemia when the specimens are obtained using good technique, stored at room temperature, and analyzed within 1 h of blood collection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1078155211429885">3</xref></sup> When malignant white blood cells are implicated as the source of pseudohyperkalemia, prompt analysis and gentle specimen handling becomes the primary method for attaining accurate potassium results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1078155211429885">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1078155211429885">7</xref></sup> Blood collection using heparin- or lithium-containing tubes to yield plasma for analysis will not delineate pseudohyperkalemia from leucocytosis in the same manner that it will when activated platelets are the source of spurious results. However, plasma samples can still be used for analysis to reduce the in vitro effect of clotting as a confounding factor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1078155211429885">6</xref></sup> Trauma to specimens transported by a pneumatic tube system can markedly increase in vitro potassium concentrations in blood collected from patients with malignant leucocytosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1078155211429885">6</xref></sup> This effect can be circumvented by hand carrying the specimen to the laboratory for immediate analysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1078155211429885">6</xref></sup> Interventions that do not seem to distinguish pseudohyperkalemia arising from malignant leucocytosis are analysis of arterial versus venous blood, femoral collection of venous blood without tourniquet use versus peripheral collection from an upper limb using a butterfly set and tourniquet, specimen transport on ice, or specimen collection using 23-gauge versus 18-gauge needle size.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1078155211429885">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>In this case, pseudohyperkalemia was suspected due to the severely elevated potassium value collected from a patient without signs or symptoms of hyperkalemia. Lysis of leukemic blast cells was blamed because pre-existing anemia and thrombocytopenia precluded the more common causes of pseudohyperkalemia. Another interesting aspect of this case is that it presents pseudohyperkalemia in the context of tumor lysis syndrome with elevated serum creatinine. Moderately elevated serum potassium levels in this patient would have reasonably been attributed to electrolyte abnormalities from tumor lysis syndrome and reduced renal function. The greatest risk of pseudohyperkalemia is medical mismanagement for hyperkalemia due to lack of condition recognition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1078155211429885">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1078155211429885">7</xref></sup> In the case described, a single dose of sodium polystyrene sulfonate 30 g was administered as a consequence of the spurious laboratory result. Fortunately, within 24 h following sodium polystyrene sulfonate administration, two plasma samples analyzed immediately after specimen collection demonstrated potassium levels within the normal range.</p>
