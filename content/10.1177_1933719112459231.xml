Despite extensive research, the underlying cause of preeclampsia remains unclear and many competing theories persist. Endothelial dysfunction and abnormal cytotrophoblast invasion of the maternal spiral arteries are important factors resulting in the development of preeclampsia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1933719112459231">2</xref></sup> The nitric oxide (NO) and the carbon monoxide (CO) synthesizing pathways are 2 major pathways known to be important in endothelial-mediated vasodilatation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1933719112459231">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1933719112459231">4</xref></sup></p><p>Nitric oxide is a potent vasodilator produced by NO synthase (NOS) from the substrate <sc>l</sc>-arginine and is subsequently released from endothelial cells.

Abnormal regulation of NO has been implicated in the development of preeclampsia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1933719112459231">3</xref></sup> Production of NO by NOS is downregulated by reversible, competitive inhibition of the enzyme by asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1933719112459231">3</xref></sup> The biologic plausibility of the role of this pathway in preeclampsia is supported by the fact that elevated levels of ADMA have been implicated in the pathology of other microvascular diseases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1933719112459231">3</xref></sup> However, while numerous studies have demonstrated elevated plasma levels of ADMA in preeclampsia,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1933719112459231">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1933719112459231">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1933719112459231"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1933719112459231"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1933719112459231"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1933719112459231"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1933719112459231"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1933719112459231">11</xref></sup> 2 other studies did not demonstrate any difference.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1933719112459231">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1933719112459231">13</xref></sup> Fewer studies of ADMA in placental tissue have been conducted but levels do not appear to be altered in preeclampsia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1933719112459231">14</xref></sup> It is not clear whether placental levels of ADMA correlate with plasma levels or not.</p><p>Asymmetric dimethylarginine is itself metabolized to <sc>l</sc>-citrulline and dimethylamine by the enzyme dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH), which exists in 2 isoforms (DDAH-I and DDAH-II).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1933719112459231">3</xref></sup> Dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase has not been as extensively studied as ADMA in preeclampsia, likely in part because it is not released into the maternal circulation. Dimethylaminohydrolase-I is primarily found in the liver and kidney and DDAH-II is primary found in the endothelium, but both are present in the placenta and metabolize ADMA. Dimethylaminohydrolase-I has been most strongly correlated with a reduction in ADMA levels,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1933719112459231">3</xref></sup> and preliminary data suggest that DDAH-I has a higher affinity to ADMA than DDAH-II, but further detailed biochemical studies of DDAH-II are needed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1933719112459231">15</xref></sup> Two studies examining placental DDAH in preeclampsia had conflicting results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1933719112459231">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1933719112459231">13</xref></sup> The isomer symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) is not an active inhibitor of NOS and is not metabolized by DDAH.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1933719112459231">3</xref> </sup>If DDAH is implicated in the development of preeclampsia, then elevated ADMA levels in relation to SDMA may be expected as it primarily metabolizes ADMA and not SDMA. However, Braekke et al found the ADMA-SDMA ratio to be 12% lower in pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia in comparison to controls.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1933719112459231">10</xref></sup></p><p>Carbon monoxide is another vasodilator that has been recently implicated with the vascular dysfunction of preeclampsia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1933719112459231">4</xref></sup> Hemeoxygenases, particularly the inducible hemeoxygenase 1 (HO-1), produce CO with degradation of heme to biliverdin IX.

All placental tissue concentrations of NO, HO-1, DDAH-I, and DDAH-II that we hypothesized would be lower in preeclampsia were found to be decreased in our study population. Specifically, our data support the theory that reduced DDAH-I and DDAH-II activity may be important in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia, leading to reduced production of NO and maternal vasodilatation.</p><p>The lower placental tissue concentrations of DDAH-I and DDAH-II support the findings of Ellis et al that this may be an integral factor in the development of preeclampsia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1933719112459231">9</xref> </sup>However, this decrease in DDAH concentration was expected to be associated with elevated levels of maternal plasma ADMA in the preeclampsia group, while our data actually showed lower ADMA levels. In attempting to explain these apparently contradictory results, it is important to note that all assays were performed shortly after specimen collection, with the exception of the ADMA and SDMA assays that were delayed due to logistical and technical limitations. The importance of time in the possible degradation of the enzymes of interest in the frozen specimens is unclear. This, and the fact that the ADMA and SDMA findings are not consistent with most previous studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1933719112459231">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1933719112459231">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1933719112459231"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1933719112459231"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1933719112459231"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1933719112459231"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1933719112459231"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1933719112459231">11</xref></sup> lead us to believe that the ADMA and SDMA results should be viewed with caution and that the findings regarding DDAH-I and DDAH-II are valid and important. This is further supported by the finding of decreased placental NO concentrations in the preeclampsia group.</p><p>While decreased DDAH expression in the preeclampsia group was expected to correlate with elevated ADMA levels, SDMA levels were expected to remain unchanged; thus we expected to find a higher ADMA-SDMA ratio in the setting of preeclampsia. However, the SDMA maternal plasma concentrations were also significantly higher in controls, leading to no significant difference in the ADMA-SDMA ratio between the 2 groups. Neither our study nor Braekke et al demonstrated an increase in the ADMA-SDMA ratio as hypothesized. Symmetric dimethylarginine is renally cleared; potentially, its clearance is compromised in preeclampsia and therefore its levels are not proportionally different than those of ADMA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1933719112459231">10</xref></sup></p><p>Our data support the theory that abnormal CO production by HO-1 at the level of the placenta plays a role in the development of preeclampsia. We recognize that data from previous studies of this pathway have been particularly contradictory, which may be in part due to the variability in patient population, laboratory methods, or severity of disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1933719112459231">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1933719112459231">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1933719112459231">17</xref></sup> Similar to our findings, Ahmed et al demonstrated lower placental HO-1 levels in pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1933719112459231">16</xref></sup> McLaughlin et al actually showed an increase in HO-1; however, their study included only 4 participants in each group<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1933719112459231">20</xref></sup>; Barber et al failed to detect HO-1 in the placenta.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1933719112459231">17</xref></sup> Based on our findings, the studies discussed above, and biologic plausibility, a compelling argument can be made that abnormalities of HO-1 expression and CO production play an integral role in the development of preeclampsia.</p><p>The major strength of our study lies in its inclusion of both the major endothelial cell pathways regulating maternal vascular tone and the finding that the functions of both pathways were significantly depressed in the preeclampsia group. A second strength was our inclusion of measurements from both the placenta and the maternal plasma. In the future, this approach may allow differentiation between dysfunction at the level of the placental interface versus the maternal periphery and evaluation for compensating responses.</p><p>The small sample size is a limitation of this study that is unfortunately shared by many similar studies. This limited our ability to perform subgroup analyses, evaluate the interaction between the 2 pathways, or adjust for important potential confounders, such as obesity or parity. While the difference in gestational age was statistically significant, it is of questionable clinical significance.</p><p>Our data, in combination with the existing literature, suggest that the clinical syndrome of preeclampsia results from a complex interaction between multiple pathways and responses that are influenced by a variety of environmental and genetic factors. Thus, the ideal future study would prospectively evaluate a large number of patients for multiple markers, starting in the first trimester of pregnancy. Additionally, genomics may prove to play a pivotal role in the future. For example, Akbar et al reported on 132 women with preeclampsia and 112 controls and uncovered 8 single-nucleotide polymorphisms forming 4 common haplotypes in the <italic>DDAH</italic> gene, 2 of which were associated with preeclampsia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1933719112459231">21</xref></sup> It may be that different women respond best to different treatments or preventative measures and that genomics can assist in determining the appropriate management for each individual.</p><p>The ultimate purpose of understanding these pathways is to design interventions that target specific deficiencies or weaknesses and either prevent or reduce the severity of the disease. For example, therapies that either upregulate CO or NO production or would offer similar biologic effects may be helpful. A recent trial conducted in Mexico demonstrated that administration of <sc>l</sc>-arginine in combination with vitamins to high-risk women during pregnancy reduced the risk of preeclampsia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1933719112459231">22</xref></sup> Some small trials evaluating supplementation of <sc>l</sc>-arginine in patients with preeclampsia have suggested that such treatment may achieve a reduction in blood pressure, but these studies were not sufficiently powered to assess safety or for clinically important outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1933719112459231">23</xref></sup> Our data suggest that DDAH activators may be a novel treatment or preventative option. The most effective therapies may be those that target first or second trimester, preclinical abnormalities.</p><p>Therapies for the prevention and treatment of preeclampsia carry the potential to dramatically reduce maternal and neonatal morbidity worldwide. The NO and CO synthesizing pathways regulating maternal endothelial cell function have each been inconsistently, and yet convincingly, implicated in the pathogenesis of this disease. This study provides further evidence that both pathways are important and dysfunctional in preeclampsia. Taken in context of the existing literature, we believe that further large, prospective trials anticipating heterogeneity of underlying etiologies, as well as studies to further investigate the role of genomics in the development and prevention of preeclampsia are crucial.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other" id="fn1-1933719112459231"><label>Authors’ Note</label><p>This study was
