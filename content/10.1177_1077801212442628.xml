<abstract>
<p>A growing body of literature has documented the global prevalence of domestic violence against women of reproductive age as well as the association between violence and an array of adverse reproductive, psychosocial, and child health outcomes . However, there is a dearth of research on domestic violence prevention interventions in the peer-reviewed literature to guide program planning and policy-making efforts. In this article, the authors describe the development and assessment of the feasibility, acceptability, and potential effectiveness of an intergenerational women’s empowerment-based intervention to mitigate domestic violence and related adverse health outcomes in low-income urban communities in Southern India.</p>

<title>Domestic Violence in India</title>
<p>The prevalence of domestic violence is particularly high in India (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077801212442628">Ackerson &amp; Subramanian, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1077801212442628">Jejeebhoy, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1077801212442628">Jejeebhoy &amp; Cook, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077801212442628">Jeyaseelan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1077801212442628">Koenig, Stephenson, Ahmed, Jejeebhoy, &amp; Campbell, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1077801212442628">Martin, Mackie, Kupper, Buescher, &amp; Moracco, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1077801212442628">Rocca, Rathod, Falle, Pande, &amp; Krishnan, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1077801212442628">Verma &amp; Collumbien, 2003</xref>). According to the most recent National Family Health Survey (NFHS), 40% of a representative sample of Indian women of reproductive age had experienced physical (35%), sexual (10%), or emotional (16%) violence by their husband (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1077801212442628">NFHS, 2007</xref>). The prevalence of violence is considerably higher among socioeconomically disadvantaged women. For example, in the NFHS, 52% of women in the lowest wealth quintile reported experiencing physical, sexual, or emotional spousal violence compared with 21% in the highest wealth quintile. Community- and hospital-based cross-sectional studies have also documented a high prevalence of domestic violence during pregnancy, with estimates ranging from 13% to 44% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077801212442628">Ahmed, Koenig, &amp; Stephenson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1077801212442628">Jain, Sanon, Sadowski, &amp; Hunter, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1077801212442628">Khosla, Dua, Devi, &amp; Sud, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1077801212442628">Martin et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1077801212442628">Muthal-Rathore, Tripathi, &amp; Arora, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1077801212442628">Peedicayil et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1077801212442628">Purwar, Jeyaseelan, Varhadpande, Motghare, &amp; Pimplakute, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>It is now widely recognized that gender inequities underlie women’s risk of domestic violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1077801212442628">Jewkes, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1077801212442628">Levinson, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1077801212442628">World Health Organization [WHO], 2002</xref>). In India, women continue to marry early; they are expected to bear children quickly, manage household chores and care-giving responsibilities, and be loyal and respectful to their husband and his family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1077801212442628">Blanc, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1077801212442628">Go et al., 2003</xref>). Women’s ties to their natal family are considerably weakened after marriage, and husbands and mother-in-laws (MILs) exert substantial control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1077801212442628">Panchanadeswaran &amp; Koverola, 2005</xref>). In fact, upon marriage, women face immediate, intense pressures from husbands, MILs, and other family members to prove their fertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077801212442628">Barua &amp; Kurz, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1077801212442628">Dyson &amp; Moore, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077801212442628">Goyal, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1077801212442628">Jejeebhoy &amp; Sebastian, 2003</xref>). Failure to bear a child, dissatisfaction with the dowry (a “gift” in the form of cash, household goods, jewelry, and other assets given by a bride’s family to the groom’s family to compensate for the “financial burden” that a bride places on her in-laws), or perceived deviations from socially expected gender roles may result in domestic violence against young wives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1077801212442628">Go et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1077801212442628">Jejeebhoy, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1077801212442628">Jutla &amp; Heimbach, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1077801212442628">Krishnan, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1077801212442628">Rastogi &amp; Therly, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1077801212442628">Rocca et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1077801212442628">Verma &amp; Collumbien, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>National data indicate that women’s first experience of postmarital domestic violence typically occurs within the first 5 years of marriage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1077801212442628">NFHS, 2007</xref>). Although domestic violence is most often perpetrated by husbands, MILs have also been implicated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1077801212442628">Fernandez, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1077801212442628">Jain et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1077801212442628">Khosla et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1077801212442628">Muthal-Rathore et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1077801212442628">NFHS, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1077801212442628">Raj, Livramento, Santana, Gupta, &amp; Silverman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1077801212442628">Vera-Sanso, 1999</xref>). In a study of women in a postnatal ward at a hospital in New Delhi, 40% of 168 women who reported experiencing some form of abuse during pregnancy noted that their MIL was the perpetrator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1077801212442628">Muthal-Rathore et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Domestic violence is a criminal offense in India. The Indian Parliament passed the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act in 2005. Yet only a minority of women seek recourse when faced with domestic violence because of their own and broader societal tolerance and acceptance of violence, social stigma associated with being divorced or separated, and economic dependence and lack of alternatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1077801212442628">Jejeebhoy, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1077801212442628">Krishnan et al., 2005</xref>).</p>

<title>Family-Focused and Empowerment-Based Approaches to Mitigating Domestic Violence</title>
<p>Clearly, domestic violence prevention interventions that are implemented early in marriage and empower young women with knowledge and skills to prevent and cope with violence are urgently needed. However, efforts targeting only the woman herself may well be ineffective if the broader context of women’s lives—particularly the marital family—remains unaddressed. Research among women in South Asia, the Middle East, and North American immigrant (Latina, South Asian, East Asian) communities has documented the role of family elders, especially MILs, in exacerbating as well as mitigating domestic violence and has led to recommendations for family-based domestic violence prevention programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1077801212442628">Chan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077801212442628">Clark, Silverman, Shahrouri, Everson-Rose, &amp; Groce, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077801212442628">Ho, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1077801212442628">Kasturirangan, Krishnan, &amp; Riger, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1077801212442628">Klevens et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1077801212442628">Lee, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1077801212442628">Lee &amp; Hadeed, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1077801212442628">Sharma, 2001</xref>). However, to our knowledge, no such programs have been developed and tested.</p>
<p>Successful efforts to mitigate women’s risk of domestic violence have used an empowerment approach. For example, Parker and colleagues’ intervention, implemented among pregnant women with a history of domestic violence in public clinics in Texas and Virginia in the United States, led to a decrease in reported violence at 6 months postpartum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1077801212442628">Parker, McFarlane, Soeken, Silva, &amp; Reel, 1999</xref>). The intervention consisted of three individual sessions aimed at enhancing women’s independence and control of safety, choice making, and problem solving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1077801212442628">McFarlane &amp; Parker, 1994</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1077801212442628">Tiwari et al. (2005)</xref> adapted this approach for use among pregnant Chinese women with a history of domestic violence at antenatal clinics in Hong Kong and found significant reductions in reported physical and psychological abuse at 6 weeks postpartum.</p>
<p>The Intervention with Microfinance for AIDS &amp; Gender Equity (IMAGE) is a second rigorously evaluated, effective empowerment-based intervention that was designed to reduce women’s vulnerability to violence and HIV in South Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1077801212442628">Pronyk et al., 2006</xref>). IMAGE empowered women through a combination of microfinance and education to increase women’s awareness of and skills to address gender inequities and HIV risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1077801212442628">Hargreaves et al., 2002</xref>). Two years after enrollment, participants in the intervention arm fared better on nine indicators of empowerment, including gender-equitable attitudes, decision-making autonomy, and communication with family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1077801212442628">Kim et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1077801212442628">Pronyk et al., 2006</xref>). Most notably, women in the intervention group were 55% less likely to report having experienced physical or sexual violence by a spouse or other sexual partner in the previous 12 months (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). A comparison of these outcomes in villages that participated in IMAGE and those that received microfinance services alone and a control group that received neither microfinance nor education revealed that consistent improvements in outcomes were demonstrated only in the IMAGE villages, suggesting that the educational component was critical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1077801212442628">Kim et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Building on evidence in support of family-focused and empowerment-based approaches to reduce women’s risk of violence, we developed a novel, intergenerational women’s empowerment intervention. Given the importance of childbearing in the early years of marriage, and given the increasing utilization of antenatal care by women, especially in urban India, we developed an antenatal care–based program. The aim of our intervention was to empower daughter-in-laws (DILs) and their MILs with knowledge, skills, and social support critical to the mitigation of young women’s experiences of domestic violence. In this article, we discuss the theoretical basis and development of this intervention and present findings on intervention feasibility, acceptability, and safety from a pilot study with 20 DIL–MIL dyads in urban low-income communities in Bengaluru, India. We conclude by outlining the implications for future research on domestic violence prevention in India and similar cultural contexts.</p>

<title>Study Setting</title>
<p>This study was conducted in two urban low-income communities in the Southern Indian city, Bengaluru, and builds on the results of an earlier longitudinal observational study (the Samata Health Study) in the same communities. Details of the study setting and our earlier research are published elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1077801212442628">Krishnan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1077801212442628">Rocca et al., 2009</xref>). Briefly, Bengaluru, the capital of Karnataka State, has a population of more than 5 million and is India’s third largest city (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1077801212442628">World Gazetteer, 2009</xref>). Approximately 10% of the city’s residents live in low-income communities known as “slums” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1077801212442628">Census of India, 2001</xref>). The Bengaluru municipal corporation operates a network of 48 urban primary health centers, which offer antenatal and postpartum services and are largely located at the center of clusters of slums (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077801212442628">Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike, 2009</xref>). Our research was conducted in two of these urban primary health centers.</p>
<p>Antenatal care utilization is high in urban Karnataka. Recent statistics indicate that 95% of mothers had some care; 89% made at least three antenatal care visits during their most recent pregnancy, and more than two thirds (71%) of women sought care in the first trimester (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1077801212442628">NFHS, 2007</xref>). Thus, antenatal care–based interventions are well situated in terms of inclusion of women from diverse backgrounds.</p>
<p>The prevalence of domestic violence among young women residing in Bengaluru’s slums is high. In the Samata Health Study, more than half (56%) of young married women reported a history of domestic violence since marriage at enrollment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1077801212442628">Rocca et al., 2009</xref>). We found that women’s ability to act on alternatives to remaining in a violent marital relationship was powerfully conditioned by social definitions of the “good” woman—even when education and employment enabled them to perceive options (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1077801212442628">Krishnan et al., 2005</xref>). In fact, our research revealed that a woman’s conformity to family and community norms and expectations may serve to protect her against domestic violence while defiance of or an inability to conform to social norms is liable to increase her domestic violence risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1077801212442628">Krishnan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1077801212442628">Rocca et al., 2009</xref>). Our prior work has underscored the urgent need for programs that promote gender-equitable attitudes and norms and mitigate domestic violence in low-income communities in Bengaluru.</p>

<sec id="section6-1077801212442628">
<title>Study Design</title>
<p>This study consisted of two phases: a development phase and a pilot study phase. During the development phase, we conducted focus group discussions with young married women to explore their perspectives on domestic violence (triggers, sources of social support, and coping strategies) and context-appropriate interventions to mitigate risk of violence. An intervention with young women and their MILs was developed using these data, theories of behavior change, and strategies that have been reported by women to effectively reduce their risk of domestic violence in the United States, Hong Kong, and South Africa. In the pilot study phase, we examined the feasibility, acceptability, and safety of the intervention with a group of young married women and their MILs recruited from the same two communities where our formative development work was conducted. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1077801212442628">Figure 1</xref> depicts the study design.

<title>Focus Group Discussions</title>
<p>A total of 13 focus group discussions were conducted with participants drawn from the Samata Health Study. Women who adhered to the Samata Health Study protocol (i.e., women who needed few visit reminders and attended all three longitudinal study visits) and signed a permission-to-contact form were invited to return to one of the two study-affiliated health centers to participate in a focus group discussion. Such sampling may have limited inclusion of women experiencing domestic violence. However, here we were trying to understand social norms, rather than the experiences of women at high risk. Written informed consent was obtained from interested women. Focus group discussions were conducted in a private room at the health center. Refreshments and a token of appreciation for participation (approximately US$2 in value) were offered to participants. Procedures to promote participant safety included the use of highly trained, experienced staff; conduct of informed consent in a private setting; reminders regarding limits to confidentiality in the group discussion setting; and provision of information on and referrals to violence-related support services to all participants.</p>
<p>Trained facilitators implemented the focus group discussions using guides comprising open-ended questions on the following themes: women’s power within marriage and implications for health, domestic conflict, and violence-related triggers, sources of support, and community norms. We also explored the acceptability and feasibility of interventions to mitigate domestic violence, particularly one involving DILs and MILs, and gathered information to refine intervention design such as on potential barriers to participation and methods of participant recruitment. Questions were geared toward the identification of a range of individual opinions and observations, including areas of consensus and contention, particularly related to intervention design and implementation, rather than the exploration of personal experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1077801212442628">Green &amp; Thorgood, 2004</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section9-1077801212442628">
<title>Theoretical framework</title>
<p>Our intervention is guided by social cognitive theory in combination with Heise’s application of the social-ecological theory of behavior to violence against women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077801212442628">Bandura, 1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077801212442628">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1077801212442628">Heise, 1998</xref>). Social cognitive theory would posit that knowledge of domestic violence–related health risks (such as adverse pregnancy outcomes, anxiety, and depression), communication and decision-making skills to prevent and cope with violence, and a sense of self-efficacy enhanced through peer social support are key aspects of empowering young married women to prevent and cope with domestic violence. However, as Heise’s social-ecological framework has emphasized, women’s risk of violence and ability to prevent and cope with violence are shaped by the interplay of a host of personal, situational (relationship, family, and community), and sociocultural factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1077801212442628">Heise, 1998</xref>). In India, efforts to reduce young women’s risk of domestic violence are unlikely to be effective if the broader context of their lives—especially as shaped by the marital family—remains unaddressed. Thus, in addition to empowering young married women, we also aimed to mobilize their MILs by increasing their knowledge of the links between domestic violence and health and gender-equitable attitudes, building their communication and decision-making skills to reduce their own and their son’s perpetration of domestic violence, and enhancing peer social support for taking leadership in promoting family health.</p>

<title>Curriculum design</title>
<p>The research team, which included staff with community-based women’s health promotion experience, developed the curriculum for the intervention called <italic>Dil Mil</italic>, which in Hindi (India’s national language) means “hearts together.” The number and content of sessions in <italic>Dil Mil</italic> were determined based on the curricula that we adapted as well as insights gained from our formative work. The curriculum has a core component that is implemented with DILs and MILs as well as unique components for DILs, which draw on Parker et al.’s empowerment intervention, and for MILs, which are based on the IMAGE curriculum, Sisters for Life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1077801212442628">McFarlane &amp; Parker, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1077801212442628">Parker et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1077801212442628">Pronyk et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Our adaptation of existing curricula for the Indian context was guided by our theoretical framework, findings from the Samata Health Study, and an Indian health education curriculum on women’s health concerns over the life course (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1077801212442628">CHETNA, 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1077801212442628">CHETNA, 2008b</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1077801212442628">Parker et al.’s (1999)</xref> intervention emphasizes the provision of information on domestic violence, such as information on the potential impact of violence on women’s and infants’ health and safety planning and the enhancement of problem-solving and choice-making skills. These activities were adapted by drawing upon Indian data on violence, locally available support resources, and communication and decision-making skill-building exercises used in the Indian curriculum. Care was taken to ensure the cultural appropriateness of the curriculum while also retaining core elements of the original curricula (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1077801212442628">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Note: Sessions are based on participatory learning and action principles and involve stories, role play, and discussion. Co-counseling, which aims to build peer support and empathy through dyadic peer counseling interactions within the small groups, was practiced in every session (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1077801212442628">Kauffman &amp; New, 2004</xref>).</p>

<p>The program was delivered in the context of antenatal care like Parker et al.’s intervention and used a small-group format. Sessions were implemented with young women (DILs) and their MILs, both separately and jointly. Two 3-hour sessions were conducted with DILs, and five 3-hour sessions were conducted with MILs. In addition, one joint 3-hour session was conducted with DIL–MIL dyads. Trained female lay health educators facilitated the intervention sessions in Tamil, a commonly spoken local language.</p>
<p>In addition to the group-based education, DILs and MILs were offered primary health care. DILs were offered standard antenatal care, including counseling on pregnancy, postpartum, and infant health. MILs were offered a comprehensive health examination (a service that is not routinely offered at the primary health center), including a gynecological exam and screening for diabetes and hypertension, along with appropriate information, prescriptions, and referrals. All women were offered information on domestic violence–related resources and referrals.</p>

<sec id="section11-1077801212442628">
<title>Pilot Study</title>
<p>The feasibility and acceptability of <italic>Dil Mil</italic> were examined among a new sample of young women and their MILs recruited from the same two communities where the Samata Health Study was implemented. To be eligible, young women had to meet the following criteria: (a) aged 18 to 30 years, (b) pregnant and in the first trimester (expanded to include second trimester), (c) able to speak Tamil, (d) able and willing to refer their MIL for study participation, and (e) able and willing to attend study visits with no plans to travel in the next 3 months. Having a history of domestic violence or other spousal maltreatment was not included as an eligibility criterion because of limited data on potential risks and benefits of the intervention and the desire to assess both prevention and mitigation of domestic violence. Enrollment of MILs was determined based on whether they were (a) able to speak Tamil, (b) able and willing to give informed consent to participate, (c) able to confirm that they were the MIL of a DIL who was recruited, and (d) able and willing to attend study visits with no plans to travel in the next 3 months.</p>
<p>A multistage recruitment and consent process was implemented. We first approached young women (DILs) at the two study-affiliated health centers and through community outreach. We administered a short screening questionnaire to assess eligibility (aged 18-30 years, self-report of pregnancy, Tamil speaker) and then invited potentially eligible DILs to the health center (if recruited in the community) for eligibility confirmation. Informed consent was obtained from eligible DILs, with enrollment contingent on their MIL being confirmed eligible and consenting to participate in the study. MILs were either referred by their DIL to the health center or contacted by study staff using information provided by their DIL.</p>
<p>Eligibility confirmation and consent were implemented at the health center to ensure confidentiality and minimize potential risks of study participation. Care was taken to prevent disruption of family relationships either because of family members’ perception of the intervention as being focused on violence or because of resistance to the types of social and behavioral change encouraged by the intervention. DILs’ consent to participate in the study was obtained before their MIL was contacted, to minimize risk of domestic conflict and/or coercion.</p>
<p>Full disclosure to young women and their MILs regarding the study was ensured during informed consent. As recommended and approved by our U.S. and Indian institutional review boards, the overall aim of the research was described as the evaluation of a program that would address the health needs of younger and older women and children, including the health impact of experiences of conflict and violence in the family. Consent was documented by a signature or thumbprint, and participants were given the option of taking a copy of the consent form home. A dyad was considered enrolled if a DIL and her MIL provided independent, informed consent.</p>
<p>All intervention and related data collection activities were implemented at the two study-affiliated health centers. Participants were offered a small token of appreciation (valued at about US$2) for each completed study visit. They were also offered transportation to and from the clinic and a meal when they attended intervention sessions that lasted 2 to 3 hours. Feedback on the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention was elicited through semistructured in-depth interviews within 2 weeks after the completion of the intervention. Trained interviewers who were not involved in the implementation of the intervention explored participants’ motivations to enroll and remain in the study, aspects of the intervention they found useful, areas they felt could be improved, and their opinions about future implementation of the program.</p>

<sec id="section12-1077801212442628">
<title>Data Analyses</title>
<p>Focus group discussions and postintervention in-depth interviews were conducted in Tamil and audiotaped, transcribed, and translated into English by study staff. Translations were reviewed for accuracy by a senior member of the research team who is fluent in the local language and English. A modified grounded theory approach guided data analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1077801212442628">Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1994</xref>). Data collection and interpretation, led by the project director (KS) and principal investigator (SK), took place iteratively, with emerging themes and questions contributing to further data collection and in-depth analysis. Emerging findings were often discussed with members of the field team to ensure that individual biases and assumptions were not influencing the analytical process. During this process, we (SK and KS) independently developed a codebook for each set of data based on categories grounded in the data and topics identified a priori. The two codebooks were merged to create a master codebook; redundant codes were removed, and code meanings were discussed to ensure consistent and accurate code interpretation. Transcripts were coded and analyzed with the aid of the software package ATLAS.ti. Coded data were examined to identify categories of codes and subcodes and connections between categories, with connections documented using memos. Memos were refined iteratively and further summarized into key themes, and representative quotes were selected for each theme.</p>

<title>Triggers of Domestic Violence and MILs’ Role</title>
<p>The majority of focus group discussion participants acknowledged that violence “happens in all the houses.” Many triggers of domestic violence were noted, including lack of acquiescence to a husband’s demand for sex, conflicts related to husband’s employment and income, and women’s mobility within the community. Problems in women’s relationships with their in-laws also figured prominently in discussions of triggers of violence. MILs may exacerbate domestic conflict and violence if they felt that their relationship with their son was threatened by their DIL; if a DIL was not adequately “obedient” to them, their sons, and in some cases their daughters; if the dowry a DIL brought was perceived as insufficient; or if a DIL did not produce a child soon after marriage. The situation was described by one participant:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Some MILs feel that . . . the DIL has come between them and their son. . . . MILs were also once DILs, but they forget what that was like once they get the “MIL” status. They start torturing [their DIL]. They don’t think about the past; they don’t adjust. . . . And, the [DIL] can find it difficult if the son has the same attachment to his mother. . . . Because of this, there can be fights between the husband and wife. (Focus Group 9)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Women emphasized that dowry demands and violence by husbands were often intensified by MILs. The following quote illustrates what was viewed as a fairly common scenario:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The MIL will say that she has not brought this or that [as part of her dowry], and hearing his mother, the husband will also repeat this. He will beat—listening to his parents’ words. (Focus Group 6)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1077801212442628">
<title>Women’s Responses to Violence and MILs’ Role</title>
<p>Women not only acknowledged the occurrence of domestic violence in their communities but also appeared reconciled to its occurrence. The majority bore it in silence, sometimes with severe consequences. Respondents pointed out local reports of suicides by young women as an example of the extreme result of “too much torture” by husbands and in-laws. They emphasized that domestic conflict and violence were issues that could not be easily shared with others and that such experiences may be shared only with individuals who could be trusted to keep the information confidential.</p>
<p>When asked to provide examples of individuals to whom women could turn, there was little consensus. Some cited close friends, noting that disclosure to friends may yield psychological benefits. Others felt that it was safest for women to tackle the problem on their own: “If we share [experiences of violence] with others, the problem will be aggravated rather than reduced. The problem will not be solved, so we have to understand and solve it ourselves” (Focus Group 3).</p>
<p>Upon further probing, several participants observed that domestic conflict and violence were family matters and that family members, including MILs (although sometimes implicated in the perpetration of violence), could be called in to intervene. In the words of one woman, “Instead of telling others, we should discuss [domestic violence] with others in our family. . . . If we share with our relatives, they will not tell it out; they will advise and do some good” (Focus Group 10). A few commented that there were houses in which DILs and MILs were “like daughter and mother.” They went on to describe numerous ways in which MILs supported their DILs and positively influenced their sons’ behaviors. MILs helped by looking after grandchildren, providing economic support especially when their son did not work, and doing household chores and taking care of DILs during pregnancy and the postpartum period. MILs also advised sons and DILs on a range of family matters, including management of household finances, child rearing, and the marital relationship.</p>
<p>Notably, despite women’s reservations about the role of MILs, they also considered it appropriate and judicious to talk about domestic violence with them. Examples of positive interventions made by MILs when DILs appealed to them for support included trying to reason with their sons, urging them not to be violent, and even reprimanding them as illustrated by the following quote: “If my husband is beating me, my MIL will come and scold her son” (Focus Group 7). MILs may even go to the length of temporarily separating their DIL from their son to minimize the DIL’s risk of domestic violence: “MIL will say, ‘what you won’t take care? I will take care of my DIL’” (Focus Group 7). At a minimum, MILs could provide critical social support: “Even if they don<italic>’</italic>t do anything to help, if they speak a few loving words that is a huge comfort for the DIL” (Focus Group 10).</p>
<p>Underpinning women’s responses was a view that MILs have a “right” to intervene, which one participant explicitly articulated: “If there is a problem between husband and wife, the MIL can solve it. She can advise me or my husband. She can say that this is right or this is wrong as she has the right to do it” (Focus Group 9). In fact, MILs’ support may be preferable to support from a woman’s natal family because husbands were less likely to retaliate in response to intervention by their own mother as compared with individuals from their wife’s family, as indicated in the following quote: “Mother will comfort us. . . . If we talk to our MIL, she can scold and beat her son. . . . She will question her son, and tell him not treat his wife like that” (Focus Group 6). Thus, although some MILs heightened and even perpetrated violence against young women, MILs can—and sometimes did—take a leadership role in reducing domestic violence.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1077801212442628">
<title>Designing an Intervention With DILs and MILs</title>
<p>Focus group participants offered detailed feedback on intervention design. There was some debate regarding the feasibility of an intervention involving MILs and DILs with concerns regarding increases in the risk of domestic conflict and violence noted in almost every group. Although a small minority of participants felt that interventions should focus primarily on MILs, many participants felt that one involving both MILs and DILs was important. They recommended separate interactions with DILs and MILs to encourage open communication. However, they also acknowledged that some joint interaction was needed to minimize risks of exacerbating familial tensions and suspicions about what each party may assume the other may have said in their absence. Joint interactions also had the potential to enhance opportunities for resolving conflicts. In addition, MILs and DILs who have a mutually supportive relationship could serve as role models in a mixed-group setting. One participant noted that hearing about other women’s experiences with their MILs would make her feel “that I should not [be abusive to my DIL] and then make up my mind to not go in that direction. I would feel sorry for what I have done, and correct myself” (Focus Group 9).</p>
<p>Framing the program in terms of improving family life and health emerged as a potential strategy to promote safety and openness. In the words of one participant,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>[You can talk about] how to maintain a healthy family; how to prevent problems; what are the best ways to go about things; how to be so that there are no problems in the family; how as elders they can set an example. (Focus Group 9)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Participants also offered guidance on incentives that we might use to recruit MILs. They emphasized that MILs’ support for DILs could be mobilized after first addressing their own health issues. They suggested access to diagnostic services and information and referrals for health concerns related to aging as a possible benefit. Also, they confirmed that a program implemented during antenatal care would be acceptable to young women and their MILs. However, they noted that DILs may not be able to make study-related visits between the 8th month of pregnancy and the first 40 days postpartum, since many go to their natal home for delivery. Women also noted that all research activities should be conducted at the health center, which was viewed as a respectable, neutral, and legitimate space for women to frequent. These findings were used to develop and pilot test <italic>Dil Mil</italic>, a context-specific intergenerational violence prevention program.</p>

<p>Sociodemographic characteristics of pilot study participants are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1077801212442628">Table 3</xref>. DILs’ average age was 23 years, while their MILs were, on average, about 30 years older. The majority of DILs (60%) were nulliparous. Although DILs were not selected on the basis of prior experience of domestic violence, 11 out of 20 enrolled in the study mentioned past experiences of domestic conflict and violence in postintervention in-depth interviews.</p>

<title>Feasibility</title>
<p>A total of 134 DILs met the initial short eligibility screen, and 33 dyads went on to be confirmed eligible. Reasons for being ineligible included not being pregnant or in the first trimester of pregnancy and not having an eligible MIL. Twenty dyads (61%) consented to enroll in the study. During recruitment for the pilot study, we decided to extend eligible DILs’ age from 25 to 30 years due to the profile of antenatal care registrants. We also decided to include young women in the second trimester of pregnancy to increase the pool of potential participants.</p>
<p>Adherence and retention were extremely high. Eighteen out of 20 MILs and 18 out of 20 DILs attended each intervention session. A similar proportion of dyads (18 out of 20) participated in the DIL–MIL joint session. All 40 participants completed in-depth interviews within 2 weeks of the previous intervention session. MILs and DILs identified a range of factors that motivated them to adhere to study visits, including rapport with staff and their peer group.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-1077801212442628">
<title>Acceptability and potential effectiveness</title>
<p>A prime motivation to enroll in the study was an interest in learning more about pregnancy-related health issues (DILs) and aging-related health concerns (MILs). Several participants mentioned that they were curious to hear what study staff had to say about the DIL–MIL relationship. One MIL described her reason for joining the study thus: There are many problems between MILs and DILs. I joined to learn more about that. (MIL 2)</p>
<p>Women found the sessions useful and interesting, highlighting the discussion of health issues and family relationships. All MILs found the health information offered in the intervention to be useful, and more than half (13 out of 20) noted changes in diet and adherence to medication as a result of participation in the program. Greater awareness of the importance of relationships with DILs and improvements in the relationship were also noted uniformly. In the words of one MIL,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I learned about how a DIL should behave with her MIL—how to talk, adjust. I also learned how we [MILs] should look after our DILs like they are our own children. A sister-in-law and MIL should not create problems in the house. I understood that clearly. It’s good. (MIL 8)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Greater recognition of the importance of MILs’ leadership in the family—both in terms of promoting health and in terms of preventing violence—was another outcome. Ten out of 20 MILs specifically mentioned intervening with sons during domestic conflicts after participation in the study, as illustrated by the following quotes:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>When there is a fight, I will send my son outside. [I will say,] “If you show your anger, I will say one thing and you will say something and then it becomes a big problem. You go outside for ten minutes and show your anger somewhere else. Afterwards you come and talk peacefully.” . . . Like that I will say and send my son outside and keep my DIL inside. (MIL 12)</p>
<p>When she [DIL] is not there, I will tell him not to do like that. I will tell him, “Don’t make this beating a habit.” I can say that and stop them. . . . We cannot scold our DIL in front of our son, and we cannot scold him in front of her. Both of them will think I am supporting them. By talking peacefully to each other in each one’s absence, we can stop [the beating]. (MIL 14)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>An additional six MILs noted that they would comfort their DIL and help her cope with marital conflict and violence. For example, one MIL (19) said that she would tell her DIL, “You go peacefully. His mind will change one day. Be patient until then.”</p>
<p>DILs’ responses echoed those of MILs. All DILs noted that they felt more knowledgeable and confident about their health. They particularly appreciated advice on nutrition and the discussion of food taboos during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Improvements in communication and coping skills, including talking openly at home and managing conflicts through negotiation rather than anger, were also reported. A substantial number of DILs (12 out of 20) spoke about improvements in their relationships with their MIL, highlighting their own and their MIL’s increased understanding of each others concerns:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I am able to take care of her—I can tell [my MIL] to eat this and do this, and she will feel happy. . . . By taking care like this, our relationship will become better. She also came to know what to do and what not to do for me. . . . So, the relationship will be good. (DIL 11)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Participants unanimously supported the expansion of the program. They recommended actively advertising the study with the support of community advisors and pilot study participants (some of whom volunteered), holding community meetings including husbands, and providing information on logistical support available to participants in the form of transportation by rickshaw to the clinic to attend sessions and weekend sessions to accommodate working women and to reach out to women who may be at high risk of domestic violence.</p>

<title>Safety</title>
<p>As evidenced by the high adherence and retention in the study, participants were enthusiastic about the <italic>Dil Mil</italic> intervention. Furthermore, none mentioned increased conflict or violence in the home as a result of study participation. Participants were informed of counseling and referrals available at the health center, and they were encouraged to seek support in the event of domestic conflict or violence. No adverse events were recorded during the 6-week intervention period, and no reports of study participation–related violence were recorded at the health centers up to 3 months after the pilot study.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>It is increasingly recognized that domestic violence prevention efforts must target not only victims and abusers but also the family and community contexts that shape individual behaviors. Yet few such interventions have been developed and systematically studied. To our knowledge, our project in Bengaluru, India, is the first to have developed and examined an intergenerational intervention to mitigate domestic violence. It has provided compelling evidence that a family-focused, women’s empowerment–based approach is indeed feasible, acceptable, and potentially safe and effective.</p>
<p>Our formative research confirmed previously documented triggers and responses to domestic violence in India (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1077801212442628">Jejeebhoy &amp; Cook, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077801212442628">Jeyaseelan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1077801212442628">Panchanadeswaran &amp; Koverola, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1077801212442628">Rocca et al., 2009</xref>). Conflicts between husbands and wives arose over sex, household finances, women’s mobility, and dowry. Often, in-laws, especially MILs, were also implicated. Women were largely reconciled to domestic conflict and violence, and the majority suffered in silence. In fact, multiple references were made to the occurrence of suicides among young married women in these communities, pointing to the urgent need for interventions that enhance young women’s access to social support and that mitigate their domestic violence risk.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, given this broader scenario, women identified few sources of social support. Domestic violence was viewed as a private family matter, and external sources of support and intervention were largely eschewed. Among women who successfully coped with violence were individuals who obtained the support of their MIL. They noted that MILs’ position within the family enabled them to intervene without the risks that may accompany interventions by women’s natal family. The <italic>Dil Mil</italic> intervention was based on these and additional insights gained from formative research.</p>
<p>Much attention was paid to developing a protocol that would not exacerbate women’s risk of domestic violence. For example, the study description and goals were articulated with care to ensure full disclosure while minimizing risks of backlash against women. We advertised the study as aiming to address family health concerns, including the health impacts of domestic conflict and violence, among younger and older women and children. A second strategy to minimize participation-related risks was employing a multistage recruitment and consent process in which the final steps (including review of the consent form) were conducted in a private setting at the local health center. Thus, we ensured that young women had an opportunity to weigh the risks and benefits of participation and reach an informed decision, without undue influence by her MIL or other family member.</p>
<p>The results of our pilot study indicate that a family-based approach to violence prevention is highly promising. Although the relationship between MILs and DILs is commonly thought of as adversarial, findings of this study support the notion that with increased awareness and knowledge of gender inequities, violence, and health, enhanced relationship skills, and peer support, intergenerational relationships can be safely mobilized to mitigate domestic violence.</p>
<sec id="section23-1077801212442628">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Intervention research on domestic violence, especially in settings such as ours where there is a high prevalence and incidence of violence, may pose risks to participants. Participation in a study on violence may contribute to domestic conflict and inadvertently increase women’s vulnerability. Thus, even when interventions are culturally grounded, theoretically sound, and based on evidence, phased evaluation of feasibility, acceptability, safety, and effectiveness is prudent. Small-scale qualitative pilots (or phase 1 studies), such as the one we conducted, enable researchers to make a preliminary assessment of an intervention strategy at relatively low risk and with relatively few resources. Qualitative data collection methods offer participants an opportunity to voice their concerns and viewpoints on the intervention. Pilot data indicating feasibility, acceptability, and potential safety provide a rationale for further research on the approach. Thus, we believe that our pilot study and our phased approach to intervention development and evaluation are strengths rather than limitations. Results of this pilot study provide a strong rationale for a more rigorous evaluation of <italic>Dil Mil</italic> with a larger sample, a control group, and quantitative measures. An assessment of program costs would also help facilitate decisions regarding scale-up of this approach.</p>
<p>Although we did not select pilot participants on the basis of prior experience of domestic violence, our inclusion criteria for DILs (being young and pregnant) were designed to recruit an especially vulnerable group. Our data bore this out: 11 out of 20 young women voluntarily reported a history of domestic violence in postintervention interviews. Nonetheless, our inability to specifically comment on the influence of prior experiences of domestic violence on our outcomes of interest (feasibility, acceptability, and safety) may pose a limitation. Future research on this intervention should evaluate recruitment, enrollment, and retention on the basis of women’s history of domestic violence.</p>
<p>It is possible that DILs who enrolled in this study with their MIL were at lower risk of domestic violence. However, the high levels of violence reported by DILs indicate that, although they may not be at highest risk, they were vulnerable. Engaging in greater community outreach as suggested by this study’s participants may help us reach those at highest risk. Assessment of domestic violence experience during screening in future research on this intervention will enable assessment of potential selection bias.</p>
<p>Finally, this research is most applicable to the low-income urban setting in India and to communities where members of the extended family, such as MILs, continue to play an important role in young women’s lives. Although increasing proportions of young married couples in urban contexts may be living as nuclear families, extended families are likely to reside in relatively close proximity and to play an important role. In fact, recent studies in communities in the United States and elsewhere have documented the role of the extended family in domestic violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1077801212442628">Chan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077801212442628">Clark et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1077801212442628">Kasturirangan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1077801212442628">Klevens et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1077801212442628">Lee &amp; Hadeed, 2009</xref>). If <italic>Dil Mil</italic> is proven effective in this context, it may be adapted and tested in other settings where similar family dynamics have been identified as important.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The results of this study provide several insights into the development and implementation of domestic violence interventions in India. It suggests that engaging in domestic violence prevention as part of maternal and child health promotion—in the context of antenatal care—is feasible, acceptable, and potentially safe. In fact, given the importance of childbearing in the early years of marriage, and given the increasing utilization of antenatal care by women, especially in urban India, lack of systematic domestic violence screening and interventions represent a missed opportunity to prevent escalation of violence and serious adverse outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077801212442628">Campbell, 2001</xref>). Furthermore, interventions that are implemented through primary health care and allied national programs, as opposed to stand-alone interventions, have greater potential for scale-up (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1077801212442628">Kim et al., 2007</xref>). The launch of new national initiatives to increase health care access, such as the National Urban and Rural Health Missions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1077801212442628">Voice of India, 2009</xref>) and the recently enacted Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act 2005 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1077801212442628">Government of India, 2006</xref>), has increased opportunities for large-scale implementation of evidence-based domestic violence reduction interventions in the country.</p>
<p>However, much remains to be learned about specific strategies that may be acceptable, safe, and effective. Further research is needed to explore ways in which primary care providers and community health workers can engage in primary and secondary domestic violence prevention. At the same time, it is critical that the development of these strategies takes into account women’s perspectives on violence, including the kinds of social support and intervention they desire and their fears and concerns regarding external intervention. Given the evidence on the multiple major health concerns associated with domestic violence, we must prioritize identification and evaluation of prevention strategies. Further research that is being planned on the effectiveness of the DIL–MIL empowerment strategy described in this article promises to contribute to advancing this goal.</p>
