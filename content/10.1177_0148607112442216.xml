<abstract>
<p><italic>Background</italic>: Lipid emulsions have been suggested to reduce immune responses, particularly in severely stressed patients. The authors investigated the influence of the slow intravenous infusion of a soybean oil–based lipid emulsion on some immune parameters in patients who had undergone an esophagectomy for esophageal cancer. <italic>Methods</italic>: Thirty-two patients who had undergone an esophagectomy were randomly divided into a lipid emulsion (LPD)–treated group and a control group. All patients received parenteral feeding with a glucose-based solution. Patients in the LPD group received 100 mL of a 20% soybean oil emulsion for 7 days after the esophagectomy in addition to the glucose-based feeding. A slow infusion rate (0.09–0.12 g/kg/h) was adopted to take account of the intrinsic degradation of infused lipids. Immune responses were measured based on lymphocyte proliferation and serum concentrations of monocyte chemoattractant protein–1 (MCP-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor–α (TNF-α). The authors also measured levels of rapid turnover proteins (ie, transferrin, prealbumin, and retinol-binding protein). <italic>Results</italic>: Phytohemagglutinin- and concanavalin A–stimulated lymphocyte proliferation significantly decreased after the esophagectomy, but no significant difference was seen between the LPD and control groups. No significant difference in changes in plasma concentrations of MCP-1, IL-6 and TNF-α occurred between the 2 groups either. Plasma concentrations of rapid turnover proteins did not differ between the groups. <italic>Conclusions</italic>: These results indicate that the lipid emulsion did not affect the immune parameters measured in patients who had undergone an esophagectomy when administered at a slow rate.</p>

<body>
<p>Malnutrition is associated with mortality in hospitalized patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0148607112442216">1</xref></sup> Parenteral nutrition (PN) is provided after an esophagectomy. The supply of enough energy through an intravenous (IV) catheter is essential for a full recovery and to avoid malnutrition. Lipid emulsions are frequently used as an IV infusion to provide energy to patients who need high-calorie intake because lipids have more calories per weight than carbohydrates. A soybean oil emulsion is commercially available and frequently used for IV injections in many countries.</p>
<p>The fatty acids in lipid emulsions administered intravenously attract apoprotein from high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and form lipoproteins. The lipoproteins are converted back to fatty acids by lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and used for energy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0148607112442216">2</xref></sup> The infusion of a soybean oil emulsion, however, was reported to reduce immune function in severely stressed patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0148607112442216">3</xref></sup>: concanavalin A (Con A)– and phytohemagglutinin (PHA)–stimulated lymphocyte proliferation 7 days after esophagectomy was significantly lower in patients given the soybean oil emulsion than in those given a glucose-based solution alone. The intrinsic breakdown of lipid emulsions administered intravenously has a saturable level because the supply of apoprotein from HDL has limitations. Therefore, an infusion rate greater than the intrinsic degradation capacity may cause hyperlipidemia. Macrophages phagocytize excess lipid particles in the bloodstream of patients with hyperlipidemia. These foamy macrophages affect cellular immunity and immune responses. In turn, soybean oil emulsions contain a lot of linoleic acid, including ω-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). ω-6 PUFAs are a precursor of arachidonic acid, which in turn gives rise to leukotrienes and dienoic prostaglandins. It is known that dienoic prostaglandins, such as prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub>, suppress host immune responses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0148607112442216">4</xref></sup> Lipid emulsions with a high proportion of linoleic acid promote the apoptosis or necrosis of lymphocytes in vitro.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0148607112442216">5</xref></sup> Therefore, immune function is reported to be compromised by lipid emulsions rich in ω-6 PUFAs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0148607112442216">6</xref></sup> Although a decrease in immune response is predicted to be associated with the infusion rate of lipid emulsions,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0148607112442216">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0148607112442216">8</xref></sup> no study has focused on the infusion rate of soybean oil emulsions.</p>
<p>Monocyte chemoattractant protein–1 (MCP-1), an inflammatory cytokine, attracts monocytes, memory T lymphocytes, and natural killer cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0148607112442216">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0148607112442216">10</xref></sup> Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a pleiotropic cytokine that plays an important role in host defense due to its wide range of immune and hematopoietic activities and its ability to induce an acute phase response.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0148607112442216">11</xref></sup> Production of IL-6 is induced in response to tumor necrosis factor–α (TNF-α).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0148607112442216">12</xref></sup> MCP-1 production is also induced in response to TNF-α.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0148607112442216">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0148607112442216">14</xref></sup> Serum levels of MCP-1, IL-6, and TNF are known to increase in association with defects in cell-mediated immunity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0148607112442216">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0148607112442216">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the present study, we evaluated the influence of the slow IV infusion of a lipid emulsion on plasma cytokines and ex vivo T cell proliferation in patients who had undergone an esophagectomy for esophageal cancer. We also investigated changes in plasma concentrations of rapid turnover proteins—transferrin (TF), prealbumin (PA), and retinol-binding protein (RBP)—to assess changes in nutrition status after an esophagectomy.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<sec id="section2-0148607112442216">
<title>Patients and Clinical Protocol</title>
<p>Thirty-two patients who underwent an esophagectomy for esophageal cancer at Shizuoka Prefectural General Hospital from September 2006 to March 2009 were prospectively enrolled into the study. The protocol was approved by the institutional review board at the Shizuoka Prefectural General Hospital. All patients provided written informed consent before entry into the study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0148607112442216">
<title>Study Design</title>
<p>This study was conducted as a prospective randomized open-label trial. Patients fed exclusively PN were divided into 2 groups: a lipid emulsion (LPD) group and a control group. The LPD group received daily 100 mL of a 20% soybean oil emulsion (Intralipos; Otsuka Pharmaceutical Factory, Inc, Tokushima, Japan), 20 g as soybean oil, with an infusion rate of 0.09–0.12 g/kg/h in addition to PN consisting of glucose from 1 day (day 1) to 7 days (day 7) after the operation. The soybean oil emulsion contained 51.6% linoleic acid, 7.7% α-linolenic acid, and 1.6% arachidonic acid as essential fatty acids. The control group received 1120 kcal/d with fat-free PN and approximately 200 kcal less energy than the LPD group. Patients in the LPD group received 24% (days 1 and 7) and 17% (days 2–6) of this total daily calorie intake from the soybean oil emulsion. Every patient intravenously received a bolus (250 mg) of methylprednizolone sodium succinate (Solu Medrol) just before the esophagectomy.</p>

<sec id="section4-0148607112442216">
<title>Laboratory Analyses</title>
<p>Serum concentrations of IL-6, MCP-1, and TNF-α were determined using the Human IL-6 ELISA Kit (Endogen, Inc, Woburn, MA), Human MCP-1 ELISA Kit (Endogen, Inc), and Quantikine HS Human TNF-α/TNFSF1A Immunoassay (R&amp;D Systems, Inc, Minneapolis, MN), respectively. Serum concentrations of RBP, TF, and PA were determined using N-Assay LA RBP, N-Assay TIA Tf-H, and N-Assay TIA Prealbumim (Nittobo Medical Co, Ltd, Tokyo, Japan).</p>
<p>Con A– or PHA-stimulated lymphocyte proliferation was measured based on the incorporation of [<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0148607112442216">3</xref></sup>H]thymidine into DNA of lymphocytes at the SRL Laboratory (Tokyo, Japan). Results were evaluated using a stimulated index (SI). The SI values were estimated by the dividing radioactivity with mitogen by that without mitogen.</p>
<p>Serum concentrations of MCP-1, IL-6, TNF-α, RBP, PA, and TF were measured 1 day before, 2 hours after, and 1, 2, and 9 days after surgery. Blood samples were centrifuged at 1000 <italic>g</italic> for 15 minutes, and the sera were stored at −80°C until assayed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0148607112442216">
<title>Statistical Analyses</title>
<p>All values are expressed as the mean ± SD. Statistical analyses for temporal changes in immune cytokines and rapid turnover proteins were performed using the repeated-measure analysis of variance (repeated-ANOVA). If a significant difference was detected with the repeated-ANOVA, the Tukey test was performed to compare multiple groups. Comparisons of parameters between the LPD and control groups were performed using the Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test. Demographic, preoperative, and surgical data were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test or Fisher exact test. All statistical analyses were carried out with the use of SPSS software, version 17.0 (SPSS, Inc, an IBM Company, Chicago, IL). <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05 was considered significant.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Demographic, preoperative, and surgical data are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0148607112442216">Table 1</xref>. The LPD group had more frequently received preoperative chemotherapy. There were no significant differences in demographic data between the groups. Operative blood loss and volume of fluid infusion during surgery were significantly larger in the LPD group. SI values for Con A–stimulated lymphocyte proliferation before the operation were significantly lower in the LPD group. Blood cell counts and renal and hepatic function test results from before the operation were comparable between the groups with 1 exception: platelet counts were significantly lower in the LPD group.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present study showed that when 20 g of soybean oil was intravenously infused as a lipid emulsion at a rate of 0.09–0.12 g/kg/h, there was no significant change in the immunological parameters measured in patients who had undergone an esophagectomy. Battistella et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0148607112442216">6</xref></sup> reported that the IV infusion of a soybean oil–based emulsion caused an increase in susceptibility to infection in trauma patients. We, however, did not find an increased infection rate in the LPD group compared with the control group (data not shown). They administered 16% higher daily total calories and twice as many calories as we provided as a soybean oil emulsion. Other differences were that the patients in their study were younger and suffered from trauma but not malignancies. Those differences may explain the different results. Furukawa et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0148607112442216">3</xref></sup> showed that the administration of a lipid emulsion to patients after an esophagectomy impeded lymphocyte proliferation and raised serum IL-6 concentrations 2-fold as compared with levels in patients who received fat-free PN. They suggested that the excessive rise in IL-6 levels reflected decreased immune function but did not mention the rate of infusion. The rate at which an oil emulsion is infused is thought to be very important because the rate of intrinsic breakdown of lipid particles has limitations. Some experts have recommended that infusions of parenteral lipid emulsions at rates of 0.8–1.5 g/kg/d are safe but should not exceed 2.6 g/kg/d (0.11 g/kg/h).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0148607112442216">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0148607112442216">17</xref></sup> The study of Intralipid shows that the infusion rate can be increased up to 0.2 g fat/min, which converts to 0.24–0.15 g/kg/h in patients whose body weight is 50–80 kg. This rate is higher than that recommended by experts. In Japan, soybean oil–based emulsions (20%) are generally infused at a rate of 83 mL/h (≈ 0.3 g/kg/h) as recommended by their manufacturers. This rate is 3 times the one used here and exceeds the upper limit of the infusion rate proposed by experts. The infusion rate of 0.09–0.12 g/kg/h in the present study was almost within the recommended limit. The slow infusion of the lipid emulsion in this study may have contributed to the lack of deterioration in host immune function.</p>
<p>Differences between the study by Furukawa et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0148607112442216">3</xref></sup> and our study are that we clearly stated the rate of infusion of the lipid emulsion, and corticosteroids were administered before esophagectomy. The preoperative administration of corticosteroids might affect immune responses. Although no corticosteroid was administered to the patients in the previous study, preoperative corticosteroid treatment is generally used in current clinical settings. Therefore, our study adopted the slow infusion of a soybean oil–based emulsion and administration of corticosteroids before the esophagectomy. Under our study conditions, no significant difference in immune response parameters, such as PHA and Con A–stimulated lymphocyte proliferation, in patients after esophagectomy was seen between infusion of the soybean oil emulsion in addition to the glucose-based fluid and the glucose-based fluid alone.</p>
<p>Despite the random allocation, the total volume of blood loss, volume of infusion, and volume of blood transfusion during the operation were significantly larger in the LPD group than in the control group. The differences indicated that operative stress was more severe in the LPD group and might influence host immune activity because severe stress such as hemorrhage is known to cause a significant elevation in serum IL-6 levels and decrease in lymphocyte proliferation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0148607112442216">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0148607112442216">18</xref></sup> Platelet counts were significantly lower in the LPD group. Lower platelet counts before the operation might have caused more bleeding in the LPD group. Moreover, the mean SI value for Con A–stimulated lymphocyte proliferation was significantly lower in the LPD group before the operation. Despite this disadvantage, there was no significant difference in lymphocyte proliferation or serum concentrations of MCP-1, IL-6, and rapid turnover proteins between the groups. One patient in the LPD group showed extremely high concentrations of IL-6 in serum after the operation, which led to a large deviation value and might explain the lack of a significant temporal change in the group. Although an elevation in serum IL-6 levels is reported to be associated with hemorrhage,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0148607112442216">18</xref></sup> the blood loss by this patient during the operation was less than the average for the LPD group.</p>
<p>We measured nutrition changes in patients after the esophagectomy. Patients in the LPD group received 200 kcal more than those in the control group. There was, however, no significant difference in plasma profiles of rapid turnover proteins (ie, PA, TF, and RBP) between the groups. The amount of bleeding was significantly greater in the LPD group. It is well established that severe bleeding causes protein catabolism and a deterioration in rapid turnover proteins. That there was no difference in the plasma concentrations of rapid turnover proteins between the LPD and control groups until 9 days after the surgery indicates that the lipid emulsion did not have a harmful influence on host nutrition after the esophagectomy. Our results did not show a nutrition advantage from the lipid emulsion in those patients, probably because of a difference in the extent of bleeding between the groups and the small amount (200 kcal/d) of lipid emulsion used. A larger amount of lipid emulsion may be required to obtain an obvious nutrition advantage in severely stressed patients.</p>
<p>Limitations of this study include an imbalance in the extent of bleeding between the LPD and control groups, as well as a small sample size. We should also mention that the lack of difference in the immune-related parameters examined does not mean that immune function was equivalent between the 2 groups.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this study indicated that the slow infusion of a lipid emulsion did not affect the immune response of severely stressed patients who need hyperalimentation. Further study is needed to assess the advantages of lipid emulsions in addition to glucose-based alimentation.</p>
