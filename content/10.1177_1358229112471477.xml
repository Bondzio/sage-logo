         <abstract>
            <p>For too long, homosexuals have been considered as failed heterosexuals without the rights to self-realisation that other groups in society have. Persons who exhibit emotional and erotic attraction to members of their own sex have been persecuted both by private individuals in society and by the state. They are punished for not what they have done but simply for their perceived deviance. Their freedom of sexual expression is repressed for its perceived symbolism rather than because of its proven harm. Africa has seen the enactment of a great deal of homophobic violence and drama. This article argues that the persecution of homosexual people violates their fundamental rights and denies them the opportunity to enjoy their full personhood. The article also makes the point that efforts by homosexual people in Africa to secure their recognition and respect of their rights are undercut by the denunciation of gay and lesbian rights by some African leaders. The article further laments the inaction of the African Commission in the struggle for recognition by gay men and lesbians. It argues that the African Commission has a crucial role to play in promoting and protecting gay and lesbian rights, and in particular in seeking to change social convictions and attitudes of African people by embracing homosexuality and appealing to African countries that still legally prohibit the practice to decriminalise it. The article also contends that the African Commission must be the centre of research around this issue to benefit policy makers and other role players to make informed decisions on this highly contentious and emotive issue.</p>

         <title>Introduction</title>
         <disp-quote>
            <p>The plague of mankind is the fear and rejection of diversity: monotheism, monarchy, monogamy and, in our age, monomedicine. The belief that there is only one right way to live, only one right way to regulate religious, political, sexual, medical affairs is the root cause of the greatest threat to man: members of his own species, bent on ensuring his salvation, security, and sanity.</p>
            <attrib>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1358229112471477">Szasz, 1990</xref>: 47)</attrib>
         </disp-quote>
         <p>Africa is a competitive arena for violation of rights of gay and lesbian people. This group of individuals lives in perpetual fear of victimisation. They suffer prejudice, rape, torture, beatings, criminal prosecutions and executions. In most parts of Africa, the abuse of gay men and lesbians is official and institutionalised. In Africa, the space for sexual freedom remains constricted, with sexual minorities still being denied their fundamental rights throughout the continent. In 37 of 54 African countries, laws exist that criminalise homosexuality. Most of these laws date back to British colonial rule and have been retained by these countries since colonialism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1358229112471477">Fecteau, 2011</xref>). There are some African countries which, though they do not criminalise homosexuality, simply deny its existence in their midst altogether and call it a foreign phenomenon. South Africa must be singled out for commendation as the only African country that constitutionally guarantees the right to sexual orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1358229112471477">Constitution of South Africa, 1996</xref>: s 9(3)). Yet still there is no firm basis for exalting and glorifying South Africa in this area, since the country is still facing a horrifying phenomenon of homosexual oppression and violence. In particular, South Africa is faced with a pandemic of ‘corrective rape’. This is a form of sexual violation or rape used to brutalise lesbians by men, ostensibly as a means to ‘correct’ their deviant sexual orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1358229112471477">Arndt and de Bruin, 2006</xref>: 17).</p>
         <p>This vile practice not only threatens the security of lesbians but also strips them of their basic human rights. As shall be shown below, the persecution of sexual minorities is an affront to the precepts of international human rights law (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1358229112471477">Ako, 2010</xref>: 34). This article makes a critical inquiry into the protection of human rights of homosexual people in Africa. A survey is made of selected countries to demonstrate the state of human rights on the continent insofar as gay men and lesbians are concerned. Although the article speaks of Africa generally, it does not examine the law of each African country in this regard because the nature and form of the persecutions that gay men and lesbians endure throughout the continent is similar. Therefore, a country-by-country exploration will lead to unnecessary prolixity whereby similar facts about the persecutions of gays and lesbians are repeated throughout the article under every country being discussed. Since human rights violations against gays and lesbians in Africa are paternalistic throughout the continent, only a few countries will be discussed.</p>

         <title>Understanding sexual freedom</title>
         <p>Defining sexual freedom is as complicated and contentious as defining democracy. The natural starting point for commentators in the area is to look at the concept from the ‘ classical liberal – or perhaps neo-liberal – formulation that posits that any viable notion of sexual freedom must protect sex between two persons who are consenting adults committed in the privacy of the home and thus causing no harm to others’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1358229112471477">Ako, 2010</xref>: 34–36). This definition would appear to protect from legal liability such practices as bigamy, adultery and miscegenation. The neoliberal approach is fraught with insuperable definitional difficulties. For instance, the meaning of sex presents yet another difficulty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1358229112471477">Ako, 2010</xref>: 34–36). Do lesbian practices in which no penis or penis substitute is involved qualify to be termed sex per se? In addition, the requirement of ‘two’ overlooks concurrent multiple arrangements such as polygamy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1358229112471477">Ako, 2010</xref>: 34–36). Equally interesting are non-mutual sexual activities such as use of sex toys. These have been criminally forbidden in the United States except with medical prescriptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1358229112471477">Borgmann, 2006</xref>: 171).</p>
         <p>Despite its shortcomings, the neoliberal notion has been a valuable tool in the analysis of rights of lesbians and gay men seeking to contest the criminalisation of certain acts viewed by wider sections of society as inimical to its morals and values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1358229112471477">Robson, 2007</xref>: 408). This is far from being satisfactory, however. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1358229112471477">Robson (2007)</xref> further argues that this approach risks transforming the roles of gay men and lesbians into a model of sexual minority rather than as agents and drivers of sexual freedom.</p>

      <sec id="section3-1358229112471477">
         <title>The role of international law in the quest for sexual freedom for homosexuals in Africa</title>
         <p>As indicated above, several African countries have signed up to numerous international human rights law instruments such as the Universal Declaration on Human Rights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1358229112471477">UDHR, 1948</xref>), the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1358229112471477">ICCPR, 1966</xref>), the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1358229112471477">ICESCR, 1966</xref>) and the African Charter on Human and Peoples Rights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1358229112471477">African Charter, 1981</xref>). Thus, African states have incurred responsibilities under international law to give effect to their obligations under these instruments. In addition, as recently as 2011, the United Nations’ Human Rights Council, a committee based in Geneva, Switzerland, has approved a report denouncing ‘discrimination’ against homosexuals and ordering a global study of the phenomenon.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1358229112471477">1</xref>
            </sup> There is no doubt that these instruments offer protection to the rights of sexual minorities in the same manner that they protect the rights of everyone else. These rights accrue to sexual minorities on the simple basis that they are human beings and nothing more. A cardinal feature of all the international instruments is that the rights they guarantee shall be enjoyed by all individuals without discrimination or reference to any personal condition or qualification. For instance, the UDHR states that ‘[e]veryone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth <italic>or other status</italic>’ (art. 2(2)) [italics added]. Article 2(2) of the ICCPR and article 2(1) of the ICESCR also prohibit discrimination or reference to distinctions of any kind in the enjoyment of the rights guaranteed under those instruments. It is submitted that the phrase ‘or other status’ as employed in these instruments must be interpreted liberally to include sexual orientation in its purview. Accordingly, sexual orientation is a prohibited ground for discrimination under the UDHR, ICCPR and ICESCR. In addition, and for our purposes, these international instruments guarantee the rights to equality (ICCPR, preamble and art. 3; UDHR, Preamble, arts. 1 and 7; ICESCR, preamble and art. 3; African Charter, preamble, arts. 3 and 19), dignity (ICCPR, preamble and art. 10; UDHR, preamble, arts. 1 and 7; ICESCR, preamble and art. 13), privacy (UDHR, art. 12; ICCPR, art 17), liberty (UDHR, arts. 3 and 9) and bodily integrity (African Charter, art. 4), which it is submitted protect an individual’s right to sexual orientation when broadly and purposefully interpreted. These rights are also expressed in Constitutions of several African countries. In fact, as indicated above, the South African Constitution protects an individual’s right to sexual orientation in explicit terms. In terms of section 9(1) thereof, ‘[e]veryone is equal before the law and has the right to equal protection and benefit of the law.’ In terms of section 9(3):</p>
         <disp-quote>
            <p>The state may not unfairly discriminate directly or indirectly against anyone on one or more grounds, including race, gender, sex, pregnancy, marital status, ethnic or social origin, colour, <italic>sexual orientation</italic>, age, disability, religion, conscience, belief, culture, language and birth [emphasis added].</p>
         </disp-quote>
         <p>However, as pointed out above, despite the colourfulness and pioneering character of the above quoted provision, its theory does not match its reality. On the ground, despite constitutional protection, gay men and lesbians are still subjected to widespread persecution in South Africa. They are subjected to ostracism, assault, rape and other forms of inhuman and degrading treatment (Arndt and de Bruin, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1358229112471477">2006</xref>: 17). This painfully confirms Massoud’s view that laws do not always have the capacity to contain and control the social attitudes of the people they are intended to govern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1358229112471477">Massoud, 2003</xref>: 302). Duarte repeats this observation in the following lapidary words:</p>
         <disp-quote>
            <p>Not only are there legal injustices to be done away with, but mind-sets and cultures have to be done away with too. It is one thing for you to have your rights and equality in the law, it’s quite another to have them each day in the street, at work, in the bar, in public places.</p>
            <attrib>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1358229112471477">Duarte, 1994</xref>)</attrib>
         </disp-quote>
         <p>Indeed it is beyond contestation, as Duarte points out, that there is a need to do away with a culture that is not congenial to human rights notions in so far as homosexuality is concerned. However, this will prove to be extremely difficult. As the legal philosopher An-Na’im argues:</p>
         <disp-quote>
            <p>There is nothing that is culturally neutral. The way we think, the way we walk, the way we dress, the way we see the world, the way we see each other, the way we deal with the environment, whatever we do is culturally rooted. But we can’t even see it as culturally rooted because our culture is the eye by which we see the world and it is the heart by which we feel things or the mind by which we think. So it is integral to our very being … in that sense, universalist projects are very problematic.</p>
            <p>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1358229112471477">An-Na’im, 1990</xref>: 367)<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1358229112471477">2</xref>

            </p>
         </disp-quote>
         <p>The essence of the preceding passage is that that notions of human rights are not absolute, but are relative, and our ideas and conceptions on human rights are culturally rooted. In engaging in a human rights discourse within the context of culture, one ineluctably forays into the compass of other confusing and dialectic concepts of universality of human rights and cultural relativism. A discussion on these concepts will be beyond the scope of this paper. Suffice it to say, if ‘all human beings are equal, then the rights that they hold as a result of being human are the same regardless of the culture into which the individual happens to be born’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1358229112471477">Shestack, 2000</xref>: 46). The Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action endorses this position by confirming that:</p>
         <disp-quote>
            <p>while the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical, cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind, it is the duty of States, regardless of their political, economic and cultural systems, to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms.</p>
            <attrib>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1358229112471477">Vienna Declaration, 1993</xref>: para. 5)</attrib>
         </disp-quote>
         <p>The above doctrinal and theoretical debates on human rights notwithstanding, international tribunals, treaty bodies and other mechanisms have also played a crucial role in advancing the sexual minority human rights agenda. For instance, the Human Rights Committee’s Concluding Observations in relation to the United Republic of Tanzania are notable. It states:</p>
         <disp-quote>
            <p>The Committee reiterates its concern at the criminalisation of same-sex sexual relations of consenting adults, and regrets the lack of measures taken to prevent discrimination against them … The state party should decriminalise same-sex sexual relations of consenting adults and take all necessary actions to protect them from discrimination and harassment.</p>

         <p>In Botswana, homosexuality is legally prohibited through sodomy laws (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1358229112471477">Penal Code of Botswana, 1964</xref>: s. 64). In the case of <italic>Kanane v The State </italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1358229112471477">BLR, 2003</xref>[2]: 67) the Court of Appeal of Botswana has taken the view that these laws are constitutional on ground that Botswana is not yet ready to embrace homosexuality. During Botswana’s Universal Periodic Review session in 2010, the working group of the Human Rights Council expressed concerns about Botswana’s treatment of sexual minorities and observed in its recommendations that Botswana should ‘decriminalise homosexual relations and practices/consensual same-sex activities between adults; and outlaw discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1358229112471477">Botswana UPR Report, 2009</xref>: para. 23). However, Botswana has rejected this recommendation, arguing that:</p>
         <disp-quote>
            <p>the laws of Botswana do not allow same sex sexual activity. Section 15 of the Constitution of Botswana is comprehensive in effectively addressing all issues relating to discrimination. The Government has no plans to amend the Constitution in line with these recommendations.</p>

         <p>In November 2011, Nigeria caused a furore in the international community when its Senate passed the Bill for an Act to Prohibit Marriage or Civil Union entered into between Persons of Same Sex, Solemnization of Same and for other matters related therewith in November 2011. As its name suggests, the Bill was intended for the prohibition of same-sex erotic relations. Not only does the proposed Bill seek to criminalise same-sex marriage, but it will impose penalties against anyone who ‘witnesses, abets and aids the solemnization of a same gender marriage contract’ (s. 12). The upper legislative chamber, which passed the Bill, endorsed the views of Senator Domingo Obende (sponsor of the Bill) who stated at a deliberation on the Bill held on 26 September 2011 that:</p>
         <disp-quote>
            <p>We [Nigeria] as a country need to act very fast for this trend not to find its way into our country. Same sex marriage cannot be allowed on moral and religious grounds. The Muslim religion forbids it. Christianity forbids it and the African traditional religion forbids it. It should not be allowed because it will lead to a breakdown of the society.</p>

         <p>In Uganda, since 2009, politicians have been seeking to pass legislation that aims at further criminalising acts of homosexuality by introducing harsher penalties than they exist under the current law (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1358229112471477">Ugandan Anti-homosexuality Bill, 2009</xref>: Bill no. 18).<sup>
               <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1358229112471477">3</xref>
            </sup> The Bill prescribes life imprisonment for engaging in a homosexual activity (clause 2) and the death penalty for an offence it calls ‘aggravated homosexuality’ (clause 3[2]). The Bill goes further to provide for penalties for parents, teachers, doctors and any other person who suspects that someone under their care is homosexual and does not report them to the police (Clause 14). In Malawi, in 2010, a gay couple, Stephen Monjeza Soko and Tiwonge Chimbalanga, were arrested after holding an engagement ceremony.<sup>

            </sup> After their arrest, they were forcibly undressed to establish the nature of the sexual organs they had. They were also medically examined to check if they had engaged in anal sex. Clearly, these acts are degrading, demeaning, humiliating and in violation of their right to dignity. They were later convicted for buggery and indecent assault contrary to sections 153(c) and 156 of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1358229112471477">Malawi Penal Code Act (Cap 7:01)</xref>

In passing sentence on the couple after their conviction on 20 May 2010, the Chief Resident Magistrate Nyakwawa Usiwa-Usiwa remarked that ‘I will pass a <italic>scaring sentence</italic> so that the public [will] be protected from people like you, so that we are not tempted to emulate this horrendous example’ (<italic>Republic v Stephen Monjeza Soko &amp; Anor</italic>, 2009: 13; italics added). The pair was later separated and sent to prisons more than 40 miles apart to dash any hopes of maintaining contact on their part.</p>

In a dramatic and grotesque show of homophobia in that country, in 2009, a mob exhumed the body of a gay man from his grave, spat over it and dumped it at his aging parents’ home (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1358229112471477">Wavuti, 2010</xref>). Several other African countries still retain laws that criminalise acts of homosexuality.</p>

The Court further pointed out that it must be ‘guided by Zimbabwe’s conservatism in sexual matters’ in interpreting the country’s Constitution. In addition, it reasoned that sodomy laws of that country were valid because it was hard to prove that ‘the social norms and values of Zimbabwe are pushing [the Court] to decriminalize consensual sodomy’. In <italic>Chairperson of the Immigration Selection Board v. Frank and Another </italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1358229112471477">NR, 2001</xref>: 107), the Supreme Court of Namibia upheld the sodomy laws of that country.

            <p>The human misery that criminalisation causes can never be overestimated.

         <p>The criminalisation of someone’s sexual identity or orientation is a breach of his or her right to equality under international human rights law and defies all precepts of a democratic, free and open society that most nations of the world aspire to be. Ironically, many African countries that criminalise homosexuality have ratified several international human rights instruments. As indicated above, homosexuality is a question of human rights. Since human rights are a feature of democracy, sexual minority issues such as homosexuality are matters of democratic concern. They cannot be wished away.</p>
         <p>In the European system, the European Court has helped spur the agenda of gay men and lesbians through its decision in <italic>Jeff Dudgeon v the United Kingdom</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1358229112471477">Series A, No. 45, 1981</xref>: 123). In this case, Mr Dudgeon, a homosexual, approached the court complaining about the existence in Northern Ireland of laws which have the effect of making certain homosexual acts between consenting adult males criminal offences. The Court ruled in favour of the applicant, Mr Dudgeon, arguing that the existence of law that criminalises homosexuality in Northern Ireland was a violation of the applicant’s right to privacy. No case involving rights of sexual minorities has been litigated within the African human rights system yet.</p>
         <p>Since the concept of sexual freedom is predicated on notions of human rights, it is apposite at this juncture to consider a few of such rights which are violated by the persecutions of sexual minorities, albeit briefly. In surveying some of the implicated rights, the author does not endeavour to make an exhaustive catalogue of all implicated rights. In addition, as will appear from the discussion that follows, there is a huge overlapping and interfacing of the numerous rights at issue.</p>

            <title>The right to equality</title>
            <p>The concept of equality is a deeply controversial socio-legal idea. In the basic and classic sense, the idea of equality means that people who are similarly circumstanced in relevant ways should be treated in a similar manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1358229112471477">Llayayambwa, 2012</xref>: 51). Inversely, embodied in the construct of equality is a correlative idea that people who are not similarly circumstanced cannot and should not be treated alike. In <italic>Vriend v Alberta</italic> (DLR, 1998: 156) Cory and Lacobucci JJ expressed themselves thus:</p>
            <disp-quote>
               <p>It is easy to say that everyone who is just like ‘us’ is entitled to equality. Everyone finds it more difficult to say that those who are ‘different’ from us in some way should have the same equality rights that we enjoy. Yet so soon as we say any group is less deserving and unworthy of equal protection and benefit of the law all minorities and all of society are demeaned. It is so deceptively simple and so devastatingly injurious to say that those who are handicapped or of a different race, or religion, or colour or sexual orientation are less worthy (Lamer CJC, Gonthier, McLachlin and Bastarache JJ concurring; L’Heureux-Dubé and Major JJ partly concurring and partly dissenting).</p>

            <p>The South African Constitutional Court, per the legendary Sachs J, has eloquently stated within the context of homosexuality in <italic>Minister of Home Affairs &amp; Anor v Fourie &amp; Othrs </italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1358229112471477">SA, 2006</xref>) that:</p>
            <disp-quote>
               <p>Equality means equal concern and respect across difference. It does not presuppose the elimination or suppression of difference. Respect for human rights requires the affirmation of self, not the denial of self. Equality therefore does not imply a levelling or homogenisation of behaviour or extolling one form as supreme, and another as inferior, but an acknowledgement and acceptance of difference. At the very least, it affirms that difference should not be the basis for exclusion, marginalisation and stigma. At best, it celebrates the vitality that difference brings to any society.</p>
               <attrib>(para. 38)</attrib>
            </disp-quote>
            <p>The right to equality has two variations. The first is that all persons are entitled to equal treatment before the law. This requires that all persons be treated equally in respect without any differentiation, as such a differentiation will be a violation of the law (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1358229112471477">Sepulveda et al., 2004</xref>: 307). The second aspect of the equality principle is to the effect that everyone has the right to equal protection of the law. This means that laws shall be applied equally to all persons without regard, for example, to their sexual orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1358229112471477">Sepulveda et al., 2004</xref>: 307). The question of equality or equal protection of the law for gay men and lesbians remains unresolved and highly contentious. Despite the organised and vigorous efforts by lesbian and gay communities, civil society and commentators, and, in recent years, the broadening of public support for protecting sexual minorities in formal civil rights arrangements, the legal status of gay men and lesbians remain largely unequal and unprotected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1358229112471477">Hutchinson, 2000</xref>: 1358).</p>
            <p>However, the South African equality jurisprudence has made giant strides in relation to the rights of gay men and lesbians in the last decade. In <italic>National Coalition for Gay and Lesbian Equality and Anor v Minister of Justice and Othrs </italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1358229112471477">ZACC, 1999</xref>) (popularly known as the <italic>Sodomy</italic> case) the Constitutional Court of that country had to deal with the question of whether or not the criminalisation of sodomy was unconstitutional and invalid. In delivering the judgment of the Court, O’Regan J reasoned that, in her view, a broader definition must be annexed to the concept of equality. She held that laws that are aimed at prohibiting sexual intimacy between gay men violate their right to equality in that they unfairly discriminate against them on the basis of sexual orientation (para. 37). The Court felicitously opined that ‘[t]o penalise people for being who and what they are is profoundly disrespectful of the human personality and violatory of equality’ (para. 129). It remarked further that ‘[t]he development of an active rather than a purely formal sense of enjoying a common citizenship depends on recognising and accepting people with all their differences, as they are’ (para. 130), noting that ‘[t]he experience of subordination – of personal subordination, above all – lies behind the vision of equality’ (para. 130). Accordingly the government must honour at the level of politics the existential claim that people are different. Their separateness and disparateness should not cause discord but should entail their rich diversity and tapestry of values, which in turn entails their right to establish and pursue their own concept of self-worth or dignified personhood, independent of the concept of value pursued or favoured by others. Dworkin ably casts this argument when he asks:</p>
            <disp-quote>
               <p>What does it mean for the government to treat its citizens as equals? That is the same question as the question of what it means for the government to treat all its citizens as free, or as independent, or with equal dignity. … [To accord with this demand, a government must] be neutral on what might be called the question of the good life. … [P]olitical decisions must be, so far as is possible, independent of any particular conception of the good life, or of what gives value to life. Since the citizens of a society differ in their conceptions, the government does not treat them as equals if it prefers one conception to another, either because the officials believe that one is intrinsically superior, or because one is held by the more numerous or more powerful group.</p>

            </disp-quote>
            <p>To this end, it is beyond argument that the persecution of gay men and lesbians frustrates their right to equality, which is a crucial personal right indispensable to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men in a democratic society.</p>

            <title>The right to liberty</title>
            <p>In the case of <italic>Sarah</italic> 
               <italic>Diau v Botswana Building Society</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1358229112471477">BLR, 2003</xref>[2]: 334), the Industrial Court of Botswana, per Dingake J, expressed the opinion that the right to liberty goes beyond the notion of mere freedom from physical constraints and protects within its scope a narrow sphere of personal autonomy wherein individuals may make inherently private choices free from irrational and unjustified interference by others or the state. The above line of reasoning was also adopted in the Canadian case of <italic>Godbout v Longueuil </italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1358229112471477">SCR, 1997</xref>: 884). On the strength of these authorities, it stands to reason that it is within the competence of every adult of full legal capacity exercising his or her right to liberty to enter into a sexual relationship of whatever form or nature, whether homosexual or heterosexual, without being punished as a criminal or ostracised as social outcast. In particular, the point must be made that the state has no business with the sexual escapades of consenting adults in the privacy of their bedrooms and other private places. What goes on behind closed doors between a gay or lesbian couple is distinctly and infinitely personal in character. The state cannot and should not control the destiny of a homosexual couple by making private sexual conduct a crime. Their right to liberty gives them the full right to engage in their conduct without intervention of the government. In <italic>Lawrence v Texas</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1358229112471477">US, 2003</xref>: 539) Justice Kennedy struck down legislation that criminalised homosexuality partly on the basis that it offended against the liberty of private individuals. In majestic prose, the judge stated that:</p>
            <disp-quote>
               <p>Liberty protects the person from unwarranted government intrusions into a dwelling or other private places. In our tradition the State is not omnipresent in the home. And there are other spheres of our lives and existence, outside the home, where the State should not be a dominant presence. Freedom extends beyond spatial bounds. Liberty presumes an autonomy of self that includes freedom of thought, belief, expression, and certain <italic>intimate conduct</italic>. The instant case involves liberty of the person both in its spatial and more transcendent dimensions.</p>

            <p>Clearly, in barring the state from employing a bedroom police that spies through keyholes at the private consensual acts of adults, <italic>Lawrence </italic>secures for Americans, homosexual and heterosexual alike, a secure environment to express their sexual orientations without fear for prosecution. Practices of state-sanctioned invasion of gay citizens’ bedrooms were also common in the West before homosexuality was decriminalised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1358229112471477">Chauncey, 1994</xref>: 219). In sum, the assertion that the victimisation, harassment and prosecution of homosexuals denude them of their fundamental right to liberty admits of no demur. Related in formulation to the right to liberty is the notion of bodily integrity.</p>

In this context, this right posits that the body of an individual is sacrosanct and must not be interfered with. Rather than protecting the liberal notion of an intact civil relationship, in a public place, the right to bodily integrity is intended to protect the broader notion of personhood. The essence of this right is captured in the following quote:</p>

It is submitted that the subjection of gays and lesbians to such tests is demeaning and violatory of their right to bodily integrity. Connected to this right is the right to privacy.</p>

The right to privacy has been a subject of litigation in several jurisdictions. In <italic>Griswold v Connecticut</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1358229112471477">US, 1965</xref>: 381) the US Supreme Court described the right to privacy as the ‘the right to be let alone’. In terms of the common law, violation of the right to privacy may assume two forms: an unlawful intrusion on the personal privacy of another or the unlawful publication of private facts about a person. We are here concerned with the former type of invasion. In determining whether there has been a violation of the right to privacy, a two-stage inquiry must be undertaken: first, we must address the question whether the conduct complained of amounts to an infringement. Second, if the answer to (a) is in the affirmative, whether the infringement is reasonably justifiable in a democratic society. This test was adopted by Dingake J in the case of <italic>Diau</italic>, above. Several decisions of the US Supreme Court such as <italic>Lawrence v Texas</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1358229112471477">US, 2003</xref>: 558)<sup>

In the <italic>Lawrence</italic> case (2003), the court observed that intimate relationships belong to the ‘realm of personal liberty which the government may not enter.’ As indicated above, it is impermissible for governments to regulate or legislate on matters of sex between two consenting adults. In the <italic>National Coalition for Gay and Lesbian Equality </italic>case (1998, above), the court argued that the criminalisation of private conduct between consenting adults which causes no harm to anyone else is impermissible. It reasoned that this intrusion on the ‘innermost sphere of human life violates the constitutional right to privacy’. Interweaving the gay rights to equality, dignity and freedom, the court opined that:</p>
            <disp-quote>
               <p>The criminalisation of sodomy in private between consenting males is a severe limitation of a gay man’s right to equality in relation to sexual orientation, because it hits at one of the ways in which gays give expression to their sexual orientation. It is at the same time a severe limitation of the gay man’s rights to privacy, dignity and freedom. The harm caused by the provision can, and often does, affect his ability to achieve self-identification and self-fulfilment. The harm also radiates out into society generally and gives rise to a wide variety of other discriminations, which collectively unfairly prevent a fair distribution of social goods and services and the award of social opportunities for gays.</p>

In <italic>Bernstein and Others v Bester and Others NNO </italic>above, Ackermann J argued that the scope of the right to privacy is intimately connected to the concept of identity and that ‘rights, like the right to privacy, are not based on a notion of the unencumbered self, but on the notion of what is necessary to have one’s autonomous identity. In the context of privacy this means that it is the inner sanctum of the person such as his/her family life, sexual preference and home environment which is shielded from erosion by conflicting rights of the community’ (at paras 65–67).<sup>

               <p>We do not find an explicit definition of the expression ‘dignity of the human person’ in international instruments or (as far as I know) in national law.

            <p>Despite the above observation, the English philosopher Thomas Hobbes has made a valiant attempt at defining this concept. In his celebrated treatise, <italic>Leviathan</italic>, he remarks that ‘human dignity is the public worth of a man [or woman] which is the value set on him [or her] by the Commonwealth’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1358229112471477">Hobbes, 1999</xref>: 104).</p>
            <p>Whereas it should be readily conceded that defining dignity is no minor task, one fact must be accepted, however: that its protection under various municipal laws and international instruments ‘requires us to acknowledge the value and worth of all individuals as members of society’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1358229112471477">
                  <italic>National Coalition for Gay &amp; Lesbian Equality</italic>, 1999</xref>: para. 29). The genesis of the concept of human dignity can be traced to Kantian moral philosophy, in which human dignity is considered to be what gives a person their intrinsic worth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1358229112471477">Curie and de Waal, 2005</xref>: 272). In a ground-breaking South African decision of <italic>S v Makwanyane</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1358229112471477">SA, 1994</xref>[3]: 391), the Constitutional Court of that country, per O’Reagan J, relevantly remarked that ‘recognising the right to dignity is an acknowledgement of the intrinsic worth of human beings … [T]his right therefore, is the foundation of [all] other rights’ (para. 328). Human dignity is basic and irreducible. At its bare minimum, it is the bedrock upon which all other fundamental rights such as the rights to liberty, privacy, bodily integrity privacy and a plethora of other rights are embedded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1358229112471477">Curie and de Waal, 2005</xref>: 272). Callous acts of abuse, victimisation and persecution of gays and lesbian undermine their dignity. Describing the assault that the persecution of gays and lesbians occasions to their dignity, Cameron J stated in <italic>Minister of Home Affairs and Anor v Fourie &amp; Othrs </italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1358229112471477">BCLR, 2006</xref>[3]: 524) that: ‘The sting of … continuing discrimination against both gays and lesbians’ lies in the message it conveys, namely that, viewed as individuals or in their same-sex relationships, they ‘do not have the inherent dignity and are not worthy of the human respect possessed by and accorded to heterosexuals and their relationships’. This denies to gays and lesbians that which is foundational to our Constitution and the concepts of equality and dignity namely that ‘all persons have the same inherent worth and dignity’, whatever their other differences may be (para. 17).</p>
            <p>Within the context and setting of sexual minority rights, Nussbaum argues that homosexuals are human beings too and have an inherent dignity that deserves respect from laws and social institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1358229112471477">Nussbaum, 1999</xref>: 13). In the light of the foregoing, there can be no doubt that prejudicial practices against homosexuals will despoil them of their dignity – it being appreciated that the right to dignity is the matrix of all rights (including those set out above).</p>
            <p>In summation, it is a travesty of notions of human rights to seek to fit gay men and lesbians into the mainstream sexual orientation of heterosexuality simply because their conception of a sexual relationship is not congenial to the taste and preference of the majority. One may assume that those who oppose homosexuality do so in the firm belief that it is unnatural and immoral or abominable. This is understandable to the extent that many people’s religious faiths teach that homosexuality is wrong. However, whereas sympathy can be extended to this assertion, it can never be correct to allow the majority to prescribe to the minority what is correct and acceptable to the latter simply because the former enjoys numerical advantage or strength over the latter.

               <p>The very purpose of a bill of rights was to withdraw certain subjects from the vicissitudes of political controversy, to place them beyond the reach of majorities … and to establish them as legal principles to be applied by the courts. One’s right to life … and other fundamental rights may not be submitted to vote; they depend on the outcome of no elections.</p>
            </disp-quote>
            <p>So clearly, whilst public opinion is important in setting the parameters of a public discourse on issues surrounding homosexuality, it must not be permitted to override what are clearly legal principles in the analysis of rights of sexual minorities. Accordingly, courts of law must be vigilant at all times to ensure that they do not reduce themselves to courts of public opinion by throwing away legal principles and pandering to the whims and caprices of the majority.</p>
            <p>Finally, whereas litigation plays a crucial and defining role in directing of the discourse of human rights of sexual minorities, it is submitted that greater focus must be placed on the process of ‘integrative and constructive dialogue’ with governments than litigation in courts. Such a manner of engagement allows for a far more extensive participation of non-governmental organisations than court processes and thus has a stronger claim to greater legitimacy. It is when people engage one another openly on the rights of sexual minorities that these rights can be brought down from the realm of legal sophistry to the day-to-day life of people as they live it in the bars, villages and streets. In addition, outcomes of political consultative processes and dialogue have greater acceptability to the people than judgments of courts. As the Roman Catholic theologian John Courtney Murray profoundly remarked, ‘civility dies with the death of dialogue’ (quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1358229112471477">Nussbaum, 1999</xref>: 185).</p>

         <title>Impediments to change</title>
         <p>The major impediment to securing human rights of sexual minorities in Africa is lack of political will on the part of African leaders – perhaps stemming from the fact that they are homophobic. Following the remarks by the United Nations Secretary-General to the African Union Summit held at Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, in January 2012 calling African leaders to end social and legal discrimination against homosexuals in Africa, several African leaders openly denounced him on this score. In spurning the UN’s leader’s call for the protection of rights of gay men and lesbians, Libya’s envoy to the UN, Ibrahim Dabbashi, countered that issues concerning homosexuality ‘affect religion and the continuation and reproduction of the human race’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1358229112471477">Burke, 2012</xref>). Dabbashi also criticised the UN pro-homosexual resolution, passed in June 2011, saying Libya would have opposed it had it not, at the time, been suspended from the Council (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1358229112471477">Burke, 2012</xref>). The Ghanaian president, John Atta Mills, also made it clear that Ghana does not share the same view as the UN Secretary-General. He is reported to have stated that:</p>
         <disp-quote>
            <p>We have made our position well known. Ghanaian society frowns upon homosexuality and everybody has been telling us that democracy means governance for the people, by the people in the interest of the people.</p>

            <p>I find it outrageous and repugnant to my human conscience that such immoral and repulsive organizations like those of homosexuals, who offend both the agents of the law of nature and the morals and religious beliefs espoused by our society, should have any advocates in our midst or even elsewhere in the world.</p>

         <p>It is also regrettable that even African Heads of State and Government who are seen to be progressive, liberal and democratic, such as Presidents Mills of Ghana and Johnson-Sirleaf of Liberia, support laws that criminalise homosexuality. A closer look at the attitudes of African leaders towards homosexuality reveals the fact that they think of it as antithetical to their religion and traditional morality. They embrace the discourse of normality, in particular heteronormativity relative to sexuality, simply because the majority of their people practice and prefer it. Addressing this issue in the Zimbabwean case of <italic>Banana v The State</italic> (above), Gubbay CJ (as he then was) had the following to say in his minority judgment:</p>
         <disp-quote>
            <p>It may well be that the majority of the people, who have normal heterosexual relationships, find acts of sodomy morally unacceptable. This does not mean, however, that today in our pluralistic society that moral values alone can justify making an activity criminal. If it could one immediately has to ask: ‘By whose moral values is the state guided?’</p>
            <attrib>(p. 623)</attrib>
         </disp-quote>
         <p>He continued to admirably state that he was not ‘persuaded that in a democratic society such as ours it is reasonably justifiable to make an activity criminal because a segment, maybe a majority, of the citizenry consider it to be unacceptable’ or deviant. In the <italic>National Coalition for Gay &amp; Lesbian Equality</italic> case (above), Sachs J stated that:</p>
         <disp-quote>
            <p>The concept of sexual deviance needs to be reviewed. A heterosexual norm was established, gays were labelled deviant from the norm and difference was located in them. What the Constitution requires is that the law and public institutions acknowledge the variability of human beings and affirm the equal respect and concern that should be shown to all as they are. At the very least, what is statistically normal ceases to be the basis for establishing what is legally normative. More broadly speaking, the scope of what is constitutionally normal is expanded to include the widest range of perspectives and to acknowledge, accommodate and accept the largest spread of difference. What becomes normal in an open society, then, is not an imposed and standardised form of behaviour that refuses to acknowledge difference, but the acceptance of the principle of difference itself, which accepts the variability of human behaviour.</p>

         <p>When we demonise African leaders for fuelling anti-homosexuality myths, stereotypes and prejudices, we must acknowledge and appreciate efforts by the Malawian President Joyce Banda, who has vowed to lift the country's ban on homosexuality, breaking ranks with much of Africa, where such activity remains a crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1358229112471477">Smith, 2012</xref>). Symbolically, President Banda’s gesture is very important for Africa and hopefully many more countries on the continent will follow Malawi’s example.</p>
         <p>Perhaps the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights<sup>
               <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1358229112471477">11</xref>
            </sup> (the African Commission) is the weakest link in the protection of rights of gays and lesbians and sexual minorities in general within the African system. The African Commission is not committed to protecting rights of sexual minorities on the continent. Apart from the fact that the Commission has no programmatic arrangement to advance the agenda of the human rights of sexual minorities, it has moved further to frustrate efforts of interest groups that are desirous of promoting rights of sexual minorities. On 25 November 2010 the African Commission took a decision to refuse to grant observer status to the Coalition for African Lesbians (CAL), a non-governmental organisation that promotes the rights of sexual minorities in Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1358229112471477">Tlhwale, 2010</xref>). CAL was not granted observer status because, in the opinion of the Commission, its activities did not promote and protect any of the rights enshrined in the African Charter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1358229112471477">28th Activity Report of the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights, 2009</xref>: item 33). The position of the Commission defeats logic because it is common knowledge that the human rights of sexual minorities are systematically violated throughout the continent. This situation calls for activism and lobbying on the part of the civil society for the protection of these people, and it is this purpose that CAL wanted to serve. In a blistering yet understandable response to the Commission’s refusal to grant CAL observer status, two African sexual minority activists, Sokari Ekine and Mia Nikamiso, retorted as follows:</p>
         <disp-quote>
            <p>We are angry at the grotesque indifference exercised by these charlatans whose misogyny, xenophobia, homophobia, lesbophobia, transphobia due to heteronormativity whether the origin, is being unleashed against us [sic]. Acting with hysterical fear in the face of a simple request by CAL to hold observer status, the ACPHR, as it represents and discusses issues of importance to all African citizens, is the mark of irresponsibility and shameful viciousness. And of course it is in violation of the treaties and international agreements to which it and its member countries are signatories.</p>

         </disp-quote>
         <p>Through the gesture of refusing to grant a sexual minority organisation observer status, the African Commission is saying that rights of sexual minorities do not matter; that they count for nothing. This is regrettable, coming as it does from an institution charged with the noble role of ensuring that states parties to the African Charter respect the rights guaranteed under the Charter.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1358229112471477">12</xref>
            </sup> Negative attitudes towards homosexuality, including its criminalisation, are hardly surprising, though. Rational analysis and argumentation on this issue will not resolve all controversy attending to it because the resistance to homosexuality ‘has deep psychological roots, principally because those opposed to it fear the erosion of traditional distinctions and boundaries.’ These make the current debate on the issue ‘ugly and irrational’ (Nussbaum, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1358229112471477">1999</xref>: 185). Discussing arguments on women’s equality, the philosopher John Stuart Mill argued that the lucidity and rationality of argument frequently serves only to increase or intensify its oppositional force. He remarked that:</p>
         <disp-quote>
            <p>So long as opinion is strongly rooted in the feelings, it gains rather than loses in stability by having a preponderating weight of argument against it … [T]he worse it fares in argumentative contest, the more persuaded its adherents are that their feeling must have some deeper ground, which the arguments do not reach; and while the feeling remains, it is throwing up fresh entrenchments of argument to repair any breach made in the old.</p>
            <attrib>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1358229112471477">Nussbaum, 1999</xref>: 185)</attrib>
         </disp-quote>
         <p>Notwithstanding the above, reason is still relevant to the resolution of public controversies in relation to homosexuality. The trajectory of history in such debates shows that, in the end, reason always triumphs over the irrational. For instance, in the fourteenth century, there would have been no debate about the assertion that women are inferior in status to men. Time has moved on. Today it is heresy at law to talk of men being superior to women. Similarly, it may sound like heresy today to talk of the need to protect the human rights of homosexuals, but tomorrow they will claim their rights to full personhood as homosexuals and will be free at last.</p>

         <title>Conclusion</title>
         <p>Human rights have set deepening roots in the polity and body politic of Africa and the world. They are here to stay. They are an integral feature of democracy – a political philosophy that embraces all people, rich or poor, gay or straight, in its tapestry of diversity. The time has come when the question of fully equal rights of homosexuals can no longer be avoided (Nussbaum, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1358229112471477">1999</xref>: 185). The fact of an active rather than purely formalistic enjoyment of common citizenship depends on accepting people as they are, no matter how different they could be (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1358229112471477">De Vois, 2007</xref>: 448). Democracy affirms the right of people to self-expression without being forced to subordinate themselves to the cultural and religious norms of others, and highlights the importance of individuals and communities being able to enjoy what has been called the right to be different. Homosexuals, as a different group of people, must be respected and afforded protection from the impact of discrimination which severely impugns their dignity, personhood and identity at many levels. Same-sex partners must be granted the liberty to found their relationships in a manner that accords with their sexual orientation, including engaging in same-sex marriages, if they choose to do so, without any hindrances from criminal statutes.</p>
         <p>Unfortunately, as can be gleaned from this study, gay men and lesbians are far from enjoying their legal rights in Africa. Consequently, as was suggested in<italic> J and Anor v Director General, Department of Home Affairs, and Othrs</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1358229112471477">SA, 2003</xref>[5]: 621), comprehensive and human rights sensitive legislation regularising relationships between gay and lesbian persons is necessary in African countries. African countries which criminalise homosexuality must decriminalise it and give back homosexual persons their humanity. However, decriminalisation of the practice alone will not suffice, since the anti-homosexuality proclivities are still heavily embedded in the psyche of many Africans as core social beliefs. To dislodge the stereotypes, prejudices, hatred and all homophobic tendencies from the minds of their people, African countries must engage in a decisive and broad-based process of expansive sensitisation of its people to the idea that gays and lesbians are human beings as well and equally deserving of dignity and respect to their personhood. As Fanon explains:</p>
         <disp-quote>
            <p>Sometimes people hold a core belief that is very strong. When they are presented with evidence that works against that belief, the new evidence cannot be accepted. It would create a feeling that is extremely uncomfortable, called cognitive dissonance. And because it is so important to protect the core belief, they will rationalize it, ignore and even deny anything that does not fit in with the core belief.</p>
            <attrib>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1358229112471477">Fanon, 2004</xref>: 230)</attrib>
         </disp-quote>
         <p>It is this cognitive dissonance regarding homosexuality that we must fight to dislodge the prejudices and homophobic tendencies and structures that have despoiled homosexual persons of their dignity and self-worth for too long. At a continental level, the African Commission must coordinate and streamline efforts geared towards the protection and promotion of rights of homosexual people in Africa. In particular it must spearhead research around the issue, in line with article 45 of the African Charter,<sup>
               <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1358229112471477">13</xref>
            </sup> so that policy makers and other role players could make interventions or can act on the basis of extant and credible information. In order to succeed in this endeavour, the African Commission must collaborate with (and not shun) relevant interest groups such as CAL.</p>
