<p>Martel’s <italic>Textual Conspiracies</italic> reads like a guide book for a strategy of the Left in the face of a seemingly “endless future of capitalism.” (xi) His advice: “We must conspire against our own tendency toward idolatry, engaging in what I will call a ‘textual conspiracy’ with the very material objects and symbols of the world that we otherwise treat as fetishes.” (xii) Given the explicitly political concern Martel puts forward the targeted audience of his book is circumscribed quite clearly: those who consider themselves to belong to the Left and who feel discouraged by the fact that capitalism never seems to be less questioned than nowadays. Given that leftist thinking historically is indebted to materialism, it is surprising that Martel engages in a ‘‘textual conspiracy’’ with hardly any reference to the traditional canon of the Left. His key co-conspirator is Walter Benjamin whom he reads in constellation with Franz Kafka, Niccolò Machiavelli, Alexis de Tocqueville, Edgar Allan Poe, Hannah Arendt, Federico García Lorca, Franz Fanon and Assia Djebar. It is this at first sight anarchic method that Martel deploys and its unconventional reading of authors not usually associated with “the Left” which makes the book an interesting and illuminating read.</p>
<p>Martel takes on the important task of loosening the grip cultural and literary studies have had on Benjamin’s <italic>oeuvre</italic> in that he understands Benjamin as a political thinker whose work also offers a specific method for our own work. In this regard, Martel’s venture to not only work <italic>on</italic> but <italic>with</italic> Benjamin, that is to employ Benjamin’s concept of “constellation” to produce his “textual conspiracy” is an important contribution which transcends the authors discussed in the book. Martel’s book manifests not only the virtue of this method “to remove objects and symbols [and authors for that matter, H.F.] from their phantasmagoric context, to allow us to reread and reconsider them with a new perspective” but it also, involuntarily, reproduces the contradictions that come with the concept. This ambivalence is most visible when it comes to the question of intentionality of our political acting, which is of particular concern to Martel.</p>
<p>He reads Benjamin “in constellation” with Kafka and Machiavelli in order to produce insights about a way to conspire against our idolatry and hence our own complicity with capitalism. From Benjamin’s position, Martel holds, “the agency that we take as our own, and the intentions that we hold to so intimately are in fact a product of the phantasmagoria.” (9) According to Martel, in order to resist this tendency, we have to “conspire with language” (187) by adopting a politics of misrecognition which “seeks only to combat delusion when it is idolatrous in nature.” (247) Challenging what Martel calls a conventional perception of politics, he seeks to decenter the intentional political subject in order to be able to think a Left project as “hope-but not for us.” (xi)</p>
<p>In the face of the importance Martel attributes to the problem of intentionality, it is surprising that he omits the question of intentionality when it comes to Benjamin’s concept of “constellations” as a method, and hence his choice of authors. Even though he alludes to the arbitrary moment in the concept of constellation when he states that “we can only rejuxtapose objects and moments at random,” (10) Martel in fact qualifies this statement when he provides justifications for the selection and combination of political and literary figures. However, the initial intrigue why Martel chooses to discuss these authors (or texts) and not others persists, as well as the impression that at times the link between his reading of the authors and the overall concern of the book gets lost. My suspicion is that this is because Benjamin’s concept of constellation itself remains ambivalent on the question of how a constellation is produced: does it present itself to or is it (intentionally) produced by the one who perceives/makes it? This ambivalence permeates Martel’s language throughout the book. While he starts speaking as an author who intentionally “forms,” “produces” (10) or “makes” (12) a constellation, in the course of the book the authors or texts present “evidence” or “show us” certain insights. Then again “it almost doesn’t matter” (134) what the author (in this case Poe) intends to say for what we make out of it.</p>
<p>One can read this ambivalence as a problem of consistency or logic that needs further exploration of the question of what enables us to perceive authors, objects or historical moments in constellation. Or we can look at it as a conflict between the process of thinking and the presentation of our argument. This is a conflict which is produced by the academic requirement to present our work as the fruit of a rational and methodologically guided process when in fact it often is inspired by random associations, casual discoveries and political preferences. If we understand a method as something that helps us to make our own thinking traceable and available for others, maybe it is necessary to break with the linear form of the text in order to fully explore the potential of constellation as a method that “removes objects from their phantasmagoric contexts.”</p>
