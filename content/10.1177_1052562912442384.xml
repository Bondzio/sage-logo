<abstract>
<p>This article addresses educators’ concerns about using asynchronous online discussions in lieu of face-to-face discussions. Drawing from research on asynchronous online education and Bloom’s taxonomy, the authors introduce the system of “original examples” and “value-added comments” that they have developed to promote engaging and meaningful discussions in which students learn course material from one another. The authors describe how to integrate this system into an online course and provide guidelines for instructor facilitation. They offer evidence that online asynchronous discussions facilitate students’ learning and may be more inclusive than face-to-face discussions for some students. Finally, the authors share their observations and suggestions for implementation.</p>

<title>Discussions in the Online Classroom</title>
<p>According to a nationwide survey of the chief academic officers of institutions of higher education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1052562912442384">Allen &amp; Seaman, 2010</xref>), online enrollments grew 17% from 2007 to 2008, with more than one quarter of postsecondary students in the United States taking at least one course on line.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1052562912442384">1</xref></sup> Furthermore, about 60% of the respondents indicated that their long-term strategy includes online education. Yet less than one third of them reported “that their faculty accept the value and legitimacy of online education” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1052562912442384">Allen &amp; Seaman, 2010</xref>, p. 3; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1052562912442384">Aggarwal, Adlakha, &amp; Mersha, 2006</xref>). One factor contributing to faculty members’ qualms about online education is their assumption that the lack of face-to-face interaction in an asynchronous classroom would preclude students’ active engagement with course material. Such concerns are not unfounded, given that some faculty who deliver courses online still define their role as transferring knowledge through lectures, rather than involving students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1052562912442384">Zemsky &amp; Massy, 2004</xref>). Likewise, students, especially those taking their first online course, may fail to appreciate their need to exercise self-discipline and to play a major role in their own learning. These misconceptions of both instructors and students may contribute to lower retention rates for online versus traditional courses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1052562912442384">Heyman, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1052562912442384">Kember, 1996</xref>). When online students operate in the passive mode, they may not connect to their course materials, classmates, and instructors; eventually, they may withdraw from the class (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1052562912442384">Bernard et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1052562912442384">Bates (1997)</xref> has argued, however, that asynchronous distance learning provides the opportunity to create a learner-centered environment that fosters rich communication between instructor and students and among students. An online asynchronous discussion board, through which “computer and Internet technologies enable communication via the generation of discussion messages amongst participants” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1052562912442384">Han &amp; Hill, 2006</xref>, p. 30), can engender more and more meaningful participation and interaction than we find in many traditional face-to-face classrooms.</p>
<p>This article describes how we use the discussion board to promote students’ engagement with course concepts and with one another. We introduce our system of “original examples” and “value-added comments,” explain how an instructor can integrate this system into an online course, and explore the instructor’s role in the discussion. We also consider evidence that this system promotes students’ learning of course concepts. Although we focus here on the use of our system in fully online classes, we introduced this system—and continue to incorporate it—in our traditional face-to-face classes and would also recommend it for hybrid classes. Using original examples and value-added comments can enhance discussion-based learning opportunities, as we now explain.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1052562912442384">Berger (1999)</xref> has reported that “electronic communication free[s students] to be more revealing and to participate more than in the typical classroom setting” (p. 689). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1052562912442384">Rainsbury and Malcolm (2003)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1052562912442384">Berry (2005)</xref>, likewise, have found that students’ online discussions are better than face-to-face discussions for fostering ideas, interaction, and in-depth consideration of others’ viewpoints. Most of the students <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1052562912442384">Shea, Swan, Fredericksen, and Pickett (2001)</xref> sampled indicated that they put more thought into online posts than into classroom comments. Online students have time to reflect on what they want to convey before they post their ideas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1052562912442384">Al-Shalchi, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1052562912442384">Berry, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1052562912442384">Rollag, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1052562912442384">Vonderwell, Liang, &amp; Alderman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1052562912442384">Young, 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1052562912442384">Schallert et al. (2009)</xref> have suggested that freedom from the pressure to respond instantaneously allows students to craft more civil responses, so that the tone of asynchronous discussions is more polite than that of synchronous discussions.</p>
<p>Another advantage of asynchronous discussions is that they elicit comments from students who tend not to participate in the traditional classroom. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1052562912442384">Arbaugh (2000)</xref>, finding that women students contribute more comments online than in a classroom, has concluded that online communication eliminates quieter students’ need to vie with their more outspoken classmates for airtime. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1052562912442384">Neidorf (2006)</xref> has concurred that an online discussion “[b]enefits students who tend to hang back in face-to-face discussions, preferring to think through their responses before jumping in/ . . . [and those] who tend to learn through reading rather than through listening” (pp. 26-27). These reflective learners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1052562912442384">Felder &amp; Silverman, 1988</xref>) are more comfortable giving their ideas after they have had an opportunity to consider the material.</p>
<p>International students, who may have more confidence in their ability to read and write English than in their ability to speak it, may also be more likely to contribute to online discussions than to face-to-face ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1052562912442384">Rainsbury &amp; Malcolm, 2003</xref>). Online discussions increase their opportunities to exchange ideas with and learn from their native-English-speaking classmates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1052562912442384">Al-Jarf, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1052562912442384">Belz &amp; Kinginger, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1052562912442384">Gonzalez-Bueno, 1998</xref>). Thus, students who ordinarily would not participate in a classroom discussion “are able to give themselves a voice” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1052562912442384">Al-Shalchi, 2009</xref>, p. 105; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1052562912442384">Young, 2008</xref>) in online discussions.</p>
<p>The diversity of perspectives in an online discussion encourages more nuanced and productive consideration of the material (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1052562912442384">Dahlin, Weingart, &amp; Hinds, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1052562912442384">Shaw, 1983</xref>), thereby further promoting learning for all class members. Using a discussion board in an asynchronous online course builds a community of learners, which reduces the social isolation students might otherwise experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1052562912442384">Brower, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1052562912442384">“Has the Quality,” 2010</xref>). Students’ active engagement with one another in the application of course material enhances their acquisition of course concepts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1052562912442384">Carr-Chellman, Dyer, &amp; Bremen, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1052562912442384">Conrad &amp; Kanuka, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1052562912442384">Krentler &amp; Willis-Flurry, 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1052562912442384">Robinson and Hullinger (2008)</xref> have urged faculty members to “promote interaction, participation, and communication in the online learning environment” (p. 107; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1052562912442384">Arbaugh, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1052562912442384">Cox &amp; Cox, 2008</xref>). Online students report higher perceived learning and satisfaction when they have opportunities to collaborate with classmates to apply the course concepts that their instructors present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1052562912442384">Arbaugh &amp; Benbunan-Fich, 2006</xref>). As a student explained, “[S]ometimes someone can explain a concept in a way that the professor may not” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1052562912442384">Vonderwell et al., 2007</xref>, p. 316).</p>
<p>We hasten to point out that computer-mediated discussions do not automatically yield desired outcomes. Indeed, students in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1052562912442384">Landry, Griffeth, and Hartman’s (2006)</xref> sample regarded the discussion board as less useful and used it less often than other tools within their course management system. Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1052562912442384">Landry et al. (2006)</xref> did not describe how the discussion board was incorporated into the classes they sampled, their findings suggest that educators need to be deliberate about their use of a discussion board. Instructors cannot simply set up a few discussion forums and expect learning to happen. Just as instructors in face-to-face courses must establish an environment that fosters the exchange of ideas and observations, their online counterparts need to ensure that students raise and respond to relevant questions in a respectful way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1052562912442384">Zemsky &amp; Massey, 2004</xref>). Because the impediments to productive discourse that can occur in a traditional classroom can likewise affect a discussion board, instructors have to structure, facilitate, and summarize their students’ online discussions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1052562912442384">Rollag, 2010</xref>). They need, for example, to encourage posts that consider classmates’ viewpoints and to discourage cursory or repetitious comments that require little thought on the part of the poster and hold no value for fellow students. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1052562912442384">Rollag (2010)</xref> has advised, a thread of low-quality high-quantity posts is unproductive for students and can present an overwhelming time commitment for them and their instructors.</p>

<title>How Can an Instructor Design Discussions That Promote Students’ Engagement With Course Material and With One Another?</title>
<p>From a technological standpoint, using the discussion feature is straightforward. Online learners and their instructors, even those who are “digital immigrants,” can quickly master the user-friendly technology to create new threads and post comments.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1052562912442384">2</xref></sup> However, the ease of using the discussion feature is only one criterion affecting students’ actual engagement with it. According to the technology acceptance model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1052562912442384">Davis, 1989</xref>), learners are more likely to adopt a technology if they perceive it as not only easy to use but also worthwhile. It follows, then, that students will be more likely to participate in discussions that they consider relevant to their learning and performance (see also, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1052562912442384">Arbaugh, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Instructors need to ensure that discussions matter to students and have pedagogical value. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1052562912442384">Athanassiou, McNett, and Harvey (2003)</xref>, who drew on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1052562912442384">Bloom’s (1956)</xref> taxonomy, advocated developing students’ higher order skills of application, analysis, synthesis, and evaluation. In their revision of Bloom’s taxonomy, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1052562912442384">Anderson and Krathwohl (2001)</xref> inverted the order of evaluation and synthesis and renamed the latter “creating.” Online instructors would do well to help ensure that students</p>
<list id="list1-1052562912442384" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>apply course concepts to their own experiences in ways that provoke meaningful discussion about course material,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>analyze classmates’ posts to provide useful advice or solutions, and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>evaluate classmates’ posts by critiquing them.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>We now introduce the system we have developed to meet these goals.</p>
<sec id="section3-1052562912442384">
<title>Overview</title>
<p>We create a discussion forum for each course module or unit (i.e., a chapter or group of chapters or a particular concept or set of concepts). If participation in discussions is optional and/or of negligible extrinsic value, many students may elect not to participate. Therefore, participation is mandatory in our online courses and students earn credit for posting comments that meet course requirements (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1052562912442384">Hammond, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1052562912442384">McComb, 1994</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1052562912442384">Brower (2003)</xref> has suggested allotting a decent percentage of the course grade to students’ discussion comments. We agree that in an introductory (survey) course, in which students are learning a few fundamentals about each of a large number of topics, it may make sense to have contributions to the discussion board count toward more of students’ course grade and be the hub and heart of the course. However, in an advanced elective course, in which students are delving somewhat deeply into a relatively circumscribed topic, it may be pedagogically appropriate to assign a final project and/or case study, which would also be worth a substantial amount of course points and, therefore, reduce the number of points students could earn for their posts on a discussion forum. In any case, students should earn course credit for every post (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1052562912442384">Chalmers, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Because merely providing opportunities for discussion does not guarantee useful student interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1052562912442384">Knowlton, Knowlton, &amp; Davis, 2000</xref>), we have students initiate discussions by posting comments about subjects that are salient to them. Although some instructors (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1052562912442384">Arbaugh, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1052562912442384">Brower, 2003</xref>) take it upon themselves to post interesting questions to which their students respond, we follow that approach for other course requirements and reserve discussion forums for student-generated questions. Having students develop their own questions, based on examples they identify and select, gives them an opportunity to apply course materials to issues that matter to them and to gather useful input from their classmates. Discussion boards are more effective when they involve tasks or topics that have “real-world” applications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1052562912442384">Ferdig &amp; Roehler, 2003-2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1052562912442384">Ivancevich, Gilbert, &amp; Konopaske, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1052562912442384">Woo &amp; Reeves, 2008</xref>). Moreover, allowing students to participate in the construction of knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1052562912442384">Levine, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1052562912442384">Palloff &amp; Pratt, 2001</xref>) complements their acquisition of knowledge from textbooks and other materials that their instructors select and supply for them.</p>

<title>Applying Course Concepts and Provoking Meaningful Discussion: Original Examples</title>
<p>Students <italic>apply</italic> course concepts by posting Original Examples (OEs). An OE must pertain directly and specifically to a concept covered in a particular module so that it applies and therefore reinforces course material. An OE is based on a description of an organizational situation that a student has experienced, a work of fiction related to organizational life, or a historical or current event; and it includes an intriguing question and/or a request for advice that follows from the description. The inclusion of a specific question or request helps ensure that classmates will provide useful responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1052562912442384">Lunney, Frederickson, Spark, &amp; McDuffie, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1052562912442384">Williams &amp; Humphrey, 2007</xref>). Although most of our students—even the traditional undergraduates in their late teens and early 20s—have at least some work experience and many have quite a lot, we allow them to draw from their broader organizational experiences (in, e.g., student clubs, athletic teams, volunteer groups), as well as from world events and literary, television, and film examples. Each OE is student-initiated, allows a student to demonstrate application of material, and indicates direct evidence of learning; in contrast, the commonly used objective multiple-choice test is instructor-initiated, requires a student to demonstrate recall or recognition, and provides only indirect evidence of learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1052562912442384">Axelrod, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1052562912442384">Mueller, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1052562912442384">Wiggins, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>Each of us includes in our syllabus the contents of <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1052562912442384">Appendix A</xref> (also available online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jme.sagepub.com/supplemental">http://jme.sagepub.com/supplemental</ext-link>), which spells out expectations regarding content, length of posts, and clarity of expression. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1052562912442384">Bliss and Lawrence (2009a)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1052562912442384">Woo and Reeves (2008)</xref> have underlined the importance of clear guidelines and organization for all learners in an asynchronous course. Such explicit information is especially welcomed by Millennial students, who tend to “crave structure and rules” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1052562912442384">Baker, Comer, &amp; Martinak, 2008</xref>, p. 69). An OE that is drowning in its own verbiage will alienate fellow students, who will not have the patience to sift through it. At the opposite extreme, an OE that is too sparse or one that poses a lackluster or throwaway question will not invite worthwhile responses. Because interesting OEs tend to elicit more meaningful responses, we post (before the course begins) a few exemplary OEs to which students can refer, in order to clarify our expectations and improve performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1052562912442384">Woo &amp; Reeves, 2008</xref>). Providing these examples minimizes the likelihood that a poster will either go overboard (by including a summary of every key term in a course module before proceeding to present his or her example) or fall short of course requirements (by including insufficient information; asking an obvious, overly general, or yes/no question; or forgetting to include questions related to their example). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1052562912442384">Han and Hill (2006)</xref> have suggested, “Fostering learners’ capability to engage in online discussions may contribute to successful learning” (p. 47). Specifying precisely what kinds of comments will—and will not—earn credit helps eliminate irrelevant postings that do not advance learning (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1052562912442384">Bliss &amp; Lawrence, 2009b</xref>, for a discussion of this problem) and can also reduce frustration. <xref ref-type="app" rid="app2-1052562912442384">Appendix B</xref>, which is also available online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jme.sagepub.com/supplemental">http://jme.sagepub.com/supplemental</ext-link>, provides a convenient checklist for guiding students as they prepare their OEs and VACs, which we now describe.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1052562912442384">
<title>Analyzing and Evaluating: Value-Added Comments</title>
<p>Students <italic>analyze</italic> and <italic>evaluate</italic> course concepts by posting VACs in response to OEs and other VACs. A VAC responds directly to an OE, responding to the question or providing advice (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app3-1052562912442384">Appendix C</xref>, which is also available online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jme.sagepub.com/supplemental">http://jme.sagepub.com/supplemental</ext-link>). Students need to understand that a VAC is different from a casual comment on someone’s blog or a hastily dashed-off tweet or response to an e-mail or a text message. Instead, a VAC needs to add value—by insightfully addressing the corresponding post and enhancing and advancing the discussion. Preparing a VAC response thus involves analysis, inasmuch as the student is examining what a classmate has stated, making inferences and comparisons, and identifying motives or causes. Additionally, a student can post a VAC in response to a classmate’s VAC about an OE. However, a student who is not the first person to post a VAC in response to a particular OE must take care to evaluate, rather than repeat, what others have already stated. Thus, the first couple of students who respond to a classmate’s OE will use analysis as they prepare their responses; subsequent students tend to depend more on evaluation, as they assess the relative merits of previous posts. An instructor who wants to ensure that each student engages in both analysis and evaluation can specify explicitly on the course syllabus that each student is required to post VACs early for some modules and late for others. Instructors may decide to give students an opportunity at the beginning of the course to post practice VACs for which they earn no course points but gain feedback that will help them prepare future VACs.</p>

<title>Integrating OEs and VACs Into an Online Course</title>
<sec id="section7-1052562912442384">
<title>Distributing OEs and VACs Across Course Modules</title>
<p>To ensure that there are some OEs for every module (unit) of a course and that there are neither too many nor too few VACs for a given module, it is necessary to assign OEs and VACs. At the beginning of the course, the instructor can divide the class into four groups and assign each student to one of these groups. For each module, all the students in one group (one quarter of the class) are required to post OEs, all the students in two other groups (one half of the class) are required to post VACs, and the students in the fourth group have a course requirement unrelated to the discussion board. (In a class with relatively few students, the instructor can divide students among three groups, and have everyone in one group post an OE and everyone in the other two groups post a VAC.) Additionally, after the deadline for posting VACs for a particular OE, the person who posted the OE may have an opportunity to earn extra course credit for posting a VAC that addresses <italic>all</italic> the VACs his or her classmates posted in response to that OE and indicates (a) how well classmates’ VACs addressed the OE and (b) how he or she plans to use their responses/advice. The preparation of this type of post gives the student, who applied concepts in his or her OE, an opportunity to engage in higher order thinking skills: The student examines the contents of classmates’ posts (analyzes), makes judgments about the validity or quality of the ideas and information presented (evaluates), and puts together the ideas and information of previous posts to construct new plans for behaving in the workplace (creates; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1052562912442384">Anderson &amp; Krathwohl, 2001</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1052562912442384">Athanassiou et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1052562912442384">Page &amp; Mukherjee, 2007</xref>). Distributing OEs and VACs across students and modules helps guarantee a good balance such that students who are required to post VACs will have a variety of OEs from which to choose and there will be sufficient discussion within any particular thread (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1052562912442384">Bliss &amp; Lawrence, 2009a</xref>). Limiting the number of students in any given discussion may produce more meaningful posts than a larger group of discussants would (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1052562912442384">Bliss &amp; Lawrence, 2009b</xref>) and keep discussions from becoming repetitive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1052562912442384">Vonderwell et al., 2007</xref>). Designating students as posters of OEs or VACs for particular forums, rather than letting students post any type of comment for any forum they select, enhances the quality of their comments and reduces the number of superficial posts that at best add nothing to the conversation and, at worse, make it cumbersome to follow (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1052562912442384">Rollag, 2010</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section8-1052562912442384">
<title>Posting Deadlines: Sacrificing Degrees of Freedom to Promote a Community of Learners</title>
<p>The number of weeks in the course and the number of modules into which the instructor has divided course content (as well as other logistical factors) will determine how much time students have to post their OEs and VACs. For example, in an accelerated summer course with a condensed schedule and a rather large number of modules, it may make sense to require students to post their OEs within one or two business days of the date the module becomes available and then to have them post VACs within another one or two business days. Although a tighter schedule reduces students’ flexibility, it keeps everyone on the same (web)page, thus enhancing mutual learning. Some students who choose an online course may assume incorrectly that they will have boundless freedom to work at their own pace. It is therefore essential that instructors advise students on the syllabus—and in their precourse and early-course e-mails and announcements—that even though they are not required to be in a certain classroom at a certain time on certain days, they do need to adhere to a schedule to afford collaborative learning via the discussion board.</p>

<sec id="section9-1052562912442384">
<title>Grading Posts Objectively</title>
<p>Prompt performance feedback is appreciated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1052562912442384">Hackman &amp; Oldham, 1980</xref>). Online students seek feedback and need it to learn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1052562912442384">Vonderwell et al., 2007</xref>). Especially at the beginning of the course, when students are leaving their first posts, feedback from the instructor can relieve their anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1052562912442384">Woo &amp; Reeves, 2008</xref>). It is essential to alert students when their posts need modification. Students also enjoy receiving praise for their unusually provocative or insightful posts. Assessment criteria affect students’ contributions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1052562912442384">Vonderwell et al., 2007</xref>). Therefore, before the course begins, instructors need to provide for students the criteria that they will use to evaluate posts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1052562912442384">Al-Shalchi, 2009</xref>). The checklists in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app2-1052562912442384">Appendix B</xref> clarify for students that their posts—which are inherently subjective—will be graded according to objective criteria. If a student posts a comment that does not meet <italic>all</italic> the relevant criteria, the instructor can label that post “no credit” on the discussion forum and indicate the reason(s) why it is ineligible for credit. For example, using the classification system in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app2-1052562912442384">Appendix B</xref>, an oe that is not based on one of the three specified options and is too short and poorly written will be designated “no credit—O2, O6, O7.” It may seem harsh to reveal to a student’s classmates that his or her post is not eligible to receive credit. However, a public correction provides an opportunity for students to learn vicariously from their classmates and, thus, helps them frame their own acceptable posts, and also demonstrates that the instructor is adhering to the established grading standards specified on the syllabus. By referring to a handy set of objective standards, the instructor expeditiously reiterates expectations and guides the poster to fix the deficient post. All students soon know how to post properly and the instructor no longer needs to mark posts as problematic. Instructors should aim to supplement the quick assessment provided on the discussion forum with a personal courtesy e-mail to any student whose post is not credit-worthy. The instructor can use this e-mail to provide further clarification of the deficiencies of the student’s post and offer suggestions for correcting them. However, students need to understand that it remains <italic>their</italic> responsibility to check that their posts have earned credit. (Instructors who are concerned that publicizing scores might constitute an FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act) violation are advised to provide feedback about the quality of a student’s inadequate post without specifying that the post earned no credit.)</p>

<sec id="section10-1052562912442384">
<title>What Is the Instructor’s Role in the Discussion?</title>
<p>An instructor’s role on the asynchronous discussion forum is as important as the role that the instructor would play in a face-to-face classroom discussion. Too much instructor participation can reduce the quality of the discussion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1052562912442384">Palloff &amp; Pratt, 2001</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1052562912442384">Pelz (2010)</xref> has argued that students should lead discussions and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1052562912442384">Brower (2003)</xref> has gone so far as to advise instructors to intervene in a discussion only to correct inaccuracies or ensure civility, but not to enter into the discussion as a participant. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1052562912442384">Mazzolini and Maddison (2003)</xref>, likewise, see the instructor’s purpose as encouraging students to initiate and assume responsibility for their discussion. They found in a later study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1052562912442384">Mazzolini &amp; Maddison, 2007</xref>) that, although many instructors believe that their greater participation on the discussion board will elicit more comments by their students, an increase in instructor posts tends to suppress students’ posting. We agree that the instructor should contact students offline to provide either commendation or constructive criticism about their posts and refrain from sharing their perspectives right away on the discussion board itself. Instead, instructors should wait until the posting deadline, when their students have had their opportunity to offer their ideas and opinions. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1052562912442384">Rollag (2010)</xref> has observed, instructors may find “that often the comments they would have made about a specific student’s posting eventually get made by other students” if they refrain from jumping into the discussion right away (p. 517). However, the instructor may have to guide or moderate a discussion to facilitate learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1052562912442384">Woo &amp; Reeves, 2008</xref>). Therefore, if a student has left a comment that indicates confusion about a concept, it is necessary to provide clarification as soon as possible.</p>
<p>An instructor may need to redirect a discussion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1052562912442384">Han &amp; Hill, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1052562912442384">Vonderwell et al., 2007</xref>), bringing in new information or ideas to elicit posts that can open up a conversation that has stalled or has gone off on an unfruitful tangent. The immediacy of the instructor’s response depends on the length of the course. In a condensed course, the instructor will have to monitor the discussion board more frequently than in a full-semester course. Especially during the first few days of a condensed course, the instructor may need to check every couple of hours from early in the morning until late into the evening. Later, the discussion can be monitored just a few times a day. At the beginning of a semester-length course, the instructor will be watching the discussion perhaps as often as a few times daily. As students gain experience posting, the frequency of monitoring can decrease to about once a day. The instructor may also have to remind students to defend (rather than merely state) their position or may provide a contrary or conflicting view that nobody has considered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1052562912442384">Gerber, Scott, Clements, &amp; Sarama, 2005</xref>). Finding the right balance between under- and overparticipation is not clear-cut, but two guidelines for instructors to keep in mind as they navigate their role on the discussion board are (a) to post enough to ensure that they have a “presence” and show they care but not so much as to dominate the discussion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1052562912442384">Bliss &amp; Lawrence, 2009a</xref>) and (b) to post in a way that fits comfortably with their teaching style (see, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1052562912442384">Vlachopoulos &amp; Cowan, 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>Evidence of Effectiveness</title>
<p>We now provide two types of evidence to show that using this system of OEs and VACs facilitates students’ learning of course concepts: (a) examples of threaded discussions and (b) survey feedback from students.</p>
<sec id="section12-1052562912442384">
<title>Threaded Discussions With OEs and VACs</title>
<p><xref ref-type="app" rid="app4-1052562912442384">Appendix D</xref>, which is also available online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jme.sagepub.com/supplemental">http://jme.sagepub.com/supplemental</ext-link>, gives two illustrations of student-initiated threaded discussions. (Please note that the comments in these threaded discussions are lightly edited; we fixed punctuation and capitalization errors, but changed neither vocabulary nor sentence structure.) A threaded discussion allows participants to engage in a virtual conversation and “shows the list of all the messages with subject headings, enabling a structuring of messages by topic” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1052562912442384">Han &amp; Hill, 2006</xref>, p. 31). In a given class, two or more discussions can occur at the same time. After a student posts an introductory comment, classmates’ replies will appear indented under the original post (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1052562912442384">Hazari, 2004</xref>). The first threaded discussion presented in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app4-1052562912442384">Appendix D</xref> appeared on the discussion board of the first author’s online undergraduate introductory management course. The thread begins with an OE that applied the course material on leadership and posed a provocative question to her classmates. The posts following the OE are VACs, in which students responded directly to the question in the OE. The authors of the first and second VACs analyzed the contents of the OE author’s post through a different lens, thereby prompting a meaningful conversation that furthered students’ learning. The poster of the third VAC compared the points made in the previous posts with one another, as well as with information from the textbook, and evaluated them. Once the deadline for this discussion had passed, the instructor posted a comment to integrate the student-led discussion, clarify important issues, and validate students’ comments—just as an instructor would do during a face-to-face discussion in a classroom. This discussion thus demonstrates that students’ OEs applied course concepts and their VACs analyzed and evaluated classmates’ posts. Additionally, it provides evidence of the achievement of learning objectives for the course. For example, one of the primary objectives (taken directly from the syllabus) for the course in which this discussion transpired is students’ learning “key concepts for motivating, leading, and communicating with individuals and groups in organizations.”</p>
<p>The second threaded discussion comes from a different section (in a different semester) of the same course. The OE poster drew from an actual problem faced at work to apply course material on effective communication and request advice from classmates. The VACs that this OE elicited brought additional course concepts into the discussion and prompted a rich exchange of ideas. In the last comment (the extra-credit VAC), the student who had posted the OE skillfully wrapped up the discussion by integrating her classmates’ VACs, evaluating their comments as helpful for gaining insights into her work situation, and reflecting on general lessons that could improve future organizational encounters. Because her extra-credit post was comprehensive, the instructor did not need to comment in this discussion.</p>

<title>Survey Feedback From Students</title>
<p>We have collected feedback from the eight online classes in which we have used this system: five sections of the first author’s Principles of Management class, a required survey course for all undergraduate business majors at our institution; and three sections of the second author’s Organizational Recruitment and Selection course, an elective for undergraduate Management majors. As we have noted and as <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1052562912442384">Table 1</xref> indicates, students’ posts to the discussion board constituted a substantially larger portion of their course grade in the survey course (40% to 48%) than in the elective (12% to 15%). Because the latter course is an upper-level elective, the second author gave more weight to other assessments (an individual project and a group project that required students to integrate knowledge acquired in the course to solve real-world organizational problems).</p>

<title>Overall learning from the course</title>
<p>Most students reported that they had learned a lot from their online course (Question 1, ranging from 83.33% to 100%), that they had not learned less in their online class than they would have learned in a face-to-face class (Question 2, from 58.33% to 94.12%), and that taking the online class had made them recognize that they could learn from their fellow students (Question 3, from 66.67% to 100%). Students in the five sections of the required survey course, in which posting OEs and VACs counted substantially toward their grade, as compared with their counterparts in the three sections of the elective course, in which discussion posts contributed less heavily to the course grade, were just as likely to report that they had learned a lot, less likely to believe that they had learned less in their online class than they would have learned in a face-to-face class, and more likely to agree that the class had made them recognize that they could learn from classmates. It is possible that students in the elective course were less enthusiastic about their overall learning in the course because the discussion board was a less prominent feature of the course.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1052562912442384">
<title>Learning from OEs and VACs</title>
<p>Students reported that posting OEs (Question 4, from 76.19% to 100%), responding with VACs to their classmates’ comments (Question 5, from 76.19% to 100%), and reading their classmates’ posts (Question 6, from 76.19% to 100%) had helped them understand and apply course concepts. Students in the introductory classes, in which posting OEs and VACs was a more significant part of the course grade, were more likely to respond favorably to these items. It could be that their counterparts in the other class, as juniors and seniors taking an elective in their major, focused more on what they had learned from their integrative course projects than on the value of the lesser weighted discussion board.</p>
<p>Several students commented that they had enjoyed advising their classmates and helping them learn from the concepts and, in turn, had valued receiving helpful feedback and ideas from their classmates. A student explained,
<disp-quote>
<p>The VACs were a good way to make the students work together. We were interacting with one another, trying to share examples, and providing insight as to how we could work on something or what we would do in a certain situation.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Others likewise reported on the usefulness of the discussion board. As one student wrote, “It made me aware of future problems I might encounter in the business world. I am more prepared to handle them.” Another commented, “I learned a little more ‘street smarts’ because of the great feedback from my classmates.”</p>
<p>Many students remarked that a higher proportion of their classmates had participated on the discussion board than in their face-to-face classes and that they had learned more from fellow students than they do in such classes. They mentioned the advantage of not “being singled out” because everyone was required to post comments, as well as the convenience and efficiency of having a record of classmates’ ideas for future reference:
<disp-quote>
<p>It is very easy to get distracted in a classroom. You may lose insight from fellow students, or not hear from the students who don’t like to speak up. On the discussion board, you are much more able to learn from everyone and not just the teacher and text.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1052562912442384">
<title>Other aspects of the discussion board</title>
<p>In most classes, a sizable proportion of students reported that they were more comfortable participating in online discussions than in discussions in face-to-face classes (Question 7, from 28.54% to 82.35%). These results confirm previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1052562912442384">Al-Shalchi, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1052562912442384">Arbaugh, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1052562912442384">Neidorf, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1052562912442384">Rainsbury &amp; Malcolm, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1052562912442384">Young, 2008</xref>), indicating that an online discussion board is a welcome forum for those students who want to contribute but dislike public speaking. (We offer a post hoc explanation for the relatively low percentage, i.e., 28.54%, of students in one section of the upper-level elective indicating that they were more comfortable participating in the online discussion board than in a face-to-face class: Not only was this one of their last classes before graduation but they had also already taken many courses together in which they had been encouraged to participate in classroom discussions. As a result, at this point in their program of study, the prospect of an in-class discussion with familiar faces did not seem stressful.) Students also reported that it was appropriate to assess their comments on the discussion board (Question 8, from 66.67% to 100%). Moreover, students in the survey classes, whose posts counted toward a larger portion of their grade, viewed this means of performance assessment especially positively.</p>
<p>Although a couple of students complained that they had some difficulty conveying their ideas in writing, many more mentioned that posting comments on the discussion board developed their writing skills and gave them greater confidence in expressing themselves in writing. One international student explained, “Because my English is not very good, I was always afraid of speaking in class. I felt the same way in the beginning of this course, but now I’m more confident ‘speaking’ to the class.” Another student hoped to use a newfound self-assurance in traditional courses:
<disp-quote>
<p>I have definitely developed more confidence in expressing my opinions to my peers. Before taking this class online, I never would have raised my hand in class to disagree with a classmate, because I would have felt awkward expressing that opinion in person. After completing the assignments on the discussion boards and receiving positive feedback about my posts, I feel much more confident in expressing these opinions, and will try to incorporate this confidence in my face-to-face classes.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In general, students from both the introductory survey course and the advanced elective course found the discussion board “interactive,” “engaging,” and “interesting.” Indeed, they commonly described it as the “best feature” of the course. Very few students registered complaints about the discussion board. Whereas two stated that it was difficult for them to produce OEs and two others raised objections about the tight scheduling, several others commented favorably about the usefulness of coming up with applications from their own experiences and noted that the course enhanced their self-discipline.</p>

<title>What We Have Learned</title>
<p>Since we have begun teaching online, we have made modifications to improve delivery of the OE–VAC system. We found, for example, that we had to adjust our posting deadlines to match the nocturnal habits of our students. On observing a flurry of posting activity after midnight, we moved our deadlines from late in the afternoon to very early in the morning. Also, before the semester begins, we try to disabuse students of the idea that online courses are diluted versions of “real” face-to-face courses. Although we implore them via e-mail and video to consider whether they have adequate self-discipline to participate regularly in discussions and to be mindful of due dates, not all students heed our advice. Typically, one or two of these will drop the class after just a few days, once they have grasped the level of commitment an online course demands. We monitor our students’ participation and send reminders to those who miss deadlines. Some of these initial underperformers do blossom into key contributors. Others, however, continue to lose points for not posting comments and have to withdraw from the course in order to avoid earning undesirable grades.</p>
<p>Having used the model of OEs and VACs for several semesters, we can report that our students find it easy to grasp from the beginning of the course. Whereas most students ascertain how to prepare acceptable comments by regarding the instructions on the syllabus and/or emulating the exemplary OEs posted on the discussion board, some have to learn from their own mistakes. We encourage students to post not-for-credit practice comments at the beginning of the course and to post their initial (for-credit) OEs and VACs early, so that we will be able to catch any errors in time for them to make corrections and repost for a higher score. In general, students are quite competent at posting VACs. A few students have told us at the beginning of the course, however, that they have trouble coming up with OEs. This finding is surprising, inasmuch as applying (which is involved in preparing an OE) is considered more basic than analyzing and evaluating (which are required to prepare a VAC) by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1052562912442384">Bloom (1956)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1052562912442384">Anderson and Krathwohl (2001)</xref>. According to their taxonomy, it should be easier to use lower order cognitive skills than higher order cognitive skills. Yet because many students’ prior coursework has emphasized acquisition and comprehension of knowledge and afforded few opportunities for using this knowledge, the novel task of applying a course concept to something that they have experienced may feel awkward at first. Our finding underscores the importance of giving students—in face-to-face and online courses—opportunities to engage in higher level thinking.</p>
<p>Instructors may need to reinforce their course policies about the mechanics of student posts. Our syllabi tell students that their writing must be professional—that is, grammatically correct and free of typographical errors—and that they should proofread their comments before posting them. We also encourage them to seek the services of a campus writing support center (some universities provide writing assistance online as well as in a physical facility). Although we do not penalize students for less than praiseworthy prose, we do insist that they avoid texting language (“i,” “u,” and “ur”). Whenever such language surfaces at the beginning of the course, we require students to correct their posts in order to earn credit. Some instructors may decide to subtract points for any infractions later in the course or may require students to resubmit posts free of text-message shorthand.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The lack of face-to-face interaction in asynchronous online courses does <italic>not</italic> have to lessen the lesson. Instead, asynchronous online discussions can promote students’ participation and learning. This article introduced a system developed to foster online discussions that are useful for students. As we have shown, the discussion thread begins when a student posts an OE, in which he or she applies course concepts to issues that interest him or her and requests advice and ideas from classmates. Classmates then reply with VACs that address the OE. Early VAC posters use analysis as they compare their opinions and experiences with those of the OE poster. Those who post VACs later in the thread evaluate what their classmates have stated. By specifying for students how to prepare their posts and assigning posting roles to students, instructors save themselves and their students from the frustration and stress of dysfunctional discussions (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1052562912442384">McKeach, 2002</xref>) and help ensure that each post in a thread will enhance and advance the discussion to strengthen learning.</p>
<p>Since introducing the system, we have noticed that the comments students post are more meaningful than they were before we used OEs and VACs, and discussion has been more thoughtful and gratifying for us as instructors. Additionally, students have reported, at the end of the course, that the discussion board is one of their favorite parts of the course because they learn by applying course concepts to issues of personal salience and thinking about their classmates’ experiences and insights. This observed link between the perceived relevance of the discussion board and students’ use of it is consistent with Technology Acceptance Model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1052562912442384">Davis, 1989</xref>). Furthermore, we found that our model was viewed more favorably by students in an introductory class, where the discussion board factored significantly into their final grade, than by their counterparts in an advanced elective course, in which the discussion board was weighted less than other coursework.</p>
<p>We cannot ascertain, at this point, whether it is the amount the discussion board counts toward students’ grades and/or its prominence in the course that matter(s). However, we can report that the majority of students in both courses found the discussion board to be a valuable tool to enhance their learning in an asynchronous online course. We developed the OE–VAC model for our undergraduate online courses, but believe that the structure it provides for students to apply, analyze, and evaluate course concepts can likewise promote meaningful online discussions for graduate-level learners. We plan to incorporate it into the courses we teach in our school’s online MBA program.</p>

<title>Original Examples</title>
<p>You will earn up to <italic>n</italic> points<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1052562912442384">3</xref></sup> for posting each original example (OE), which must pertain <underline>directly and specifically</underline> to a concept (or concepts) covered in the <italic>current</italic> module so that it benefits everyone in the class by applying, and thereby reinforcing, course material. Please refer to the tables on page __ of this syllabus to determine the modules for which you are required to post your OEs. An OE must truly be original; it must not resemble a classmate’s OE, a VAC, or an ASSIGNMENT. An OE that is too general or vague is not useful. An OE must <underline>pose an intriguing question</underline> and/or <underline>ask for advice</underline>. Do not pose a “throwaway” question, whose answer is obvious or trivial or appears in the notes or textbook. Your OE will contain <underline>at least eight</underline> clearly and carefully composed sentences. Your OE will be scored according to its <underline>relevance</underline> to the identified course concept(s) and its <underline>insightfulness</underline>. It <underline>must</underline> be based upon <italic>one</italic> of the following three options:</p>
<list id="list2-1052562912442384" list-type="order">
<list-item><p><bold><italic>a situation you have experienced in an organizational setting (such as your workplace, student club, volunteer group, etc.);</italic></bold></p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold><italic>a summary of a book, short story, song, comic strip, play (or scene from one), movie (or scene from one), or television program (or episode of one); or</italic></bold></p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold><italic>a description of an important historical event or a current event or a newspaper article published within the last six months.</italic></bold></p></list-item>
</list>
<p>An OE that is not sufficiently relevant or thoughtful, or one whose question(s) is/are meaningless and/or do(es) not follow directly from the rest of it, will earn fewer than <italic>n</italic> points. Late OEs will receive no credit. To post your OE, go to the Discussion Board on Blackboard, click on the forum for the respective module (e.g., if you are required to post an OE for Module 3, click on “Module 3 forum”) and then click on “add new thread.” Fill in the subject line as “OE about [<italic>a few words that describe the concept(s) illustrated by your example</italic>].” Fill in the body of the message with at least eight clearly and carefully composed sentences and submit your message.</p>

You may also indicate, <italic>beyond</italic> what the post already states, how the comment relates to a course concept and you may include a question of your own. You may post your VAC in response to an OE for that module or in response to someone else’s VAC about an OE for that module. If you are not the first person to post a VAC in response to an OE, be sure to read all other VAC(s) posted for that OE to ensure that you are incorporating, rather than rehashing what has already been stated. Please note that although it <italic>is</italic> appropriate for you to state your disagreement with someone else’s opinions, you must take care to do so in a respectful way. Uncivil posts are unacceptable and will earn no credit. Nor will late VACs.</p>
<p>For instance, suppose that on [day of week], [month] [date], Alina posts an OE for Module 3 relating how an episode of a television show illustrates managing workplace diversity and asks what the manager could have done more effectively. A student who is required to post a VAC for Module 3 has until [time] on [day of week], [month] [date], to do so. For example, Giuseppe has until [time] on [day of week], [month] [date], to give his reply and add that he viewed that same episode and that Alina forgot to mention that the episode also illustrates another relevant course concept we have covered. Marisol, meanwhile, may respond, until [time] on [day of week], [month] [date], by describing how a situation resembling the one in the OE actually happened at the company where she had her internship and discussing how her boss behaved effectively. Another classmate who is required to post a VAC for this module then has until [time] on [day of week], [month] [date], to reply by posting a VAC about either Alina’s (or another classmate’s) OE or about Giuseppe’s or Marisol’s (or another classmate’s) VAC.</p>

<title>Two Examples of a Threaded Discussion</title>
<p><bold>Thread I:</bold> Great Leaders</p>
<p><bold>Original Example:</bold> Great Leaders</p>
<p><bold>Author:</bold> CC</p>
<p>What is considered a great leader? When we think of greatness we think of Superman or someone of that nature that has done positive things in the world, but if we refer to it like that, it’s just a title. But greatness in a person is what, as a leader, Adolf Hitler had. I understand how many people may think that this is nonsense because he ordered the Jews to get killed and how the war was started. But he was a GREAT leader because he gained Germany’s trust and made everyone believe in his views, he kept Germany fighting for 6 long years and he even gained control of even more countries, with this he needed the people’s help, Social Power. Though many may think this is absurd I think differently. He would not have gone as far as he did if he did not speak to his followers as confidently as he did and believing in his speeches. Adolf Hitler is the definition of LEADERSHIP. He was an effective leader because he induced his followers to reach a particular goal.</p>
<p>I believe Fidel Castro is also among the world’s Greatest Leaders. I am not saying this because I am probably Fidel Castro’s number one fan but because, after 52 years and going, he has been able to maintain Cuba as a communist INDEPENDENT country. And even if he dies he will still have followers and like his brother now, Raul, they will maintain the country the way it is now. I am not comparing Fidel Castro with Adolf Hitler because those who are against Fidel Castro, it’s not because he went off and killed everyone who did not believe in him or those who do not look white with blue eyes, but because of his political views. There are many people, like myself, who think communism is the answer for many of our problems. Castro’s speeches are just beyond inspiring and they allow his followers to believe in his views.</p>
<p>Can anyone else think of a leader who may have had a malicious goal, but was really good at leading?</p>
<p><bold>First Value-Added Comment</bold></p>
<p><bold>Author:</bold> BS</p>
<p>I personally despise Adolf Hitler. But he was one of the greatest leaders of all time. His ability to motivate people to do such horrid things could be construed as somewhat miraculous. He led a generation to despise a group of certain individuals through revolutionary use of propaganda and leadership strategies. While no one can say that he was a positive leader, he certainly was a great motivator. He turned a whole country’s views around in a few years, which led to mass murder. The ability to get so many people to think and behave the same way is a true sign of leadership. Not many individuals in history can claim this.</p>
<p><bold>Second Value-Added Comment</bold></p>
<p><bold>Author:</bold> ES</p>
<p>C,</p>
<p>I found it very interesting that you correlated leadership with such malicious individuals. I see your point—that the men you described were effective in obtaining the people’s attention and gaining their trust, but I would have to disagree as far as calling them great leaders. I would, instead, call those men great persuaders. Persuasion is an art form and something that is very much a part of being a leader, manager, boss. However, these men are so vicious and the crimes Adolf Hitler committed, so heinous, I could not fathom calling them great leaders. I feel as though a great leader does need the power of persuasion but should use their persuasion for good. For example, Martin Luther King Jr., was a great leader with the strong power of persuasion and a great talent for speech communication. All in all, I believe that great leaders should also make great, and just, actions.</p>
<p>Does anyone else feel as though a great leader should not only be a great persuader but also use their power of persuasion for good?</p>
<p><bold>Third Value-Added Comment</bold></p>
<p><bold>Author:</bold> MV</p>
<p>Well, I am certainly not going to say that Adolf Hitler and Fidel Castro are good leaders; they are in fact two individuals who took advantage of two poor, beat-up, and devastated nations. Germany was just beaten in WWI and so much of their rights were taken away from the rest of the world. The only relevance that Cuba has ever had is as much as a 1970s one-hit wonder. They played a small role in the Cold War, which Castro was responsible for, mainly because he allowed the Soviet Union to enter his country, during a dangerous time with our country. People who order the mass murdering of innocent people are no one to look up to and call great leaders. Genocide is not an attribute of a good leader. That is an attribute of a sick individual. The killings of people who are different, and who don’t agree with your beliefs, are all that those two individuals should be remembered for.</p>
<p>As for your question, I agree with E’s statements. Those individuals are better persuaders than they are leaders. But I also agree with her statement that a great leader should use their power of persuasion for good. Being a good speaker doesn’t mean you’re a great person; it just means you know how to talk. President Obama won the election mainly because the man can really speak, but we aren’t calling him a great leader, yet. The textbook itself says that a leader uses their abilities for the better of the GROUP and not the individual—clearly not what Hitler and Castro have done. A great leader, as mentioned, is someone like Martin Luther King, Jr. A great leader is Abraham Lincoln. These individuals fought against everything that Hitler and Castro believed in. They fought for individual rights, for equality. A great leader is only great if the actions they take are greater for the group/business (in this case world).</p>
<p><bold>Instructor’s Comment (posted after the deadline)</bold></p>
<p>As E and M have argued, it makes us cringe to use the word “great” in the same sentence as these heinous creatures.</p>
<p>M points out that [the author of our textbook] defines a leader as someone who uses his/her abilities for the benefit of the group. According to this definition, no matter how successful a person is at getting others to follow him/her, the person is a leader only if he/she is driven by socialized power.</p>
<p>However, we could argue (and I would) that [the textbook author]’s definition is Pollyannaish. We could define a leader less restrictively as someone who has followers, as someone who gets other people to do what he/she wants them to do.</p>
<p>Yes, of course, the kind of leader we’d like to lead our group, company, nation, etc. would be someone who would meet the added criterion of working toward the betterment of the people he/she is leading and have morally appropriate goals. If, however, we use the more inclusive definition, then a great leader is someone who succeeds at getting people to follow him/her and pursue his/her ends. A great leader, sadly, may not be a good (as in beneficent) leader.</p>
<p><bold>Thread II:</bold> OE on Communication Effectiveness</p>
<p><bold>Original Example:</bold> Communication Effectiveness</p>
<p><bold>Author:</bold> BR</p>
<p>While working at the pool last year, my manager, while completely physically capable and knowledgeable about working at the pool, had a problem receiving information effectively. When someone had information for her, she would seem preoccupied when being informed. She would not stop what she was doing to receive the information, which would make the subordinate lifeguard uncomfortable, and she only occasionally would indicate that she had even heard the message. Often, she would scold the lifeguard reporting to her for bringing up needless information, and, depending on the person, would not listen to them at all. This was a major problem last year, especially in situations involving biohazards (blood or “accidents”) and medical conditions. Though we tried to work with her, none of us seemed successful in creating little more than useless noise in her direction.</p>
<p>What are some ways our manager could have improved her receiving abilities? What are some ways we subordinate lifeguards could have improved our sending abilities? Is it one party or the other’s fault as to how the scenario often ended up in unsuccessful communication? Are both parties at fault?</p>

<p>It sounds like the situation had more fault on your manager’s side than the lifeguards’, but from what we learned in module 17 the fault was on both sides. If the lifeguards could see that she was not paying attention they should have waited until she did. I can see why it would be uncomfortable, and one of you may even get yelled at to get back to work, but that’s when you tell her that you were waiting for her attention. If you don’t have her attention, then she definitely was not in the right mindset to listen to you. So for the lifeguards I would say they should have waited until they did have her full attention and then told her what happened fully. As far as the manager goes, she needs to change her entire attitude. She should have been attentive when you came to her with a problem. She should have told you how to handle the situation, or answer your questions and she should have stopped doing everything else that she was doing for 5 seconds so you could talk to her. I want to say that it is mostly your manager’s fault, and I believe it is. It can be very intimidating to wait for someone of authority to give you attention, especially if you walk in and they say, “can I help you?” and they continue to do what they were doing. You feel that the right thing to do is to tell them what you want, but in your case it doesn’t sound like your manager was even interested. It was more like talking to a wall for you guys. I hope that you either have a new manager now, or that your current manager has improved her ways.</p>

<p>B,</p>
<p>That’s absolutely a great example for this module. I agree with you. I hate when people do not listen because they’re preoccupied with doing something else. Your manager’s actions clearly indicate that she did not want to be bothered. She displays evidence of nonverbal communication as discussed in the module. It is a shame that someone who is in charge of saving lives acts in this way. I feel that the best advice is given from the workers who are actually the ones performing the tasks. Your manager should have really acted more managerially. Often times, it’s too late when she finally figures out the true importance of her job. Listening is one of the most important aspects of communication. Listening well is where the challenge for her is present. So the question is what could she have done to improve her receiving skills? Your manager obviously has to sit down and listen to her workers’ concerns. She has to put other things aside when she is approached by a concerned employee. A lot of times, college professors offer office hours. This can also be something for your manager to consider. The manager isn’t going to be afraid until something bad happens to a swimmer or even herself. Therefore, another approach would be to get her into trouble with a supervisor. Someone has to talk seriously to her and let her know the situation that’s on hand. If she cannot handle being a manager, perhaps she should step down. The employees can also write letters to the manager so she can read them when she has time. That gives her time to read them. So, there is no reason for her to not be able to address the concerns. The lifeguards can improve their communication skills by getting more serious. As communicators, they have to show their intent. They cannot simply have a laid-back attitude. They have to talk to the manager and in a serious way where it will get her attention. It is important for both the sender and the receiver to do their jobs well for the message to be successfully sent and received. Refer to the diagram. It’s a multiple effort for both parties—so both parties are at fault. Hopefully, it doesn’t take a tragic event to teach her to listen.</p>

<p>B,</p>
<p>I think this is an excellent example of communication. I also think that it was more the manager’s fault than the lifeguards’ fault. The lifeguards could have reported the manager to someone who holds a higher position than her rather than taking this attitude from her this whole time. When I first read that the manager didn’t want to be bothered, my first thought was that she didn’t know what she was doing and she didn’t want to be responsible if something went wrong. In other words, she didn’t want the blame on her if something went wrong so she figured she would ignore the lifeguards and let them figure out the situation on their own since they should know the procedure. I think she should definitely step down as manager because her attitude is not in the right place right now and she claims not to have any time to answer questions. As a manager, she should be there to answer the littlest questions because she is there to help the lifeguards when they need help.</p>

<p>What are some ways this manager could have improved her receiving abilities?</p>
<p>Your manager can be an overall nicer person and be more open-minded when it comes to listening to what the subordinate lifeguards have to say. She can have nicer body language that will make the lifeguards want to come up and talk to her.</p>
<p>What are some ways the subordinate lifeguards could have improved their sending abilities?</p>
<p>The subordinate lifeguards can make sure that they are addressed the manager nicely. They can make sure that they sound good and the tone of voice they choose to use is one that the receiver likes. Lastly, they can make sure that the actual words they choose to use are ones that are suitable for the conversation they are trying to have with the manager.</p>
<p>Is it one party’s or the other’s fault as to how the scenario often ended up in unsuccessful communication? Are both parties at fault?</p>
<p>In this case, it seems that the manager is uptight and she should really lighten up and be more open. She should definitely be listening better to the subordinate lifeguards because if they don’t go to her then who could they go to? So in this case I think that manager is more at fault but it also can very well be that the lifeguards that were sending the message could have been doing it in the wrong manner and the receiver, in this case the manager, could have not been a good receiver, which is what seems to me to be the problem in this scenario. Do you think that they should have someone else take her position? Or do you think that she is capable of just having someone talk to her about what she has to work on and then from there do her job correctly?</p>

<p>Though I also feel that more fault was on my manager’s side, I now feel that a more perceptive subordinate lifeguard would have been more successful with her. She could have been much more receptive when someone gave her information. However, it seems not to be that she does not receive the information, just that she does not give the person speaking enough attention to make them feel important. I feel that she was not necessarily malicious in her ignorance. She may have just not wanted to spend the energy involved in halting, looking the guard in the eye, and paying them the respect they should have received. In the end, someone else did take her position, but her new coworkers have the same problem from what I have been told.</p>
<p>I agree with all of these answers. In this case, both parties were at fault, but it was a fundamental issue on the manager’s part that caused the problem. Though not necessarily life-and-death situations, every situation that a subordinate brings up should be treated at least with enough dignity to indicate that she was paying attention. At the same time, the lifeguards could have made a point to wait until they had her undivided attention. If they had changed their attitude, the manager probably would have quickly changed hers.</p>

<p>The boom in online learning is not solely an American phenomenon, but a global one. Distance education is growing markedly in Asia, particularly in China, India, South Korea, Japan, and Singapore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1052562912442384">Gooch, 2011</xref>). Likewise, membership in the European Association of Distance Teaching Universities includes more than 200 universities and about 3 million students across Europe (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.eadtu.eu/about-eadtu/2.html">http://www.eadtu.eu/about-eadtu/2.html</ext-link>). The International Council for Open and Distance Education now includes members from more than 50 countries (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.icde.org">www.icde.org</ext-link>). According to a study conducted by the European Distance Education Network for the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the number of “traditional” higher education institutions across the world offering distance learning courses is rising rapidly (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.unesco.org">www.unesco.org</ext-link>).</p>
