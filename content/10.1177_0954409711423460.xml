<abstract>
<p>Recent research has highlighted the effect of the individual contributions of the crib, shoulder, and base resistance to the lateral behaviour of a typical railway sleeper under loading. The contribution of the shoulder ballast has been seen to provide around 30 per cent of the lateral resistance for an unloaded sleeper. The addition of extra ballast in the shoulder area provides a very limited increase in lateral sleeper resistance. It is common in areas of high lateral loading, such as switch and crossings, to provide sleeper end plates to improve the passive resistance of the track. Sleeper end plates have, however, many disadvantages, not least is the need to disturb the ballast in order to facilitate their installation. The application of polyurethane reinforcement of the ballast shoulder to rapidly form an <italic>in situ</italic> GeoComposite shoulder beam (geobeam) has many advantages over end plates, including the ability of the lateral beam to be installed directly after the track geometry has been corrected; the lateral track geometry can then be ‘captured’ at installation. The beam can also be formed while the trains are still running. In this article the application of lateral GeoComposite side beams to improve the passive resistance of the shoulders is illustrated through analytical and numerical analysis. The application of the technique to actual problem sites is also presented and the performance of the technique at the Harford bridge transition site discussed.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0954409711423460"><title>1 INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>The worldwide resurgence in railways as a principal means of mass people and freight transport has led to the need to increase axle weight, line speed, and track usage. Track maintenance requirements for ballasted track are therefore increasing, particularly on mixed lines. Track geometry correction is often needed at track assets that experience high levels of lateral loading, such as switch and crossings. Improving the lateral resistance at these types of track assets can, however, be difficult. The subject of improving the passive lateral resistance of the sleeper through <italic>in situ</italic> polyurethane reinforcement of the ballast shoulder is the subject of this article. In reference [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954409711423460">1</xref></bold>] the initial peak passive shoulder resistance, for the ballast level with the sleeper top case, was achieved with lateral displacements generally around the 0–3 mm range (some initial peaks occurred around 0.5 mm). These tests were conducted in a test tank approximating plane-strain conditions between sleeper centres. The test tank width was 650 mm and the G44 sleeper width was 290 mm and it had a height of 210 mm at the shoulder end. For a 300 mm wide ballast shoulder width the maximum lateral resistance measured was 2.15 kN and for a 600 mm wide shoulder it reached 2.317 kN; these contributed around 30 and 32 per cent of the maximum lateral resistance of the unloaded sleeper, respectively [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954409711423460">1</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954409711423460">2</xref></bold>]. The ballast friction angle was measured to be approximately 55°. It was reported that there was little benefit in extending the shoulder past 600–800 mm.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954409711423460">Figure 1</xref> shows the situation considered in a two-dimensional finite element analysis of a plane-strain wall of height <italic>H</italic> = 210 mm being pushed into ballast that has a friction angle of <italic>ϕ</italic> = 55°, a unit weight of <italic>γ</italic> = 15 kN/m<sup>3</sup>, Young's modulus <italic>E</italic> = 20 MPa (the confining pressure is extremely low), and Poisson's ratio <italic>ν</italic> = 0.4. Two wall roughness conditions were considered, i.e. perfectly smooth and perfectly rough; two different dilation angles <italic>ψ</italic> = 25° and 55° were also considered. The rough wall case was modelled by restraining the vertical degrees of freedom at the loading nodes. The program used for this analysis can be found in reference [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954409711423460">3</xref></bold>]. For the case of a smooth wall, the program uses the following form of Rankine's equation
<disp-formula id="disp-formula1-0954409711423460"><label>(1)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954409711423460-eq1.tif"/></disp-formula>
where
<disp-formula id="disp-formula2-0954409711423460"><label>(2)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954409711423460-eq2.tif"/></disp-formula>
<fig id="fig1-0954409711423460" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Finite element mesh used in the two-dimensional passive earth pressure studies</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954409711423460-fig1.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The passive earth pressure coefficients <italic>K</italic><sub>p</sub> for different wall conditions can be found from a variety of sources such as reference [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954409711423460">4</xref></bold>]. Taking an average of the results (the sleeper end will not be perfectly smooth or perfectly rough) from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954409711423460">Fig. 2</xref>(a) and (b) at around 0.5 mm (corresponding to the initial peak of the smooth Rankine case) then the force per metre width of wall is approximately 4.14 kN/m at this displacement of 0.5 mm.
<fig id="fig2-0954409711423460" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Computed passive lateral resistance per metre length for a 0.21 m high continuous wall in plane-strain conditions pushed into ballast compared to Rankine's passive limit: (a) smooth and rough wall conditions for a friction angle of 55° and dilatancy angles of 25 and 55°; and (b) effect of shoulder ballast stiffness for a friction angle of 55° and a dilatancy angle of 25° for smooth and rough wall conditions</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954409711423460-fig2.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Although the test in reference [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954409711423460">1</xref></bold>] was performed in plane-strain conditions, with respect to the 0.65 m sleeper centres, the sleeper end width of 0.29 m would generate some three-dimensional effects in the shoulder. If it is assumed that it is valid to take the ratio of the measured value (2.317 kN) to the computed value (4.14 kN/m) then this would suggest that the equivalent sleeper width for a plane-strain comparison to the test results is approximately 560 mm; increases in equivalent widths due to three-dimensional conditions were reported by [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954409711423460">2</xref></bold>]. The exact ratio will of course depend on the values of the actual ballast friction and dilation, interface roughness, etc. The important point from this paper's perspective is the 4.14 kN/m figure obtained for the equivalent passive plane-strain analysis.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954409711423460">Figure 2</xref>(b) shows the effect of increasing the ballast shoulder stiffness from <italic>E</italic> = 20 MPa to <italic>E</italic> = 50 MPa; the peak in the smooth analysis at a dilation angle of <italic>ψ</italic> = 25° shifts to the left, to around 0.2 mm, however, the overall passive resistance is similar. In looking at the test results given in reference [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954409711423460">1</xref></bold>] the sleeper movement required to obtain the peak resistance from the crib ballast is in the range 0–4 mm and for the initial base resistance, a peak is reached between 0–12 mm. The crib ballast was found to provide a resistance of around 3.8 kN; the sleeper base resistance is of course dependant on the vertical load. The value measured in [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954409711423460">1</xref></bold>], between the horizontal (<italic>H</italic>) to vertical loading (<italic>V</italic>), was in the range of <italic>H</italic>/<italic>V</italic> = 0.5 to 0.6 which is consistent with shear box tests performed at low normal contact stress by [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954409711423460">5</xref></bold>], however, higher values of this ratio were found by [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954409711423460">5</xref></bold>] when the shear box vertical contact stress increased (this has been indicated by references [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954409711423460">6</xref></bold>] and [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954409711423460">7</xref></bold>]). It would therefore appear that the sequence of peak lateral sleeper resistance for unreinforced ballasted railway track is first mobilization of the shoulder peak passive resistance, followed by the peak crib ballast, and finally the peak sleeper base resistance (the latter contribution providing the majority of the resistance). Reference [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954409711423460">2</xref></bold>] indicated that the range of peak lateral resistance values ranged from 3 to 16.8 kN (displacement at the peak ranged from 2.5 to 10 mm) depending on whether the sleepers were wooden or concrete and on the compaction state, i.e. just tamped, trafficked, etc. From reference [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954409711423460">7</xref></bold>] (Table 2) the recommended lateral resistance values per unloaded sleeper for design (<italic>F</italic><sub>p</sub> = peak resistance, <italic>W</italic><sub>p</sub> = displacement at peak resistance) are: weak track <italic>F</italic><sub>p</sub> = 5.2 kN at <italic>W</italic><sub>p</sub> = 15 mm; medium track <italic>F</italic><sub>p</sub> = 7.1 kN at <italic>W</italic><sub>p</sub> = 10 mm; strong track <italic>F</italic><sub>p</sub> = 8.1 kN at <italic>W</italic><sub>p</sub> = 5 mm. The values of <italic>F</italic><sub>p</sub> proposed by [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954409711423460">7</xref></bold>] are consistent with the total lateral forces measured by [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954409711423460">1</xref></bold>] and [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954409711423460">8</xref></bold>]. The weak, medium, strong reference is with regards to the tamped condition of the ballast.</p>
<p>Many sites on the railway network experience lateral misalignment issues. For example, in the case of assets such as switch and crossings large lateral forces can be generated [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954409711423460">9</xref></bold>] as the train vehicles traverse the diamond and accelerate towards the main line speed. In high-speed turnouts large lateral forces can be generated due to the changing curve radii through the turnout itself (as well as at the rail discontinuities) [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954409711423460">10</xref></bold>]. These lateral misalignments cause track quality issues on the main line and hence increased track maintenance. Often sleeper end plates are used to try to provide increased lateral resistance, however, they can be difficult and time-consuming to install and require possession of the track. In addition they usually disturb the ballast during insertion and may therefore not ‘capture’ the lateral track alignment at installation. Track maintenance using tampers and/or stone blowers can also be difficult due to the need to disconnect the plates from the sleepers. In addition, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954409711423460">Fig. 3</xref>(a) and (b) at the Llanwern switch and crossing near Newport, UK, they have often been found to not provide the required lateral track stability. This is because of the limited participation of the end plate. While the diamond-shaped end plate may be relatively large in surface area (and depth) it is only connected to a single sleeper and hence can only mobilize ballast in front of that plate. In order to mobilize the lateral resistance of additional end plates the lateral forces must be transmitted to those adjacent sleepers through the lateral displacement of the two rails. The level of lateral rail displacement will depend on the lateral bending stiffness of the rails and the stiffness contribution of the rail fasteners. The result is that the switch and crossing can still go out of alignment (as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954409711423460">Fig. 3</xref>(a) where end plates are attached to all sleepers in the knuckle area of the diamond yet the track is still laterally misaligned). In this paper a technique for improving the lateral passive resistance of the sleeper shoulders is presented through the use of a polyurethane reinforcement technique that can rapidly reinforce the ballast in three-dimensions [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954409711423460">11</xref></bold><bold>–</bold><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954409711423460">13</xref></bold>]. The behaviour of a typical beam is illustrated throughthree-dimensional numerical simulations and through actual site application and performance measurement using the results of track recording vehicle (TRV) traces.

<sec id="sec2-0954409711423460"><title>2 IMPROVING LATERAL SHOULDER RESISTANCE</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954409711423460">Figure 3</xref>(b) illustrates a typical level ballast shoulder area at the end of a G44 sleeper [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954409711423460">10</xref></bold>]. It is assumed that the width of the ballast shoulder is approximately <italic>W</italic> = 400 mm and the ballast depth below the sleeper is 300 mm. For the G44 sleeper this means that the ballast shoulder depth is approximately 210 + 300 = 510 mm. For the moment it is assumed that the ballasted track is located within a soft to firm soil and if one temporally assumes that the ballast behaves ‘rigidly’, then an estimate of the passive lateral force required to displace this ‘rigid’ ballast into the soil per metre length can be calculated from the following Rankine equations
<disp-formula id="disp-formula3-0954409711423460"><label>(3)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954409711423460-eq3.tif"/></disp-formula>
<disp-formula id="disp-formula4-0954409711423460"><label>(4)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954409711423460-eq4.tif"/></disp-formula>
</p>
<p>An example on how these equations can be used to estimate the increase in passive resistance is given as follows: if it is assumed that the loading of the soil is instantaneous (train loading) then a total stress analysis can be used for the clay, and one can use the undrained shear strength parameters <italic>C</italic><sub>u</sub> and <italic>ϕ</italic><sub>u</sub>; various values of <italic>C</italic><sub>u</sub> for different railway track stiffness values can be obtained from reference [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954409711423460">14</xref></bold>]. If it is assumed that the undrained shear strength of the soil is approximately <italic>c</italic> = <italic>C</italic><sub>u</sub> = 50 kPa (<italic>ϕ</italic><sub>u</sub> = 0), <italic>H</italic> = 510 mm, and let <italic>γ</italic> = 15 kN/m<sup>3</sup> then <italic>P</italic><sub>p</sub> = 52.95 kN/m for a smooth wall and <italic>P</italic><sub>p</sub> = 74.07 kN/m for a rough wall. The value of <italic>γ</italic> has been set to allow a direct comparison to the ballast-only analysis. The effect of reinforcing the ballast shoulder can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954409711423460">Fig. 4</xref> where a similar mesh to that shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954409711423460">Fig. 1</xref> is used to estimate this particular soil's passive resistance, in this case for a 510 mm deep wall. It is assumed that thesoil has a Young's modulus of <italic>E</italic><sub>u</sub> = 20 MPa (<italic>E</italic><sub>u</sub>/<italic>C</italic><sub>u</sub> = 400). The finite element analysis agrees well for the smooth wall case and is slightly lower in the rough case when compared to equations (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula3-0954409711423460">3</xref>) and (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula4-0954409711423460">4</xref>). The displacement indicates, for this particular Young's modulus, that the plain-strain wall would reach its peak resistance around 6 mm (a similar level to that reported by [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954409711423460">2</xref></bold>] for the peak lateral sleeper resistance). In addition the rigid block itself would provide additional resistance due to sliding at it base, which can be estimated using
<disp-formula id="disp-formula5-0954409711423460"><label>(5)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954409711423460-eq5.tif"/></disp-formula>
where α is the coefficient of friction between the shoulder ballast base and the soil. If <italic>α</italic> = 1, <italic>W</italic> = 400 mm, <italic>H</italic> = 510 mm, and <italic>γ</italic> = 15 kN/m<sup>3</sup> then <italic>P</italic><sub>b</sub> = 3.06 kN/m. For this plane-strain example, the combined values for the block and soil resistance are therefore <italic>P</italic><sub>p</sub> = 56.01 kN/m and <italic>P</italic><sub>p</sub> = 77.13 kN/m for the smooth and rough walls, respectively. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954409711423460">Figure 3</xref>(b) illustrates the mechanisms involved in the resistance enhancement. For deep shoulder beams the line of action of the sleeper force would not be at the <italic>H</italic>/3 point (this could be achieved by adding material above the sleeper top level in the soil area). However, shoulder beam overturning would be resisted by the rotational stiffness/strength of the reinforced beam (the beam is continuous whereas the lateral sleeper loading is not) and by the shoulder beam width. Therefore, modifying the beam’s dimensions and stiffness, results in a change to the equivalent length of the reinforced beam participation perloaded sleeper (i.e. from plane-strain to three-dimensional conditions). A mechanism that can transform the unreinforced ballast into a reinforced ballast beam (geobeam) without disturbing the lateral or vertical track alignment is now discussed.

<sec id="sec3-0954409711423460"><title>3 THREE-DIMENSIONAL POLYURETHANE SHOULDER REINFORCEMENT (GEOBEAM)</title>
<p><italic>In situ</italic> polyurethane application rapidly reinforces and stabilizes the railway ballast shoulder to form a continuous resilient geobeam [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954409711423460">15</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954409711423460">16</xref></bold>]. Typically, the polymer used to treat the ballast is a rapidly reacting urethane-crosslinked system, which is supplied as two components. These two components are mixed <italic>in situ</italic> through mixing equipment and poured on thetrack (i.e. it is not sprayed or injected). The rheology of the cross-linked polymer can be modified for each track treatment; this allows its engineering properties to be predefined for the particular track application. The engineering properties of the polymer include, stiffness, strength, damping ratio, viscosity, cure rates, etc. Tensile strains at break within the polymer can exceed 100 per cent and hence the polymer exhibits a high degree of ductility [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954409711423460">13</xref></bold>]. When applied to ballast, the polymer uses the void structure within the ballast to penetrate down to the preset depth. During this process the polymer cures to form reinforcing elements in all directions. These reinforcing elements are all linked together to form the three-dimensional GeoComposite. Typically, the polymer cures within 10 s, with around 50 per cent ofits stiffness formed within minutes and around 90per cent of its stiffness formed within an hour. The GeoComposite has high levels of compression, shear, and tensile strength, which enables the geobeam to transfer lateral track stresses over a wider area than the sleeper end alone. The built-in resiliency of the polymer geobeam ensures good longevity from the treatment [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954409711423460">13</xref></bold>]. The ability to modify the properties of the polymer and control the level of polymer loading and its distribution enables a wide range of properties to be developed. The visco-elastic polymer satisfies therequirements of the Environment Agency and can therefore be used in areas where water ingress occurs. In many cases application of the polymer does not require traffic to be stopped and if applied directly after a geometry correction, it can ‘capture’ the lateral track geometry [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954409711423460">16</xref></bold>]. Hysteresis in the stress–strain response of the GeoComposite is very good and a resilient state within the GeoComposite can be rapidly formed [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954409711423460">13</xref></bold>]. Since the polymer only takes up around 26 per cent of the void structure the GeoComposite is still highly permeable. Lower levels of polymer loading would of course reduce the amount of voidage taken up.</p>

The analysis presented here uses the three-dimensional finite element code SART3D [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954409711423460">18</xref></bold>]. In reference [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954409711423460">17</xref></bold>] a very highly refined mesh was used to simulate the behaviour of a single sleeper to various frictional interfaces and loading conditions. In this article the general influence of the reinforced shoulder beam is of interest and therefore the mesh reflects the general unloaded sleeper lateral behaviour over distance (i.e. more than one sleeper width) rather than concentrating on a highly refined single sleeper analysis. As with the two-dimensional analysis presented in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec1-0954409711423460">section 1</xref>, what is considered important in this article is to highlight the mechanisms involved in the overall enhancement provided by the polyurethane reinforcement (this is because the exact level of enhancement will be site-specific). Force control [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954409711423460">3</xref></bold>] is used to aid implementation and analysis, and hence the lateral resistance increase is modelled prior to the peak resistance only. As with the two-dimensional analysis a visco-plastic algorithm incorporating a Mohr–Coulomb failure criterion is used [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954409711423460">3</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954409711423460">18</xref></bold>]. The vertical sleeper load is set to zero so as to simulate a conventional on-site lateral sleeper pull-out test [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954409711423460">8</xref></bold>]. The properties of the ballastand clay are the same as those used in the two-dimensional study. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954409711423460">Figure 5</xref>(a) to (c) shows the finite element mesh used in the undeformed study and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954409711423460">Fig. 5</xref>(b) that in the deformed study. While the rails are shown in this figure it should be noted that in the actual calculations their stiffness properties are set to zero. Load is only applied to the central sleeper at the rail connection point and the interface layer directly beneath the sleepers is set at <italic>δ</italic> = 0.44 × 55°<sup> </sup>= 24° [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0954409711423460">19</xref></bold>]. The analysis is stopped when the lateral load <italic>P</italic> = 15 kN in the unreinforced shoulder ballast case and <italic>P</italic> = 60 kN in the reinforced ballast shoulder case due to the force loading condition [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954409711423460">17</xref></bold>] giving rise to a high number of plasticity iterations (especially in the unreinforced analysis). The GeoComposite modelled in this particular analysis has a stiffness of 370 MPa and an unconfined compression strength of 3 MPa[<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954409711423460">13</xref></bold>].

<p>The first stage of the analysis is to compare the unreinforced three-dimensional mesh results to those of a single sleeper test, i.e. a single lateral sleeper pull-out test. There are many different experimental results that can be used for this purpose, each giving their own unique load versus displacement graph. This is because the experimental results relate to different site conditions, sleepers (weight and shape), ballast compaction, soil properties, interface values, etc. However, to allow a comparison to be made references [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954409711423460">2</xref></bold>], [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954409711423460">7</xref></bold>], and [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954409711423460">8</xref></bold>] are used (the data is simply scaled and plotted from the relevant graphs). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954409711423460">Figure 5</xref>(c) shows the computed improvement in the sleeper response by plotting the lateral force against the lateral displacement. The improvement is seen by divergence of the two computed unreinforced/reinforced graphs, which is similar to the improvement indicated by the plane-strain analysis. In the unreinforced analysis the three comparison references ([<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954409711423460">2</xref></bold>], [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954409711423460">7</xref></bold>], and [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954409711423460">8</xref></bold>]) are plotted alongside the computed unreinforced analysis. The resistance against beam overturning is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954409711423460">Fig 5</xref>(b). In this figure the deformed mesh (displacement multiplier × 100) is plotted against the undeformed mesh (shown in red); the effect of the geobeam is to engage passive resistance over several sleeper widths and provide torsional resistance to reduce beam over turning.</p>
<p>The higher the soil's cohesive strength, the greater the level of passive lateral resistance provided to the sleeper. The actual values of the soil's strength parameters (cohesive and/or frictional) will depend on each track location, plasticity index, the presenceof the water table, the value of the unit weight, and so on. In many cases an unsaturated soil will be present suggesting that soil suction is generated. However, the soil suction will give an apparent strength to the soil due to the development of a negative water pressure [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0954409711423460">20</xref></bold>]. This apparent strength of the soil will decrease with the increase in the degree of saturation. When the soil is fully saturated (undrained condition) no suction is observed. There are also many cases when the cess shoulder width will be greater than 600 mm, for example, at switch and crossings, and hence an additional passive resistance will be provided by engaging a greater ballast area. However, the example analysis presented in this article illustrates that allowing stresses to be transferred through the ballast matrix into the surrounding soil and/or ballast (through a deepened reinforced shoulder geobeam) results in a significant increase in the passive component of the sleeper lateral resistance. The following section describes the practical application of GeoComposite research to curves and switch and crossings on railway tracks. It is difficult to measure the actual lateral resistance enhancement for track while in service, especially at switch and crossings, due to operational reasons (availability, equipment requirements, cost of track possession for the lateral pull tests, etc.). However, since the retention of the lateral track geometry is the primary objective of the track reinforcement, then interrogation of the TRV trace will give a good indication as to the performance of the treatment at a specific site. For the first site (bridges 1640, 1640A, and 1644 at Harford) this data was readily available for the maintenance year 2003–2004 and hence it is used to demonstrate the performance of the technique. For the second site (Knighton Junction) this data was not readily available and hence this example is used to show the technique's applicability to complex track asset reinforcement; another advantage of using geobeams over end plates is that the geobeams can be used for any sleeper type and shape. In addition the shoulder ballast has not been subjected to constant tamping and particulate degradation (attrition) as is the case for the ballast under the sleeper and therefore, in many cases, the ballast would not have to be renewed prior to installation in order for the polymer to penetrate. Simply modifying the catalyst level in the polyol component of the polymer will allow different penetration depths to be achieved and hence different beam depths (i.e. different increases in the passive enhancement).</p>

<sec id="sec6-0954409711423460"><title>5.1 Bridges 1640, 1640A, and 1644 at Harford, UK</title>
<p>In October 2003 the reinforcement technique was used to help retain the lateral track geometry at bridges 1640, 1640A, and 1644 at Harford [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954409711423460">16</xref></bold>]. The bridges form part of the Thetford Line in the UK and are of directly fastened timber deck construction, situated on a curve. The track is built over a weak embankment which is founded on peat with large pockets of ash near the surface. In October 2003 the shoulder ballast was reinforced using the polyurethane technique at a similar strength and stiffness to that discussed in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec4-0954409711423460">section 4</xref> for beam dimensions of 400 mm width by 400 mm depth. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954409711423460">Figure 6</xref>(a) to (c) shows the application of the polymer at bridge 1644. The pump, application lines, and the trailer carrying the polymer components can be seen. The difference between this track and the analysis presented in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec4-0954409711423460">section 4</xref> is the embankment slope, which reduces the available passive resistance due to the reduction in the geometry and weight of the shear plane surface available (i.e. its length and overburden pressure). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954409711423460">Figure 6</xref>(b) shows the completed lateral geobeam for one cess shoulder on the outside part of the curve. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954409711423460">Figure 6</xref>(c) shows the results of the TRV traces over the treated section both pre-installation and post-installation. Prior to installation, movement of the lateral alignment can be seen as divergence in the TRV traces over the measured section (the sleepers are experiencing plastic lateral movements which in time leads to lateral misalignments). The post-installation graph shows that the TRV traces are virtually on top of each other showing that the lateral alignment is now being held.

<sec id="sec7-0954409711423460"><title>5.2 Knighton Junction</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954409711423460">Figure 7</xref> shows another example of a typical geobeam installation, in this case at Knighton Junction, UK. This multiple junction is of a ladder type comprising six ends situated on an embankment; each end has a length of approximately 16.3 m. This example is included in this paper to highlight the applicability of the technique at complex track assets such as turnouts and switch and crossings. The subgrade is brown clay, sand and gravel, and soft to stiff brown slightly gravely clay/silt. At this particular site the ballast shoulder width extended beyond 600 mm and hence much of the additional passive resistance after shoulder reinforcement would take place within this additional width of the shoulder ballast. As with the treatment of the bridges at Harford, the dimensions of the beam chosen at this site were a 400 mm width and a 400 mm depth. The treatment took place in January 2007 and to the authors knowledge track performance at each of the treated ends has been very good. Feedback from track engineers has often indicated that at many sites geobeam dimensions of 400 × 400 mm has often been found to provide a sufficient improvement in the track geometry retention.
<fig id="fig7-0954409711423460" position="float"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption><p>Typical application of the polyurethane reinforcement to the shoulder ballast at switch and crossings, here at Knighton Junction, UK: (a) switch tips of Points 780A looking towards Market Harborough, UK; (b) formation of the geobeam close to the heel blocks; and (c) continuation of the geobeam from the heel blocks past the switch tips</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954409711423460-fig7.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The two presented examples demonstrate the applicability of the reinforcement technique to rapidly improve the shoulder passive resistance to lateral loading. If applied directly after geometry correction, the technique has the capacity to ‘capture’ the lateral track geometry without disturbing the ballast and hence altering the existing vertical and lateral track geometry. In addition all maintenance procedures, such as tamping and stone blowing, can still be used without disturbing the geobeam. Since the geometry of the geobeam can be varied and the amount (and properties) of the polymer varied, a large range of possible solutions can be applied at any particular site depending on the ground conditions and level of lateral loading applied. The technique therefore allows a design-based approach to be developed for lateral passive resistance improvement by using equations (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula3-0954409711423460">3</xref>) and (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula4-0954409711423460">4</xref>) as initial estimates of the improvement possible at a particular site.</p>

<sec id="sec8-0954409711423460"><title>6 CONCLUDING REMARKS</title>
<p>In this paper the application of a three-dimensional <italic>in situ</italic> polyurethane reinforcing technique to rapidly improve the lateral passive resistance of railway track was presented. Through both two-dimensional analytical and displacement-controlled finite element approaches, the improvement in the passive resistance of the railway track was shown when a geobeam was created, i.e. by extending the depth of the equivalent wall height in the ballast shoulder. The results of recent experimental measurements of lateral behaviour were discussed in relation to the finite element analysis. Three-dimensional finite element analysis of the track using force control was also presented to show how the formed polymer/ballast geobeam behaves during lateral loading. The results of the analysis were compared to the published results of lateral loading for unloaded sleepers in order to assess the influence of the formed geobeam. Application of the polyurethane research was shown through the treatment of two typical lateral loading problems in the field. In the first of these examples, TRV data confirmed that application of the reinforcement was retaining the lateral alignment. In the second example, application of the technique was used to show how the technique can be used to increase the passive lateral resistance at complex track assets such as switch and crossings. The reinforcement can be applied after the track geometry (both vertical and lateral) has been correctly set without disturbing the track; this is especially beneficial to the track engineer when possession times are short. This also means that future correction of the track geometry can still take place without disturbing the ballast; the track panel can be slewed back into place and chippings used (reinforced if necessary) to fill thegap between the sleeper end and the reinforced beam. Since many installation factors can be varied, such as the beam's dimensions (width, depth, and length), the amount of polymer applied, and the properties of the polymer (i.e. its rheology), a design-based approach to providing increases in passive resistance can be adopted which is particularly appealing to the track design and maintenance engineer.</p>
