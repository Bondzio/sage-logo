<p>This article explores the desegregation of Levittown, Pennsylvania, in the 1950s. Following World War II, black Philadelphians found themselves locked in the heart of the city, with bad housing and few job opportunities. Levittown offered a place for African Americans to secure better homes near growing industrial areas, but William Levitt refused to sell to them. African Americans and their white allies mounted political and legal campaigns to force the community to admit black residents. The Myers family finally broke the color barrier in 1957 but faced weeks of protests until state authorities squelched local resistance. The Myerses got to keep their home, but their victory did little to break down Levittown’s barriers. Building on new scholarship about suburban history and the northern black rights movement, this article analyzes the meaning of suburbs to African Americans, conflicting ideas white and black residents had about rights, and the limited ability of liberal approaches to address racial discrimination.</p>

<p>“I have a right to live in Levittown or in any other section of our country so long as I am a good citizen,” Bill Myers told reporters in his Levittown home in late August 1957. “We are church-going, respectable people. We just want a nice neighborhood in which to raise our family and enjoy life,” he added. “We will be good neighbors and I know, or at least hope, that those around us will be the same.” The reporters, especially the ones from Philadelphia’s largest black newspaper, the <italic>Tribune</italic>, must have listened to that last sentence with raised eyebrows. Outside the front door, they could hear a mob of some three hundred people milling around, muttering racial epithets, and threatening violence. Over the course of the last hot weeks of August, the Myers family had a window shattered by stones, they and their supporters faced threats and vandalism, and local and state police had to come in to quell the riotous atmosphere. Levittown was indeed, in the words of a <italic>Tribune</italic> headline, “A Disgrace to America.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0096144212445452">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>The August riots in Levittown came at the end of a long campaign to open this suburban community to African Americans. That campaign, as much as the riots themselves, reveals much about race relations, black politics, and the meaning of democracy in mid-twentieth-century America. In telling the history of the Levittown riots and, just as importantly, the history that led to them, this article explores black suburbanization as a long-term movement with political, legal, and grassroots components. The Myers family may have expressed a seemingly simple desire to “raise our family and enjoy life,” but their presence in Levittown was a culmination of a movement that included protests to governors and presidents, a legal campaign led by Thurgood Marshall, and efforts by civil rights, religious, and labor groups to end segregationist practices. This article thus explores the strength, as well as the ambivalence, a “pioneer” family displayed in pushing for desegregation as part of a campaign that saw African Americans tie together constitutional, political, workplace, and moral rights to claim that democratic equality meant they must have access to any home that they could afford. At the same time, the piecemeal, individualistic, approach that liberals employed in this case shows that activists could achieve some victories but such gains were inadequate to the larger needs of black Americans. Ultimately, Levittown became a critical scene in the postwar contest over the meaning of democracy where African Americans defined equal rights as the freedom to live where they pleased and their opponents argued they had the right to choose the people with whom they would live.</p>
<p>This Levittown story builds on several bodies of scholarship that have led historians to rethink their approach to twentieth-century African American history. One such body, typified by Thomas Sugrue’s <italic>Sweet Land of Liberty</italic>, Matthew Countryman’s <italic>Up South</italic>, and Kevin Boyle’s <italic>Arc of Justice</italic>, has emphasized the national nature of America’s “race problem.” Their arguments have pushed scholars away from a declension narrative that begins with Martin Luther King, Jr. ascendant in the South and ends with the rise of black power and riots in the North. The northern movement played out in local communities as activists campaigned to desegregate suburbs like Levittown and pioneers like the Myerses helped lead the way. This article also builds on the new suburban history, which in part has emphasized the diversity of suburban communities and the way they shaped and were shaped by race relations. Rather than a white monolith, as Andrew Wiese has shown, the suburbs have always had an African American presence, and I offer Levittown as a case study of how that presence was secured by a vigorous, multifaceted campaign that was contested by white residents, business interests, and public officials. Finally, this story builds on and extends a number of histories of the desegregation of Levittown, many of which have offered narrative accounts that focus on the riot itself. Sugrue’s analytical treatment in <italic>Sweet Land of Liberty</italic>, which places events in Levittown in the context of federal policy, racial identity, and the postwar psychology of intergroup relations, stands as a notable exception to this literature. This article, in contrast, emphasizes the campaign that led to Levittown’s desegregation, the nature of black politics, and the contested meaning of democracy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0096144212445452">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>To be sure, the Levittown riots of 1957 offer an explosive example of the racial tensions that roiled the urban North in the decades after World War II. As such they have begun to earn deserved attention from journalists and scholars. But treating the riots as an explosive moment, I argue, minimizes the larger story of black activism that led people like the Myerses to believe Levittown was where they had to take a stand. The politics and activism of Bill and Daisy Myers and the supporters who backed them shaped what happened in Levittown, and that story of black politics is too often lost in accounts of the riots. Levittown certainly put a moment of raw conflict on display, but this article argues that by drawing on a broader perspective we can interrogate the meaning of suburbs to black Americans, contested ideas about rights, and the efficacy of the liberal approach to racial discrimination in postwar American society.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0096144212445452">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Housing had always presented major difficulties to Philadelphia’s black population, but World War II and the reconversion to peacetime exacerbated the situation. The city as a whole found itself in a massive housing crisis after the war, with little public or private shelter available. The tens of thousands of African Americans who had come to the city to take factory jobs during the 1940s (the city’s black population grew from 250,000 to 375,000 between 1940 and 1950) faced the worst problems as discrimination from real estate interests, public officials, and neighborhood residents forced them into the city’s oldest, most run-down buildings. Studies showed 35 percent of black Philadelphians lived in homes that either were dilapidated or lacked a private bath and that the rate of overcrowding in black districts in North, South, and West Philadelphia stood at 10 percent, three times the city average. This concentration came in part from the burgeoning black numbers in some mixed tracts, which dwarfed the number of white residents, and in part from whites leaving for the suburbs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0096144212445452">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>While the housing stock within Philadelphia’s city limits was largely stagnant, private builders worked to satisfy the suburbanizing white market. These companies, led by William Levitt, built 140,000 homes in the metropolitan area between 1945 and 1955. Three-quarters of their homes went up in suburban Bucks, Montgomery, and Delaware Counties, with almost all of the rest in northeastern Philadelphia, which was within the city limits but was so far removed from downtown that it was suburban in character, if not in name.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0096144212445452">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>New residents of these communities sought the open spaces, new schools, and modern amenities that the suburbs offered, but race often motivated their move as much as anything. Philadelphia’s Commission on Race and Housing reported that homeowners regularly said, “I don’t know where we’ll go, but we’re going” and “I don’t mind a Negro down the street, but not next door.” Around the region, Bucks County saw its white population rise by nearly 40,000 people between 1940 and 1950, but its black population climbed by only 500 residents. Delaware County gained over 100,000 people, only 7,000 of whom were black. And of Montgomery County’s 60,000 new residents, only 700 were African American.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0096144212445452">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Once in the suburbs, residents relied on a variety of tactics to maintain the racial homogeneity of their new neighborhoods. Their actions showed how the racism of ordinary whites meshed with economic and legal structures to prevent African Americans from gaining access to new homes. Many communities used restrictive covenants to keep blacks out. This method became so prominent that the Philadelphia Housing Association called a conference where participants “strongly condemned” the burgeoning practice. Some neighborhoods pressured local bankers not to loan money to blacks and urged real estate agents not to sell to them. One banker said his firm “never financed a sale which would break a block.” Doing so, he claimed, would antagonize white patrons and thus be bad for business (an argument that Beryl Satter, in her study of Chicago, has shown to be untrue: blockbusting practices could in fact be highly profitable to banks that charged African Americans exorbitant interest rates and “flipped” houses multiple times). In addition, a 1953 NAACP survey found that not one of sixty-two local real estate agencies sold or rented to African Americans. Other communities put together housing associations and passed zoning laws to “protect their property values” and “police their neighborhoods.” Builders, led by William Levitt, accepted this discrimination, exacerbating the problem and giving it a stamp of corporate approval. “Most whites prefer not to live in mixed communities,” Levitt once said. “The responsibility [for this] is society’s. . . . It is not reasonable to expect that any one builder could or should undertake to absorb the entire risk and burden of conducting such a vast social experiment.” Everyone understood the racial implications of the physical construction of the metropolitan area, leading the Society of Friends to worry that a “White Christian belt” was encircling the city.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0096144212445452">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Despite all the problems, the news about black housing was not entirely bad. Black Philadelphians had the highest home ownership rate in the country, registering at nearly 30 percent in 1950. In part this reflected the city’s housing market in general, dominated by row houses and single-family homes, rather than the high-rise apartment complexes of other cities. The high black home ownership rate also reflected the fact that in the mid- to late 1940s the city still held several hundred thousand good-paying industrial jobs that employed thousands of African Americans. Also, the growth of white suburbs boosted black homeownership rates, as whites moving out of their neighborhoods usually found African Americans to be their largest pool of prospective buyers. Finally, there were a few mixed suburbs, Concord Park for example, that offered a ray of hope. But overall, African Americans found a discriminatory housing market that locked them into the worst homes located at Philadelphia’s core.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0096144212445452">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Reconversion of the city’s industrial base at the end of World War II and the subsequent suburbanization of jobs compounded black Philadelphians’ problems. At war’s end Baldwin Locomotive, Midvale Steel, the Frankford Arsenal, and other businesses cut thousands of jobs. The end of federal money only added to the anxious feelings engendered by the continued slide of textiles and other industries that were moving their operations to avoid higher labor costs. While some of the lost jobs headed south, many moved to the suburbs. From 1919 to 1939 Philadelphia held some 60 to 65 percent of the metropolitan area’s manufacturing jobs, but that number fell to 50 percent in 1943 and below 40 percent by 1980. The city’s northeast and Montgomery and Bucks counties picked up the bulk of this work as SKF, General Electric, Budd, and other companies built new factories. With jobs in the city growing scarce, Philadelphians’ salaries barely kept pace with inflation, while suburbanites in Bucks County and Montgomery County saw their pay rise by 46 and 26 percent, respectively, over the next couple decades.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0096144212445452">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Reconversion and the dispersal of jobs had a particularly devastating effect on African Americans who could not follow their employers to the suburbs. In the first weeks after V-J Day, companies such as Sun Ship, the Pennsylvania Railroad, and the Philadelphia Transportation Company laid off some fifteen thousand black employees. Some African Americans did hold onto their factory work, especially in metals, into the early 1950s, but as the government reduced its orders, companies laid off their workers, and blacks were the first to go. One study estimated that the number of manufacturing jobs in largely black North Philadelphia fell by as much as fifty thousand between 1928 and 1972. The unemployment rate in that district reached 37 percent by 1956, and another 42 percent claimed to be working only irregularly.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0096144212445452">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>As jobs and housing suburbanized, the problems that process created for African Americans became a vicious circle. African Americans could not live in most of the suburbs where companies were relocating, while at the same time jobs were drying up in Philadelphia, and they soon found their incomes stagnant or gone. Without steady employment, blacks found that they could afford to live only in public housing or the most run-down private housing in the inner city, which concentrated them even more in neighborhoods where there were no jobs to be found, and the cycle started all over again. Housing and employment, then, were mutually reinforcing problems that limited opportunities for the city’s African Americans.</p>
<p>Black Philadelphians of course understood the intertwined nature of the housing and workplace problems confronting them and that is what made Levittown so crucial. Since the mid-1940s, the <italic>Tribune</italic> had been warning Philadelphians that “[t]he housing situation can and will destroy many of the things for which Americans fought and died.” George Schermer, executive director of Philadelphia’s Commission on Human Relations, made the point more specific. “The citadel of segregation in the next 10 to 20 years will be in Northern cities,” he said. One of the largest problems in his view was the suburbs which “produc[ed] an intensified pattern of racial segregation.” The largest of these suburban communities was Levittown, and it was built expressly, if not exclusively, to house workers at U.S. Steel’s new Fairless plant about twenty miles northeast of Philadelphia. The distance meant that if African Americans could not live in the area, then they could not work at the factory, and in fact some forty men turned down jobs at the mill for that reason. Levittown’s size and the economic activity the new steel plant was expected to generate made the suburb, in the words of one NAACP report, a “frontier for today’s democracy.” The problems that Levittown posed typified the issues confronting African Americans throughout the region, and the NAACP, wrote Roy Wilkins, had to make sure there would be “no discriminatory treatment of [African Americans] in the matter of housing.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0096144212445452">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Black activists knew it would be difficult to desegregate Levittown, Pennsylvania. William Levitt, the head of Levitt and Sons, Inc., had publicly vowed that his construction company would not sell homes to African Americans and had followed through on that pledge in his first community on Long Island. There, he ignored protests from groups such as the NAACP and the Civil Rights Congress and created a whites-only community. Levitt’s company turned away black veterans with good credit, forcibly removed the NAACP’s Herbert Hill from its office when he came to investigate, and even refused to renew the leases of two white families who invited black children to play with their kids. A clause in early leases read, “The tenant agrees not to permit the premises to be used by any person other than members of the Caucasian race,” but the Supreme Court in its 1948 <italic>Shelley v. Kraemer</italic> decision declared such covenants “unenforceable as law and contrary to public policy.” Levitt’s response was to remove the clause but maintain his segregationist restrictions. Levittown was widely perceived as so racist that in his columns Langston Hughes compared it to the Deep South and argued that he would “rather be treated like a dog than like a Negro” because at least dogs could live in Levittown.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0096144212445452">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>To black activists, one of Levitt’s greatest weaknesses lay in his dependence on federal funds. In an era when African Americans were putting greater pressure on the federal government to ensure equality before the law, desegregationists were appalled that mortgages on many Levittown homes had Federal Housing Administration (FHA) backing. The federal government, Thurgood Marshall, Walter White, and others from the NAACP and other organizations argued, was using tax money drawn from all citizens to prop up segregation. This amounted, in their view, to “federal aid and assistance for an unconstitutional purpose.” FHA administrators responded that they had no authority to challenge racial discrimination and in fact could not extend mortgage insurance to projects “where there are characteristics which tend to produce undesirable community effects or threaten to influence adversely the value of neighborhood properties.” “There is no doubt,” an FHA official concluded, “that in most cases the entrance of a negro into a white section will adversely effect [sic] values.” An incensed Marshall demanded that the FHA, which since its creation in 1934 had based its determination of the “stability” of communities in part on their racial makeup, change its stance, especially in light of <italic>Shelley</italic>, and revise its manual if necessary to conform to the law of the land. The FHA, he wrote, should no longer “give aid and comfort to those in this country who are determined to continue and expand racial segregation in public as well as in private housing.” Such arguments did little to change Levittown, New York—as late as 1957 the community had only thirteen black households—but they did foreshadow the Pennsylvania campaign to come. In the Bucks County community, black activists would make even greater demands for equal treatment, and would do so with grassroots, political, and legal campaigns.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0096144212445452">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Shortly after Levitt announced in 1951 that he would build a segregated community in Pennsylvania, the Philadelphia NAACP led an array of groups in a grassroots campaign that demanded the abolition of segregation in the new Levittown. The NAACP held a series of meetings to protest Levitt’s policies that would force the Philadelphia area to “become divided into little islands of prejudice and distrust [rather than a] democratic community carrying on proudly in the American tradition.” Levittown, the association asserted, should represent the “American Dream—for all Americans.” It then formed a committee to take up what it called “one of the Branch’s most important pieces of social action,” stopping the construction of a “discriminatory housing project.” The association advocated sending a resolution to local governments to protest Levittown’s discrimination, pressuring the state legislature to prohibit discrimination by a private builder, mobilizing local churches and civic organizations to demand equality, and working with newspapers to publicly excoriate Levitt’s plans. It also began laying the groundwork for a legal challenge based on the due process and equal protection clauses of the Constitution. The black press, led by the <italic>Tribune</italic>, joined the campaign, running a series of editorials challenging Levitt to abandon his policy that “contradicts both the religious and democratic heritages of the American people.” “Segregation breeds contempt for the segregated, and hatred for the segregator,” the paper continued. “It destroys the unity of the American people.” Levitt might call his suburb “the most perfectly planned community in America,” the editors wrote another time, but it was in fact “just the opposite.” “Any community which is deliberately planned to discriminate against any religious or racial group of Americans is not consistent with Democratic principles. . . . Levittown,” they concluded, “breeds hate.” Television and radio shows featuring racial issues reminded their audiences that “discrimination in housing [was] a direct violation of civil liberties” and that Levittown represented “a monster of discrimination which could have harmful and far reaching effects on the great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.” Real estate groups held meetings to discuss “Discrimination in Housing in Philadelphia” and repeatedly challenged the FHA, President Truman, and President Eisenhower to halt federal funding of segregated communities. And religious groups, including the African Methodist Episcopal church and the Quakers, created organizations such as the Committee on Democracy in Housing to protest the “immoral and Un-American” suburb. Many people concerned about Levittown saw it as part of a bigger picture. In a worldwide propaganda war with the Soviet Union, the United States should be ashamed of this “poor example of the American way of life,” wrote one man. “In light of world conflict,” added another, “we need our people together in every phase of American life.” The grassroots portion of the campaign, then, was built on local organizations that appealed to black Philadelphians on a broad basis through newspaper articles, television and radio shows, and mass meetings. It was a community-wide effort that touched on a number of themes in postwar life: the meaning of democracy, the nation’s religious heritage, America’s image in the cold war.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0096144212445452">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>With pressure mounting in the black community, activists developed a multipronged strategy that exemplified the mid-twentieth-century liberal, piecemeal approach to civil rights that relied on quiet meetings with corporate and public officials to solve individual problems. In particular, they pushed William Levitt, U.S. Steel, and public officials to eliminate segregation in Levittown. The national NAACP, its efforts largely led by attorney Constance Baker Motley, arranged a meeting with Levitt, H. Charles Ford of the steelworkers union, Drayton Bryant of the Philadelphia Housing Authority, and Reginald Johnson of the Urban League. Levitt opened the meeting by claiming that he “did not want an all-white policy in his developments, but that same was demanded by the white public which he served.” He was willing to listen to counterarguments though (a good sign in Motley’s view since he had refused to discuss his policy on Long Island), and after two hours of discussion he backed down from his adamant stand. He would not, he said, “take a chance on admitting Negroes and then not be able to sell his houses,” but he might allow the Fellowship Commission, an interracial group in Philadelphia, to buy one thousand or fifteen hundred homes and rent them on an interracial basis. He also suggested that he might be willing to build a small interracial community elsewhere if it could be proved that he would suffer no financial loss. But that was as far as he would go. Levitt did not budge much from his initial position, but Motley was heartened by the fact that he appeared to be “not interested in building communities as such, but in making money.” Sheer capitalist enterprise, she seemed to realize, could at times be more race blind than planned communities. Motley left the meeting believing that she had made some headway and hoping that more discussions with Levitt would bring greater results.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0096144212445452">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>The NAACP next targeted U.S. Steel, cautiously optimistic that the company, which proudly trumpeted itself as the largest employer of African Americans in the United States, would oppose Levittown’s segregation. Motley and Walter White of the national NAACP, Charles Shorter of the Philadelphia branch, and representatives from the Urban League and the American Friends Service Committee met with company officials who “welcomed” the discussion about housing in Bucks County. At first they appeared to support fair employment practices and recognize the connection between jobs and fair housing. But things soured when White and Shorter asked for specifics about African American employment. Nationwide the company employed over 32,000 African Americans, but of the 3,000 workers at the Fairless plant, only 70 were black. These men had to commute in from either Trenton or Philadelphia, while many others had turned down the work because it was inaccessible. Although the steel executives appeared somewhat sympathetic to the NAACP’s case, they had little response when pressed on the demographics of Fairless Village, a new 6,000-home housing project for plant workers that received some $15 million in funding from the company. It had zero black residents. The meeting left the <italic>Chicago Defender</italic> to wonder “Is All Fair at Fairless?” and accuse the company of not recognizing that “it is the key to the installation of fully democratic practices in [its] community.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0096144212445452">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>NAACP officials and their allies also tried to pressure public officials, starting with President Eisenhower. In doing so, they demonstrated the belief that many African Americans held in the 1950s that the government, when pressed, would support nondiscriminatory policies. To Eisenhower, NAACP officials argued that Bucks County offered a “unique opportunity to establish unsegregated patterns of living and employment.” “Indeed,” they continued, explicitly tying housing and jobs together, “unless the residential racial pattern is biracial, there is no hope of establishing fair employment practices in the surrounding industries.” Moreover, they reminded the president that the FHA had committed some $81 million to mortgages in the community and that he had vowed that federal funds “would not be used to support or extend racial segregation and discrimination.” “We are appealing to you,” the NAACP concluded, “to open on an unsegregated pattern this vast program of government assisted housing in the Bucks county area. Such action would not only be in accord with the policy announced by your Administration, but it will also make a major contribution towards facilitating democratic employment patterns in industries now being created at Bucks County.” In response to their arguments, President Eisenhower agreed to put Maxwell Rabb, his aide in charge of minority affairs, on the case. But several months later, in May 1954, there had still been no movement on Levittown, and Walter White was left to ask Vice President Richard Nixon for help. That appeal went nowhere.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0096144212445452">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>Black activists also pushed Pennsylvania Governor John Fine and local FHA and VA (Veterans Administration) officials for help. “We ask the state of Pennsylvania . . . to insure that Levitt does not adhere to . . . un-American practices,” wrote Walter White. “We respectfully request you as governor . . . to take appropriate action to insure that there shall be no discrimination or segregation with respect to selection of tenants or purchasers.” A clergyman from the AME church added that discrimination in Levittown would be “contrary to public policy . . . [while] feed[ing] the propaganda mills of the enemies of Democracy, both here and abroad.” He then called on the governor to speak out against housing discrimination and “to either ban a Levittown, or to force the builders to scuttle their policy of excluding Negroes.” To these pleas, Fine issued a boilerplate response that he was personally opposed to discrimination but that he would not “impose conditions of occupancy on a private builder.” Telegrams to FHA and VA officials who had the responsibility of backing home loans in the Philadelphia area requested that they “insure there will be no discrimination or segregation because of race, color, or religion.” But like the federal administrators in New York, they refused to intervene.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0096144212445452">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>As the NAACP pressed its campaign with Levitt, U.S. Steel, and public officials, it also built a legal case against segregation in Levittown. The <italic>Philadelphia Tribune</italic> aided the cause, urging its readers to apply to buy homes in the community. If they were turned down because of skin color, the paper advised, they should sue Levitt. The NAACP, the editors concluded, was on the case. By January 1953 Motley had collected names of a number of possible plaintiffs and had begun plotting strategy with Jacques Wilmore of the American Friends Service Committee. Motley was cautious about bringing suit, concerned that state courts would rule they had no jurisdiction since Pennsylvania did not have a law prohibiting housing discrimination (such a law was not passed until 1961). Better, she thought, for the NAACP to win suit against the federal government in an ongoing public housing case in Savannah, Georgia, that would “establish the principle that the federal government may not give its assistance to the construction of segregated public housing.” That would give the NAACP grounds to argue that in Levittown the government could not “give financial assistance of any kind to the construction of segregated private housing.” Motley’s strategy led to the logical conclusion that FHA assistance made public and private housing related strands of a single, broad federal housing policy rather than two distinct means of sheltering people, one a government program and the other a private, supposedly free-market, system. If that logic held, then, in her view, federal assistance to racially discriminatory communities violated the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution. It was an easier argument to make, though, if the courts outlawed segregation in public housing first. But Levittown was growing so fast—one hundred homes or more went up each week in the early 1950s with some sixteen thousand built by 1955—that Motley feared the NAACP could not afford to wait. The NAACP, led by Thurgood Marshall and Constance Baker Motley, did win its Savannah suit in November 1956, but the association could not wait that long in Levittown and sued William Levitt and administrators from the FHA and VA in January 1955.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0096144212445452">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>Marshall, Motley, and other officials from the NAACP and its Legal Defense Fund thought the tide of history was running with them as they headed to court. <italic>Shelley v. Kraemer</italic> had outlawed state sanction of racial covenants, and <italic>Brown v. Board</italic> had just declared segregated schools unconstitutional. “The next targets,” announced the NAACP, “are the operations which receive indirect aid from the Federal Housing Administration [including] the huge Levittown communities which candidly discriminate against Negroes.” Moreover, the association thought it had assembled a sympathetic collection of plaintiffs to front its class action suit. The six men were all married, all but one had received an honorable discharge after serving in World War II, and they all sought defense work in the Levittown area while the United States was engaged in a cold war around the globe and, for a time, a hot war in Korea. These were working- and middle-class men with families who projected the kind of “respectability” that the NAACP desired.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0096144212445452">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>The NAACP’s suit asserted that Levitt and Sons, Inc. and the federal government were intrinsically linked to each other and that discrimination in the resultant Pennsylvania community violated the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment and the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. Levitt’s business plan, Marshall and Motley argued, was to build for a mass market by selling at low prices and providing long-term amortization. To do so, Levitt needed the support of the FHA and the VA, whose premium rates did not conform to actuarial principles. Their mortgage insurance, the attorneys argued, “constituted a subsidy to private builders” who rejected applicants “solely because of their race or color.” This was discrimination that Levitt could not have practiced without taxpayers’ money. FHA and VA administrators, the lawyers charged, had the duty under the National Housing Act to make sure there were no restrictive covenants on any of the properties their agencies insured, and in failing to do so they not only broke the housing act but also violated the civil rights of numerous African American applicants who had been denied a Levittown home solely because of their race.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0096144212445452">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>The association’s second argument held that Levitt’s community was so vast that it made his company more than an ordinary home builder. “In constructing streets, roads, schools, [etc.], defendant Levitt and Sons, Inc., has at all times acted as an instrumentality of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,” the attorneys said. “Levittown, Pennsylvania is in fact and in effect a city or town similar in all respects to all other cities or towns in the Commonwealth.” With sixteen thousand homes, Levittown ranked as the tenth largest city in the state, and Marshall and Motley argued that it should be regarded as a public entity where home sales were subject to the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment rather than as a private concern where Levitt had greater latitude to make his own rules. The only proper relief, the attorneys asserted, was an injunction “restraining Levitt from refusing to sell to the plaintiffs solely because of race and color and restraining the government defendants from insuring mortgages on Levittown properties as long as Levitt discriminates against purchasers because of race or color.” The connection between Levitt and the federal government was so great that “the actions of Levitt must be deemed the acts of the federal agencies,” they concluded.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0096144212445452">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>The defendants’ attorneys offered counterarguments that spoke to the limits of state power and the attenuated connection between Levitt and the federal agencies. First, it was by no means clear that the government had the right to compel private actors to adhere to nondiscriminatory principles. <italic>Shelley v. Kraemer</italic> made it unconstitutional for courts to uphold restrictive covenants but there was no such thing as an open housing law at the time. Levitt enjoyed “the fundamental right of a private builder to sell to whom he pleases,” his attorneys argued. In addition, Levitt, they claimed, had no direct relationship with the federal government; instead, it was the home buyers who contracted with federal agencies. As for the allegations against the VA and FHA, Congress had never charged them with the duty of preventing discrimination in housing, which meant the plaintiffs were asking the court to compel federal officials to overstep their charge. Finally, the defense argued that the federal district court lacked jurisdiction over the case. The NAACP should have sued either in state court (where the attorneys knew there was no Pennsylvania state law appropriate to the case) or in federal court in Washington, D.C., where the FHA and VA were headquartered.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0096144212445452">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>The NAACP’s arguments failed to persuade Judge William Kirkpatrick. The judge acknowledged the close relationship between Levitt and the federal agencies, which gave the government some control over Levittown’s construction, but that did not make “Levitt and Sons, Inc., of New York, the government of the United States or a branch or agency of it nor [did it] make the government of the United States the builder or developer of the Levittown project.” The judge also agreed with the defense that the FHA and VA had never been charged with the duty of preventing discrimination and that only Congress could change that fact. Finally, he rejected the claim that Levitt was acting as an instrument of the state with the blunt comment that the argument was “too far-fetched to require discussion.” “The complaint,” Kirkpatrick concluded in a curt final statement, “may be dismissed.” The NAACP considered filing an appeal, but ultimately decided to drop the case.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0096144212445452">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although the association lost, its court battle was far from a dead end. The case kept Levittown in the headlines of black newspapers such as the <italic>Tribune</italic> and <italic>Chicago Defender</italic> as well as Philadelphia’s largest daily, the <italic>Evening Bulletin</italic>. In doing so, it made the racial problems of Levittown common knowledge throughout the black community. “We knew, like everyone else did, that the new suburb called Levittown . . . was supposed to be lily-white,” Daisy Myers recalled. “Lawsuits had been lost by Negroes trying to buy new homes in both the New York and Pennsylvania Levittowns.” The suburb also became a cause célèbre for black activists and their allies, with men such as Ralph Abernathy coming to speak to audiences about desegregating the community and area authors Pearl Buck and James Michener arguing that its discriminatory policies gave support to America’s communist enemies abroad. And the case helped pull the Bucks County Human Relations Council and the Quakers into greater involvement with desegregating the suburb. It was this mass awareness of the court case and the larger Levittown campaign that kept the suburb front and center for many people concerned about combating Jim Crow in the Philadelphia area.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0096144212445452">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>With little help coming from public officials, the courts, or U.S. Steel, activists from a variety of backgrounds took it on themselves to push to break the color bar in Levittown. The suburb’s Faith Reformed Church, for example, held a public meeting titled “Fair Housing in Bucks County,” where a minister asked the crowd if they would accept an African American family with “faith, love, and human understanding.” They had better consider the question, he told them, because like it or not the day was coming when a black family would move into Levittown. A real estate appraiser at the same meeting assured listeners that it was a myth that housing values depreciate because African Americans move into a neighborhood. At the same time, several groups—the Bucks County Human Relations Council, the American Friends Service Committee, and related Quaker organizations housed at the nearby William Penn Center—began looking for a black family to move into Levittown. As historian Thomas Sugrue has detailed, the Quakers’ search was an exhaustive process, playing out over four years and involving interviews with many candidates. The Quakers were looking for a stable, middle-class family that would move into Levittown without upsetting too many white residents. As much as anything, the Quakers’ effort to desegregate Levittown “was intended,” Sugrue writes, “to change the hearts and minds of white Americans.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0096144212445452">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>Such an effort, however well-intentioned, was disturbing and intrusive to the Myerses. The Penn Center, in Daisy Myers’s view, played perhaps the greatest role in sparking her and Bill’s interest in Levittown. At meetings at Levittowners’ homes, the Myerses engaged in conversations about political, social, and economic topics. At one of the meetings in spring 1957, someone asked Bill if he knew “a nice Negro couple that would like to move to Levittown.” Bill said no, but driving home that night he asked Daisy, “What about us?” With a growing family that needed more room, Daisy and her husband decided to ask for more details the next time the group met. That conversation led to hours of further discussions, reaching a point that Daisy sardonically commented that the group should have been called the “Levittown Committee to Discuss the Successful Move-in of a Negro Family.” The discussions, in Daisy’s view, quickly became more like interrogations. Some of the questions were relevant, but others were “stupid.” “I finally said that we were only ordinary people,” she recalled, “we had not invented anything or created sensations or been in any trouble. They pried into our lives so extensively that one would wonder if they were going to give us a house instead of us having to buy it.” The Quakers, indisputable supporters of integration, still felt it their right and duty to apply a character test to African Americans that no one expected white Levittowners to pass.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0096144212445452">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>Despite their disgruntlement about what Daisy termed the “third degree,” she and her husband were ideal to make the move because of their background and determination. Daisy, an only child born in Richmond, Virginia, in 1925, grew up in Navy Hill, a largely middle-class black neighborhood. Her father worked for the Richmond, Fredericksburg &amp; Potomac Railroad and made a good enough income that the family lived comfortably. Daisy’s parents were both deeply religious, members of the local NAACP, and politically active. They paid their poll taxes, urged friends and relatives to do the same, and often used the family car to take people to the polls. They also stressed the value of education for their daughter who graduated high school at sixteen, finished college at Virginia Union, and immediately began a teaching career in Amelia, Virginia. In her memoirs, Daisy remembered that Jim Crow was ubiquitous, but it did not always impinge on her life. Her attention to discrimination became more focused after she moved north to study at New York University. Seeing integrated classrooms and African Americans in all walks of life made Myers believe the integrated North was “like a Promised Land,” and the Jim Crow system of Virginia appeared much more stifling. Bill grew up in York, Pennsylvania, the son of the bellman at the Yorktown Hotel. His was the only African American family in their neighborhood near the hotel, but he told Daisy that he never felt out of place. He integrated his high school band and played basketball well enough to earn a scholarship to Hampton Institute, where he met Daisy while learning to do electrical work. During World War II Bill served two years in the Army Quartermaster Corps. When he came back from the war, like so many other black veterans Bill knew that he could no longer tolerate the South’s ways. He married Daisy in 1950 and they moved to York a year later, seeking what Daisy termed “a freer life.” Bill had a hard time finding suitable work in York, so they soon moved to the Philadelphia area, where they hoped for better prospects. Daisy knew the abolitionist history of the city, its fame for the Quakers helping to run the Underground Railroad, and hoped it would offer her family greater opportunities. Bill found a job as a refrigerator technician, Daisy did some social service work, and they along with their two children settled in Bloomsdale Gardens, an integrated community in Bucks County not far from Levittown, where they wanted to enjoy what the <italic>Philadelphia Tribune</italic> called an “impressive community . . . founded on the basis of ‘open occupancy’ for families of moderate income.” The Myerses were happy in Bloomsdale Gardens, but with Daisy pregnant with their third child they knew they needed more room, and Levittown was just down the road. After much angst-filled conversation, they decided to make the move.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0096144212445452">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>Bill and Daisy Myers, then, were indeed what scholars have termed “pioneers,” the first family willing to take the consequences of breaking the color bar when they move into a new community. But pioneer has another connotation, that of someone striking out on his or her own to explore and settle a new land, and in that respect the term does not fit. The Myers family moved to Levittown only after years of agitation by black Philadelphians, a series of behind-the-scenes meetings with U.S. Steel, Levitt and Sons, and federal agencies, a high-profile court case, and a campaign by religious and civic groups to find the “right” family. What made the Myerses the “right kind of family,” as Daisy put it, was their background, their occupational status, and the stability that their children implied to onlookers, but also the years of campaigning by the black community and their white allies. Without both, the pioneering family and the community that set the context for them moving in, desegregation would not have succeeded.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0096144212445452">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>It was no fait accompli, however, that the desegregation of Levittown would succeed. The Myerses, assured by the Penn Center that they had some support in the community, moved into the Dogwood Hollow section of Levittown on August 13, 1957, with a sense of optimism that was quickly dashed. Daisy thought they could expect the local newspapers, politicians, police, and at least some civic organizations to defend their right to live in the community. “What can happen?” one supporter said. “We live north of the Mason-Dixon Line.” The Myerses’ sanguinity faded when the mailman knocked on the door at noon. “May I speak to the owner?” he asked. “I am the owner,” Daisy replied. The man went pale and backed away from the home. He spent the rest of the afternoon going around the neighborhood, telling people, “It happened! Niggers have moved into Levittown!” In a short time small groups began gathering on the street, watching the Myers house and circulating a petition protesting their new neighbors. By the end of the afternoon, the <italic>Levittown Times</italic> had an article announcing to the entire community that the first black family had moved in. The protests and threats began that night.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0096144212445452">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>The protests were inchoate at first, consisting of crowds milling on the sidewalk, muttering epithets and promises of violence. During the daylight hours of August 13, the Myerses felt comfortable enough to ignore the crowds. They had supporters stop by to welcome them to the neighborhood and the arrival of the police also helped put them at ease. But as evening came, the crowds became bolder and the police seemed to do little to quell them. With the tension rising, Bill and Daisy decided to go back to Bloomsdale Gardens to spend the night and did not permanently move into Levittown for another week.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0096144212445452">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>During that time, those Levittowners most vehemently opposed to integration formed the Levittown Betterment Committee. Led by James Newell who had headed the local Veterans of Foreign Wars post, this group claimed it was a “non-profit, non-political organization for the people of Levittown” that only sought to “secure for their community the former status of limitations by peaceful means.” They vowed to reject violence, claiming they felt no hate but only wanted to halt the “encroachment upon our rights as a limited community.” “Nero fiddled while Rome burned,” they wrote. “We do not propose to do likewise. From this we take our stand.” On a Philadelphia radio show, Newell and others claimed that Bill Myers was at fault, causing the protests by moving into the community. “Before we have integration,” one man said, “we must educate everybody and that takes time.” Some twelve hundred Levittowners heard the committee’s arguments and joined the group. On the face of it, they at least claimed to reject violence and overt racism. This was about their right to control their community. But a darker side of the committee emerged when it secured the home directly behind the Myers residence. Dubbing the home “Confederate House,” they raised the rebel flag and played “Dixie” on the stereo, and one member walked his dog, newly christened “Nigger,” up and down the street, calling loudly for his animal in front of the Myers house. When he heard of the betterment committee’s behavior, Georgia’s Senator Richard Russell expressed his sympathy for their “plight.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0096144212445452">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>The rhetoric and behavior of the betterment committee well captures the various themes within the reaction Levittown segregationists had to the Myerses. On one hand, committee members threatened violence and raised hoary notions of black criminality and sexual depravity; on the other, they talked of white rights, property values, and democratic principles. Ugly, overt racism was not always on ready display in 1950s America, but it was by no means fully supplanted by other idioms.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0096144212445452">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>Throughout the protests, which stretched out until the end of the summer, violence always seemed to be in the offing. At different times, protestors smashed a window in the Myers home, exploded gas bombs, and threatened to use dynamite. African American reporters from the <italic>Tribune</italic> were told “get out of Levittown; you don’t want to get hurt.” Service workers who dared to go to the Myers house found their trucks vandalized. And the Myerses received so many threatening letters that Daisy feared being murdered. Local police did arrest five protestors the first night, but their otherwise anemic efforts struck the Myers family and their supporters as weak at best and tacitly supporting the mob at worst.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0096144212445452">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Myerses’ consternation deepened with the growth of Klan activities. The evidence is mixed about whether the KKK had a formal chapter in Levittown or whether segregationists just appropriated its name. Some reports claimed that Levittowners voted down a proposal to invite the Klan to their community; others said that the Klan had a two-hundred-member Klavern in the suburb. Regardless, allies of the Myerses found crosses burned in their yards and “KKK” painted on their houses. Klan applications and posters circulated in the community. One poster depicted a white man kneeling in fear before a black man with the words “We are watching your every move” at the bottom. Another featured a man in Klan robes on horseback, holding a fiery cross to the sky. “Save Our Land. Join the Klan,” it read.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0096144212445452">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>Related attacks on the Myers family tied them to interracial sexual contact and criminal behavior. “When the races mix socially there is bound to be race mixing,” wrote one man. “We need segregation because most people are dominated by fleshy desires.” Another man said he “wouldn’t let [his] wife and children walk the streets at night. The niggers will always be an uncivilized race.” And a poster pasted to the wall of the Myerses’ supportive neighbors, the Wechslers, was headlined “Conquer and Breed.” Daisy was even asked by someone friendly to her cause what plans she had for her children to intermarry. Not only was she insulted by the question, but her oldest son was five at the time. Just as insulting were the insinuations that the Myerses were the vanguard for “urban problems.” “A great majority of Levittown people remember too vividly other street scenes in their former neighborhoods after Negroes moved in. The memory of wild liquor parties, muggings, dope traffic, etc. is not easy to forget. If someone can assure me that these same things will not follow to Levittown, I will be glad to accept a Negro neighbor.” And a member of the Levittown Betterment Committee told a reporter that they did not want African Americans in Levittown “because of all the crime and violence that happens where colored people live.” When pushed on whether the committee was encouraging lawlessness in its own right, he responded, “This is different.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0096144212445452">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>Mixed in with these overtly racist messages was a more rights-conscious strain of thinking that was growing in this era. That line of argument focused in part on the value of people’s homes and on property rights more generally. Time and again, protestors claimed the Myerses’ presence destroyed what they had spent their lives building. “We spent a lot of money on our homes. Now they are worth nothing!” one man cried. “You should be ashamed of yourself!” another Levittowner shouted at Lewis Wechsler. “Our houses are worth only half of what they were yesterday.” Concerns about property were expressed most clearly in a petition signed by six hundred people who argued they had the right to control their community. “We, the citizens and home owners of Levittown, Pennsylvania, protest the mixing of Negroes in our previously all-white community. As moral, religious and law-abiding citizens, we feel that we are unprejudiced and undiscriminating in our wish to keep our community a closed community. In as much as having equal rights, the Negroes have an equal opportunity to build their own community of equal value and beauty without intermingling in our community. We therefore feel that we must keep our community closed to protect our interests.” Real estate experts, public officials, and religious leaders tried to tell the crowds that they were wrong, that there was no evidence that black residents harmed their property values or lessened their rights, but white Levittowners were so enraged that they would not listen.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0096144212445452">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>In addition to issues of property, rights-based arguments targeted liberal politicians whom segregationists believed made them victims of antidemocratic government policies. Any government backing of this black family was sheer “political expediency,” wrote one woman. “All the laws,” said another, “seem to be to protect the Negro race.” With the desegregation of Little Rock’s Central High School dominating the headlines in September 1957, Daisy Myers received phone calls praising the Jim Crow South and Governor Orval Faubus as “the type of man we need in Levittown,” a man who would stand up for white rights. Instead, Pennsylvania had liberal Governor George Leader, who had come out in support of the Myerses.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0096144212445452">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Levittown conflict, many white residents essentially argued, came down to whether they had race-based rights in a democratic nation. They felt they were the true Americans, singing “America the Beautiful” as they paraded with the flag in front of the Myers house and chanting “This is America! This is America!” when the police tried to curtail their demonstrations. Five hundred people attended a town hall meeting where they told Levittown commissioners that they had the right to “say who we want to live in our neighborhood.” When one commissioner responded that “[o]ur responsibility is to defend to the best of our ability the protection of property regardless of race, creed or religion,” the crowd became so unruly that the commission had to adjourn. Whites had made it clear, one member of the Levittown Betterment Committee said, that “a majority of the people did not want [Mr. Myers] in Levittown [and] he should accept it.” The Myerses, by this logic, were at fault for not having the “common courtesy to respect the rights of other men.” Perhaps, one man suggested, it was time to repeal the Civil Rights Bill. In the crabbed worldview of these Levittowners, democracy meant majority rule, and that meant whites could deny equal opportunity to African Americans regardless of their constitutional rights. Blacks, it followed, were at fault for challenging this discrimination.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0096144212445452">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>When the Myerses first moved to Levittown—before the depth of the attacks on their persons and their character became evident—they espoused rather commonplace desires about their new home. They wanted what they thought was the American Dream, the chance, as Daisy once put it, “to raise the children somewhere where they have green grass and a fence around it—a home with space and surroundings and good schools.” It was a myth, Daisy argued, that African Americans preferred to “live with their own people.” Instead, she said, “Negroes—like all other human beings—enjoy a neighborhood where they can enjoy a normal pattern of life among people who respect them for what they are, regardless of the color of their skin.” So an explicit part of the Myerses’ thinking was about taking part in a lifestyle that appealed to millions of Americans: a new home with a yard, good schools, and a place where their kids could grow up carefree. Such a view was common to many African Americans, fostered, as the historian Adam Green has shown, by social and cultural leaders in the pages of <italic>Ebony</italic> who portrayed the suburbs as the embodiment of an idyllic American Dream. That the suburbs could provide all this may be a myth that scholars have spent careers dissecting (as critics did at the time), but it was certainly a popular one, and in many circles still is.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0096144212445452">40</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although the Myerses were committed to their move, ambivalence went hand in hand with their new home and intensified with the protests. From the start, Bill and Daisy knew Levittown was for whites only and that they would not receive a warm welcome from most of their neighbors. Daisy was often racked with doubt, worrying about her children, her neighbors, her future. “Would our children be ostracized?” she asked in her memoirs. “To what extent would our neighbors object? . . . Could we live a normal, happy life in Levittown?” Bill worried most about the safety of his children and sent them to live with friends until he was sure they would not be harmed. But he was also concerned about what the black community might think of his move. He knew the community had pushed for years for the desegregation of Levittown, but it still pained him that reporters and letters to the editor asked why he was “reject[ing] his own people [to] live in a community where there isn’t another Negro family for blocks and even miles.” He repeatedly told the press, “I don’t want anyone to think that we are trying to get away from our own people and live just with white people.” Even with white supporters in the community, Bill lamented that “[t]hey used to say about Levittown, ‘You never have to live in Levittown and look at a black face.’ I’d like to look out and see a black face.” It was enough to make him tell Daisy in the quiet of their home, “Let’s give up. I’m ready to call it quits.” With legitimate worries about their family’s safety, acceptance by their neighbors, and the possible response of the African American community troubling Bill and Daisy Myers, it is no wonder the move to Levittown left them feeling ambivalent.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0096144212445452">41</xref></sup></p>
<p>As the protests grew, the Myerses’ residence became much more than a house to them and their supporters. African Americans’ fundamental rights, they believed, were at stake. Their Levittown home became the embodiment, Daisy wrote, of the “basic moral principle [that African Americans should have] full equality in housing, or schools, or jobs.” The protests led Daisy to ask searching questions about Levittown and American society more broadly. “Why,” she asked, “were the crowds at our home? . . . Do we love our children less than they do? . . . Do we have the right to choose a neighborhood or do the neighbors have a right to choose us? Have they come to tell us where we shall or shall not live? Aren’t we human? . . . Did we not, I asked myself, as an American Negro family have a legal and moral right to live in a place of our own choosing? What of the American ideals of justice and equality?” Facing naked racism also angered Bill and Daisy after the years he served the United States in World War II. “He won five battle stars,” Daisy bitterly told the <italic>Tribune</italic>, “but just try to tell that to the mob out there.” As Bill and Daisy Myers articulated the reasons Levittown mattered, they raised many of the issues that animated the black rights movement of the twentieth century: human rights and legal rights, the right to decent housing, the right to raise your family in a safe and loving atmosphere, and the right to live where you please without facing harassment.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0096144212445452">42</xref></sup></p>
<p>An array of individuals and organizations understood what was at stake and supported the Myerses. The NAACP and <italic>Philadelphia Tribune</italic>, involved in the campaign to desegregate Levittown from the start, led the way. The association held meetings with community leaders to see how they could help calm Levittown and issued a statement demanding that the police enforce the Myers family’s “fundamental property rights . . . to occupy a home of its choice.” The <italic>Tribune</italic> took an angrier stance, labeling Levittown as being as bad as the Deep South and a “morass of hate and vindictiveness.” The Levittown protestors, the paper continued, were un-American bigots who “snarl like beasts in the jungle,” and William Levitt was Pontius Pilate, unable to “wash his hands of the nasty mess which his company created.” But no matter how bad the attacks on the Myers family became, the paper assured its readers, Bill and Daisy were strong people, and they would not “permit a gang of hoodlums and terrorists to chase them out.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0096144212445452">43</xref></sup></p>
<p>A number of white groups also backed the Myers family. The Quakers, who helped get the Myerses into Levittown in the first place, lamented the violence and issued a statement proclaiming their faith in “opportunities for all Americans to live side by side in a peaceful, democratic way.” The Catholic Interracial Council, Americans for Democratic Action, the Bucks County Human Relations Council, and Jewish groups all decried the protests and violence. And the <italic>Evening Bulletin</italic>, the mouthpiece of respectable, middle-class Philadelphia, lambasted the riots and told its readers that “Levittown may be divided on housing integration. Surely they are united in wanting to stay in an unbloodied, lawful community.” Daisy Myers appreciated the support, but wondered about the form it took. Calling for order and the end of violence was one thing, she wrote, but too often the <italic>Evening Bulletin</italic> and other groups failed to offer “direct support for the principle of integration.” Too many groups, in her view, saw this as an issue of community peace rather than her family’s inherent rights.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0096144212445452">44</xref></sup></p>
<p>Supporters further left on the political spectrum took a firmer stand. The steelworkers union, which had joined the NAACP in pushing Levitt to desegregate Levittown, called on its members in the suburb to oppose “any un-American acts of bigotry.” “This veteran,” the union continued, “[has] an inherent right to a better home, a right he has fought to protect, and a home he has worked and saved to buy and, as an American citizen, he and his family are entitled to the full protection of the law.” The AFL-CIO seconded this sentiment, as did Bill’s local union at the refrigeration company in Trenton, New Jersey, where he worked. Even greater support came from the Myerses’ next-door neighbors, Lewis and Bea Wechsler, who had been communists and members of radical organizations when they lived in New York City. The Wechslers had a deep belief in the cause of racial equality and had fought for tenant rights, especially for African Americans, in New York before moving to Levittown. There, Lew helped Bill Myers secure the loan for his Levittown home and personally confronted the mob harassing the Myers family. Fair housing might not solve all of black Americans’ problems, he said, but he fundamentally believed no one should “be denied the right to live where they could afford to, solely because of their color or religion.” For his trouble, not only did Wechsler find a cross burning on his lawn and a gas bomb down the street, but he and his wife received a series of threatening phone calls with people calling them “nigger-loving Jewish motherfuckers.” Other families involved with the Myerses, such as the Quaker family the Von Blums and the Jewish family the Mandels, received similar intimidation, with the Von Blums getting racist literature and a burning cross on their lawn and Irving Mandel losing his job and his wife and kids getting harassed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0096144212445452">45</xref></sup></p>
<p>As the tension in Levittown grew, the Myerses and their supporters pressured the state government to act on their behalf. They thought they had a chance for state intervention because for one of the few times since the Civil War Pennsylvania had a liberal-leaning Democratic governor. Immediately after the protests began, the Urban League wired Governor Leader, pushing him to do all he could to prevent the “vicious and potentially explosive nature of the smoldering Levittown, Pa., incident” from boiling over into racial violence. Soon after, the governor told a crowd that he was “riled up” by events in Levittown and “ashamed that this happened in Pennsylvania.” At the same time, Bill, with the help of a sympathetic member of the state House of Representatives, arranged a meeting with Pennsylvania’s Attorney General, Thomas McBride. McBride told the Myerses that he and his wife had been involved in the fight for racial justice for three decades and that he would do all he could to help. Many other Democrats, including Mayor Richardson Dilworth of Philadelphia and the Lower Bucks County Democratic Club, added their support. Republican politicians tended to remain quiet or take the side of the segregationists. The local assistant district attorney, for example, promised to help get the Myerses out of Levittown and a Republican leader in nearby Falls Township warned of “the invasion of our community by the Negro” and said Bill Myers had caused all “the violence and disruptions in a once peaceful suburban community.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0096144212445452">46</xref></sup></p>
<p>Governor Leader and Attorney General McBride acted quickly to suppress the Levittown demonstrations. “The state police,” McBride assured the Myerses, “will be there when you return [to Levittown] and will remain there as long as necessary.” This came as welcome relief to Bill and Daisy who found the local police in the first few days of the unrest ineffective at best, sympathetic to the mob at worst. The police often disappeared at night when they were supposedly providing the Myers and Wechsler families with twenty-four-hour surveillance, and they seemed lethargic in investigating putative Klan activities. Compared to local law enforcement, the state police made it clear that they would protect the Myers family and stop any threats of violence. They broke up mobs that gathered in front of the Myers home, shut down the Confederate house, and launched an investigation that led to the prosecution of seven people. Although the crowds insulted them as “nigger lovers” and there was a smattering of violence when protestors threw stones and the policemen reacted with billy clubs, the state police brought order to Levittown. It was simple enough, Wechsler commented, “to enforce law and order—as long as the desire is there.” Finally, with the state involved, he wrote, “Peace reigned.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0096144212445452">47</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the ensuing trial, Attorney General McBride argued the case, making it clear how personally he took the riots in Levittown and that Pennsylvania would not tolerate such behavior again. McBride first got the district court to issue a temporary injunction against James Newell and six other ringleaders of the protests that prohibited them from burning crosses, distributing inflammatory posters, and harassing any residents of Levittown. Six weeks later the attorney general prosecuted the so-called Levittown 7 for an unlawful conspiracy that sought to deprive the Myerses of their civil and property rights. McBride’s findings of fact detailed the violence and intimidation that the Myers family and their supporters faced until the state police arrived. The burning crosses and gas bombs, the Klan literature, the Confederate house, and the mobs on the street all constituted what McBride called “an unlawful, malicious and evil conspiracy,” and he had no choice but to prosecute those responsible for the “spirit of lawlessness” that roiled the community. To make his case, McBride leaned heavily on the <italic>Shelley</italic> decision, arguing that the court had to side with the Myerses and thus affirm that African Americans have “the same and equal privilege under the law of the land as any other to acquire and possess their hom[es] and other property.” This was a “constitutional right,” he said, and “nobody has the right to get the Myerses out of Levittown by any means.” The judge agreed with McBride, issuing a permanent injunction against the Myerses’ harassers on December 9. A later trial against two betterment committee members for burning crosses resulted in fines and suspended sentences of two years in prison. The punishments for those involved were not particularly harsh, but Daisy knew they ended the ordeal. “We were finally assured a peaceful life in Levittown,” she wrote.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0096144212445452">48</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although Daisy remembered that her “peaceful life” in Levittown finally began, desegregation was in fact quite an uneven process, and the suburb never gained a substantial black population. By the end of 1957 several Levittowners organized the “Dogwood Hollow Neighbors” and invited the Myerses to join a group that pledged to “restore neighborhood friendliness.” A year later, Daisy told the press that her family finally felt at home. Bill, however, admitted that they still had neighbors who would not accept them. “On the other hand, there are some people that we don’t find acceptable,” he added. Quaker activists looked for more black families willing to join the Myerses, but the notoriety of Levittown’s protests made the job difficult. Finally, in June 1958 Kenneth and Julia Mosby moved their family into the Orchard section, about two miles away from the Myerses. Small groups of neighbors stood and watched quietly as they moved in, and although there was no violence, someone did tack up a sign on the street corner that read “Black Bottom Road.” Levittown’s reputation as antagonistic to African Americans persisted such that the community had only seven black families in 1961 and twenty-five in 1964, nearly a decade after the Myerses first moved in. Before the Myers family moved to Harrisburg for better job opportunities in 1962, they witnessed the first black teacher in Levittown’s schools encounter what Daisy called “whispered threats” and heard some talk that they would need a police guard to use the community swimming pool. For the next several decades, teenagers periodically got into racially motivated fights, and the Klan annually marched just outside the community. Vandalism of black property followed in the wake of the marches, and black Levittowners told the press, “[Here] you’re treated like a black person and you are different.” Little wonder that the community’s black population stood at 1 percent in 1981 and had barely increased to 2.45 percent in 2000.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0096144212445452">49</xref></sup></p>
<p>The desegregation of Levittown was in some ways a triumph for the Myers family and for the larger black community. A campaign that began six years earlier finally ended with Bill and Daisy securing the home they sought. That campaign brought together black and white activists who pursued long-term political, legal, and grassroots strategies that kept the suburb firmly at the center of black Philadelphians’ attention. It helped the NAACP to hone its arguments about state intervention in the housing market and the constitutional implications of the government backing loans in discriminatory developments. And after numerous disappointments, it also secured the support of the state, in particular the governor, the attorney general, the courts, and the state police. Without such official backing, the Myerses never would have succeeded. At the same time, without a couple as strong and dedicated as Bill and Daisy Myers, Levittown would undoubtedly have remained fully segregated for much longer. Theirs was certainly a triumphant moment in the long quest for equal rights in the North.</p>
<p>But the suburb’s desegregation simultaneously showed the limits of such an approach. Private actors such as the NAACP and the William Penn Center simply did not have the resources to integrate American society. Pursuing litigation, organizing protests, and holding private meetings was an expensive and time-consuming approach that could at best result in piecemeal gains. For African Americans to have a better chance of securing integration and equality, they had to be treated as a class with legal rights rather than as individuals with private claims. It should come as no surprise that Levittown proved an unsuitable setting for such alternative thinking. The suburbs, in their physical and ideological construction, were more about individual striving than community advancement for both whites and blacks, and any solution to discrimination almost by default took an individualist approach. Moreover, this approach required the Myerses and their supporters, especially the Wechslers, to show extraordinary courage to brave the threats, intimidation, and violence that they encountered. Few black families for obvious reasons wanted to follow them, even decades later. A campaign initially intended to secure housing for hundreds if not thousands of black workers in industrializing Bucks County ended with activists spending all of their time and money to get one house for one family. The liberal, piecemeal, individualist approach was well-intentioned, but it had limits that made it difficult, if not impossible, to achieve the larger goal of integrating American society.</p>
<p>From a broader perspective, this Levittown story highlights issues that should be central to how historians understand postwar African American history and the suburban experience. African Americans and their supporters understood that as policy makers, home builders, bankers, and ordinary buyers remade the cities of the United States after World War II, the suburbs controlled access to jobs, education, and resources. Opening Levittown required a long-term campaign that, eventually coupled with state support for black rights, finally led to victory, albeit a limited one. Paying close attention to that campaign puts the explosive riots of August 1957 in historical context, emphasizing grassroots, political, and legal activism as well as state action, and gives us a clearer understanding of the process of desegregation. While we rightly celebrate the challenges African Americans made to segregation, the difficulty of that process, the hardship it placed on “pioneer” families like the Myerses, caused a deep ambivalence that should not be overlooked. The suburbs and all that they promised for personal betterment mattered greatly to African Americans, but so too did their fear that they would be ostracized in their new neighborhood and that they might look like they were fleeing the black community that supported them. Facing constant attacks from white Levittowners who believed that the Myers family intruded on their right to limit who they had to associate with greatly heightened their concerns. The Myerses were ultimately willing to damp down their ambivalence and fight for their home in Levittown because they believed white Levittowners were wrong in their beliefs about the primacy of white rights. To the Myerses, moving into the suburb struck a blow for a different interpretation of rights in postwar America. At a time when African Americans were pushing the nation to rethink meanings of rights and democracy, the Myerses’ ownership of a Levittown home forcefully made moral and constitutional points about the necessity of equal treatment under the law. A home in Levittown, as the NAACP put it, was about making accessible the “American Dream—for all Americans.”</p>
