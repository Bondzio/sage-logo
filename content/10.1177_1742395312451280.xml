<p><bold>Objectives:</bold> The ‘Comprehensive ICF Core Set for low back pain (LBP)’ is an application of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) and represents the typical spectrum of problems in functioning of patients with LBP. The objective of this study was to validate this ICF Core Set from the perspective of physicians.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> Physicians experienced in the treatment of LBP were asked about the patients’ problems, patients’ resources and aspects of environment that physicians take care of in a three-round survey using the Delphi technique. Responses were linked to the ICF.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Seventy-one physicians in 36 countries named 707 concepts that covered all ICF components. One hundred ninety-three ICF categories were linked to these answers. Three ICF categories were not represented in the Comprehensive ICF Core Set for LBP although at least 75% of the participants have rated them as important. Twenty-six concepts were linked to the not yet developed ICF component <italic>personal factors</italic> and 21 issues were not covered by the ICF.</p>
<p><bold>Discussion:</bold> The high percentage of ICF categories represented in the ICF Core Set for LBP indicates good content validity from the perspective of the physicians. However, some issues were raised that were not covered and need to be investigated further.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1742395312451280" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Low back pain (LBP) is neither a fixed disease nor a diagnostic entity of any sort. According to Ehrlich<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1742395312451280">1</xref></sup> the term refers to pain of variable duration in an area of the anatomy afflicted so often that it has become a paradigm of responses to external and internal stimuli. LBP is a common and costly health condition and cause of work-related disability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1742395312451280">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>The symptoms of LBP and the associated disability bear only a little association with objective data like X-rays or MRI-scans. Often specific causes cannot be found, especially when pain has already become chronic.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1742395312451280">1</xref></sup> Thus, clinical data should be amended by additional factors that contribute to the genesis and persistence of LBP, such as psychological factors, educational status and work satisfaction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1742395312451280">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Considering that LBP can arise from a great variety of causes and accordingly diverse treatment strategies are necessary. A multidisciplinary approach can be a useful way to proceed in the treatment of these patients. In addition to physicians with different specializations, other health professions including psychologists, physical and occupational therapists are commonly involved in treatment and rehabilitation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1742395312451280">2</xref></sup> The roles that different professions have in the process of care may depend on the severity or acuteness of the patients’ problems as well as on cultural characteristics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1742395312451280">3</xref></sup> However, to optimize interventions a proper understanding of the patients’ functioning and health status is needed.</p>
<p>The International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) is based on an integrative model of health that provides a holistic, multidimensional and interdisciplinary understanding of health and health-related conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1742395312451280">4</xref></sup> According to the ICF, the problems associated with a disease may concern <italic>body functions</italic>, <italic>body structures</italic> and the <italic>activities and participation</italic> in life situations. Health states and the development of disabilities are modified by contextual factors like <italic>environmental</italic> and <italic>personal factors</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1742395312451280">Figure 1</xref>). <italic>Personal factors</italic> including gender, age, habits, coping style, etc. are not yet classified.
<fig id="fig1-1742395312451280" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Structure of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1742395312451280-fig1.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>Both content and structure of the ICF indicate its potential value for those health professions involved in LPB care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1742395312451280">5</xref></sup> Compared with the use of profession-specific assessment and documentation systems, the common language of the ICF can be used by different professions and health care disciplines. The ICF is increasingly being applied in rehabilitation practice, for facilitation of multidisciplinary team communication, for structuring of the rehabilitation process, for goal setting and assessment, and for documentation and reporting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1742395312451280">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1742395312451280">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>The ICF is a highly comprehensive classification containing more than 1400 categories. To enhance the applicability of the classification, ICF-based tools should be developed which were tailored to the needs of the users.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1742395312451280">8</xref></sup> The development of ‘ICF Core Sets’ for a number of health conditions, including LBP,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1742395312451280">9</xref></sup> was one approach to increase the feasibility of the ICF and to facilitate its implementation in clinical practice. ICF Core Sets are selections of ICF categories relevant to specific health conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1742395312451280">10</xref></sup> The Comprehensive ICF Core Set for LBP includes 79 ICF categories covering the typical spectrum of problems in functioning of patients with LBP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1742395312451280">9</xref></sup> The development of the ICF Core Set for LBP followed a standard approach that included a formal-decision-making and consensus process among experienced health professionals (physicians, physical therapists, occupational therapists) integrating evidence gathered from preparatory studies. Preparatory studies included a Delphi exercise, a systematic review, and empiric data collection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1742395312451280">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1742395312451280">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>In clinical practice, the Comprehensive ICF Core Set for LBP can be used to describe impairments in body functions and structures, limitations in activities, restrictions in participation and influential environmental factors determining patient outcomes. It may also create a functioning profile serving as a reference for follow-up.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1742395312451280">13</xref></sup> The ICF Core Sets can be applied by different health professions. Therefore, the Comprehensive ICF Core Set for LBP could be used to guide the process of assessment, assignment, intervention and evaluation in a multi-professional patient care. This enables the care and treatment of patients with LBP to be tailored according to their specific needs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1742395312451280">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Before being recommended for routine use in clinical practice, the Comprehensive ICF Core Set for LBP must demonstrate its feasibility, reliability and validity. One approach is the validation from the user (health professional) perspective. Content validity from the health professional perspective means that at least those problems in functioning which are substantial targets of the specific interventions applied by health professionals are represented in the ICF Core Set for LBP. To give an example, if muscle power functions are a main intervention target of physicians, it is essential that physicians are able to document the extent and the change of muscle power in a patient during the course of treatment using the ICF Core Set for LBP. Consequently, if the corresponding ICF category for muscle power functions is not included in the current version of the Core Set for LBP, the Core Set is lacking content validity from the perspective of physicians.</p>
<p>As treatment by physicians often plays a crucial role in the care of patients with LBP, it seems most important to evaluate whether applied interventions are sufficiently represented in the Comprehensive ICF Core Set for LBP. Consequently the primary aim of this study is the identification of patients’ problems, resources and aspects of environment treated by physicians. The second objective is to analyze whether these issues are represented by the current Comprehensive ICF Core Set for LBP.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1742395312451280" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title>
<p>From March to July 2007, we conducted a three-round electronic-mail survey of physicians using the Delphi technique. The Delphi technique aims to gain consensus from a panel of individuals, who have knowledge of the topic being investigated. These informed persons are commonly titled ‘experts’. The Delphi method is a multi-stage process in which each stage builds on the results of the previous one and a series of rounds is used to both gather and provide information about a particular subject. The technique is characterized by its anonymity, thus avoiding group dominance; iteration, which allows panel members to change their opinions in subsequent rounds; and controlled feedback showing the distribution of the group’s response as well as the individual previous response.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1742395312451280">15</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="sec3-1742395312451280"><title>Recruitment of participants</title>
<p>In the preparatory phase of the study associations of physicians as well as universities, hospitals and former cooperation partners of the ICF research branch in Munich were contacted. In addition, literature search and personal recommendations were used to identify experts. The sample was selected using a purposive sampling approach. Purposive sampling is based on the assumptions that a researcher’s knowledge about the population can be used to handpick the cases to be included in the sample.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1742395312451280">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>To assure that the participants of the study are ‘informed individuals’ concerning LBP treatment, the initial letter noted that participants should be ‘physicians experienced in the treatment of LBP’. The first contact included an invitation to co-operate and a detailed description of the projects targets, the Delphi process and the timeline. Only persons who agreed to participate were included into the expert sample and received the questionnaire of the first Delphi round.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1742395312451280"><title>Delphi process</title>
<p>In round 1 of the Delphi exercise an information letter including instructions and an Excel file containing an open-ended questionnaire was sent to all experts. In the questionnaire the participants were asked ‘What are the patients’ problems, patients’ resources and aspects of environment treated by physicians in patients with LBP?’</p>
<p>Additionally, the participants were requested to complete questions on demographic characteristics and professional experience. Responses were collected and linked to the ICF.</p>
<p>In the second Delphi round, the participants received a list of the ICF categories linked to the responses of the first round. The responses that could not be linked to an existing ICF category were categorized by the research team and listed. The participants were asked to respond with ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to the question ‘Do you agree that this ICF category represents patients' problems, patients' resources or aspects of the environment treated by physicians in patients with LBP?’</p>
<p>In the third Delphi round the participants received a list of the ICF categories including the proportion and the identification numbers of the participants who have agreed that the categories represent patients’ problems, patients’ resources or aspects of environment treated by physicians in patients with LBP. The participants were requested to answer the same question taking into account the responses of the group as well as their previous response. The participants had 3 weeks to mail their responses for each round. Reminders were sent approximately 1 week and 2 days before deadline.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1742395312451280"><title>Linking</title>
<p>Categories are the units of the ICF classification and are arranged hierarchically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1742395312451280">Figure 1</xref>). Categories are divided into chapters, which constitute the first level of specification. Higher-levels categories (e.g. second, third of fourth level) are more detailed. Within each component (<italic>body functions</italic> (b), <italic>body structures</italic> (s), a<italic>ctivities and participation</italic> (d) and <italic>environmental factors</italic> (e)) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1742395312451280">Figure 1</xref>), the categories are arranged in a stem/branch/leaf scheme. Consequently a higher level (more detailed) category shares the lower-level categories of which it is the member, so the use of a higher level category implies that the lower level category is applicable, but not vice versa.</p>
<p>Each response of the first Delphi round was linked to the most precise ICF category. The linkage was performed by a trained medical doctoral student (Catherine Glocker) on the basis of ten linking rules, established in previous studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1742395312451280">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1742395312451280">18</xref></sup> If a response contained more than one concept, several ICF categories could be linked. Fifty percent of the responses were randomly selected and linked separately by two health professionals (Catherine Glocker/physician, Agnes Fincziczki/physical therapist). Consensus between the health professionals was used to decide which ICF category should be linked to each response. In case of disagreement between the two health professionals, the suggested categories were discussed by a team consisting of three health professionals (Catherine Glocker, Agnes Fincziczki, Inge Kirchberger). Based on this discussion a joint decision was made. The linking procedure was performed with anonymized data.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1742395312451280"><title>Statistical methods</title>
<p>Statistical analysis was performed using SAS for Windows V8. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the sample and frequencies of responses. The percentage of participants who agreed with the question of the second and third Delphi round was calculated. Data analysis was performed by Catherine Glocker.</p>
<p>The ICF categories considered a problem, resource or an aspect of environment treated by physicians were compared with the ICF categories from the Comprehensive ICF Core Set for LBP. Only ICF categories with consensus in the third Delphi round are presented. Lacking a universally accepted definition of ‘consensus’ an agreement of 75% among the participants was considered sufficiently high based on experiences from previous studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1742395312451280">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1742395312451280">19</xref></sup> ICF categories were regarded as being represented in the Comprehensive ICF Core Set for LBP if they were identical or if a third- or fourth-level category was covered by a less precise (i.e. second-level) category of the Comprehensive ICF Core Set for LBP.</p>
<p>Kappa statistics with bootstrapped confidence intervals were used to describe the agreement between the two health professionals who performed the linking on 50% of the responses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1742395312451280">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1742395312451280">21</xref></sup></p>

<p>One hundred sixty national and international associations covering different medical fields (e.g. physical medicine and rehabilitation, pain medicine, rheumatology, orthopaedics, neurosurgery) were contacted, 18 associations forwarded our e-mail to their members or named experts, who were contacted directly. Two associations posted our mail on their webpage or sent the invitation out in their newsletter. Twenty-five experts agreed to participate. Of 30 universities that were contacted one expert followed our invitation. E-mails were also sent to 180 hospitals, 15 experts agreed to participate. Sixty-five experts were found by internet and literature research, nine were willing to collaborate. One hundred twenty-eight cooperation partners of the ICF research branch were contacted, 18 agreed to participate as did 15 further experts recommended by cooperation partners.</p>

<p>The Kappa statistics for the linking was 0.42 with a 95% confidence interval of 0.37–0.48. Most common reason for disagreement between two health professionals was the use of only one versus a number of ICF categories for a participants’ response. For example the first round answer ‘anxiety due to loss of income due to unemployment/sick leave’ was linked to just one category (<italic>b152 Emotional functions</italic>) by the first health professional, whereas the second health professional selected the categories <italic>d850 Remunerative employment</italic>, <italic>e570 Social security services, systems and policies</italic> and <italic>d8451 Maintaining a job</italic>.</p>

<p>Twenty-one issues like <italic>neuropathic pain, non-oral drugs, therapies</italic> and <italic>posture</italic> were found not to be covered by the ICF classification.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-1742395312451280" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>In our study we have examined whether patient problems which are focus of physicians treatment of LBP are included in the current version of the Comprehensive ICF Core Set for LBP. Since the Comprehensive ICF Core Set for LBP was developed amongst others to allow health professionals including physicians to create a pre- and post-treatment functional profile of patients, it is a matter of content validity that those functional limitations are part of the Comprehensive ICF Core Set for LBP. All patient problems treated by physicians that refer to the ICF components <italic>body structures, activities and participation</italic> and <italic>environmental factors</italic> and were considered as relevant by more than 75% of the participants are included in the Comprehensive ICF Core Set for LBP. However, regarding the component <italic>body functions</italic> three categories, which are not included in the Comprehensive Core Set for LBP yet, were identified to be important in the treatment of patients with LBP by physicians.</p>
<p>The first of these categories is <italic>b530 Weight maintenance functions</italic>. Numerous studies have shown a correlation between increased body weight and musculoskeletal pain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1742395312451280">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1742395312451280">23</xref></sup> Although the association between obesity and LBP has not been proven to be causal,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1742395312451280">23</xref></sup> factors like a sedentary lifestyle, physical deconditioning and depression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1742395312451280">24</xref></sup> as well as medications such as antidepressants and membrane stabilizers may contribute to weight gain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1742395312451280">23</xref></sup> An increased recovery from back pain was observed following weight reduction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1742395312451280">22</xref></sup> Therefore it is recommended that physicians may consider weight management as a adjunct treatment for patients with obesity. Furthermore, a study on the validation of the Comprehensive ICF Core Set for LBP from the perspective of physical therapists has identified the category <italic>b530 Weight maintenance functions</italic> as being important for physical therapist interventions in persons with LBP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1742395312451280">25</xref></sup> Thus, the inclusion of this ICF category might be indicated.</p>
<p>The second category identified in our study that is not included in the Comprehensive Core Set for LBP is <italic>b6202 Urinary Continence</italic>. Incontinence and back pain are related because of the contribution of the trunk muscles to continence and lumbopelvic control.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1742395312451280">26</xref></sup> In clinical observations linking urinary urgency and low back pain, a significant association between incontinence and back problems was found.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1742395312451280">27</xref></sup> Another more serious cause for urinary incontinence associated with LBP is the cauda equina syndrome (CES). It presents with a variety of symptoms and vesical abnormalities, from chronic back pain and sciatica that gradually progresses to a loss of urinary function, to acute trauma-related sciatic pain with immediate problems with vesicular control and it may progress to permanent incontinence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1742395312451280">28</xref></sup> CES is a serious condition that will require an acute surgical intervention if the symptoms, so called ‘red flags’ signs, occur.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1742395312451280">28</xref></sup> Thus, it might be useful to include the second-level category <italic>b620 Urination Functions,</italic> representing the third-level category <italic>b6202 Urinary incontinence</italic> identified in our survey.</p>
<p>The third category considered to be relevant in the treatment of LBP by our participants is <italic>b6700 Discomfort associated with sexual intercourse</italic> that is also not represented in the Comprehensive Core Set for LBP. A significant negative effect of chronic LBP on sexual activity could be revealed in a couple of studies. Patients’ greatest worries seem to be related to the possibility of triggering pain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1742395312451280">29</xref></sup> So the inclusion of this issue in the Core Set should be considered in addition to the already present category <italic>b640 Sexual functions.</italic></p>
<p>A considerable number of the participants’ responses was identified as <italic>personal factors</italic>. According to the ICF language <italic>personal factors</italic> are contextual factors that relate to the individual.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1742395312451280">4</xref></sup> Some <italic>personal factors</italic> may contribute to disability by mediating from pain to disability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1742395312451280">30</xref></sup> The <italic>personal factors</italic> identified in this survey mostly refer to coping and lifestyle. Patients with LBP show a great variety of coping strategies and pain behavior. For instance, Sloan et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1742395312451280">31</xref></sup> found that organic pain beliefs were associated with increased catastrophizing in patients with chronic LBP, and addressing these beliefs may help patients to manage their pain and disability. The effect of lifestyle factors such as physical activity, body weight and substance abuse on disability is supported by the literature. Patients with LBP have demonstrated negative health habits associated with a higher rate of illness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1742395312451280">32</xref></sup> Therefore, lifestyle interventions potentially affect risk factors for LBP in a positive way, but only one third of the patients receives advice regarding appropriate diet and lifestyle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1742395312451280">32</xref></sup> These findings stress the need to develop the component <italic>personal factors</italic> in future revisions of the ICF to get a comprehensive and complete description of relevant aspects influencing a patient’s functioning and health.</p>
<p>Several issues were raised in our survey that reached an agreement of more than 75% in the final Delphi round but are not covered by the ICF. One of them – posture – was already found not to be covered in the validation of the Comprehensive ICF Core Set for rheumatoid arthritis from the perspective of physical therapists.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1742395312451280">33</xref></sup> Takeyachi et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1742395312451280">34</xref></sup> found the restriction of functional status to be highly correlated with poor posture in patients with LBP. Therefore the development of an adequate category in the ICF and its inclusion in the Comprehensive ICF Core Set for LBP might be indicated.</p>
<p>The next point that needs to be stressed is the role of non-oral drugs in the physicians’ treatment of patients with LBP. Epidural injections of anaesthetics and/or steroids, intrathekal opioids, intramuscular NSAIDs, intravenous NMDA antagonists, transdermal opioids, facet blocks and paravertebral injections of botulinum toxin have been proposed in the literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1742395312451280">35</xref></sup> Although the ICF category <italic>e110 Products or substances for personal consumption</italic> includes drugs in its definition, this definition is limited to oral medication by the phrase ‘for ingestion’. An amendment to the categories’ definition may be useful to cover all aspects of drug treatment in LBP. Another issue not sufficiently covered by the ICF is neuropathic pain. The ICF category <italic>b280 Sensations of pain</italic> includes in its definition a broad spectrum of sensations, but the organization in the referring third- and forth-level categories cannot be looked upon as being satisfying in matters of LBP. In an unselected cohort of chronic LBP patients, 37% were found to have predominantly neuropathic pain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1742395312451280">36</xref></sup> Since neuropathic pain correlates with more intense pain, more severe co-morbidity and poorer quality of life than nociceptive pain,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1742395312451280">36</xref></sup> it seems to be necessary to have an adequate representation in the ICF.</p>
<p>There are some methodological aspects of this study which should be considered. First, the fact that only a small proportion of the physicians who were initially contacted, finally participated in the study, could have affected the results. Moreover, the technique of purposive sampling and the selection of participants based on their self-rating of LBP expertise could be associated with a bias. However, the Delphi technique proved to be an appropriate method for this study objective. With response rates between 86% and 96% in the single rounds, the reported rates of approximately 50% could be clearly surpassed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1742395312451280">37</xref></sup> The Kappa coefficient of 0.42 reached in this study reflects a barely ‘moderate’ agreement between the two persons who performed the linking.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1742395312451280">38</xref></sup> It is slightly lower than in other studies that used the same linking method.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1742395312451280">39</xref></sup> A possible explanation for the lower calibre in this study is that there were two health professionals from different backgrounds and native languages involved in the linking process. This should be taken into account for the selection and training of the health professionals in future studies.</p>
<p>Although participants with experience in the treatment of patients in the acute, early post-acute or the chronic situation were represented in our sample, the participants’ experiences with such subgroups of patients may have influenced the results. The application of the Comprehensive ICF Core Set for LBP in clinical practice will show whether it can be used for all subgroups of patients.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec12-1742395312451280" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Overall, the ICF Core Set for LBP demonstrated content validity from the perspective of physicians in our study. The problems identified in our study cover a specific set of categories important for the treatment by physicians. However, since the ICF Core Set for LBP was developed for interdisciplinary use it is not restricted to ICF categories which concern treatment by physicians. Additional categories are included which cover functional problems other health professions take care of, and even aspects of functioning which are relevant for the patients without being focus of any intervention. Consequently, in order to capture the entire scope of content validity, additional studies should examine the perspective of other health professions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1742395312451280">25</xref></sup> and the patient perspective.</p>
<p>The ICF Core Set for LBP defines which areas of functioning are relevant for patients with LBP and consequently should be assessed. Therefore, it can be used as a starting point in the assessment of a patient. A comprehensive functioning profile can be created which includes all relevant problems and resources of a patient. Furthermore, ICF Core Sets can be integrated into documentation systems for rehabilitation management, which facilitate goal setting, assignment of intervention targets to specific interventions and responsible health professionals and finally evaluation of goal achievement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1742395312451280">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1742395312451280">40</xref></sup></p>
