<p><italic>What It Means To Be a Muslim in India Today: A Report</italic> (henceforth referred to as the ‘Report’) was published by ANHAD (Act Now for Harmony and Democracy) in 2011. The report is a combined account of two tribunals organised by ANHAD in collaboration with the Human Rights Law Network and Siasat, Hyderabad. The first of these tribunals was held in Hyderabad in 2008 and was called ‘People’s Tribunal on the Atrocities Committed Against the Minorities in the Name of Fighting Terrorism’. The other one was the ‘National Meet on the Status of Muslims in Contemporary India’, held in Delhi in 2009.</p>
<p>The Report consists of testimonials by human rights activists, lawyers as well as ordinary citizens who have witnessed, or been at the receiving end of, transgressions of the rule of law in contemporary India, manifest in illegal detentions of Indian Muslims who are then subjected to biased governmental investigations, especially in the wake of the anti-terror climate that has gripped India after September 2001. As noted by members of the juries (whose membership included well-known academics like Zoya Hassan and Ashgar Ali Engineer, journalist Tarun Tejpal, as well as civil liberties activists such as Prashant Bhushan and the Late K.G. Kannabiran) at these tribunals, the testimonials served as a grim reminder of the negative prospects for secularism and democracy spawned by the disproportionate singling out of Indian Muslims as terror suspects.</p>
<p>The testimonials outline the processes through which an unjust sociopolitical order that prevents ordinary Indian Muslims from leading minimally decent lives is getting consolidated in India. For example, many speakers at the tribunals questioned the role of the media, especially the routine manner in which unsubstantiated charges against Indian Muslims are given disproportionate publicity leading to all the problems associated with ‘trial by media’ (pp. 12, 28, 29, 37, 164–65). Others have commented on the several hurdles in obtaining fair and just treatment faced by those accused of being ‘terror suspects’ (pp. 38, 168–69).</p>
<p>The depositions offered at the tribunals can be interpreted as pointing to the systematic suppression of a healthy dialogue among political institutions, a kind of dialogue that must characterise the operation of the rule of law in a healthy liberal democracy. However, the interventions recorded in the Report remain largely silent about some basic problems leading to a system that allows the reproduction of vulnerability for already marginalised constituencies. For example, although there is much attention given to the problems faced by the ‘accused’, there is not nearly as much focus given to the inadequacy of procedural norms that shape the way in which the accused can be treated. In other words, although there is no direct mention of this in the Report, it is quite clear that more attention needs to be paid to issues such as the content of the Code of Civil Procedure operating in India, and to considerations about its reform. Arguably, attention to such matters leads in the direction of recognising the seriousness of the activity of law-making itself, and from there, to questions of representation, all of which are vital for any system that is committed to a democratic law governed order. Without doubt, the materials contained in this Report will prompt concerned citizens, human rights activists and academics to consider addressing such questions, particularly because the observations with regard to the suspension of democratic and secular norms made by the participants of the tribunals poignantly highlight the very imperative of institutionalising the values of democracy and secularism in a political community as deeply diverse as India.</p>
<p>Aside from highlighting the problems for democracy from the point of view of the failure of the rule of law, the Report also contains materials that unravel the extent to which informal politics in India fall short of the requirements for democratic orders. Interventions about the nature of stigmatisation of Muslims in India, including the problem of the moral double standard exposed in the differential responses to organisations like the Students Islamic Movement of India (SIMI) and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) (p. 206), indicate growing intolerance toward minorities. Fearfully enough, the Report suggests that the trend in India with regard to the nature of informal politics bears stark similarities with the questionable ways in which North American and European polities are responding to the demands and activities of their Muslim inhabitants in the face of a growing dominance of the politics of security.</p>
<p>Other important issues pertaining to the Indian Muslim community highlighted in this report include the poor maintenance of Wakf properties (pp. 221–23), and the importance for Indian Muslims of securing good education to offset the vulnerability that has presently come to be their lot. Because of the presence of so many different dimensions of the plight of Muslim minorities in India, the Report could have gained significantly from the inclusion within it of an essay that pulled together the different facets in analytical manner. The text of the Report could endure closer editing as well.</p>
<p>Still, because it can familiarise the reader with the kinds of obstacle faced by Indian Muslims, the contents of this Report will be of great interest to scholars, activists and citizens that wish to address the lacunae in the formal and informal enactment of democratic politics in India.</p>
