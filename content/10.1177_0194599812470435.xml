<body>
<p>The anatomic location of the parotid gland makes its parenchyma and duct particularly prone to injury during trauma cases. Failure to identify and treat injuries to the parotid duct may result in late complications such as sialoceles that increase patient morbidity and discomfort. Initial management of sialoceles typically involves a conservative approach, although more aggressive techniques may be employed if the initial treatment fails.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599812470435">1</xref></sup> We present a case of 47-year-old female patient who developed a left parotid sialocele several days after receiving a penetrating injury to the left parotid region. We drained the sialocele intraorally using a 16-gauge angiocatheter that was left sutured in place to create a controlled intraoral drainage pathway.</p>

<title>Case Report</title>
<p>We obtained exemption from the Institutional Review Board at the University of Puerto Rico, School of Medicine. The patient is a 47-year-old female patient who, in December 2010, received multiple penetrating injuries to the face and neck with a kitchen knife. The patient was taken to the operating room to repair a small nick to the left internal jugular vein. During this intervention, no injury to the parotid duct was noted, and all open wounds were closed primarily. Ten days later, the patient was referred to the otolaryngology clinics for evaluation of a left parotid cystic mass that was confirmed to be a sialocele of the left parotid gland.</p>
<p>Initially, the sialocele was managed conservatively with repeated percutaneous aspirations, application of local pressure, and antisialogogues. As the sialocele kept recurring, we implemented a technique that provided a constant drainage pathway from the sialocele into the oral cavity. The procedure was performed at our clinics in January 2011. First, we passed 2 nylon sutures through opposite sides of a 16-gauge angiocatheter. After preparing the patient and infiltrating 1% lidocaine into the cheek mucosa, we introduced the catheter intraorally until puncturing the sialocele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0194599812470435"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>). This confirmed that the catheter was in the correct position within the capsule of the sialocele. A purse-string suturing technique using the 2 nylon sutures was finally employed to secure the catheter to the cheek mucosa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0194599812470435"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref>). The procedure was well tolerated by the patient, and there were no complications.</p>

<p>The patient was discharged home on prophylactic antibiotics. The weeks following the procedure, she never complained of pain, eating difficulties, catheter dislodgement, infection, or sialocele recurrence. The catheter was finally removed in the fourth week. During a 1-year follow-up period, there has been no evidence of sialocele recurrence or any other associated complications.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Sialoceles are periductal accumulations of saliva that typically develop 8 to 14 days after an injury to the parotid gland.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812470435">2</xref></sup> It is estimated that 21% of patients with penetrating trauma to the parotid region experience an injury to the parotid duct.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812470435">3</xref></sup> Failure to identify and treat these injuries may result in late complications such as sialoceles and/or cutaneous fistulas.</p>
<p>The current consensus is to repair severed parotid ducts whenever possible, but the reality is that many of these injuries often go undiagnosed, resulting in the delayed formation of sialoceles and/or other complications. Most sialoceles are initially managed conservatively. However, given their tendency to recur, more aggressive techniques that are risky and uncomfortable to the patient are oftentimes employed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599812470435">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>The prognosis for functional recovery of the gland with this type of injury is also very poor. Parekh et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812470435">2</xref></sup> reported their experience with 51 patients with trauma to the parotid region and concluded that with complete disruption of the parotid duct, there is a progressive diminution of function over time. Similarly, it has been shown that cicatrization from chronic parotid injuries leads to progressive parotid gland atrophy and poor glandular function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812470435">3</xref></sup> Not surprisingly, most techniques used to treat late complications of parotid gland injuries such as sialoceles seek to depress salivary secretions rather than reestablish glandular function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812470435">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599812470435">5</xref></sup> With time, parotid secretions will stop, as eventual gland atrophy takes place.</p>
<p>In this case, we implemented a safe and simple technique to solve a posttraumatic sialocele that carries marginal patient discomfort and that can be done in the outpatient setting. It provides a controlled pathway for salivary flow into the oral cavity, all while allowing the natural healing process of the gland to seal the injury by itself.</p>
