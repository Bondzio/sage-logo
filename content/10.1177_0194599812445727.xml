<sec id="section3-0194599812445727">
<title>Subjects and Methods</title>
<p>All patients who underwent total thyroidectomy with central neck dissection for PTC at Oregon Health &amp; Science University between 2005 and 2010 were screened for the presence of CLT and reviewed for clinical prognostic factors. Patients with inadequate central neck dissections were excluded. Molecular markers for PTC were analyzed on archived tumor samples.</p>

<sec id="section4-0194599812445727">
<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 139 patients met selection criteria. The rate of CLT was 43.8%. The rate of central node positivity was 63%. Presence of CLT was associated with a significantly lower proportion of central node metastases (49% vs 74%, <italic>P</italic> = .003) and angiolymphatic invasion (31% vs 15%, <italic>P</italic> = .03). There was no significant difference in mean age, tumor size, and extracapsular extension.

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The data indicate a lower incidence of central compartment lymph node metastasis in those with CLT in this patient population, suggesting a potential protective role in tumor spread. The equal distribution of tumor mutations between the carcinomas with and without evidence of CLT argues against a mutation-specific antigen as the immunologic stimulus. Further research is needed to characterize the role of autoimmunity in thyroid cancer.</p>

<body>
<p>The role of autoimmune thyroiditis in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) has been a topic of recent interest over the past decade. Hashimoto’s has been described as a risk factor for PTC in multiple studies; however, this is controversial, and the specific mechanism in carcinogenesis in this subgroup of patients remains unknown. Others maintain that the cancer itself is the eliciting factor for the autoimmune reaction.</p>
<p>Regardless, the prevalence of chronic lymphocytic infiltrate, indicating autoimmune thyroiditis, may be present in thyroid tissue of patients with PTC even without symptoms. Pathologic studies have revealed that the prevalence of this infiltrate is high in PTC, with studies ranging from 17.7% to 58%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599812445727">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812445727"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812445727">3</xref></sup> A meta analysis by Singh et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812445727">4</xref></sup> demonstrated that the rate of chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis (CLT) was 2.77 times higher in patients with PTC compared with controls and 1.9 times higher compared with other types of thyroid cancer. Tamimi<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599812445727">5</xref></sup> confirmed that a lymphocytic infiltrate was significantly higher in patients with papillary carcinoma (58%) than in patients with follicular carcinoma (20%) or follicular adenoma (14%).</p>
<p>Several studies have analyzed the presence of thyroiditis with respect to predictors of tumor aggressiveness and nodal metastasis; however, a major limitation of many studies on this topic is the lack of a strict definition of lymph node status. It is well known that the incidence of occult cervical lymph node metastasis is high, with estimates of up to 60% of affected patients having positive lymph nodes despite a clinically node-negative neck.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599812445727">6</xref></sup> In addition, recent studies have demonstrated that node positivity has been shown to be associated with a higher recurrence rate of up to 30%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599812445727">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599812445727">8</xref></sup> Given the high rate of occult metastases in PTC, one cannot be certain that the lymph node status is truly N0 unless all nodes in the “at-risk” basin are analyzed.</p>
<p>In this study, we evaluate the hypothesis that CLT in PTC may represent an autoimmune response to the tumor and that the response may hinder tumor spread with regard to central nodal metastases. In addition, we reviewed the commonly studied molecular markers of mutations in this population to determine whether there is an association with CLT and specific mutations.</p>
<sec id="section6-0194599812445727" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Institutional review board (IRB) approval was obtained through the Oregon Health and Science University (OHSU) IRB (#00002844). Specimens were obtained from archived tissue of all patients enrolled in the OHSU Pathology archives who underwent total thyroidectomy with central neck dissection for PTC over a 5-year period between January 2005 and January 2010. We excluded all patients who had insufficient tissue for evaluation or inadequate central neck dissections to adequately evaluate for central nodal spread.</p>
<p>An adequate central neck dissection was defined as follows: for those with positive nodal disease, a minimum of 1 positive node had to be identified. For those with no evidence of nodal disease, the operative reports were reviewed to ensure that a minimum of a complete ipsilateral paratracheal and pretracheal dissection was performed, with the superior border as the hyoid bone, the inferior border as the innominate artery, and the lateral border as the carotid artery.</p>
<p>The pathology was reviewed for tumor type and subtype as well as evaluation of the presence of a chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis in the nontumor tissue. For the purposes of this article, CLT was considered positive when the staff pathologist at this institution described the nonneoplastic thyroid as having characteristics such as “Hashimoto’s thyroiditis,” “chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis,” or “chronic lymphocytic infiltrate.”</p>
<p>Molecular tumor markers for papillary thyroid carcinoma were analyzed from archived tissue. Each tumor was subjected to a panel of mutation testing as demonstrated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0194599812445727"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>. Mutation analysis was performed in the Heinrich-Corless laboratories (Oregon Health Sciences Laboratory, Portland, Oregon).</p>

<p>For mutations requiring denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC), DHPLC was performed according to a standardized protocol. Aliquots of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products of tumor DNA were screened for mutations on a Transgenomic WAVE HPLC system (Transgenomic, Inc, Omaha, Nebraska) run at nondenaturing or partially denaturing temperatures. All of the DHPLC-detected anomalies were further evaluated by bidirectional sequencing on an ABI 310 sequencer using the Big Dye Terminator kit (Applied Biosystems, Inc, Foster City, California). Reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) was performed using standardized protocols on a Stratagene 3100 (Stratagene, La Jolla, California).</p>
<p>The Sequenom MassARRAY System (Sequenom, San Diego, California) was acquired partway through the data analysis, and most of the samples ran after 2008 were screened with this device using the solid tumor panel demonstrated below (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0194599812445727"><bold>Table 2</bold></xref>). Any samples with low confidence results were sequenced to confirm the presence or absence of a mutation.</p>

<p>Finally, all patient charts were reviewed for age, gender, family history, imaging studies, gross nodal disease at surgery, tumor histology, multifocality, extracapsular extension, angiolymphatic invasion, and nodal metastasis. Papillary thyroid carcinoma in multifocal lesions was classified only by the largest type. We have also shown in a previous study that the follicular variant of PTC results in fewer central nodal metastases and, therefore, controlled for this tumor type to eliminate this bias. Statistical analysis was performed using the χ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812445727">2</xref></sup> test or Fisher exact test, where appropriate.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 139 patients with PTC met the selection criteria for this study. Overall, there was a significantly higher proportion of central node metastasis (CNM) in the group without evidence of CLT (74% vs 49%, <italic>P</italic> = .003).</p>
<p>Demographic data are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0194599812445727"><bold>Table 3</bold></xref>. The mean age was 42.8, and 80% were female. The overall rate of chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis was 43.8%, and the overall rate of metastasis to central nodes was 63%. Preoperative fine-needle aspiration (FNA) was performed in 97.1% of patients. In the CLT group, preoperative FNA was consistent with PTC in 78.7% and suspicious for PTC in 8.2% (total 86.9%), whereas in the non-CLT group, FNA was consistent with PTC in 64.1% and suspicious for PTC in 24.4% (total 88.5%). The mean age was 39.6 (95% confidence interval [CI], 36.7-42.5) and 45.6 (41.9-49.2) in the CLT and normal thyroid groups, respectively, which was not significant but with a trend toward younger age in the thyroiditis group.</p>

<p>There was a significant difference in gender, with women more likely than men to have evidence of CLT (49% vs 25%, <italic>P</italic> = .02). To address this potential bias, we performed a separate analysis with women only. In the female-only analysis, the proportion of central node metastasis in women remained significantly higher in the normal thyroid group compared with the CLT group (72% vs 46%, <italic>P</italic> = .006).</p>
<p>Tumor subtype analysis revealed a trend toward PTC–follicular variant having a higher incidence of concurrent CLT; however, this was not significant. When controlled for tumor subtype, there remained a significantly higher proportion of central node positivity in the group without evidence of CLT (<italic>P</italic> = .02).</p>
<p>Finally, there was a trend toward a lower rate of distant metastasis in the CLT group, but this was not statistically significant (1.8% vs 9.4%, <italic>P</italic> = .12).</p>
<p>A summary of the mutation analysis can be viewed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0194599812445727"><bold>Table 4</bold></xref>. Overall, 77% of tumors had positive mutations, and 23% of the tumors had no identifiable mutation. The 2 most common PTC-associated mutations identified in this population were BRAF V600E point mutation (63% overall) and RET-PTC1 translocations (8% overall). Neither of these gene mutations differed between the CLT vs normal thyroid groups (64% and 62% for BRAF, 7% and 9% for RET-PTC1).</p>

<title>CLT and Tumor Aggressiveness</title>
<p>Few studies have evaluated the correlation of chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis and tumor aggressiveness of papillary thyroid carcinoma. In 1998, Schaffler et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599812445727">9</xref></sup> demonstrated that the presence of CLT was associated with lower stage. Larger retrospective studies have also demonstrated similar results. Kashima et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599812445727">10</xref></sup> reviewed histological slides from 2225 patients with PTC and found significantly improved locoregional control and improved 10-year disease-free survival in patients with evidence of CLT (95% vs 85%, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001). Loh et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599812445727">11</xref></sup> reviewed 735 patients with PTC and demonstrated a significant improvement in overall survival and in cancer recurrence rates in patients who had evidence of lymphocytic thyroiditis.</p>
<p>However, other studies have not shown significant associations. A 2008 study by Del Rio et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599812445727">12</xref></sup> investigating CLT and markers of tumor aggressiveness found no correlation with the presence of chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis and sex, age, size, capsular invasion, angioinvasion, or multifocality.</p>
<p>As discussed previously, a major limitation of many studies on this topic is the lack of a strict definition of lymph node status. Given the potentially high rate of occult metastases in PTC, one cannot be certain that the lymph node status is truly N0 without formal analysis of at-risk nodes. In this study, all patients underwent a central neck dissection to more accurately define the central compartment lymph node status.</p>
<p>Our data indicate a lower incidence of central lymph node metastasis in those with chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis in our patient population (<italic>P</italic> = .002). This is in agreement with a recent study by Kim et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599812445727">13</xref></sup> which showed a significantly lower incidence of lymph node metastasis in the central compartment with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. This finding suggests a potential protective role of autoimmune thyroiditis in lymphatic tumor spread. In addition, the rate of angiolymphatic invasion was significantly lower in this group (<italic>P</italic> = .02), which supports this finding. Furthermore, there were no statistically significant differences between age, tumor subtype, tumor size, multifocality, or extracapsular extension.</p>
<p>Overall, our incidence of CLT in PTC tumors is high (43.8%). However, this is consistent with previously published studies. In this study, the presence or absence of CLT in each case was determined by a single staff pathologist at our institution at the time of the initial thyroidectomy. The sensitivity and specificity of this is not well defined, which highlights a potential weakness of this study. The addition of a second pathologist for slide review may increase both sensitivity and specificity and should be considered in future studies.</p>
<p>We also had a relatively high rate of lymph node metastases overall (63%). Although this is not uncommon for a tertiary referral center, this high rate may also be explained by higher sensitivity due to the comprehensiveness of central neck dissections required for this study. We feel that this is a strength of this study, as most studies have not rigorously defined the node negative status, contributing to insensitive measure bias.</p>
<p>Potential biases of this study exist. First, there was a nearly 2-fold higher percentage of women with PTC who also had evidence of CLT. Several other studies have demonstrated that females are more likely to harbor CLT in the presence of PTC.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599812445727">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0194599812445727">15</xref></sup> However, when we controlled for sex in this analysis, similar results were obtained; in the female-only analysis, there remains a significantly lower incidence of lymph node metastases in the presence of CLT (72% vs 46%, <italic>P</italic> = .006). It is unclear why women are more likely to present with evidence of lymphocytic infiltrate; however, if we consider the infiltrate to represent a mounting immune response, this may help to explain why female sex is associated with improved prognosis.</p>
<p>Second, although no significant differences were found between age and tumor size, there was a trend toward lower age and size in the CLT population.</p>
<p>Although this study achieved significance in demonstrating an association between decreased central node dissection and angiolymphatic invasion, we were not able to correlate other markers of tumor aggressiveness with lack of CLT in this study (namely, extracapsular extension and distant metastases). These may be expected to be reduced as well; however, this study may have been underpowered to detect significant differences in these parameters.</p>

<title>Molecular Markers and CLT</title>
<p>Molecular markers may be of use in determining the mechanism of the high incidence of PTC and Hashimoto’s disease. A recent article by Royer et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0194599812445727">16</xref></sup> examined the incidence of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in <italic>hOGG1</italic>, a major repair gene for free radical–induced oxidative DNA damage in PTC specimens, Hashimoto’s specimens, and benign goiter specimens. They discovered that <italic>hOGG1</italic> LOH is strongly associated with PTC and Hashimoto’s thyroiditis (HT), but not with benign thyroid lesions, and suggest that longstanding HT with this mutation may represent a precursor lesion of PTC. Larson et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599812445727">14</xref></sup> used immunohistochemistry to demonstrate that PI3K/Akt expression was increased in both HT and well-differentiated thyroid cancer. The role of specific PTC mutations such as BRAF and RET-PTC in tumor immunogenicity is still unclear.</p>
<p>In this study, there is an equal distribution of tumor mutations between the carcinomas with and without evidence of CLT, which argues against a tumorigenic effect of the inflammation. Our tumor panel was relatively comprehensive, and causative mutations were identified in more than 75% of our tumors. The 2 most common PTC associated mutations identified in this population were BRAF V600E point mutation (63% overall) and RET-PTC1 translocations (8% overall). Neither of these gene mutations differed between the tumors with or without associated CLT (64% and 62% for BRAF, 7% and 9% for RET-PTC1), suggesting that the inflammatory response is independent of these genotypes.</p>
<p>The literature largely supports this theory. Sadow et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0194599812445727">17</xref></sup> evaluated 28 consecutive HT-associated nodules and demonstrated no mutations of BRAF, RET-PTC, or RAS mutations, but those that were associated with PTC did demonstrate a 40% rate of BRAF mutations. Kim et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0194599812445727">18</xref></sup> also examined the incidence of BRAF mutations in PTC with and without HT, as well as HT alone, and discovered that BRAF was highest in PTC tumors with no HT (90%), lower in tumors with HT (64%), and in none of the Hashimoto’s-only specimens. Nikiforova et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0194599812445727">19</xref></sup> specifically analyzed RET PTC rearrangements, finding that tumors harboring this mutation are not likely to be associated with an inflammatory response. Furthermore, RET/PTC rearrangements were not detected in PTC arising in the background of HT, and no RET-PTC rearrangements were detected in HT alone; however, they did find a 33% prevalence among papillary carcinomas not associated with HT.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Overall, our data support the hypothesis that an autoimmune response to PTC as characterized by a microscopic lymphocytic infiltrate may provide some protection against angiolymphatic spread and central lymph node metastases. No correlation was found between definitive tumor mutations and the presence of a lymphocytic inflammatory response, arguing against a mutation-specific antigen as the immunologic stimulus. Further research is needed to characterize the role of autoimmunity in thyroid cancer.</p>
