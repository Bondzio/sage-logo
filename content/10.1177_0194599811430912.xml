<p><italic>Objective</italic>. (1) Characterize risk factors for subsequent tonsillectomy in pediatric patients undergoing primary adenoidectomy for upper airway obstruction. (2) Compare rates of subsequent tonsillectomy between adenoidectomy patients with and without upper airway obstruction.</p>
<p><italic>Study Design</italic>. Historical cohort study with a nested case-control study. Cohort data were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier plots and a multiple regression model. Case-control data were analyzed using logistic regression.</p>
<p><italic>Subjects and Methods</italic>. Patients undergoing adenoidectomy without tonsillectomy at the University of Missouri between 1995 and 2010 were identified using billing records and selected chart review. A nested case-control study with detailed chart review was conducted to determine predictors of subsequent tonsillectomy in patients with upper airway obstruction.</p>
<p><italic>Results</italic>. Of 1291 patients identified in the historical cohort, 7.8% later underwent tonsillectomy. Age younger than 3 years (<italic>P</italic> = .027), female sex (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001), and upper airway obstruction (<italic>P</italic> = .001) were found to be significant predictors of subsequent tonsillectomy. In the nested case-control study, potential predictors investigated included adenoidectomy indications, symptoms, smoke exposure, weight, comorbidities, and tonsil size at the time of adenoidectomy. Of these, only tonsil size was significant, with an increased odds of future tonsillectomy of 2.5 (<italic>P</italic> = .01) for each unit increase in tonsil size.</p>
<p><italic>Conclusion.</italic> Patients undergoing adenoidectomy for upper airway obstruction are likely to be at an increased risk of subsequent tonsillectomy when compared with those with other indications. Within this subgroup of patients with upper airway obstruction, young age, female sex, and large tonsil size may further increase the risk of subsequent tonsillectomy.</p>

<body>
<p>Adenoidectomy without tonsillectomy is the third most common surgical procedure performed in children, with 132,000 performed in the United States in 2006.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599811430912">1</xref></sup> Common indications for adenoidectomy are recurrent or chronic otitis media, Eustachian tube dysfunction, chronic nasal obstruction with mouth breathing, and chronic or recurrent sinusitis. When the indication is upper airway obstruction, including obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS), tonsillectomy is often performed concurrently with adenoidectomy. The incidence of adenotonsillectomy for this indication, relative to other indications, has risen in recent years. Upper airway obstruction was present in 12% of patients undergoing adenotonsillectomy in 1970 vs 77% of patients in 2005.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599811430912">2</xref></sup> The role of adenoidectomy alone for upper airway obstruction, however, remains unclear. Situations arise in which patients with symptoms of OSAS are found to have large adenoids but small tonsils. Conversely, patients may present with nasal obstruction and mouth breathing alone, without other symptoms of OSAS, but have incidentally large tonsils. It is expected that a certain percentage of patients undergoing adenoidectomy alone will eventually require tonsillectomy. A recent study by Kay et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599811430912">3</xref></sup> identified younger patients and those with large tonsils as being at increased risk of subsequent tonsillectomy. This study also suggested a possible increased risk when adenoidectomy was performed for upper airway obstruction, but this did not reach statistical significance. The objective of the present study is to further characterize potential risk factors for subsequent tonsillectomy, particularly when adenoidectomy is performed for upper airway obstruction.</p>
<sec id="section1-0194599811430912" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>This study received approval by the University of Missouri’s institutional review board and was compliant with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act.</p>
<p>A historical cohort was identified by searching the billing records of the University of Missouri Hospital from July 1, 1995, to July 1, 2010, using <italic>Current Procedural Terminology</italic> (<italic>CPT</italic>) codes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599811430912">4</xref></sup> Patients were included if they had undergone primary adenoidectomy and were younger than 12 years and were excluded if they had either a previous tonsillectomy or a tonsillectomy on the same date. Within this cohort, patients who later underwent tonsillectomy were identified. Data points recorded for this cohort included date of birth, sex, date of adenoidectomy, indications for adenoidectomy, and date of tonsillectomy (if performed). Indications for adenoidectomy were determined primarily by the <italic>International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification</italic> (<italic>ICD-9-CM</italic>) codes recorded in the billing record.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599811430912">5</xref></sup> In cases where the <italic>ICD-9-CM</italic> codes were ambiguous, charts were manually reviewed to identify whether upper airway obstruction was present as a diagnosis. Examples of these ambiguous codes include 474.12 (hypertrophy of adenoids alone), 478.1 (other disease of the nasal cavity and sinuses), 478 (other disease of the respiratory tract), 519.8 (other disease of the respiratory system NOS), 770.8 (other respiratory problems after birth), and 786.9 (other symptoms involving respiratory system and chest). Patients were then divided into 2 groups: one including the indication of upper airway obstruction (as determined by clinical diagnosis) and a second group not including this indication. Patients were included in the former group if a diagnosis of upper airway obstruction was present, even if other indications were also present. Using tonsillectomy as the “failure” event, these data were analyzed with Kaplan-Meier curves and a multiple logistic regression model to identify risk factors.</p>
<p>To further investigate potential risk factors specifically in the group of adenoidectomy patients with upper airway obstruction, a nested case-control study was designed. A case, or “failure,” was defined as a patient undergoing adenoidectomy for upper airway obstruction who later underwent tonsillectomy. A control, or “success,” was defined as a patient undergoing adenoidectomy for upper airway obstruction who did not later undergo tonsillectomy. Each case was matched with 2 controls based on age, sex, and time since adenoidectomy. A case-to-control ratio of 1:2 was chosen instead of a 1:1 ratio to increase statistical power. These charts were then manually reviewed for ethnicity, weight, indications for adenoidectomy (nasal airway obstruction, OSAS, ear disease, and/or sinus disease), concurrent procedures performed at the time of adenoidectomy, presenting symptoms/signs (nasal congestion, snoring, mouth breathing, and/or witnessed apnea), smoke exposure, comorbidities (gastroesophageal reflux, asthma, inhalant allergy, food allergy, developmental/genetic/metabolic disorders, and other airway lesions), adenoid size, and tonsil size (using the standard clinical 0 to 4+ scale). Additional data collected only for “failures” included indication for tonsillectomy, whether revision adenoidectomy was also performed, and adenoid and tonsil size at the time of tonsillectomy. Adenoid size was excluded from analysis because of inconsistent and vague descriptions predominating in the medical record. Data were analyzed with logistic regression to identify significant risk factors.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 1291 patients who underwent adenoidectomy without tonsillectomy were identified in the historical cohort, including 779 (60.3%) boys and 512 (39.7%) girls. Ages ranged from 0.2 to 11.7 years, with a mean of 4.5 years. Broadly categorized, indications for adenoidectomy included middle ear disease in 1036 (80.2%), upper airway obstruction in 376 (29.1%), and sinus disease in 134 (10.4%). Within this cohort, 101 (7.8%) patients later underwent tonsillectomy. Time since adenoidectomy ranged from 0 to 15 years, with a median of 5.1 years. Time to tonsillectomy ranged from 0.2 to 10.5 years, with a median of 1.8 years and with 92% of tonsillectomies occurring within 5 years (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0194599811430912"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Based on a fitted multiple logistic regression model, significant independent predictors of subsequent tonsillectomy within the adenoidectomy cohort as a whole included age younger than 3 years, female sex, and an indication of upper airway obstruction at adenoidectomy. Results of this regression analysis are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0194599811430912"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>. Kaplan-Meier estimates were used to compare tonsillectomy rates over time. Patients younger than 3 years had a higher rate of subsequent tonsillectomy than those age 3 years or older (15% vs 8%, respectively, at 10 years, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). The indication of obstruction remained a significant factor within the female subgroup of patients (tonsillectomy rates at 10 years, 17% with obstruction vs 9% without obstruction, <italic>P</italic> = .031) but not within the male subgroup (tonsillectomy rates at 10 years, 8% with obstruction vs 11% without obstruction, <italic>P</italic> = .32) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0194599811430912"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref>). Within the group with airway obstruction at the time of adenoidectomy, girls younger than 3 years had the highest rate of subsequent tonsillectomy (at 10 years) of 28% vs 5% for boys age 3 years or older (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0194599811430912"><bold>Figure 3</bold></xref>).</p>

<p>The nested case-control study included 91 patients—31 failures (cases) and 60 successes (controls). Two controls out of the 62 initially matched controls were excluded because no records were available for review. The 3 matching variables (age, sex, and follow-up time) did not vary significantly between the groups. Of the cases, 74.2% of tonsillectomies were performed for OSAS, and 38.7% were performed for recurrent or chronic tonsillitis, with 12.9% having both OSAS and tonsillitis. Revision adenoidectomy was performed in 36.7% of cases. Patients having tonsillectomy for OSAS tended to be younger at the time of initial adenoidectomy (mean, 2.6 years) than patients without this indication (mean, 5.2 years) (<italic>P</italic> = .02). Tonsil sizes at the time of adenoidectomy and at subsequent tonsillectomy were known in 25 cases. Tonsil size increased from a mean (SD) of 2.32 (0.71) to 2.84 (0.76) (<italic>P</italic> = .01), using a 2-tailed paired samples <italic>t</italic> test.</p>
<p>Initial data analysis with crosstabs, summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0194599811430912"><bold>Table 2</bold></xref>, was conducted to identify potential predictors. Tonsil size, inhalant allergy, food allergy, and the symptom of mouth breathing were selected for inclusion in the logistic regression analysis. Tonsil size was the only variable that showed statistical significance and remained in the regression equation, with results as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0194599811430912"><bold>Table 3</bold></xref>. Large tonsil size was a predictor of future tonsillectomy, with each increase of tonsil size by 1 unit (eg, 2+ to 3+) associated with an increase in odds of tonsillectomy by 2.5 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-5.2, <italic>P</italic> = .01). No other significant predictors were identified.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study demonstrates that patients undergoing adenoidectomy for upper airway obstruction have an increased rate of subsequent tonsillectomy when compared with those with other indications. In addition, certain patients undergoing adenoidectomy for upper airway obstruction may be at especially increased risk of requiring subsequent tonsillectomy. The highest risk patients based on our data are those younger than 3 years, girls, and those with large tonsils.</p>
<p>Our findings are in general agreement with those by Kay et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599811430912">3</xref></sup> In their study, which included 2462 patients over a 5.4-year period, there was a significantly higher rate of subsequent tonsillectomy in younger children (28.7% in children younger than 2 years, 14.8% for ages 2-4 years, 6.1% for ages 5-7 years, and 2% for age older than 7 years). A similar trend was identified in our study, which found a rate of 15% for children younger than 3 years vs 8% for children age 3 years or older. Kay et al suspected that the risk of subsequent tonsillectomy may be higher in patients with upper airway obstruction, but this trend did not reach statistical significance in their study. In our study, we found the indication of upper airway obstruction to double the risk of subsequent tonsillectomy, with an odds ratio (95% CI) of 2.0 (1.3-3.0, <italic>P</italic> = .001). Notably, whereas upper airway obstruction was noted as an indication for adenoidectomy in 29% of our patients, Kay et al noted a 78% incidence of this indication. This difference could represent institutional differences—patients may be more likely to undergo tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy for upper airway obstruction at our institution and therefore be excluded from the historical cohort. This difference could also be due in part to differences in methodology between the studies. The indication of upper airway obstruction in our study was determined primarily by review of billing records for the cohort, whereas Kay et al determined this indication by chart review within a case-control subgroup. Kay et al found tonsil size at the time of adenoidectomy to be a significant risk factor for subsequent tonsillectomy, with each unit increase in tonsil size associated with a 1.6 times increased risk of tonsillectomy (95% CI, 1.2-2.1, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). Our study demonstrated a 2.5 times increased risk per unit increase in tonsil size (95% CI, 1.2-5.2, <italic>P</italic> = .01). The slightly higher number in our study may relate to our selective examination of only patients with upper airway obstruction.</p>
<p>A finding in the present study, which was not reported by Kay et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599811430912">3</xref></sup> is the association of female sex with an increased rate of subsequent tonsillectomy. This association is strongest in the group of patients with upper airway obstruction. Within this group, the majority (60.9%) of patients initially undergoing adenoidectomy were boys, whereas the majority (58.1%) of patients undergoing subsequent tonsillectomy were girls (<italic>P</italic> = .033). It is unclear whether this finding relates to any true difference in the underlying pathophysiology of OSAS or different degrees of lymphoid hyperplasia between sexes. There is insufficient evidence in this study to support or reject either of these possibilities. It is possible that boys with upper airway obstruction were more likely to undergo tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy as an initial procedure and therefore would not have been included in the historical cohort. It has previously been demonstrated that, among all patients undergoing tonsillectomy, a higher proportion are female.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599811430912">2</xref></sup> Our data could simply represent a manifestation of this underlying trend. Social factors could play a role as well, as parents may be more likely to seek medical attention for a young girl with loud snoring or other signs of sleep apnea while seeing these symptoms as less alarming in a boy. This explanation could also account for the lack of association of upper airway obstruction with higher future tonsillectomy rates in the male subgroup.</p>
<p>An earlier study by Young<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599811430912">6</xref></sup> also examined tonsillectomy rates after adenoidectomy. In this study, a cohort of 609 patients who underwent adenoidectomy without tonsillectomy was examined at a follow-up period of 6 to 9 years. Seventy-three (12%) later underwent tonsillectomy. Age was also a significant factor, with a tonsillectomy rate of 23.6% in patients younger than 6 years and 4.9% for those age 6 years or older. These rates are higher than the rates in both our study and the study by Kay et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599811430912">3</xref></sup> who suggested that this difference could relate to shifting trends in indications for tonsillectomy.</p>
<p>Strengths of this study include a long follow-up period and more focused analysis of those patients with an indication of upper airway obstruction. Concurrent tonsillectomy is more likely to be considered in the setting of upper airway obstruction rather than other indications. Thus, knowing predictors of future tonsillectomy would be more useful in this group of patients. Weaknesses of this study include its retrospective design and single-institution patient population, as well as relatively low number of cases. It is also possible that patients underwent tonsillectomy at another facility, in which case the calculated rates are underestimates. Furthermore, the methods used in the current study did not permit distinguishing those patients with upper airway obstruction as the primary indication for adenoidectomy from those with upper airway obstruction as a secondary, less clinically significant indication. Nevertheless, it was not the goal of this study to determine the roles of primary vs secondary diagnoses but rather to examine the impact of the presence vs absence of upper airway obstruction. In addition, inconsistencies in documentation made reliable determination of symptoms and comorbidities difficult. Whereas most (74.2%) subsequent tonsillectomies in the case-control portion of the study were performed for OSAS, more than a quarter of cases did not have this indication. We did not have a sufficiently large sample size to further parse down this group by tonsillectomy indication.</p>
<p>Adenoidectomy without tonsillectomy has been shown to provide significant short-term benefit for patients with upper airway obstruction and small tonsils. Bahadir et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599811430912">7</xref></sup> prospectively studied 60 patients, aged 14 months to 10 years, with adenoid hypertrophy without tonsil hypertrophy, who underwent adenoidectomy without tonsillectomy. Symptoms of nasal obstruction, mouth breathing, and snoring were assessed preoperatively and 2 months postoperatively. Fifty-three patients (88.3%) had complete resolution of all preoperative symptoms at 2-month follow-up. It is unknown, however, what percentage of these patients would later relapse because of tonsil hypertrophy.</p>
<p>At our institution, adenoidectomy without tonsillectomy is being performed more frequently for upper airway obstruction and in younger patients. This trend is consistent with the recent literature. Shatz<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599811430912">8</xref></sup> demonstrated that adenoidectomy alone is a safe and effective operation in infants younger than 1 year with OSAS. In this study, 24 otherwise healthy infants with symptoms of upper airway obstruction, physical signs of &gt;50% nasopharyngeal obstruction by adenoid hypertrophy, and polysomnography demonstrating OSAS underwent adenoidectomy alone. All patients clinically improved in short-term (1-month) follow-up, with the apnea-hypopnea index decreasing from a preoperative mean of 16.72 to a postoperative mean of 0.99. Again, this study is limited by very short-term follow-up information.</p>
<p>When considering whether to perform tonsillectomy at the time of adenoidectomy, the otolaryngologist needs to consider the added risk and morbidity of tonsillectomy vs the potential morbidity of undertreated airway obstruction and risk and morbidity of a second surgical procedure. The most common potentially serious complication of adenotonsillar surgery is postoperative hemorrhage. Adenoidectomy has been shown to have a much lower risk of postoperative hemorrhage than tonsillectomy. In a retrospective study by Windfuhr et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599811430912">9</xref></sup> a postoperative hemorrhage rate of 0.25% was found in 8086 patients undergoing adenoidectomy alone. None of these patients required blood transfusion or external carotid artery ligation, and there were no deaths in this group. In the same study, a postoperative hemorrhage rate of 2.86% was found in a group of 7132 patients undergoing tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy, with 0.06% requiring blood transfusion, 0.11% requiring external carotid artery ligation, and 1 case (0.014%) resulting in death.</p>
<p>When pursuing surgical treatment for upper airway obstruction, including OSAS, in children, the choice of adenotonsillectomy vs adenoidectomy alone is not always clear. In a study by Kay et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599811430912">3</xref></sup> groups of otolaryngologists from the American Academy of Otolaryngology—Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS) and American Society of Pediatric Otolaryngology (ASPO) were surveyed about current practices related to adenotonsillectomy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599811430912">10</xref></sup> When presented with the case of a patient with OSAS, enlarged adenoids, and small tonsils, both groups were more likely to offer adenoidectomy alone. When presented with the case of a patient with symptomatic enlarged adenoids and incidentally noted large tonsils, both groups would still tend to offer adenoidectomy alone. The AAO-HNS members, however, were more likely than ASPO members to offer tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy in the latter scenario.</p>
<p>Based on our data, stratification by symptoms or comorbidities does not have significant predictive value for risk of future tonsillectomy in patients undergoing adenoidectomy alone. Further study, preferably in a prospective fashion, would be helpful. Results of this study may, however, allow better counseling of parents of patients with upper airway obstruction who are considering surgical management. Specifically, patients younger than 3 years, females, and those with large tonsils may have the highest risk of requiring subsequent tonsillectomy.</p>
