<abstract>
<p>The syncytiotrophoblast is a multinuclear cell layer maintained through fusion events with cytotrophoblasts and plays a key role in the properties of the placenta. Monitoring fusion in this cell layer is important in studies aimed at understanding its function. We herein propose a new fusion assay based on the transactivating potential of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Tat protein on its promoter present in the long terminal repeat (LTR) region. We used 2 BeWo cell populations, one stably transfected with the HIV-1 LTR positioned upstream of the luciferase gene and the other stably transfected with a Tat expression vector. Both stable cell lines were responsive to Tat-mediated LTR transactivation and demonstrated normal fusion and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) secretion upon stimulation. When both BeWo cell lines were cocultured, forskolin-mediated induction of fusion led to an increase in luciferase activity, which was sensitive to anti-syncytin 1 and -2 antibodies and syncytin 2 small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). Similar results were obtained in primary trophoblasts. Our results highlight the effectiveness and accuracy of this new quantification assay for trophoblast fusion.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The growth and development of the placenta, an auxiliary fetal organ present between the mother and the fetus, is a fundamental process that involves the differentiation and renewal of trophoblast cells. Cytotrophoblasts and the syncytiotrophoblast appear to be key players in placental development. Indeed, the syncytiotrophoblast layer results from the fusion of villous trophoblast cells and its renewal is constantly assured during pregnancy. The syncytiotrophoblast permits the exchange of nutrients and hormones between the mother and the fetus.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1933719111424437">1</xref>
</sup> Syncytialization, the fusion of cells into a multinuclear syncytium, is thereby a normal morphogenic feature of the formation of the syncytiotrophoblast layer. Syncytin 1 and -2 are 2 envelope proteins derived from human endogenous retroviruses (HERV)-W and HERV-FRD, respectively, which play an important role in these cell fusion events.<sup>

</sup>
</p>
<p>Many research groups have been studying this biological process, trying to elucidate the fusion mechanism and the effect of numerous drugs on the fusogenic potential of trophoblasts in vitro (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1933719111424437">Refs 6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1933719111424437">7</xref>). Indeed, a better understanding of the mechanistic regulation of trophoblast fusion is necessary to more closely determine the alteration of placenta development in the various associated disorders such as preeclampsia. Previous studies have used in vitro systems to study trophoblast differentiation and fusion. For example, human cytotrophoblasts can be isolated from placenta and are known to spontaneously fuse when cultured. In addition, the human BeWo choriocarcinoma cell line can differentiate and form syncytia in the presence of forskolin induced adenylyl cyclase, which increases the intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels.<sup>

</sup> Over the years, research groups have developed methods to quantify fusion events, some of which are based on 2-color fluorescence assay or immunofluorescence using membrane-staining antibodies.<sup>

</sup> However, these methods are tedious and not always easily quantifiable.</p>
<p>In the present study, our objective was to develop a new quantitative assay to evaluate trophoblast fusion. Based on previous syncytium assays that we have developed for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and human T cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1),<sup>

</sup> we have made use of the powerful HIV-1 Tat transactivator, which strongly upregulates viral gene expression through its interaction with the RNA hairpin structure known as the <italic>trans</italic>-activating response region (TAR) located in the long terminal repeat (LTR).<sup>

</sup> Using an HIV-1 Tat-responsive luciferase reporter gene construct stably transfected into BeWo cells, we have developed a technique that enables us to quantify trophoblast fusion. Our results show that this quantitative method, which does not affect the integrity of trophoblastic cells, is specific and rapid. This new system should be a useful tool to greatly improve our comprehension of syncytiotrophoblast formation during the development of the placenta.</p>

<title>Cell Culture</title>
<p>The human BeWo choriocarcinoma cell line was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, Virginia) and was maintained in Ham F-12 medium (Invitrogen Canada Inc, Burlington, Canada) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum ([FBS] PAA Laboratories Inc, Toronto, Canada) and 2 mmol/L <sc>l</sc>-glutamine at 37°C in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere.</p>
<p>Placentas from 35 to 41 weeks of gestation were obtained immediately after spontaneous vaginal delivery, in accordance with the established guidelines of the ethic committee of St-Luc Hospital of the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Montréal (Montréal, Canada) and of the Université du Québec à Montréal (Montréal, Canada). Primary trophoblasts were isolated from human placentas of uncomplicated term pregnancy following a previously adapted published protocol.<sup>

</sup> Briefly, placental villi were cut and thoroughly washed to remove blood. Thereafter, they were incubated 4 times in a digestion medium composed of Hanks balanced salt solution containing trypsin (from 9.6 × 10<sup>5</sup> to 1.8 × 10<sup>6</sup> U per digestion) and deoxyribonuclease I ([DNase I] Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, Indiana; from 19 to 37.5 mg per digestion) for 30 minutes at 37°C in a water bath with continuous shaking. The dispersed cells were layered on top of a discontinuous 5% to 70% Percoll gradient and centrifuged for 25 minutes at 507<italic>g</italic>. The intermediate layers (density between 1.048 and 1.062) containing cytotrophoblast cells were removed and washed extensively, and cell viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion. Following trophoblast isolation, cells were seeded at a density of 1.5 × 10<sup>

Cells were maintained at 37°C in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere. The medium was refreshed daily and trophoblasts were maintained for a maximum of 3 days in culture. The purity of each preparation of cytotrophoblasts was evaluated by flow cytometry using fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated monoclonal antibody against cytokeratin 7 (Millipore, Mississauga, Canada), a specific marker of trophoblast cells. The experiment with isolated primary trophoblast cells was conducted in triplicate under normoxia conditions and repeated 3 times, in each case with a different placenta donor. Both BeWo cells and primary trophoblasts were regularly tested for mycoplasma contamination.</p>

<title>Generation of Stable Transfectants in BeWo Cells</title>
<p>Two stably transfected BeWo populations were generated, one harboring the HIV-1 LTR-driven luciferase vector, pLTRxLuc, and the other carrying the Tat expression vector, pCMVTat. Briefly, BeWo cells (8 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells/well in a 6-well plate) were co-transfected with pLTRxLuc or pCMVTat (0.7 μg; kindly provided by Dr O. Schwartz, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France) and phβPr.1-neo (0.1 μg; generous gift from Dr M. Najkamura, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan). Twelve hours after transfection, the cells were transferred to Ham F-12 medium containing 400 μg/mL G418 (Sigma-Aldrich, Oakville, Canada) and the selective medium was renewed daily for a period of 2 weeks. Resistant BeWo cells were pooled and subsequently maintained in a medium containing 300 μg/mL G418 disulfate.</p>

BeWo cells stably transfected with pLTRxLuc were transiently transfected with pCMVTat or the control vector phCMV1 (0.2 μg), while BeWo cells stably transfected with pCMVTat were transiently transfected with pLTRxLuc or pGL3Basic (0.2 μg). The pRcActin-LacZ vector was co-transfected for each condition and the experiments were performed in triplicates (0.05 μg). Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were measured 48 hours posttransfection as previously described.<sup>

<title>Coculture Experiments in BeWo Cells and Primary Trophoblasts</title>
<p>Both stable BeWo populations (2 × 10<sup>5</sup>) were cocultured at a 1:1 ratio or cultured individually for 24, 36, and 48 hours in a 24-well plate. Cells were stimulated or not with forskolin (50 μmol/L). In some experiments, after 16 hours, cultured cells were subsequently transfected using Hiperfect reagent (Qiagen, Mississauga, Canada) with syncytin 2 small interfering RNA (siRNA) or a control siRNA as previously described.<sup>

</sup> Primary trophoblasts (1.5 × 10<sup>6</sup>) were microporated with an MP-100 device (Digital Bio, Montreal, Quebec, Canada) with pLTRxLuc (0.4 μg), phCMV1 (0.4 μg), or pCMVTat (0.4 μg) along with pRcActin-LacZ (0.1 μg) for normalization. Transfected cells were then harvested with Accutase (1 mL per 25 cm<sup>2</sup> of surface area) and either cocultured at a 1:1 ratio or cultured individually for 24 hours. For all experiments, cultured or cocultured cells were lysed and luciferase activity (after β-galactosidase normalization for primary trophoblasts) was assessed in the form of triplicates.

<title>Measurement of hCG Concentration in Cell Supernatant</title>
<p>Parental BeWo cells or the 2 stably transfected BeWo cell populations (cultured individually or mixed) were either treated with or not treated with forskolin (50 μmol/L). Subsequently, the supernatants were harvested 48 hours poststimulation, centrifuged at 2000 <italic>g</italic> for 10 minutes for removal of debris, and frozen at −20°C until use. Concentrations of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) following manufacturer’s instructions (DRG Diagnostics, New Jersey).

<title>Confocal Microscopy</title>
<p>Cultured and cocultured cells (2 × 10<sup>5</sup> BeWo cells and 1.5 × 10<sup>6</sup> primary trophoblasts in 24-well plates) were either left untreated or stimulated with 50 μmol/L forskolin up to 48 hours. Cells were then fixed in methanol at −20°C for 30 minutes and incubated in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 2% FBS (volume/volume [v/v]) for 30 minutes to eliminate nonspecific binding. Samples were then rinsed with PBS and incubated with a mouse monoclonal anti-desmoplakin antibody (Sigma-Aldrich cat. no. D-1286; 1/700) in PBS containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin for 1½ hours at room temperature, washed 3 times with PBS, and incubated with the Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G ([IgG] Invitrogen; 1/1000) for 1 hour at room temperature. For nuclear staining, cells were incubated with propidium iodide ([PI] 50 μg/mL; Sigma-Aldrich) for an additional 30 minutes at room temperature, washed 3 times with PBS, and observed with a confocal laser-scanning microscope (Bio-Rad MRC1024, Hercules, California). All observations were performed at a final magnification of ×400. A syncytium was defined as an agglomeration of 2 or more nuclei in the same cytoplasm without intervening surface desmosomal membrane staining. Cellular fusion index was determined as follows: 3 fields were counted per well and an average was calculated and expressed as the percentage number of nuclei in syncytia. In general, a total of 200 nuclei were counted per field and, thus, nearly 600 nuclei were counted in each well. Three replicate wells were examined per experimental condition from which a final cellular fusion index (mean ± standard error of mean [SEM]) is presented and represents the final average of the 3 percentage values. Statistical analyses were performed using an unpaired Student <italic>t</italic> test with StatGraphics. A value of <italic>P </italic>&lt; .05 was considered significant.</p>

<title>Reverse Transcriptase–Polymerase Chain Reaction Analysis</title>
<p>Ribonucleic acid was isolated from BeWo cells by the RNeasy Plus mini kit (Qiagen), according to manufacturer’s instructions. Ribonucleic acid (500 ng) was incubated in the presence of 25 ng/μL oligo dT, 10 mmol/L dithiothreitol (DTT), 100 μmol/L deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate (dNTP), SuperScript reverse transcriptase ([RT] 10 U; Invitrogen Canada Inc) and SUPERase-In (20 U) at 42°C for 50 minutes. Aliquots from the RT reactions were then amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in the presence of 2 U Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, Pickering Canada), 1× ThermoPol buffer, 100 μmol/L dNTP, and 15 μmol/L of each primer. Primers used for syncytin 2 complementary DNA (cDNA) amplification were 5′-CCACCAACATCCTTTCAA-3′ (forward) and 5′-CGTGAGAATGAGAACCAG-3′ (reverse), while those for β-actin were 5′-CGTGACATTAAGGAGAAGCTG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CTCAGGAGGAGCAATGATCTT-3′ (reverse). The PCR conditions were as follows: a first step of denaturation at 94°C for 4 minutes followed by 26 cycles of denaturation (94°C for 30 seconds), annealing (57°C for 30 seconds), and elongation (72°C for 20 seconds).</p>

<title>Tat-dependent transactivation of the HIV-1 promoter in BeWo cells</title>
<p>Based on quantitative syncytium assays that we have previously published,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1933719111424437">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1933719111424437">16</xref>
</sup> a similar assay was developed to quantify cell fusion of human trophoblasts. This system basically relies on the capacity of the HIV-1 Tat protein to transactivate the HIV-1 promoter through its TAR RNA region. Using a BeWo cell line expressing the Tat protein and another BeWo cell line containing the pLTRxLuc construct, we reasoned that luciferase activity should augment as more fusion events occur through simple diffusion of the Tat protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1933719111424437">Figure 1</xref>). We thereby initially generated both stable cell lines by co-transfection of a neo<sup>r</sup>-expressing vector. To validate the responsiveness of these pooled resistant clones, each population was transiently transfected with the reciprocal construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1933719111424437">Figure 2A</xref>). We were indeed able to demonstrate that both stable cell lines demonstrated an increase in luciferase activity when compared to cells transiently transfected with control vectors. Differences were noted in terms of responses of each stable cell population toward transfection of their reciprocal vector and could be accounted for by the fact that Tat expression levels were more homogenous in stably transfected cells. The Tat-expressing stable cell line indicated the expected background luciferase activity level (0.5 RLU) and its values were thereby omitted in the presented results below. These results hence confirmed that both stable cell populations were successfully established and responsive to the Tat transactivator in the context of the HIV-1 LTR.</p>

<title>Induction of HIV LTR activity in coculture conditions of both stably transfected BeWo cells</title>
<p>Then we wanted to test whether increased cell fusion between both stable BeWo cell lines led to an increase in luciferase activity. To test this, BeWo cells stably transfected with pLTRxLuc were incubated with pCMVTat-transfected stable BeWo cells. Luciferase activity was measured at 24, 36, and 48 hours of coculture conditions in the presence or absence of forskolin, an inducer of trophoblast fusion. Our results demonstrated that 48 hours of forskolin stimulation led to a maximal increase in luciferase activity. At this time point, luciferase activity in the absence of stimulation was 1.45 ± 0.31, while in the presence of forskolin, a 12.38-fold induction was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1933719111424437">Figure 2B</xref>). Furthermore, the augmentation of luciferase activity at both 24 and 36 hours were modest. The typical cell fusion assay using anti-desmoplakin antibodies and PI was tested in parallel on BeWo cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1933719111424437">Figure 2C</xref> and D). Interestingly, as we have previously noted, our cell fusion index was modestly increased at 24 hours after stimulation in comparison to untreated cells while forskolin treatment led to a more important augmentation in cell fusion at 48 hours. These results thereby paralleled the luciferase activity obtained above with the 2 stably transfected populations.</p>
<p>To determine that our stably transfected cells were behaving similarly to the parental BeWo cells, measurement of hCG levels were first conducted for the 2 populations cultured either individually or in coculture conditions. Results demonstrated a normal hCG induction as compared to parental BeWo cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1933719111424437">Figure 3A</xref>). In addition, assessment of cell fusion by nucleus and desmoplakin staining showed normal fusion frequency for each population and in coculture conditions as determined by confocal microscopy. Indeed, cell fusion was only noted upon forskolin treatment and was shown to be maximal at 48 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1933719111424437">Figure 3B</xref> and data not shown). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1933719111424437">Figure 3C</xref>, a cell fusion index was determined for coculture conditions and compared to the index of each cell population grown separately. No significant differences in fusion events between the different growth conditions were noted, thereby strongly suggesting that, in coculture conditions, a BeWo cell will likely fuse to a similar extent with another cell from the same stably transfected population (homotypical fusion) or from the other population (heterotypical fusion).</p>

<p>These results hence demonstrated that, in our assay, luciferase activity was maximal at the same time point as for optimal cell fusion events, thereby suggesting that the increase in luciferase activity was mediated by cell fusion.</p>

<title>Increased luciferase activity is blocked by anti-syncytin 1 and -2 antibodies or specific siRNA</title>
<p>In order to determine that the increase of luciferase activity in our assay was dependent on cell fusion, the 2 stable BeWo cell populations were cultured individually or cocultured in the absence or presence of forskolin with anti-syncytin 1 or -2 antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1933719111424437">Figure 4A</xref>). Our former results had indeed indicated that both antibodies could specifically block the fusion of stimulated BeWo cells. When either antibody was incubated in the presence of mixed BeWo cell populations, fold induction of luciferase activity upon forskolin treatment was severely hampered. A less pronounced inhibition was also noted in culture experiments of both stably transfected pools without stimulation. No significant effect was measured in pLTRxLuc-transfected cells cultured alone with or without stimulation. In addition, controls using a blocking peptide for anti-syncytin 1 antibodies or a preimmune serum for anti-syncytin 2 antibodies were included in these experiments and showed no impact on cell fusion or luciferase activity (data not shown).</p>

<title>Cell fusion assay in human primary trophoblasts</title>
<p>We wanted to test our assay on human primary trophoblasts, which upon culture are known to spontaneously fuse. We thus transfected pLTRxLuc and pCMVTat individually in 2 different samples of freshly isolated human trophoblasts and cocultured both transfected cell populations. Luciferase activity was measured when cellular fusion occurred, hence after 48 and 72 hours. Our results indicated a significant increase in luciferase activity at 48 hours and an even more pronounced augmentation at 72 hours posttransfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1933719111424437">Figure 5A</xref>).

<sec id="section15-1933719111424437">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Current quantification methods of trophoblast fusion depend on the use of immunomarkers and are counted by confocal microscopy. Although they are extensively used, these methods are often tedious and cell fusion events are not always easy to discern. Herein we propose a new luciferase-based method, which is specific and reproducible. Our luciferase system is based on the use of the HIV-1 promoter present in the pLTRxLuc construct and the strong HIV-1 transactivator Tat.</p>
<p>We first tested this luciferase-based approach in the BeWo cell line. This cell line remains the best cell line model to study fusion events typical of trophoblasts.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1933719111424437">21</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1933719111424437"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1933719111424437">23</xref>
</sup> We have hence derived 2 different BeWo populations, one stably expressing the Tat protein and the other stably transfected with the pLTRxLuc vector. Both populations provided an adequate cellular context for Tat-mediated transactivation of the HIV-1 promoter, as determined by transient transfection. These results were not surprising since a previous study has indeed demonstrated that Tat induced HIV-1 LTR activity in different trophoblastic cell lines, including BeWo.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1933719111424437">24</xref>
</sup> In addition, we importantly demonstrated that each BeWo population behaved similarly to the parental BeWo cell population in terms of cell fusion and differentiation marker such as hCG. This is an important issue as the viral Tat protein has been shown to modulate different cellular genes in infected cells.</p>
<p>Next, we optimized conditions to obtain the most important induction of luciferase activity. The 1:1 ratio was optimal as we had similarly shown in other cell fusion assay.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1933719111424437">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1933719111424437">16</xref></sup> Also, importantly, no increase in luciferase activity was noted when both cell populations were cocultured in the absence of forskolin, thereby excluding the possibility that the Tat protein was mediating its effect following secretion and entry in pLTRxLuc-transfected BeWo cells. We have further confirmed this by testing supernatant of forskolin-stimulated Tat-expressing BeWo cells on BeWo cells stably transfected with pLTRxLuc and have not observed any significant modulation of LTR activity (data not shown). In addition, forskolin, which in itself can induce HIV-1 LTR activity, did not lead to an important induction of luciferase activity of pLTRxLuc-transfected BeWo cells.</p>
<p>The specificity of our assay was further confirmed by syncytin 2-specific siRNA and syncytin 1 and -2 antibodies. In fact, the time-dependent increase in luciferase activity in cocultured and stimulated populations was observed to be concomitant with the increase in cell fusion events occurring in stimulated parental BeWo cells as determined by the standard anti-desmoplakin/PI staining protocol. Our data therefore indicated that the upregulation of luciferase gene expression in this assay was dependent on cell fusion. These data demonstrate that different agents (siRNA, antibodies, and inhibitors) could be tested in our assay to determine their potential impact on trophoblast fusion. Indeed, using this assay, preliminary results from our team confirmed that lactose blocks cell fusion as reported by others<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1933719111424437">25</xref>
</sup> (data not shown).</p>
<p>In the current study, we have further tested the potential use of our assay on cultured primary trophoblasts. Given the transient nature of these spontaneously fusing cells, which can be maintained no more than 4 days, cells were directly transfected after isolation as we have previously performed.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1933719111424437">5</xref>
</sup> We have again measured a significant increase in luciferase activity upon coculture of both transfected cell populations. In these experiments, transfection efficiency in primary trophoblasts was important (greater than 90%, as previously described<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1933719111424437">5</xref>
</sup>) and the modest luciferase activity in pLTRxLuc-transfected primary trophoblasts was likely due to low HIV-1 LTR activity in this cell setting. The use of our assay in primary trophoblasts will permit to assess the impact of particular proteins on cell fusion through cotransfection of expression vectors or siRNA.</p>
<p>Our time course experiments have revealed that luciferase upregulation is as sensitive as the typical cell fusion index measured by confocal microscopy through membrane and nuclear staining as demonstrated above, although the latter approach is more tedious.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1933719111424437">12</xref>
</sup> Luciferase activity also does not require direct observation and identification of syncytia, which are not always conclusive. Cell fusion assays in which 2 population of trophoblasts are stained with different fluorescent dyes before being mixed have also been described previously.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1933719111424437">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1933719111424437">13</xref>
</sup> These approaches resemble our assay but are based on confocal microscopy observations, which remain occasionally cumbersome in demonstrating 2-color positive syncytia. It should however be stated that quantification by Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) analysis in this type of cell fusion assay has been tested.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1933719111424437">13</xref>
</sup> As described above, our assay is also more amenable to the use of expression vectors through transient cotransfection experiments than these latter assays.</p>
<p>Our results thereby highlight the usefulness of our assay in quantifying trophoblast fusion in cell lines as well as in more physiologically relevant primary trophoblasts. Through our protocol, we are currently addressing the defective potential of trophoblast fusion in preeclamptic placentas. Such studies will also be expanded in the evaluation of trophoblast fusion in other disorders potentially linked to placentation, such as Trisomy 21 and intrauterine growth retardation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1933719111424437">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1933719111424437">27</xref>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>We have demonstrated that our simple assay, which is based on the strong transactivation potential of the HIV-1 Tat protein, is a reliable alternative to the current quantifying assays of trophoblast fusion. This system could be successfully used to rapidly quantify cellular fusion events in primary trophoblasts and will be an interesting tool to determine variation of trophoblast fusion in disorders such as preeclampsia.</p>
