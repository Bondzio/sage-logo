<p>Popular culture and religion are both of considerable importance to the understanding of society. Where it comes to music, the relationship between these two is even more direct, with much of early rock springing directly from the gospel tradition. Rock and religion share more than a pervasive social influence, they often treat similar themes. <italic>Apocalypse Jukebox</italic>, a wide ranging, erudite yet breezily written (especially for its subject) survey of all things eschatological in popular music, explores a provocative thesis: that rock and American mystical traditions such as fundamentalism and transcendentalism share an basic apocalyptic sensibility. It is a work that sociologists specializing in either religion or pop culture would benefit from exploring.</p>
<p>Apocalypse, explain authors David Janssen and Edward Whitelock, means literally an “unveiling,” a disclosure of hidden knowledge that traditionally involves the end of the world or of a world. They trace two apocalyptic traditions in American culture, one sacred and one secular, to the nineteenth-century figures William Miller and Ralph Waldo Emerson. Miller, whose prolific predictions of the Second Coming were widely followed, epitomizes a Christian-apocalyptic tradition encompassing postmillennial and premillennial strains that disagree on whether Christ will initiate upon return a “reign of bliss” or a “war of tribulation.” The secular tradition ranges from panics over humanity’s threatened extinction to Emerson’s call to annihilate past and future in an imminent communion with nature. After establishing the deep roots of apocalyptic thought in American society, Janssen and Whitelock they leap ahead to the post-WWII era. “Rock music was born the morning of August 6, 1945,” they assert, marking the day the atom bomb dropped on Hiroshima. Country was the first genre to embrace the bomb, producing gospel tinged numbers like the Louvin Brothers’ “Great Atomic Power” and Lowell Blanchard’s “God Hits like an Atomic Bomb.” Meanwhile, suburbs swelled with former city dwellers hoping to escape nuclear attack, while those who remained turned the city into “a place of extremes” that promoted bohemian art movements like Beat literature, abstract expressionism, and rock and roll. Rock reveled in atom bomb imagery to evoke sex, youthful rebellion, and social unrest, while epitomizing an Emersonian experiential immediacy (A sensibility referenced by John Lennon in his definition of rock music’s ultimate message: “be here now.”)</p>
<p>The next section identifies popular music’s “Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse”: Harry Smith, John Coltrane, Bob Dylan, and Leonard Cohen, a diverse set of artists who speak to the volume’s inclusive definition of both American popular music and apocalyptic culture. Smith’s <italic>Anthology of American Folk Music </italic>preserved and highlighted deeply apocalyptic themes in the U.S.’s musical heritage (with songs like Blind Willie Johnson’s “John the Revelator”), while offering the same as a guide toward moral renewal in the face of potential nuclear destruction. The authors then trace the genesis of Coltrane’s <italic>A Love Supreme</italic> (and the sonically extreme albums that followed it: <italic>Ascension, Meditations,</italic> and <italic>Interstellar Space)</italic> in the jazz artist’s improvisational quest to express the divine in sound. The chapter on Dylan demonstrates his continuance of folk’s traditional apocalyptic themes, then recounts the reborn Dylan’s embrace of Hal Lindsey’s apocalyptic bestseller <italic>The Late Great Planet Earth</italic>. By the time of 1984s <italic>Infidels</italic>, Dylan had retreated somewhat from his more strident fundamentalist beliefs but still produced a “complex work that speaks apocalypse from various angles” through songs like “Jokerman,” “I and I,” and “Neighborhood Bully.” Dylan emerges here as the voice of an apocalyptic generation, exploring along with them revelatory forms of protest, spirituality, and fundamentalism. Leonard Cohen represents the apocalyptic strains of mystical Judaism and Buddhism in attempting to collapse through music the “terrible schizophrenia in society between the public utterance and the private experience.” In albums like <italic>New Skin for an Old Ceremony</italic> and <italic>The Future</italic>, Cohen, like Janssen and Whitelock’s other horsemen, exhorts his listeners to awaken to a higher spiritual and social reality.</p>
<p>The final two sections, “Reports From the Blast Zone” and “Apocalypse After 9/11” report on what can best be called “postapocalyptic” texts, musical reflections on various forms of social, spiritual and (in the case of 9/11) structural collapse. The L.A. band Love’s music presages in singer Arthur Lee’s intimate narratives of spiritual longing the larger apocalypse the 60s counterculture would soon experience. One part of that apocalypse, the deadly shooting of protesters at Kent State, led directly to the formation of the satirical new wave band DEVO by a group of KSU art students, who presented in the guise of subversive pop an alternative mythology of cannibalized intelligence and evolution in reverse. Indie rock pioneers REM, emerging from the deep South in the mid of the Reagan 80s, created though hushed, impenetrable vocals and eerie, minor chord anthems a Book of Revelations for a new generation of “diStiples” who scoured the aural text trying to decipher its hidden profundities. Conceptual artist Laurie Anderson and acclaimed indie rock band Sleater-Kinney, female artists in what is mostly a male-centric survey, are assigned the role of critics of patriarchal eschatological apocalypse, epitomizing an apocalyptic feminist emphasis on change, rebirth and renewal in response to 9/11. This is illustrated by Anderson’s statement, vilified in the mainstream media, that the attacks represented not an ending but an “great opportunity,” and Sleater-Kinney guitarist Carrie Brownstein’s description of the message of their acclaimed LP <italic>The Woods</italic> as saying “we can go to a place that’s dark and new, and it’s okay to be in here.” The volume ends with a postapocalyptic reading of Green Day’s <italic>American Idiot</italic> as tragic rebellion in a world where such agency has effectively disappeared.</p>
<p>
<italic>Apocalypse Jukebox </italic>is a fascinating examination of the interrelationship of two major forms of social influence. Courses in the sociology of religion, music, and popular culture can use the book as an accessible way to explore the ways that different areas of culture can interrogate one another. American studies courses would also find this book a most useful addition to their curriculum.</p>
