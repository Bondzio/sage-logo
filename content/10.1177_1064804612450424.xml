<p>Simply applying a warning on a product is not sufficient for helping customers avoid the hazards of using the product. Many variables influence the effectiveness of a warning. Models of human information processing can be used to explain how people may understand and comply with warnings. Such a model can be thought of as having four components: notice, encode, comprehend, and comply (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1064804612450424">Figure S1</xref>).</p>

<list-item><p><bold>Notice:</bold> For a product warning to be effective, it must first attract the user’s attention. Features such as color, presence of symbology, and location of the warning on the product affect whether it is noticed.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>Encode:</bold> Warning text and symbols must be actively processed before they can be understood. It is not enough for a person to see the letters on a warning, for example; a person also must take the time to read those letters to understand them rather than ignore the letters. The use of highlighted text and the presence of symbology can affect encoding.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>Comprehend:</bold> Comprehension of a warning is affected by factors such as inclusion of a signal word such as “Danger,” the complexity of the warning text, and the explicitness with which a hazard or instructions is described.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>Comply:</bold> Various features of a warning can encourage compliance with the warning, such as providing symbology, placing the warning so that the user must interact with it before using the product, and describing the nature of the hazard.</p></list-item>
