<abstract>
<p>Despite increased scholarly interest in how activists use visuals in claim-making and mobilization, little is known about how mainstream news media visually represent social movements and their causes over time. Given the number of studies that argue that journalistic routines, norms, and conventions create hegemonic discourse around political issues, this gap is surprising. In this article, the authors examine whether the images used to visually represent the abortion issue are homogenized. Drawing on an analysis of 2,093 print and electronic news images associated with the abortion debate, the authors find that the visuals used in media coverage are very similar. Likewise, the authors find that the most frequently shown visual landscapes for the abortion issue are relatively stable across six different kinds of events including commemorations, incidents of clinic violence, legislation, Supreme Court decisions, presidential elections, and executive nominations. The authors conclude with a discussion of the implications of this work for the study of social movements and call for more research on how visual landscapes influence audience understanding of both new and enduring issues.</p>

<p>Images are a powerful tool in a social movement’s arsenal. A single image can capture the hearts and minds of the broader public and come to symbolize a movement. These “mind bombs” are not in short supply (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0002764211419487">DeLuca, 1999</xref>). Images of environmental activists chained to bulldozers; young civil rights activists being blasted with water from high-powered hoses; a peace activist screaming over a body of her friend during the Kent State protests; the “tiny feet” of a 10-week-old fetus waved on the signs of pro-life activists; and a coat hanger, the symbol of dangerous back-alley abortions, held solemnly by pro-choice activists all have come to represent their respective causes. These iconic images, however, are rarely spontaneous. Activists carefully craft symbols and situations that conform to the standards of news media and, hopefully, capture the imagination of a broader public, who will actively support their cause (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0002764211419487">Condit, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0002764211419487">DeLuca, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0002764211419487">Meyer, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite the importance of visuals in social movement processes such as mobilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0002764211419487">Halfmann &amp; Young, 2010</xref>), there is a dearth of research on the topic—particularly in terms of how issues are visually represented across events and over time. This primarily is a result of scholars’ tendency to focus on how social movement demonstrations and protests are visually depicted in mainstream news (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0002764211419487">Meyer, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0002764211419487">van Zoonen, 1992</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0002764211419487">Baylor (1996)</xref> found that Native Americans often were portrayed as violent militants or as singing–dancing–pipe-smoking Indians in visuals of protests advocating for sovereignty or reestablishment of Treaty Rights. This empirical emphasis is problematic for at least three reasons. First, although activists may create arresting visuals that alter how the broader public regards an issue, they rarely have control over whether or how they are portrayed to mass audiences. News organizations and the people in them, who are governed by professional norms and respond to market pressures, ultimately determine how an issue is covered.</p>
<p>Second, protests are but one kind of event in which activists may be visually represented. Activists hold press conferences, lobby government officials and even bring their causes to the courtroom—events that vary in terms of the extent to which they are visually scripted for the broader public, but still have potential to be included in news coverage. Likewise, activists are not the only visual material available for inclusion in coverage. Buildings, politicians, locations, statutes, symbols, and countless other images may accompany issue coverage. While these visuals may not be very dramatic, they too play a role in how a broader public views an issue.</p>
<p>Finally, and related, the focus on protest alone ignores that visual coverage may vary by issue. The length of time that an issue is on the political agenda, for instance, may affect how an issue is visually represented to the broader public. Issues that have been contested for decades are not new, and therefore, media professionals have had time to develop conventions for visually presenting different kinds of issue events. In short, the longer an issue is on the political agenda, the more homogenized its visual representations may be.</p>
<p>In this article, we examine whether the images used to visually represent the abortion issue are homogenized. Drawing on an analysis of 2,093 print and electronic news images associated with the abortion debate, we find that the visuals used in media coverage are very similar. Likewise, we find that the most frequently shown visual landscapes for the abortion issue are relatively stable across six different kinds of events including commemorations, incidents of clinic violence, legislation, Supreme Court decisions, presidential elections, and executive nominations. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of this work for the study of social movements and call for more research on how visual landscapes influence audience understanding of both new and enduring issues.</p>

<title>News Processes and Visual Landscapes</title>
<p>American news media are charged with a heady obligation: educating the masses on matters relevant to citizenship and daily life. This is an obligation that media professionals take seriously in their efforts to cover issues and events. Journalists, for instance, uphold the doctrine of objectivity and employ practices designed to inform the public through fact-driven and politically neutral reporting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0002764211419487">Schudson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0002764211419487">Sigelman, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0002764211419487">Tuchman, 1972</xref>). However, the issues and events that constitute the news of the day are affected by more than occupational ideals. The news is a product intended to generate profit for corporate owners. The emphasis on profit-making, which often supersedes media’s societal obligations, influences the practices and routines of journalists and, ultimately, the kinds of events and issues that are included in the daily news (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0002764211419487">Gans, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0002764211419487">McChesney, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0002764211419487">McManus, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>Journalists, who consistently deal with scarce resources, tight deadlines, and limited space for the news, employ practices that enable them to quickly identify the important events of the day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0002764211419487">Tuchman, 1978b</xref>). Specifically, media professionals focus on those places where news most often occurs (e.g., Capitol Hill, police stations, and the courthouse), rely heavily on “insider” sources (such as politicians, government officials, and bureaucrats), and look to other prominent news outlets (like <italic>The New York Times</italic>) to identify issues and events that are interesting and relevant to a broader public (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0002764211419487">Gans, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0002764211419487">Tuchman, 1978a</xref>). Additionally, journalists routinize how they cover issues and events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0002764211419487">Tuchman, 1973</xref>). News coverage is formulaic with a conventional structure that focuses on episodic events and expert opinion rather than ongoing interpretations of social and political issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0002764211419487">Gamson, Croteau, Hoynes, &amp; Sasson, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0002764211419487">Ryan, 1991</xref>). These practices systematically narrow and homogenize media coverage, a consequence that is even more pronounced in the era of media consolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0002764211419487">Bennett, Lawrence, &amp; Livingston, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0002764211419487">Gans, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Occupational norms and practices also affect the visuals included with news stories. Images serve several purposes in media coverage. Visuals are designed to accentuate the news story, supply the audience with evidentiary support regarding the truth of the reporting, and provide an additional incentive for the audience to choose one news source over another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0002764211419487">Rosenblum, 1978</xref>). However, like journalists, news photographers (and camera people) learn how to visually represent issues and events to a broader public. In visual representations of the news, the goal of media professionals is to provide standardized images that capture the essence of an issue or event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0002764211419487">Graber, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0002764211419487">Rosenblum, 1978</xref>). Photographers, for example, adopt a formulaic aesthetic that both aligns with the “situational norms and technical characteristics” of an event and captures the event’s most dramatic aspects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0002764211419487">Rosenblum, 1978</xref>, p. 59). As media professionals associate particular “shots” with specific kinds of events (e.g., protests), news visuals become homogeneous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0002764211419487">Gans, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0002764211419487">Graber, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0002764211419487">Rosenblum, 1978</xref>).</p>
<p>Here, we conceptualize the images used to represent issues as visual landscapes. A landscape is a human-made space that physically reflects the aesthetic of the individual who designed it. Whereas landscapes are crafted to represent those aspects of the natural world that are most appealing to the designer, there are aspects of the physical environment that cannot be manipulated. Nonnative plants, for instance, may be unable to flourish in a foreign environment because of differences in temperature or the pH of the soil. Like physical landscapes, media professionals craft a visual aesthetic as it relates to an issue. Visual landscapes, then, refer to the professionally constructed images that are designed to capture an issue for a broader public.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0002764211419487">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>The distinction between an event and an issue as it relates to visual landscapes is an important one. As discussed above, media professionals use conventional formats to capture the visual essence of an event. Thus, the aesthetics associated with a particular type of event may not vary dramatically from issue to issue. For example, images of angry activists waving signs may be common to protest coverage regardless of the specific issue being debated. However, the extent to which angry activists come to visually represent an entire <italic>issue</italic> probably varies significantly. Just as journalists develop conventions regarding how they report on issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0002764211419487">Rohlinger, 2007</xref>), photographers and camera people utilize aesthetic conventions to visually represent an issue. In other words, a handful of visual landscapes may come to dominate the images associated with an issue, and these images may persist across different kinds of events and outlets. To be clear, we are not arguing that event-specific visual landscapes will be absent from news coverage. In fact, some visual landscapes are likely to be very event-specific. Images of presidential candidates, for example, are only relevant in issue coverage during particular points in the election cycle. The point here is that there will be a great deal of stability in the kinds of visual landscapes regardless of variances in the event and outlet, particularly for issues that have long been on the political agenda.</p>

<sec id="section2-0002764211419487">
<title>Data and Methods</title>
<p>We examine the visual landscapes associated with the abortion issue between 1980 and 2000. The abortion issue is a good case for analyzing how visuals are used in news coverage, particularly as it relates to social movements. The battle over legal abortion has taken place on Capitol Hill, in the Supreme Court, and on the streets. As such, it provides a vast range of visual contexts from which media professionals can draw when choosing images for their news stories. This diversity of potential images permits an examination of the extent to which imagery on an issue is homogenized and, more specifically, whether the visual landscapes used in news coverage vary by the kind of event being covered.</p>
<p>Here, we analyze the visual landscapes in mainstream print (<italic>The New York Times</italic> and <italic>Time</italic> magazine) and electronic (the nightly national broadcasts of ABC, CBS, and NBC) news outlets that are relatively prominent and have been in existence for several decades.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0002764211419487">2</xref></sup> For sampling purposes, the first author coded media stories during critical discourse moments of the abortion debate. Critical discourse moments are times when an issue is salient to a broad audience and, therefore, likely to garner media attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0002764211419487">Gamson, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0002764211419487">Rohlinger, 2002</xref>). In other words, critical discourse moments are important events that occur in an issue’s history. This strategy makes sense when examining media coverage on the abortion issue because, although it has been on the political agenda for several decades, on most days abortion is not news. The focus on critical discourse moments, then, captures those events that put abortion on the media agenda. The first author coded news stories and the visual landscapes associated with these events during 36 points in time from 1980 to 2000. The events coded included: Three Supreme Court decisions (<italic>Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, Ohio v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health et al.</italic>, and <italic>Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey</italic>), three legislative debates/votes (The Human Life Bill, The Gag Rule, and Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances), three presidential elections (1984, 1988, and 1992), three executive nominations (the nominations of Judge Robert Bork to the Supreme Court in 1987, Dr. David Satcher to Surgeon General in 1997, and John Ashcroft to Attorney General in 2000), incidents of clinic violence (the first bombing of an abortion clinic in 1985 and the murder of Dr. Gunn in 1993), and the annual commemoration of the <italic>Roe v. Wade</italic> Supreme Court decision, which legalized abortion in the U.S.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0002764211419487">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>This yielded a sample of 1,424 media stories and 2,093 visual landscapes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0002764211419487">4</xref></sup> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0002764211419487">Figure 1</xref> shows the distribution of the visuals by each event category. It is important to note that the visual landscapes in abortion coverage are not evenly distributed across the events. In fact, 51% of the visual landscapes in the sample are associated with events directly involving social movements—the annual commemoration of <italic>Roe v. Wade</italic> and the incidents of clinic violence. This suggests that visual coverage is skewed toward dramatic movement events.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0002764211419487-fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>The first author coded for the presence of 22 different visual landscapes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0002764211419487">5</xref></sup> These landscapes fall into one of four categories. First, landscapes that reflect social movement organizations, dynamics, or activities (a pro-life or pro-choice demonstration, vigil, or protest, a pro-choice or pro-life spokesperson, victims of pro-life violence, pro-life individuals who commit acts of violence, confrontation between pro-life and pro-choice activists, pro-life media materials such as <italic>The Silent Scream</italic>, representatives from other social movements, and unaffiliated activists). Second, landscapes that feature the symbols, sites, and actors associated with the battle over abortion (an abortion clinic, location where pro-life violence occurred, government officials and buildings, religious symbols, buildings and leaders, academics, experts, and scientists, pharmaceutical representatives, pharmaceuticals and medical proce and the president). Third, landscapes that are associated with particular events (presidential and vice presidential candidates as well as executive nominees). Fourth, medium specific and miscellaneous landscapes (TV anchor, maps, polls, graphs, and other generated visuals; and unaffiliated individuals).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0002764211419487">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the following analysis, we consider what visual landscapes dominate the abortion issue and whether the imagery varies by event type. Looking at the frequencies with which a given landscape appears provides an initial assessment regarding whether there is visual homogenization on an issue. Then, we examine whether there are differences between print and electronic outlets. This is an important analytical step because visuals are more prominent in electronic outlets. It is clear in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0002764211419487">Figure 1</xref> that the vast majority of print abortion stories were not accompanied by a photo. This, of course, is not true of electronic news coverage, which included up to eight different visual landscapes in a single story. The sample, in short, is composed primarily of the visual landscapes included in television news stories, which could mask important differences in how imagery is used in print outlets.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0002764211419487" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0002764211419487">Table 1</xref> provides an overview of the relative prominence of each visual landscape associated with the abortion issue. What is immediately apparent in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0002764211419487">Table 1</xref> is that images of conflict and violence do not dominate media coverage of the abortion issue. This finding is particularly noteworthy because, as previously mentioned, events in which social movements are integral account for almost half of the sample. The most prominent visual landscape involving conflict is that of pro-life demonstrations, vigils, and protests (12%).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0002764211419487">7</xref></sup> However, the other visual landscapes involving conflict and violence are relatively infrequent. Pro-choice demonstrations and protests appear in only 4% of the media stories, the locations where violent incidents occurred in 2%, victims of violence in 1%, confrontations between pro-life and pro-choice activists in 1%, and the individuals who commit act of violence in 0.1%. Likewise, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0002764211419487">Table 1</xref> makes clear that social movement representatives appear in media coverage as professional spokespeople, not just as angry activists or extremists. Pro-choice and pro-life spokespeople are included in visual news coverage and account for 6% and 5% of the visual landscapes, respectively. This suggests that while images of dissent play a role in issue coverage, dramatic images of embattled activists are not the only way in which social movements—or controversial issues—are visually represented.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, the visual landscapes used in print and electronic mediums are quite similar (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0002764211419487">Table 2</xref>). For example, images of government buildings and politicians and abortion clinics are among the most frequently shown visual landscapes in print and electronic coverage. Similarly, visual landscapes featuring activists engaged in protest and as professional spokespeople also are prominent. It is worth noting that pro-life activists are shown engaged in protest more often than their pro-choice counterparts. There are at least two possible (and potentially related) explanations for this finding. First, it may reflect a real difference in the number of protests in which movement activists engage. Pro-life activists may believe that protest is an important way of keeping the cause visible to the broader public, and therefore, visuals of pro-life protest may simply be readily available. Second, it may reflect journalistic conventions regarding how challengers of the status quo are visually depicted in news coverage. Because the pro-life movement seeks to abolish legal abortion, images of protest may reflect journalistic understandings regarding the activities in which challengers engage in the United States.</p>

<p>There are differences between the mediums. News anchors, for instance, are the most common visual landscape in abortion coverage. While the use of anchors in television news coverage is not particularly surprising, the prominence of anchors relative to other visual landscapes is. Images of anchors constitute 46% of the visuals in television news coverage. Our first explanation for this finding was story length. Abortion stories on television are relatively short, and therefore, a visual other than an anchor is not necessary. While more than half of the television news stories are under 60 seconds (62% of the 1,761 visuals coded), only 32% of these stories are less than 30 seconds. Additionally, 20.4% of the stories were 61 to 120 seconds long, and 20.8% were more than 121 seconds in length. In other words, story length alone does not account for the prominence of an anchor in abortion coverage.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0002764211419487">8</xref></sup> One possible explanation is that such visual landscapes are used when compelling visuals are not available. Such a convention may be employed more often when an issue is on the political agenda for a long time. Images of activists screaming at one another may be visually appealing in the early years of an issue; however, their novelty may quickly wear off, particularly if an issue remains a lightening rod of controversy for decades.</p>
<p>It is also worth noting that images of government officials and buildings are the most prominent visual landscape in print news stories on abortion. This finding also is surprising. Because the space for images is much smaller in print outlets, visuals tend to be dramatic when they are used. We assumed that this must be a function of where the story was placed in the newspaper. Stories on the front page of the paper are more likely to include dramatic visuals than stories placed in other sections of the paper. The lack of dramatic visuals, then, could be a function of story placement.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0002764211419487">9</xref></sup> In fact, this largely explains the lack of dramatic visual landscapes. While 76.6% of the stories are in front section, only 11.4% of these are on the front page.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0002764211419487">Table 3</xref> shows the seven most prominent visual landscapes for each of the critical discourse moments. Here, we see that the visual landscapes do vary somewhat by the type of event being covered. News coverage of executive nominations, for example, often includes images of the nominee (10%) and the president (7%). Similarly, the anniversary of the <italic>Roe v. Wade</italic> Supreme Court decision, which is commemorated by activists on both sides of the abortion debate, includes images of pro-life demonstrations and protests (19%), pro-choice and pro-life representatives (7% and 6%, respectively) and pro-choice demonstrations and protests (4%). That said, there are a number of visual landscapes that are prominent across the different events. In fact, three of the visual landscapes appear in five of the event categories (pro-life demonstrations and protest, pro-choice spokesperson, and pro-life spokesperson) and two of the visual landscapes appear in all six of the event categories (anchor and government officials and buildings). This suggests that while the kinds of images chosen for a story reflect the event, there are common visual landscapes that are associated with the abortion issue. Specifically, the abortion issue is visually shown as one that involves social movements and politicians alike and that debates over abortion policy take place both in the courthouse, in legislatures, and on the street.</p>

<p>Finally, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0002764211419487">Table 4</xref> shows the most prominent visual landscapes associated with each event category for print and electronic outlets. Again, there are a number of similarities between the mediums in terms of the prominent visual landscapes. In fact, of the top six most used visual landscapes, print and electronic outlets have at least three in common. For example, print and electronic outlets share four visual landscapes during presidential elections: government buildings and/or officials, pro-life protest, pro-life spokesperson, and pro-choice protest. Similarly, the two mediums have four visual landscapes in common during Supreme Court decisions: government buildings and/or officials, pro-life protest, pro-choice spokesperson, and pro-choice protest. However, it is still clear that print outlets tend to use more dramatic visual landscapes in their abortion coverage. In the visuals of clinic violence, for instance, print outlets use landscapes that feature abortion clinics (19%), the victims of violence (14%), pro-life demonstrations and protests (11%), and the location where pro-life violence occurred (11%). Although electronic outlets also use images of protests (14%), clinics (6%), and the location where the violence occurred (8%) in their visual coverage, they do not make the victims of violence a central visual landscape.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0002764211419487">10</xref></sup> Similarly, print media emphasize dissent in their visual coverage of executive nominations. Visual landscapes in the print outlets include pro-life demonstrations and protests (4%), locations where pro-life violence occurred (4%), and demonstrations and spokespeople from other social movements (4%). Visual landscapes involving social movements, violence or activism, in contrast, rarely appear in electronic media’s visual coverage of executive nominations.</p>

<title>Discussion and Conclusion</title>
<p>In this article, we examine whether the images used to visually represent the abortion issue are homogenized. Drawing on an analysis of 2,093 images associated with six different kinds of abortion events, we find that the prominent visual landscapes in media coverage are very similar. The most frequently shown visual landscapes for the abortion issue include images of protest, representatives from the pro-life and pro-choice movements, government buildings and politicians, abortion clinics, and locations of pro-life violence and its victims. Similarly, we find that the most frequently shown visual landscapes for the abortion issue are relatively stable across print and electronic news outlets. In short, we find support for our argument that the visuals used to represent issues are homogenized in so far as the same kinds of landscapes dominate images regardless of differences in event and outlet type.</p>
<p>We also find that there are differences in terms of how each side of the movement is depicted visually. Images of pro-life activists engaged in protest are more frequent than those of pro-choice activists in both print and electronic outlets. Likewise, images of pro-choice activists as professional spokespeople advocating for abortion rights appear more often than those of pro-life activists with similar standing. Although this finding may be specific to the abortion debate, it warrants further investigation because it suggests that media professionals employ aesthetic conventions that emphasize dissent and confrontation when covering social movements that challenge the status quo. If such a convention does exist, it may create real image challenges for activists and social movement groups. For instance, social movement organizations that want to be regarded as legitimate political players may find it difficult to do so if there is a disjuncture between visual and other (e.g., written or audio) media representations.</p>
<p>Despite the similarities in the visual landscapes, there are event and medium particularities that create variance in how the abortion issue is visually represented to a broader audience. For example, there are some event specific visual landscapes. Images of presidential candidates and executive nominees are only relevant and prominent during particular kinds of events—presidential elections and after the nomination of a candidate for office. This suggests that visual conventions associated with events are not completely displaced by those used to visually represent issues. Additionally, there are fundamental differences between print and electronic news outlets, and these differences shape what visual conventions develop and, ultimately, the kinds of visual landscapes that come to dominate an issue. Anchors, for example, dominate the visual landscapes in electronic news coverage of abortion. Regardless of the event, anchors serve as the storyteller and visual focus in abortion coverage. Likewise, the visual landscapes in print outlets tend to be more dramatic than those in electronic outlets, particularly those images that are on the front page or with a feature story.</p>
<p>This research broadens how we think about visual coverage of social movements. Analyzing the dominant visual landscapes in issue coverage offers at least three conceptual advantages. First, it emphasizes the importance of issue history and trajectory to visual coverage. Although the scholarly focus largely has been on visual representations of protests in mainstream media, protests are but one kind of activity in which activists engage and may be visually represented. Activists hold press conferences, lobby government, and bring their causes to the courtroom—all of which present opportunities for activists to be visually represented in mainstream news. More important, activists are not the only visual material available for inclusion in coverage. Images of politicians, symbols, and locations also are included in news coverage and contribute to audience understandings of an issue. Thus, if scholars truly want to understand how social movements and their supporters are portrayed in mainstream media, they must evaluate images of movements relative to other visual landscapes that appear in coverage.</p>
<p>Second, it highlights the importance of professional norms and routines in the visual coverage of issues generally and social movements specifically. Media professionals develop visual conventions not just around events but also around issues over time. As such, visual landscapes in issue coverage are dynamic, particularly in the early years of an issue when media professionals are developing formulas for capturing the visual essence of an issue, its arenas of contestation, its symbols, and the players involved. This could have implications for how social movements are portrayed in media coverage. Activists that primarily engage in protest in the early days of the movement may find it difficult to shake off this visual type-casting later, even as they engage in other kinds of activities.</p>
<p>Finally, it highlights that scholars must remain cognizant of outlet particularities when trying to make sense of visual coverage. While mainstream news outlets look for dramatic images and footage to grab the attention of their target audience, some outlets are more likely to include the visually mundane in coverage than others because imagery is used in a fundamentally different way. In electronic outlets, visuals are the storytellers that reveal the nature of an event. Thus, although arresting visuals are desirable, other kinds of images are needed to flesh out the story.</p>
<p>There is still much work to be done on visual coverage of social movements. For instance, it is not clear whether individuals working in alternative news venues develop aesthetic conventions or how these conventions (assuming they exist) affect the visual images accompanying stories. This line of inquiry is particularly important in the contemporary media environment, where there are countless online sources offering their own perspectives—visual and otherwise—on the news of the day. Even mainstream news media make additional images and footage available online. In short, the contemporary media environment is ripe with visual descriptions of events, and it is difficult to imagine that this imagery does not play a role in how audiences understand new and enduring political issues. Now is the time for social scientists to examine the interplay between how an issue is described and visually depicted and whether inconsistency between the two influences how audience members act on their political knowledge.</p>

<p>Using Lexus-Nexus, indexes, abstracts, and manual inspection, the first author coded <italic>all</italic> media stories and visuals discussing the abortion issue during specified time frames. For anticipated events (such as legislative votes, presidential elections, executive nominations, and the <italic>Roe v. Wade</italic> anniversary), she coded media stories and landscapes about abortion occurring before and after the event. For unanticipated events (such as clinic violence and the murder of Dr. Gunn), she coded media stories and landscapes about abortion the date of and after the event. A detailed account of the sampling time frames for each critical discourse moment for each of the outlets is available by request.</p>

<p>There were up to eight visual landscapes in a given electronic news story. As such, the number of visuals is larger than the number of stories coded.</p>

<fn fn-type="other" id="fn5-0002764211419487">
<label>5.</label>
<p>The first author initially coded for the presence of 40 different visual landscapes, many of which never appeared in the sample. Images of pro-life and pro-choice activists engaged in lobbying, for example, never appeared in the sample. For the purposes of this article, we only focus on those landscapes that appeared at least once in conjunction with the stories. There are two additional points worth making. First, there was an “other” category in which the first author wrote down detailed descriptions of visuals. All but a small number of these images were coded into a meaningful category such as “unaffiliated individuals” and “unaffiliated activists.” Second, we collapsed some of the visual landscapes together. For example, images of pharmaceutical representatives, pill, and scientific procedures at pharmaceutical facilities were initially separate categories. Likewise, government officials were rarely shown apart from the buildings in which they work. In these circumstances, categories were collapsed.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn6-0002764211419487">
<label>6.</label>
<p>It is worth noting symbols, graphs, and maps were often shown in conjunction with the anchor. To create mutually exclusive categories, the first author categorized these images according to the visual focus of the image. For example, if the anchor was the focus of the shot and the graphic was placed off to the side, than the visual was coded as anchor. If the anchor’s voice was audible but the focus of the shot was a graph, than it was coded as a graph.</p>

<fn fn-type="other" id="fn7-0002764211419487">

<p>Although protests and vigils are very different kinds of movement activities, we collapsed these together because there were not enough instances of vigils for it to constitute its own category.</p>

<label>8.</label>
<p>We did find support for this assertion. There is a significant positive correlation between story length and the presence of visuals (<italic>r</italic> = .598, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001).</p>

<p>The structure of the electronic archive used in this research made the collection of story placement in a news cast cost prohibitive. Thus, we have only included inferences based on story placement for print outlets.</p>

<p>This does not mean that the victims are not shown, only that they are not central to the landscape. For example, the anchor may be featured in a landscape whereas a small picture of the victim is shown in the corner of the screen.</p>
