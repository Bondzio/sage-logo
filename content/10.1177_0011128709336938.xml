<abstract>
<p>Moffitt, Caspi, Harrington, and Milne (2002) found in a follow-up study that many of the supposedly adolescence-limited offenders had committed offenses past adolescence. This finding raises the question of whether adulthood starts later or whether there are two distinct delinquency types, adolescence limited and adolescence onset, each with its own etiology. The present study tested whether the adolescence-onset group could be predicted by childhood psychopathology, as compared to the adolescence-limited and no-offender groups. In sum, 355 boys and girls were included, who reported on their emotional and behavioral problems when they were 11 to 13 years old and on their self-reported criminal behavior 8 to 13 years later. The findings lend support tothe hypothesis that adolescence-onset offenders can be distinguished from adolescence-limited offenders.</p>

<p>An influential theory about the classification of antisocial behavior is Moffitt’s dual taxonomy model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0011128709336938">1993</xref>). This theory describes two types of antisocial offenders: the life-course-persistent offender, who engages in illegal behavior from a young age and continues to worsen thereafter, and the adolescence-limited offender, who engages in illegal activities only during adolescence. Both types are supposed to have different etiologies. The etiological basis of the life-course-persistent offender is thought to consist of an interaction between neuropsychological problems—verbal deficits, such as receptive listening and reading, and executive deficits, such as inattention and impulsivity—and disadvantageous environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0011128709336938">Moffitt, 1993</xref>). Furthermore, the presence of mental disorders—mania, schizophrenia, drug and alcohol abuse, depression and anxiety disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0011128709336938">Robins &amp; Regier, 1991</xref>)—may be associated with the continuity of antisocial behavior of the life-course-persistent offender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0011128709336938">Moffitt, 1993</xref>). Criminal behaviors of the adolescence-limited offender are hypothesized to result from the presence of antisocial role models and a so-called maturity gap; that is, biologically mature adolescents are ready to live an adult life in which they can legally gain resources, but society holds them back. To still gain resources, adolescents copy the illegal behavior of antisocial role models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0011128709336938">Moffitt, 1993</xref>). The existence of life-course-persistent and adolescence-limited offenders has been confirmed (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0011128709336938">Kratzer &amp; Hodgins, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0011128709336938">Moffitt &amp; Caspi, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0011128709336938">Raskin White, Bates, &amp; Buyske, 2001</xref>). But other types have been found as well—for example, the adolescence-onset offenders and the adult-onset offenders (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0011128709336938">Aguilar, Sroufe, Egeland &amp; Carlson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0011128709336938">Kratzer &amp; Hodgins, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0011128709336938">Lay, Ihle, Esser &amp; Schmidt, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0011128709336938">Raskin White et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0011128709336938">Scholte, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>As noted before, adolescence-limited offenders start and stop their criminal behavior during adolescence. However, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0011128709336938">Moffitt, Caspi, Harrington, and Milne (2002)</xref> found in a follow-up study on males who were defined as adolescence-limited offenders, many of the supposedly adolescence-limited offenders had committed offences past adolescence. This finding raises the question of whether the adolescence-onset type is really a separate delinquency type or is still the adolescence-limited type. In the latter case, the upper age range of adolescence increases. Given their findings, Moffitt et al. suggested that the transition from adolescence to adulthood is now at the age of 25 years. Yet, there are indications that psychopathology is related to late-start delinquency (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0011128709336938">Hodgins, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0011128709336938">Moffitt, Caspi, Dickson, Silva, &amp; Stanton, 1996</xref>). If the presence of mental disorders indeed predisposes an individual to persist in criminal behavior past adolescence, then adolescence-onset offending may not be similar to adolescence-limited offending but similar to adult-onset offending. The present study aims to shed light on whether adolescence-onset offenders constitute a different group from adolescence-limited offenders and adult-onset offenders.</p>
<p>The presence of a mental disorder may be a precursor of life-course-persistent offending, adolescence-onset offending, and adult-onset offending. As presented above, for the life-course-persistent offender, psychopathology may enhance criminal behavior. Psychopathology may also play a role in the criminal behavior of individuals who start offending during adolescence or adulthood and continue their criminal behavior over time. Note that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0011128709336938">Moffitt et al. (1996)</xref> suggest that adolescence-limited offenders are protected from becoming persistent offenders because, among other things, they have no mental problems. This suggestion implies that adolescence-onset offenders may continue their criminal behavior (started during adolescence) as a result of emerging psychopathology. In a follow-up study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0011128709336938">Moffitt et al. (2002)</xref> found that about one third of the life-course-persistent and adolescence-limited men reported that they had sought treatment for a mental disorder, whereas the nonoffender group had virtually no report of mental disorder. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0011128709336938">Hodgins (1995)</xref> suggested that adult starters among the mentally disordered begin their antisocial behavior at about the time that symptoms of their mental disorder emerge, which are thought to include cognitive–perceptual symptoms and drug abuse. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0011128709336938">Windle and Windle (1995)</xref> found that male adult-only aggressors were more likely than the control group to suffer from psychiatric conditions. Thus, psychopathology may be one of the factors that discriminate the adolescence-onset offenders and the adult starters from the adolescence-limited offenders. Psychopathology may maintain offending started during adolescence, or it may initiate offending started during adulthood. Adolescence-limited offenders then are thought to be similar to nonoffenders in that they have no psychopathology or no serious psychopathology.</p>
<p>Mental disorders related to delinquency include attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), conduct disorder, antisocial personality disorder, schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, drug abuse, posttraumatic stress disorder, and affective disorders (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0011128709336938">Eronen, Angermeyer, &amp; Schulze, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0011128709336938">Hodgins, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0011128709336938">1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0011128709336938">Pratt, Cullen, Blevins, Daigle, &amp; Unnever, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0011128709336938">Vermeiren, 2003</xref>). Note that symptoms of conduct disorder and antisocial personality disorder include criminal acts and are therefore tautological to criminal behavior.</p>
<p>Adult mental disorders can be predicted by childhood variables, such as conduct symptoms, depressive and psychosomatic symptoms, attentional problems, social deficits, psychotic symptoms, emotional problems, and cognitive impairment (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0011128709336938">Harrington, Fudge, Rutter, Pickles, &amp; Hill, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0011128709336938">Kagan &amp; Snidman, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0011128709336938">Kim-Cohen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0011128709336938">Poulton et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0011128709336938">Rutter, 1995</xref>). This implies that childhood psychopathology maybe predictive of life-course-persistent delinquency and delinquencystarted during adolescence or adulthood, which persists over time. In fact, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0011128709336938">Arseneault et al. (2003)</xref> found that childhood psychotic symptoms could predict violence by persons with schizophreniform disorder. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0011128709336938">Lay et al. (2005)</xref> observed that among males, conduct disorder and ADHD during childhood increased the risk for delinquency started in adolescence and early adulthood, as compared to no delinquency. This risk also increased by acute life events, externalizing behaviors, and drug use during adolescence. But Lay et al. state that even though childhood conduct problems could predicte late-onset offenders, such offenders were not engaged in serious criminal behavior before the age of 18; therefore, they should be seen as individuals with a long history of disruptive behavior and not as life-course-persistent offenders.</p>
<p>We hypothesize that the etiology of the adolescence-onset offenders differs from that of the adolescence-limited offenders by the presence of childhood psychopathology. Specifically, we hypothesize that childhood psychopathology can predict the adolescence-onset offender, the adult-onset offender, and the life-course-persistent offender, as compared to the adolescence-limited and nonoffender. The present study focuses on those aspects of childhood psychopathology that are associated with mental disorders related to criminal behavior. The focus is not on mental disorders that are, by definition, related to criminal behavior. Thus, the focal point is on psychotic-like, depressive, and anxiety symptoms and attention problems rather than on conduct disorder symptoms.</p>
<p>The database used is from a longitudinal study in the Netherlands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0011128709336938">Verhulst &amp; van der Ende, 1992</xref>). Because of the numerous participants tested and its longitudinal design, this study provides an exceptional data set to examine the above research question. During this study, the Youth Self-Report (YSR; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0011128709336938">Achenbach, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0011128709336938">Verhulst, van der Ende, &amp; Koot, 1997</xref>) was administered. The present study uses the subscales of the YSR that refer to mental problems related to, but not a tautology to, criminal behavior—namely, Thought Problems (items refer to hallucinations, delusions, obsessions, and strange behaviors), Anxious/Depressed, Withdrawn, and Attention Problems.</p>
<p>Criminal behavior is based on self-reports, which many criminologists now use because they are a less biased measure (e.g., with official records, systematic arrest and conviction bias may exclude some types of offenders) and they have been shown to be valid and reliable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0011128709336938">Hindelang, Hirschi, &amp; Weis, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0011128709336938">Hirschi, Hindelang, &amp; Weis, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0011128709336938">Sutterer &amp; Karger, 1994</xref>). The present study includes boys and girls. Only a few previous studies separately studied the offender types of males and females (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0011128709336938">Aguilar et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0011128709336938">Kratzer &amp; Hodgins, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0011128709336938">Moffitt &amp; Caspi, 2001</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0011128709336938">Moffitt and Caspi (2001)</xref> argue that the origins of life-course-persistent and adolescence-limited offending are explanatory across the sexes and irrespective of sex. The present study therefore shows separate and combined analyses of boys and girls. We control for educational level because higher educational level and cognitive abilities have been found to inhibit criminal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0011128709336938">Kratzer &amp; Hodgins, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0011128709336938">Piquero &amp; White, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0011128709336938">Redondo, Sanchez-Meca &amp; Garrido, 1999</xref>).</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>The original sample consisted of participants of the Zuid-Holland prospective longitudinal study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0011128709336938">Verhulst &amp; van der Ende, 1992</xref>). Zuid-Holland is a Dutch province with urban and rural areas. The sample was drawn from municipal birth registers that list all residents in the Dutch province. Based on victim reports and police records, crimes reported in the Netherlands ranged from 6.2% in 1980 to 9.6% in 1998. Police records show that among adolescents aged 12 to 17, the police interviewed 2.8% in 1980 to 4.2% in 1998 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0011128709336938">Eggen &amp; Goudriaan, 2008</xref>). These numbers reflect current offenses. In the present study, data on lifetime offenses were collected.</p>
<p>The original study measured participants’ behavioral and emotional problems at five 2-year intervals, starting in 1983 (<italic>n</italic> = 2,076). From the third wave on (1987), the YSR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0011128709336938">Achenbach, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0011128709336938">Verhulst et al., 1997</xref>) was used to measure behavioral and emotional problems. In the sixth wave (1997-1998), criminal behavior was assesed. For the present study, participants included were who completed the YSR when they were 11, 12, or 13 years old and were at least 21 years of age when they participated in the interview about criminal behavior. The first condition was to ensure that we measured childhood psychopathology; the second ensured that we would not unjustly classify a person as an adolescence-limited offender when in reality he or she was an adolescence-onset offender. As described in the section about group allocation, the cutoff age was 18 years for the adolescence-limited group (those who reported delinquency between the age of 12 and 18) and for the adolescence-onset group (those who reported delinquency between the age of 12 and 18 and past the age of 18). Setting the minimum age when criminal behavior was assessed to 21 years reduced the chance that an individual would be unjustly classified as an adolescence-limited offender when in reality he or she was an adolescence-onset offender. For example, a boy who completed the criminal behavior interview at 18 years and reported criminal behaviors at age 16 and 17 would have been defined as an adolescence-limited offender. In reality, he may have committed offenses at the age of 20, thereby making him an adolescence-onset offender. Had we included this participant, we would have misclassified him.</p>
<p>For individuals to be at least 21 when criminal behavior was assessed, we were limited to participants from Waves 3 and 4. A number of participants completed an YSR twice, when aged 11 to 13 (at the third and fourth waves). As such, the YSR completed at the oldest age was used for analyses, which resulted in 375 participants (177 boys, 198 girls). See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0011128709336938">Figure 1</xref> for the selection of the final sample by wave (Waves 3 and 4). Criminal behavior was assessed at ages 21 (<italic>n</italic> = 120), 22 (<italic>n</italic> = 111), 23 (<italic>n</italic> = 107), 24 (<italic>n</italic> = 35), 25 (<italic>n</italic> = 1), and 26 (<italic>n</italic> = 1). At the time of the interview (when ages ranged from 21 to 26), 2.0% had completed primary school; 25.5%, lower general secondary education; 55.2%, higher general secondary education; 14.4%, higher vocational education; and 2.8%, university. Information on educational level was missing for 2 participants.</p>

<p>The YSR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0011128709336938">Achenbach, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0011128709336938">Verhulst et al., 1997</xref>) is a questionnaire for respondents aged 11 to 18 years. It consists of two parts: competencies and problems. For the present study, four of the eight subscales of the 112-item problem-behavior part were analyzed. Items are rated on a 3-point scale (0 = <italic>not true</italic>, 1 = <italic>somewhat or sometimes true</italic>, 2 = <italic>very true or often true</italic>), and all ratings refer to problems or symptoms experienced during the preceding 6 months. The four subscales are</p>
<list id="list1-0011128709336938" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Anxious/Depressed</italic>: lonely; harms self; fears impulses; needs to be perfect; feels unloved; feels persecuted; feels worthless; nervous; fearful, anxious; feels too guilty; self-conscious; suspicious; suicidal thoughts; unhappy, sad, depressed; worries</p></list-item>

</list>
<p>The sum score of each subscale was used in the analyses. The Dutch version has good reliability and validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0011128709336938">De Groot, Koot, &amp; Verhulst, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0011128709336938">Verhulst et al., 1997</xref>). The Cronbach’s alpha for Withdrawn, Anxious/Depressed, and Attention Problems is .65, .84, and .70, respectively; the Cronbach’s alpha of Thought Problems is rather low (.51) but is identical to that reported in the Dutch manual of the YSR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0011128709336938">Verhulst et al., 1997</xref>). This low internal consistency can be explained by the fact that Thought Problems is a composite score of several unrelated symptoms (obsessive-compulsive symptoms and psychotic symptoms, such as hearing and seeing things that are not there).</p>

<sec id="section5-0011128709336938">
<title>Criminal behaviors</title>
<p>Criminal behaviors were assessed during an interview. A standardized questionnaire was used, an adaptation from the questionnaire used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0011128709336938">Junger-Tas, Terlouw, and Klein (1994)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0011128709336938">Klein (1989)</xref>. The present version was adapted to make it suitable for administration to adults. Furthermore, the categories of traffic offense and fraud were added. The interview measured 49 types of criminal behaviors, divided into seven categories: problem behavior (defined as fare dodging, joyriding, and graffiti), vandalism, offenses against property, aggression, drugs, traffic offenses, and fraud. Participants were first asked if they had ever performed each behavior, which was followed by more specific questions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011128709336938">Donker, Smeenk, van der Laan, &amp; Verhulst, 2003</xref>). For the present study, questions about the first and last age at which a behavior occurred (if performed at all) were used for group allocation.</p>

<sec id="section6-0011128709336938">
<title>Group Allocation</title>
<p>Several criminal and problem behaviors are rather common before the age of 15 (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0011128709336938">Sutterer &amp; Karger, 1994</xref>). We found that when compared to the other included criminal behaviors, stealing from store and vandalism were rather common, especially during childhood. Of the total sample, 30.4% had stolen from a store, of which 54.4% had committed this act before the age of 12 (the cutoff age used in the present study for adolescence was 12 years). Similarly, 23.2% of the total sample had committed a vandalistic act, of which 24.1% had committed it before the age of 12. Therefore, stealing from store and vandalism are not regarded as criminal behaviors if they occurred before the age of 12 but are regarded as criminal behaviors if they occurred after the age of 12. (A table with the number of participants that self-reported criminal behaviors—by age category and when the behavior was first reported—is available by request.)</p>
<p>The following behaviors were regarded as serious criminal behaviors when conducted at any age: more than two different vandalistic acts (damaging different properties such as phone booths, windows, trees, furniture), graffiti, theft (motor vehicle, bicycle, and bags and the like; pickpocketing and burglary; from car, phone booth, or vending machine), fare dodging in train, stealing (from work, home, school, other), handling stolen goods, threat, arson, violence (directed at people, wounding with weapon), disturbances in public, carrying a weapon, drugs (using hard drugs, selling drugs), traffic violations (joyriding, not stopping after an accident), and fraud (insurance, tax, and welfare; see also, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0011128709336938">Kratzer &amp; Hodgins, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0011128709336938">Moffitt et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0011128709336938">Raskin White et al., 2001</xref>).

A participant had to have damaged at least two types of properties. Further, these vandalistic acts, and “stealing from store” had to have been committed past the age of 12 years in order to classify a participant as an offender. When this behavior was performed before the age of 12 or when only one type of property had been damaged, it was not used for group allocation. Based on the age in which the criminal behavior was performed, participants were allocated to one of the following groups:</p>

<list-item><p><italic>Adolescence-onset offenders</italic>: started their criminal behavior during adolescence—did not report serious criminal behavior before 12 years but did report serious criminal behavior during adolescence and past the age of 18; this group consisted of 114 individuals (30.4% of the total sample; 71 males, 43 females).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Adult-onset offenders</italic>: started their criminal behavior during adulthood—that is, past the age of 18 years; this group consisted of 30 individuals (8% of the total sample; 13 males, 17 females).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>No offender</italic>: had never performed criminal behavior; this group consisted of 103 individuals (27.5% of the total sample; 18 males, 85 females).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>A small group of offenders (5.3% of the total sample) did not fit in the above groups and were excluded from further analyses. They were childhood-limited offenders (<italic>n</italic> = 3) and offenders who performed criminal behavior during childhood and adolescence (<italic>n</italic> = 17). Thus, the final sample comprised 355 participants who were included in the analyses.</p>
<p>Based on the dual taxonomy model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0011128709336938">Moffitt, 1993</xref>) and previous studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0011128709336938">Hodgins, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0011128709336938">Moffitt et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0011128709336938">Moffitt et al., 2002</xref>), our hypothesis was that childhood psychopathology can predict the adolescence-onset offender, adult-onset offender, and life-course-persistent offender but not the no-offender and adolescence-limited offender. Therefore, the contrast group is a combination of the no-offender and adolescence-limited group and, as such, is referred to as the no-serious-offender group.</p>

The no-serious-offender group was used as the contrast group. We controlled for educational level. Two further logistic regression analyses were conducted to compute the ORs for the adolescence-onset offender group by Thought Problems, Withdrawn, Attention Problems, and Anxious/Depressed, for boys and girls separately, controlling for educational level. ORs were not calculated for boys and girls separately in the life-course-persistent and adult-onset group, because these group sizes were too small (13 &lt; <italic>n</italic> &lt; 23).

<p>The multinomial logistic regression analysis showed that all childhood psychopathology variables were predictive of adolescence-onset offending. With every 1-point increase in Thought Problems, Attention Problems, and Withdrawn, the odds for offending starting in adolescence, as compared to no serious offending, increased by 1.4, 1.1, and 1.5, respectively.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The aim of the present study was to test whether the adolescence-onset offenders differ from the adolescence-limited offenders by the presence of childhood psychopathology. Specifically, it tested whether the adolescence-onset offender, the adult-onset offender, and the life-course-persistent offender, as compared to the nonserious offender (adolescence-limited offenders and nonoffenders), can be predicted by the childhood psychopathology (Anxious/Depressed, Thought Problems, Withdrawn, and Attention Problems) reported by an individual at the age of 11 to 13 years. Based on the prospective measures from a longitudinal birth cohort, the results showed that higher levels of Thought Problems, Withdrawn, and Attention Problems increase the risk for adolescence-onset offenders, as compared to nonserious offenders; Anxious/Depressed, however, was protective of adolescence-onset offending. Furthermore, Thought Problems and Withdrawn were predictive for the life-course-persistent offenders but not for the adult-onset offenders. The finding that Thought Problems and Withdrawn can predict adolescence-onset and life-course-persistent offenders suggests that adolescence-onset offenders are more similar to life-course-persistent offenders than to adolescence-limited offenders. Therefore, the present findings suggest that even though the adolescence-onset offenders arose out of the adolescence-limited offenders, they should not be regarded as adolescence-limited offenders but rather as a distinct group with similarities to the life-course-persistent offenders. As suggested in the introduction, childhood psychopathology predicted both life-course-persistent offenders and adolescence-onset offenders. The group of adult-onset offenders was quite small. Future studies with more participants may reveal the predictive value of Thought Problems in this group to test the reliability of the present findings.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0011128709336938">Moffitt and Caspi (2001)</xref> argue that the origins of life-course-persistent and adolescence-limited offending are explanatory across the sexes and irrespective of sex. The present study intended to test whether this is true for adolescence-onset and adult-onset offending. Unfortunately, the sample sizes of male and female life-course-persistent offenders and adult-onset offenders were too small for reliable analyses on each subgroup. The analyses were therefore confined to the adolescence-onset group, but the findings are still preliminary owing to small sample sizes. The findings show that Withdrawn is predictive of adolescence-onset offending in males and females, whereas Anxious/Depressed is protective in males only. As such, childhood psychopathology can predict male and female adolescence-onset offenders.</p>
<p>The Thought Problems subscale is a composite score of obsessive-compulsive symptoms, psychotic symptoms, and strange behaviors. Withdrawn behavior is also characteristic of, among other disorders, schizophrenia and schizoid personality disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0011128709336938">American Psychiatric Association, 2000</xref>). Thought Problems and Withdrawn were not strongly related in the present study (<italic>r</italic> = .22). Thus, two independent psychopathology symptom clusters reported during childhood indicate that schizophreniform disorders are predictive of adolescence-onset offending and life-course-persistent offending. This finding is in line with that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0011128709336938">Arseneault et al. (2003)</xref>. They selected individuals with schizophreniform disorder from the Dunedian sample and found, similar to the present findings, that childhood psychotic symptoms predict later violence by individuals with schizophreniform disorder. But whereas Arseneault et al. found this to be true in individuals with schizophreniform disorder, we found that Thought Problems and Withdrawn were even in a general-population sample predictive of criminal behavior. Moreover, whereas Arseneault et al. showed that psychotic symptoms are predictive of violent behavior, the findings of the present study show that Thought Problems and Withdrawn are predictive of criminal behavior.</p>
<p>Withdrawn behavior is also related to depression and major depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0011128709336938">American Psychiatric Association, 2000</xref>). Previous studies have observed a relation between major depression and crimes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0011128709336938">Hodgins, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0011128709336938">Swanson, Holzer, Ganju, &amp; Jono, 1990</xref>). But other studies have found that depressed patients are less likely to be violent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0011128709336938">Pearson, Wilmont, &amp; Padi, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0011128709336938">Rossi et al., 1986</xref>). In the present study, symptoms of anxiety and depression protected one from becoming an adolescence-onset offender, a finding that was also observed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0011128709336938">Moffitt et al. (2002)</xref>. These symptoms possibly increase the odds for offending when assessed at a later age, when it is more likely that people have had experiences that induce more severe anxiety or depression symptoms (e.g., traumatic experiences).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0011128709336938">Lay et al. (2005)</xref> found that the risk for adolescent and adult-onset offending increased when individuals were diagnosed with ADHD during childhood. The present study also showed that symptoms similar to those of ADHD (assessed as Attention Problems) increased the risk for adolescence-onset offenders. However, contrary to the findings of Lay et al., Attention Problems did not increase the risk for offending started past the age of 18 (adult-onset group). But note that the number of participants in the group of adult-onset offenders was quite small and only half of them were male. Previous studies have shown that symptoms of inattentive and overactive behaviors are more prevalent among boys than girls (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0011128709336938">Cantwell, 1996</xref>). Another explanation may be that reported Attention Problems during childhood are not stable over the years. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0011128709336938">Hart et al. (1995)</xref> showed that hyperactivity–impulsivity declines with increasing age. However, criminal behavior may not be related to attention problems but rather to a third factor, which is related to attention problems and criminal behavior—that is, conduct problems. Attention problems are strongly associated with conduct problems (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0011128709336938">Anderson, Williams, McGee, &amp; Silva, 1987</xref>). Because the Aggressive Behavior subscale of the YSR was assessed in the Zuid-Holland study, we were able to test this supposition. Aggressive Behavior was indeed related to Attention Problems (<italic>r</italic> = .60). And, indeed, when Aggressive Behavior was included in the multinomial regression analyses, Attention Problems was no longer a significant predictor of adolescence-onset offending.</p>
<p>Although previous studies have shown that life-course-persistent offending is related to ADHD (for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0011128709336938">Lynam, 1996</xref>), in the present study, the risk for life-course-persistent offending did not increase with an increase in Attention Problems. The Attention Problems subscale is a composite score of hyperactivity–impulsivity and inattention. Perhaps, these two factors work antagonistically to predict criminal behavior. Another possibility involves the small number of life-course-persistent offenders.</p>
<p>In line with the dual taxonomy model of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0011128709336938">Moffitt (1993)</xref>, the present study found a life-course-persistent and an adolescence-limited group. Moffitt hypothesized that the life-course-persistent group is dominated by males, whereas the adolescence-limited group is highly represented by females. The findings of the present study agree with this hypothesis. The percentage of males among the life-course-persistent offenders was 60.5%; among the adolescence-limited offenders, 54%; and among the no-offender group, 17.4%. Whereas males dominate the adolescence-onset-group (62%), females dominate the adult-onset offender group (43% males).</p>
<p>The adolescence-onset group is quite large (30.4% of the total sample) and so may be regarded as an indication that the maturity gap is prolonged; that is, adulthood now starts later, as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0011128709336938">Moffitt et al. (2002)</xref>. In that case, the upper age range of the adolescence-limited group should increase, possibly to the mid-20s. But adolescence-onset offenders were similar to life-course-persistent offenders in that the odds for these two offender types increased with every 1-point increase in Thought Problems and Withdrawn. Moreover, the risk for adolescence-onset offending increased by an increase in another childhood psychopathology measure—namely, Attention Problems. This finding may indicate that offending past adolescence, unlike adolescence-limited offending, is not a normal aspect of growing up but rather related to psychopathology. Thus, these findings suggest that the adolescence-limited and adolescence-onset types are two distinct offender types. In that case, the age range defining the adolescence-limited group should not increase. Thus, the findings of this study do not indicate that the maturity gap is prolonged and that adulthood presently starts later. To validate the present findings using different methodologies, future studies may study the duration of the maturity gap. Because the maturity gap refers to no or limited access to resources and status, the end of the maturity gap could be defined by graduation plus up to 2 years (an individual has access to recourses once he or she has a job and thus earns money). Another possibility would be to control for employment or income. It would be interesting to look more closely at the nonoffending males in future studies. These may be the males who earn from legal activities during adolescence, are thereby able to gain resources, and thus may not experience the maturity gap (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0011128709336938">Moffitt, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>A limitation of the present study is the limited number of indicators of a mental disorder. Other possible indicators could be childhood traumatic experiences and drug use. The present study did not include neuropsychological deficits or environmental risk factors. So far, childhood neuropsychological deficits have been shown to be related to the life-course-persistent offender (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0011128709336938">Aguilar et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0011128709336938">Moffitt &amp; Caspi, 2001</xref>). Therefore, it is unlikely that neuropsychological deficits assessed during childhood are predictive of criminal behavior that starts long beyond childhood—that is, during adolescence or adulthood. However, future studies may test whether Thought Problems assessed during childhood remain strong predictors of late-onset offending, when controlling for neuropsychological deficits and environmental risk factors assessed during adolescence. A further limitation was the small sample that was eventually included in the analyses—especially, the small number of males and females in the adult-onset group and life-course-persistent group and the small number of males in the no-offending group. Finally, another limitation was the retrospective nature of the assessment of criminal behavior. The strengths of the present study include its longitudinal character (10-13 years) and its focus on indications of mental disorders that are not, by definition, related to criminal behavior.</p>
<p>The findings of the present study are relevant not only for studies on the classification of offender types (e.g., life-course persistent, adolescence limited, adolescence onset, and adult onset) but also for studies on the etiology of offender types. So far, when studying the etiology of offender types, researchers have focused on neuropsychological deficits, environmental risk factors, and early aggressive and criminal behaviors. When mental disorders were studied in relation to the prediction of antisocial behavior at all, the focus was on conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and ADHD (but <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0011128709336938">Lay et al., 2005</xref>). Moreover, most studies focused on the life-course-persistent and adolescence-limited offender. The present findings validate more studies on mental disorders as a predictor of a third group: the adolescence-onset offender.</p>
<p>The findings suggest that adolescence-limited and adolescence-onset offenders form two separate groups. Therefore, crime prevention programs should realize that these two distinct offender groups require different interventions. Offenders starting their criminal behavior during adolescence may be screened for attention problems and thought problems, to select those individuals with the worst prognoses regarding the continuing of their offending behavior. For males, intervention programs may focus on attention-related problems, and for females, they may focus on thought problems. However, more information is necessary on which aspects of attention problems and thought problems are predictive. Future studies may examine whether the prediction of the adolescence-onset individuals among the adolescence starters can be improved by combining measures of psychopathology with an outlook for transition events. Such transition events may include employment, military service, and/or relationships—that is, those events that provide opportunities for desistence from crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0011128709336938">Moffitt, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>Regarding juvenile justice programming, sanctions for those adolescence-start offenders who are most likely to stop their criminal behavior by early adulthood—thus, adolescence-start offenders without psychopathology or indications thereof—may be confined to some form of deterring, such as community service. Education about the consequences of a criminal record, in terms of future career and family life, may also be helpful. Adolescence starters with indications of psychopathology may profit from sanctions, in combination with treatment for their psychopathology symptoms.</p>
<p>In sum, the findings of the present longitudinal study show that psychopathology—namely, withdrawn behavior, thought problems, and attention problems—is a precursor of adolescence-onset and life-course-persistent offending. The finding that the adolescence-onset offender is similar to the life-course-persistent offender, with respect to its precursors, lends support to the hypothesis that the adolescence-limited offender can be distinguished from the adolescence-onset offenders. Future studies may further test the validity of this hypothesis. Studies may test whether thought problems and withdrawn behavior still increase the risk for adolescence-onset offending when environmental and neuropsychological risk factors are taken into account. If so, studies may be aimed at unraveling what aspect of these symptoms increases the risk for adolescence-onset and life-course-persistent offending. The present study may then be a start for further studies on the etiology of adolescence-onset offending.</p>
