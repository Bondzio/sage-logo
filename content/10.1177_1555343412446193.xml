<abstract>
<p>The authors report two experiments studying the requirements for effective decision making in a complex environment. The focus lies on three components of individual cognitive readiness: situation awareness (SA), problem solving, and decision making. Participants performed a simulated society management task in which they could allocate resources to stabilize a national crisis involving multiple interrelated factors (political, economic, environmental, and social). A striking aspect of this simulation is that even though information about the causes and effects within the system is available, most individuals fail to bring the system to the targeted state because of unintended consequences of their decisions. The experiments test the impact of two cognitive support tools designed to improve anticipation of future outcomes. Results show that supporting short-term anticipation (with perfectly accurate projections) was insufficient to improve effectiveness, but supporting long-term anticipation (with approximate projections) successfully improved performance in this complex environment. We conclude with a review of requirements that training and technological support should address to augment individual cognitive readiness for operations in complex environments and propose an extension to SA theory by conceptualizing a Level 4 SA (long-term projection) that may be particularly important to overcome the “wall of complexity.”</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>D<sc>ecision makers in critical areas, such as national defense, security, health care</sc>, and environmental management, face the daunting task of influencing a complex dynamic system of systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1555343412446193">Carafano &amp; Weitz, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1555343412446193">Horn, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1555343412446193">Sterman, 2006</xref>). Unfortunately, complex systems tend to overwhelm the cognitive capabilities of decision makers, often leading to a phenomenon called <italic>tunnel vision</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1555343412446193">Miller, 1982</xref>). Tunnel vision is defined as insufficient problem formulation and situation assessment, producing narrow-minded interventions that may lead to failure or even to the emergence of new unintended problems. Conversely, taking a comprehensive (and long-term) approach to deal more effectively with complex problems can be excessively challenging without cognitive support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1555343412446193">Dörner, 1996</xref>). Although human reasoning about complex dynamic systems is limited by the computational capabilities of the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1555343412446193">Halford, Baker, McCredden, &amp; Bain, 2005</xref>), technology, training, and teamwork may augment these capabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1555343412446193">Gonzalez, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1555343412446193">Karakul &amp; Qudrat-Ullah, 2008</xref>). According to many researchers and practitioners, there has been significant progress in the past decade in developing technologies and methods that support human sensemaking and decision-making processes in complex domains, such as command and control (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1555343412446193">Allen, Corpac, &amp; Frisbie, 2006</xref>), operational analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1555343412446193">Langton &amp; Das, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1555343412446193">Lizotte et al., 2008</xref>), and management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1555343412446193">Busemeyer &amp; Pleskac, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1555343412446193">Vester, 2007</xref>). Nonetheless, examples in which cognitive support fails to improve performance abound (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1555343412446193">Arnold, Collier, Leech, &amp; Sutton, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1555343412446193">Lerch &amp; Harter, 2001</xref>). These examples are also very valuable since they help one to better understand human cognitive requirements when faced with complex problems. Better knowledge of such requirements is crucial to help guide the development and evaluation of the technologies and methods in the cognitive support toolbox.</p>
<p>Understanding the dynamics of a complex system or organization can help one foresee the side effects of a decision, adapt to events before they occur, and influence system behavior more effectively. <italic>Comprehension</italic> is defined here as the product of sensemaking: a motivated, continuous effort to understand information or a situation to anticipate its trajectory and act effectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1555343412446193">Klein, Moon, &amp; Hoffman, 2006</xref>). Naturally, complex systems defy the brain’s ability to anticipate future outcomes, even when accurate information is available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1555343412446193">Funke, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1555343412446193">Putz-Osterloh, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1555343412446193">Rousseau, 2003</xref>). One way to provide cognitive support is to use a model of the system to derive plausible outcomes for a specific intervention or series of decisions, effectively enabling “what-if” reasoning during strategy development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1555343412446193">Lizotte et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1555343412446193">Vester, 2007</xref>). Indeed, such an approach amounts to supporting situation awareness (SA) in terms of the projection of future outcomes. SA is conceptualized as combining the perception of elements in the environment within a volume of space and time (Level 1 SA), the comprehension of their meaning (Level 2 SA), and the projection of their status in the near future (Level 3 SA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1555343412446193">Endsley, 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1555343412446193">1995</xref>). But what about the not-so-near future? We propose that decision support technology has the potential to extend human reasoning capabilities beyond <italic>proximal</italic> outcomes, leading to a greater SA (i.e., supporting projection of the situations’ current course farther into the future) and to the ability to consider higher-order effects of decisions (indirect effects that follow from first-order impacts of interventions), which may be critical for success in complex domains.</p>
<p>Yet, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1555343412446193">Lerch and Harter (2001)</xref> have found that this type of <italic>feedforward</italic> support does not necessarily lead to improved performance. Indeed, they showed that feedforward support alone was detrimental to performance and that feedforward support combined with feedback yielded a performance level that did not differ from the control condition, although an accelerated rate of learning was observed. The simulated task (mail operations management) required real-time dynamic decision making whereby situation monitoring and control are assumed to compete for attentional resources because of time pressure. <italic>Monitoring</italic> refers to the decision makers’ tracking of key system variables, and <italic>control</italic> refers to the decision makers’ generation, evaluation, and selection of alternative actions that can change the system. In the Lerch and Harter study, participants with feedforward support could actually freeze the world, project the status of the system into the future with perfect accuracy, perform what-if simulations (i.e., test various courses of action), and use this information to make decisions in the present. Lerch and Harter interpret the fact that this form of support, by itself, degraded performance by speculating that participants “allocated too many of their scarce attentional resources to exploring the combinatorial decision space, got lost in the decision space, and therefore made worse decisions than those participants without the feedforward facility” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1555343412446193">Lerch &amp; Harter, 2001</xref>, p. 81). They conclude that the design of feedforward support requires a better understanding of its benefits and costs. This form of cognitive support thus deserves further investigation on its factors of success and failure. For instance, a logical next step is to investigate whether feedforward support improves performance in task conditions involving no time pressure.</p>

<title>Cognitive Readiness</title>
<p>The high-valued goal of the cognitive engineering efforts mentioned previously is to improve the <italic>cognitive readiness</italic> of individuals working in complex domains, such as defense and security (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1555343412446193">Carafano &amp; Weitz, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1555343412446193">Etter, Foster, &amp; Steele, 2000</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1555343412446193">Morrison and Fletcher (2002)</xref> define cognitive readiness as the mental preparation (including knowledge, skills, abilities, and attitudes) an individual needs to establish and sustain competent performance in complex operational environments. It is an integrative concept that includes 10 subcomponents, namely, SA, memory, transfer, metacognition, automaticity, problem solving, decision making, mental flexibility and creativity, leadership, and emotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1555343412446193">Morrison &amp; Fletcher, 2002</xref>). Cognitive readiness can be improved through selection of skilled individuals, training, and technological support. The present study focuses on three components of cognitive readiness: (a) SA, the ability to perceive, comprehend, and anticipate events in a dynamic environment; (b) problem solving, the ability to analyze the current situation, derive possible strategies, and develop plans; and (c) decision making, the ability to recognize learned patterns, review courses of action, assess their impact, and make a choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1555343412446193">Fletcher, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1555343412446193">Morrison and Fletcher (2002)</xref> assert that cognitive readiness can be seen as a combination of three general abilities (with which the 10 components of cognitive readiness are associated): (a) recognizing patterns in apparently chaotic situations (SA is of key relevance here), (b) modifying problem solutions as required by the current situation (which relates to the problem-solving component), and (c) implementing plans of action on the basis of these solutions (relevant to the decision-making component). Although all components of cognitive readiness are relevant to human adaptability and effectiveness in highly complex domains, with the subset selected for the present study, we sought to sample one component from each of these three general abilities. Thus in the present studies, we investigate factors that may support adaptability and competent performance in complex operational environments by focusing on the SA, problem-solving, and decision-making components of cognitive readiness.</p>
<p>Herein, our goal is not to assess the overall cognitive readiness of individuals tested in our experiments but, rather, to identify metrics to guide the development of tools and methods to improve cognitive readiness. Specifically, we seek through the following experiments to help identify useful predictors of goal attainment that can be derived from the three components of cognitive readiness considered here (SA, problem solving, and decision making). In addition to metrics development, the focus of this work is to test the effectiveness of two cognitive support tools designed to improve SA through the projection of short-term outcomes in Experiment 1 and of longer-term outcomes in Experiment 2. Jointly considering various components of cognitive readiness clearly has the advantage of allowing a more comprehensive assessment of the impacts of cognitive support tools or, conversely, of identifying the differential effects of such tools as a function of individual characteristics.</p>
<p>Although the distinction between short-term and long-term projection clearly seems useful, especially in complex domains in which long-term outcomes do not follow linearly from those observed in the short term, the boundary between the two is ill defined. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1555343412446193">Endsley (2001)</xref> stated that “it is the ability to project the future actions of the elements in the environment, at least in the very near term, that forms the third and highest level of situation awareness” (p. 5). The lack of a clear bound on what is meant by “very near term” is essentially attributable to the fact that it shall vary according to the task and context because of the unique memory load involved. Indeed, projection tends to impose a strong load on working memory by requiring the maintenance of present conditions, future conditions, and rules used to generate the latter from the former (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1555343412446193">Wickens, 1992</xref>). Working memory therefore is believed to impose a task-specific limit to the (unaided) human projection ability, which constrains Level 3 SA to the near term (although expertise may help overcome these limits). In the context of the turn-based task described next, <italic>proximal outcomes</italic> will refer specifically to the next game turn, whereas <italic>long-term outcomes</italic> will refer to all turns that follow. We justify this boundary by the observation that in this highly challenging task context, the ability to anticipate outcomes for the next game turn is already severely limited.</p>
<p>The simulated task used in the two following experiments is based on a German educational computer game titled <italic>Ecopolicy</italic> (MCB-Verlag). <italic>Ecopolicy</italic> is a society management game that aims to educate people about the importance of “networked thinking,” that is, striving to understand how variables interrelate when dealing with complex systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1555343412446193">Vester, 2007</xref>). Indeed, a particularly striking aspect of this game is that even though the causes and effects within the system are clearly shown, people have a great difficulty bringing the system to the targeted state. They fail to understand the implications of their decisions, and the system clearly demonstrates “policy resistance” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1555343412446193">Sterman, 2006</xref>), whereby interventions turn out to have the opposite of the intended effect. This strategy game shows the pitfalls of focusing on isolated problems without carefully considering the whole set of interactions within the system (i.e., tunnel vision). A key difference from the classic studies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1555343412446193">Dörner (1996)</xref> is that <italic>Ecopolicy</italic> provides structural knowledge about the system (cause-and-effect relations are provided to the decision makers), yet the task still proves to be a considerable challenge for most individuals. Given the decision-making environment selected for the two following experiments, the scope of the present work mainly applies to operational- and strategic-level decision making in complex domains, specifically in situations whose specific characteristics are novel and in which situation understanding, learning, and adaptation are critical.</p>

<title>Experiment 1</title>
<p>Given that humans have difficulty anticipating the proximal evolution of complex systems and fail to understand the immediate effects of their own decisions because of fundamental computational limits of working memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1555343412446193">Newell &amp; Simon, 1972</xref>), we hypothesize that a tool that correctly extrapolates these dynamic effects should help one to evaluate decisions and revise them before committing to a specific intervention. This tool may not solve the problem of having to develop an appropriate strategy involving multiple decisions over time (so success is far from guaranteed), but it may provide valuable help to cope with the complexity of the system.</p>
<p>The goal of Experiment 1 is to test the impact of a short-term projection tool (to show whether it addresses a critical support requirement) and to develop two metrics related to cognitive readiness, namely, for SA and problem solving. The first metric is based on the short-term anticipation of outcomes and relates to Level 3 SA. The (unaided) ability to project the state of the environment in the near future and to anticipate the near-term consequences of a decision is expected to be important for the selection of an effective course of action. We thus hypothesize that Level 3 SA will be positively correlated to goal attainment. We also test whether simply emphasizing anticipation (by virtue of asking participants the anticipated outcome) proves helpful for decision making compared with a baseline condition without the anticipation measure. The second metric is based on the degree of strategy elaboration and relates to problem-solving ability. We hypothesize that strategy elaboration (problem solving), which involves identifying subgoals and long-term planning, will be positively correlated to goal attainment in a complex environment, since insufficient problem formulation and analysis are typically put forward as key reasons for failure in this context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1555343412446193">Dörner, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1555343412446193">Miller, 1982</xref>).</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section5-1555343412446193">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Thirty university students (mean age = 22.4 years, <italic>SD</italic> = 3.1) from a wide variety of backgrounds (mainly social sciences and engineering), 11 men and 19 women, reporting normal or corrected-to-normal vision and normal hearing received $15 compensation for their participation. Although the main goal of this experiment is to compare the results of participants using a short-term projection tool with those of other participants who do not have access to this tool, we were concerned that the measure of (unaided) Level 3 SA per se might have a favorable effect on goal attainment by promoting anticipatory thinking. Two groups with no access to the projection tool were thus created: one without and one with the Level 3 SA measure. Group 1 is thus called the baseline condition (with no tool and no Level 3 SA measure). Group 2 and Group 3 participants are required to predict the short-term effects of their decisions. Group 3 benefits from a computer program that correctly extrapolates the short-term outcomes of a decision. Note that Group 3 participants are asked to anticipate the state of the next game year before using the extrapolation tool so as to be on equal footing with Group 2 for this measure. Participants were randomly assigned to one of these three groups (Group 1 = without tool and without SA measure; Group 2 = without tool and with SA measure; Group 3 = with tool and with SA measure).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1555343412446193">
<title>Apparatus</title>
<p>The experiment is run on a standard personal computer with two flat-screen monitors. The first monitor displays the <italic>Ecopolicy</italic> interface, and the second monitor displays an interactive Microsoft Excel file that prompts the user for predictions and confidence ratings for these predictions and then presents the extrapolation tool. The MORAE software (TechSmith) logs all user interactions with input devices (keyboard, mouse) and records the information displayed on each of the two monitors.</p>
<p>In <italic>Ecopolicy</italic>, participants are in charge of managing a country for 12 simulated years (or game turns) by allocating “activity points” in one of four areas that can be influenced directly: sanitation, production, education, or quality of life. The state of the situation in a given year is described through eight variables that range from 0 to 30: politics, sanitation, production, environmental stress, education, quality of life, growth rate, and population. In the simulation, these eight dimensions mutually influence each other so that each decision results in a chain of effects within the system. Each year, the participant receives a number of additional activity points that depend on the current state of the society. Depending on its current value, each variable can be in a desirable or an undesirable state as described by a five-color scale that goes from green to red. The goal of the participant is to bring all eight dimensions within the green zone by Year 12. If a dimension goes too far in the red zone, the current government is overthrown and the game ends. The goals are (a) to maximize the value for politics, sanitation, education, and quality of life; (b) to minimize environmental stress; and (c) to keep production, growth rate, and population in the middle range of the scale. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1555343412446193">Figure 1</xref> illustrates the main <italic>Ecopolicy</italic> interface. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1555343412446193">Figure 2</xref> shows the interactions between system variables. The functional relationship between two variables can be viewed by clicking of a specific interaction (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1555343412446193">Figure 3</xref>). <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1555343412446193">Appendix A</xref> provides further details on the <italic>Ecopolicy</italic> simulation.</p>

<p>The projection tool made available to a subset of participants (Group 3) implements the cause-and-effect relations (available to all participants in the Functions panel) and provides the user with an accurate extrapolation of the effects of the participant’s decisions for the next game year. The participant must first enter the eight variables of the current situation (and the number of activity points available) and then enter his or her decision in the Excel file. The projection tool (shown in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app2-1555343412446193">Appendix B</xref>) instantly calculates the outcomes of that decision for the next game year. Participants can therefore see the effects of taking no action and the effects of various interventions before making a final decision.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1555343412446193">
<title>Design and procedure</title>
<p>Participants underwent the following test procedure during a single visit in a research laboratory at Université Laval. The session began with an interactive tutorial on how to play the game (Groups 1 through 3), how to generate predictions (Groups 2 and 3), and how to use the extrapolation tool (Group 3). The interactive tutorial generally took about 15 to 20 min to complete (ending when both the participant and experimenter agreed that all aspects of the task and interface were clearly understood). <italic>Ecopolicy</italic> involves a very user-friendly graphical user interface designed to educate high school students about systemic thinking. The complexity lies mainly in the chain of effects rather than in any single element or relation. Prior to the task, participants were made aware that the task is complex and were instructed that it is very important to inspect all 18 cause-effect relations between the society’s dimensions and to try to develop a good strategy.</p>
<p>After entering a decision, participants entered their predictions of the future state of the eight variables (and a confidence rating in those predictions) in the Excel file displayed on the second monitor (Groups 2 and 3). Then, participants in Group 3 could use the extrapolation tool to observe the actual effects of their decision, consider other options, and if desired, change their decision (note that the anticipation measure was based on the initial decision, and predictions could not be changed at this point). Finally, participants were presented a postexperimental questionnaire that measured the degree of strategy elaboration and recorded helpfulness ratings about the tool and the anticipation measure itself. There was no time limit to accomplish the task. Participants could inspect the cause-effect relationships in the system (graphic display and text description of these effects) to analyze the system and derive an intervention strategy. Feedback on the changes occurring in the society was provided during the transition from one turn to the next. The best known solution to the <italic>Ecopolicy</italic> game was found by the experimenters following extensive gameplay. The solution reaches the stated objective at the end of Turn 9.</p>

<title>Goal attainment</title>
<p>The game ends after one of three events occurs: (a) the society has reached the target state for each of the eight dimensions, (b) 12 years have passed, or (c) the government has been overthrown. The score at the end of the game (i.e., performance or goal achievement) is calculated as follows: First, the relative distance to the nearest “green value” is calculated for each dimension of the society. The eight numbers are averaged and the score is then converted to a scale ranging from 0 to 100. This basic score is then weighted by the number of turns completed to give a bonus to those who lose later and to give a greater bonus to those who win earlier (i.e., winning on Turn 9 out of a maximum of 12 turns yields a score of 100%). The numerator of the weight factor is the number of turns completed, and the denominator is 15 (not 12) because the game can be won on Turn 9/12 (wining on Turn 9 yields a weight factor of 15/15, winning on Turn 12 yields a weight factor of 12/15). Therefore, winning on Turn 12 gives a basic score of 100% (all subgoals in the green zone) × 12/15 (weight factor), hence a weighted score of 80%. All else being equal, those who survive longer are thus considered more effective, yet those who win earlier than the 12th turn are also considered more effective.</p>

<title>Anticipation accuracy (Level 3 SA)</title>
<p>The anticipation measure consists of asking the participant to infer the state of the society for the next year. Each prediction is a set of eight discrete numbers, one for each specific dimension of the society. The anticipation accuracy score for a given participant corresponds to the average sum of squared errors (SSE) between the eight predicted values and the eight correct values for each game year. A lower SSE value corresponds to a greater anticipation accuracy. The anticipation measure is about understanding short-term effects or outcomes irrespective of the rate of change (e.g., minutes, weeks, or years). When managing a nation, for example, short-term effects of interventions can be observed within a year, and long-term effects may extend for decades.</p>

<title>Strategy elaboration (problem solving)</title>
<p>Participants were asked to write down a description of the strategy they used during the task. The degree of elaboration of the strategies reported by participants was assessed by two judges who were well acquainted with the task and unaware of each participant’s experimental condition. The final measure was based on the average rating of the two judges. The ratings indicated the number of distinct subgoals and constraints (e.g., things to avoid) expressed in the written strategy. The segmentation was conceptually based (i.e., judges identified the number of relevant and unique subgoals, rather than simply counting propositions). For example, the following strategy has three distinct subgoals: “(a) Augment sanitation to diminish environmental stress so that quality of life may improve. (b) Keep production at the same level and even decrease it a little to keep it under control. (c) Augment education a little each turn.” The scoring scale for the strategy elaboration measure thus ranges from 0 to infinity and corresponds to the number of distinct subgoals and constraints in the reported strategy. Note that judging strategy quality would be very interesting as well. However, it would be quite challenging to make valid qualitative assessments because very different strategies can lead to favorable outcomes; that is, there is no single normative strategy or template on which to base these judgments.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The goal of Experiment 1 was to study whether two metrics related to components of cognitive readiness, anticipation of short-term consequences (related to Level 3 SA) and strategy elaboration (related to problem solving ability), were predictive of goal attainment in a complex simulated society management task. Group 1 was the control condition, with no cognitive support and no short-term anticipation measure. Group 2 received only the anticipation (Level 3 SA) measure so we could test whether this measure had in itself a positive effect on goal attainment (by asking participants to explicitly extrapolate short-term outcomes). A tool was provided to Group 3 so we could test whether having an “optimal” short-term outcome projection improved goal attainment in a complex situation. A noteworthy result was that the overall score of participants in the three conditions was comparable. Focusing on short-term consequences, either with or without a tool providing correct predictions, was not sufficient to improve the participant’s ability to successfully influence the complex system in the long term. This result is particularly counterintuitive: Providing participants with a “crystal ball” that predicted the effects of their decisions for the next game year did not help them in the long term. Furthermore, short-term anticipation accuracy was not significantly related to goal attainment.</p>
<p>In hindsight, these results, initially surprising, do make sense when we think that in complex systems management, short-term and long-term outcomes are often at odds, hence the saying “short-term gains, long-term pains” (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1555343412446193">Gureckis &amp; Love, 2009</xref>). In a complex environment, such as the <italic>Ecopolicy</italic> simulation, improving one variable can actually have adverse effects on other variables. For example, improving quality of life can lead to rapid growth and overpopulation, unless education is high enough to compensate. Simultaneously achieving multiple competing subgoals requires understanding which ones to pursue first (because they are beneficial to the attainment of other goals) and which ones to pursue later, when their adverse effects can be managed. Consequently, apparently beneficial decisions (in the short term) can lead to disastrous consequences over time. Similarly, undesirable situations may sometimes have beneficial effects that help stabilize the system. The fact that short-term projection support did not help is therefore understandable. These results do not mean that Level 3 SA plays no role in this type of situation, just that it is not sufficient in itself to improve goal attainment.</p>
<p>An interesting finding was that participants had the impression that the tool was helpful, whereas objective measures did not show an overall benefit in terms of goal achievement. This result suggests that subjective assessments of the usefulness of a support tool can be biased and misleading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1555343412446193">Chen &amp; Lee, 2003</xref>). Finally, we found that the degree of strategy elaboration (associated with problem-solving ability) was positively correlated to goal achievement but only in Group 2 and Group 3, in which there was an emphasis on anticipation. One possible interpretation of this result is that anticipation, which requires the integration and application of structural knowledge, is a necessary but not sufficient condition for developing effective strategies. Conversely, it may be that more elaborate and potentially more effective strategies tend to be better <italic>applied</italic> in contexts with an increased focus on anticipation.</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1555343412446193">Funke (1991)</xref>, the development of strategic knowledge is mainly a problem of learning to apply structural knowledge. However, it seems that deriving specific actions from structural knowledge to achieve one’s goals is not straightforward and must be practiced or learned: “Structural knowledge alone is not sufficient to control a large system. Structural knowledge together with proper strategic knowledge is sufficient (probably even necessary) for the control of large systems” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1555343412446193">Schoppek, 2002</xref>, p. 24). Experiments in which structural knowledge was taught have shown mixed results and seem to support this claim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1555343412446193">Funke, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1555343412446193">Langley &amp; Morecroft, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1555343412446193">Preußler, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1555343412446193">Putz-Osterloh, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1555343412446193">Schoppek, 2002</xref>). The present results lend further support to that conclusion.</p>

<title>Experiment 2</title>
<p>The results from Experiment 1 motivated us to investigate the impact of a long-term outcome projection tool designed to support cognitive readiness in the <italic>Ecopolicy</italic> simulation. We hypothesize that supporting long-term projection will have a positive impact on goal attainment on the basis of the idea that short-term and long-term outcomes can be at odds in complex situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1555343412446193">Gureckis &amp; Love, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1555343412446193">Sterman, 2006</xref>), which suggests that long-term thinking might be critical for success. We therefore hypothesize that such a tool can significantly improve goal attainment in complex situations (decision makers will more easily accept “short-term pains” when they can foresee the “long-term gains”). Yet success is not guaranteed, since the decision makers still need to come up with effective resource allocations despite a very vast set of possibilities. The purpose of Experiment 2 is also to test additional metrics related to cognitive readiness and to further refine the methodology from Experiment 1 (practice session added, revised measures).</p>
<p>We sought to improve the assessment of problem solving since the written strategies previously used to derive a degree of strategy elaboration were rather incomplete descriptions (we found that participants had great difficulty verbalizing their strategy). Problem-solving ability is now assessed with two measures related to system analysis, that is, the acquisition of information about the cause-effect relationships in the systems: (a) information acquisition frequency and (b) information acquisition comprehensiveness (the proportion of the system inspected). Additionally, we created a postexperimental questionnaire (described later) measuring various qualitative dimensions of the problem-solving approach of each individual. Decision-making ability in complex and dynamic situations is a component of cognitive readiness that has been previously associated with the score on Raven’s Advanced Progressive Matrices (APM), a measure of nonverbal intelligence and abstract reasoning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1555343412446193">Elg, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1555343412446193">Gonzalez, Thomas, &amp; Vanyukov, 2005</xref>). In addition to Raven’s APM, we use the General Decision Making Style (GDMS) inventory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1555343412446193">Thunholm, 2009</xref>) to attempt to identify useful predictors of goal attainment in the present task.</p>
<p>The main goal of Experiment 2 is thus to compare a condition using the cognitive support tool against a baseline condition in terms of goal attainment, information acquisition behaviors, short-term anticipation accuracy, and problem-solving approach. Our main hypothesis is that the long-term projection tool, by helping one to foresee future problems, will stimulate information acquisition behaviors (learning) to understand how these problems arise, therefore improving (unaided) short-term anticipation accuracy (Level 3 SA). The tool is also expected to lead to problem-solving strategies with a greater orientation toward the long term and to the development of more effective courses of action (i.e., better goal attainment).</p>
<p>To help put in perspective the observed performance in complex dynamic tasks, some authors have proposed to compare results with purely random responses (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1555343412446193">Goode &amp; Beckmann, 2010</xref>). Indeed, even if the performance of a participant is above zero, the question remains whether the score obtained is attributable to skill or can be explained by chance. For a given task, the chance performance level can be estimated through simulation. Here, we use a random-response rule to generate 10,000 simulations and then compare these results with those from human participants.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Forty participants (mean age = 23.8 years, <italic>SD</italic> = 4.6) from a wide variety of backgrounds (mainly social sciences and engineering), including 22 men and 18 women, received $40 compensation for their participation in two 2-hr experimental sessions. Participants were randomly assigned to either the test or the baseline condition (i.e., with or without the cognitive support tool).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-1555343412446193">
<title>Apparatus</title>
<p>The experiment is run on a standard personal computer with two flat-screen monitors. The Screen 1 displays the <italic>Ecopolicy</italic> interface, and Screen 2 displays an interactive Microsoft Excel file used for measuring Level 3 SA and for interacting with the long-term projection tool. The GDMS and Raven’s APM are presented electronically, and the postexperimental questionnaire is paper based.</p>
<p>The tool provided in the test condition (shown in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app3-1555343412446193">Appendix C</xref>) extrapolates the likely outcomes of a series of decisions entered by the participant (i.e., the participant’s current plan for the present and upcoming turns). Participants can consider different courses of action and learn from the anticipatory feedback (i.e., feedforward) provided by the tool. The design of the projection tool essentially involved replicating <italic>Ecopolicy</italic>’s system model (i.e., the variables and interrelations) by creating a set of equivalent Excel formulas. The current state of the situation and the decisions of participants are entered via input fields, and the Excel model then provides the projected outcomes in the output fields. For realism’s sake, some noise is added to those projections (to prevent participants from having a perfect “crystal ball”). More precisely, 50% of the projections are slightly higher or lower than the actual outcome. Yet the effect of noise is also multiplicative, thus creating an increasing degree of uncertainty about future turns. The presence of noise also ensures that participants need to revise their plan on each turn, since the outcomes are not exactly those projected by the tool.</p>

<sec id="section24-1555343412446193">
<title>Design and procedure</title>
<p>Session 1 involves a tutorial and 6-turn practice game followed by the administration of Raven’s APM and the GDMS questionnaire. Session 2 involves a 12-turn <italic>Ecopolicy</italic> game followed by the postexperimental questionnaire inquiring about the problem-solving approach used. The simulation has a different starting state in the practice phase and the test phase (i.e., the initial value of the eight variables is different). On each game turn, participants are first presented with the Level 3 SA measure (described in the next section) on Screen 2. Then, participants may decide how they wish to allocate their activity points to influence the system. Those in the test condition may use the projection tool at their leisure before entering their decision for the current turn. There is no time limit for each turn. Participants can inspect the cause-effect relationships in the system (graphic display and text description of these effects) via the Functions tab in <italic>Ecopolicy</italic>. Feedback on the changes occurring in the society is provided during the transition from one turn to the next.</p>

<title>Short-term anticipation accuracy (Level 3 SA)</title>
<p>In Experiment 2, the short-term anticipation measure is now placed before making a decision rather than after. Indeed, the quality of SA <italic>before</italic> making a decision may possibly constitute a better predictor of success than does SA measured after having made a decision. We measured the (unaided) ability of participants in both groups to consider the mutual influences (and time delays) between system variables in an integrated manner to anticipate the outcome of these interactions for the following game turn. For each year in the game, we record the eight predicted values and the eight correct values that describe the state of the society in the subsequent year (without the effects of the intervention). Each prediction for a specific dimension of the society is a discrete number between 0 and 30. We then compare the change in the situation predicted by the participant for each variable to the correct response. Whereas in Experiment 1, anticipation accuracy referred to prediction error (SSE), in Experiment 2, the anticipation accuracy score for a given participant corresponds to the coefficient of determination, referred to as the “proportion of variance accounted for” (PVAF) by the participant:</p>

<p>The short version of Raven’s APM developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1555343412446193">Bors and Stokes (1998)</xref> is used as a nonverbal reasoning test that measures the ability to recognize and combine complex visual patterns.

Indeed, several studies have found a relationship between score on the Raven’s APM and dynamic decision-making ability in microworlds, although results are not consistent across studies (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1555343412446193">Goode &amp; Beckmann, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1555343412446193">Rigas &amp; Brehmer, 1999</xref>).</p>

<title>Short-term anticipation accuracy (Level 3 SA)</title>
<p>The accuracy of anticipated proximal outcomes of the situation (Level 3 SA) did not improve during the course of the task: The learning slope of participants (<italic>M</italic> = .016%, <italic>SD</italic> = .071) was not significantly different from zero, <italic>t</italic>(39) = 1.432, <italic>p</italic> = .16, and did not significantly differ across groups, <italic>t</italic>(38) = .418, <italic>p</italic> = .679. Level 3 SA was lower in the cognitive support condition compared with the baseline group in all turns but one (Turn 8), yet the overall average did not significantly differ across groups because of the high variability in the data, <italic>t</italic>(38) = 1.388, <italic>p</italic> = .173. It seemed important to investigate this trend further, so we reduced the scope of the analysis. The excessive variability was mainly observed for the late turns and seems clearly related to the considerably reduced sample (i.e., 30% to 45% attrition from Turn 7 to Turn 12). Turn 1 was also excluded since the projection tool was not yet presented at the time of measurement and both conditions were basically identical at this point. This more focused analysis shows that Level 3 SA was significantly lower in the cognitive support condition (<italic>M</italic> = .17, <italic>SD</italic> = .21) compared with the control group (<italic>M</italic> = .33, <italic>SD</italic> = .28), <italic>t</italic>(38) = −2.064, <italic>p</italic> = .046.</p>

<p>Partial correlations on the complete sample of participants indicate the degree of association between key variables while controlling for the group effect.

The Raven’s APM was found to be significantly correlated to Level 3 SA, <italic>r</italic>(36) = .404, <italic>p</italic> = .012, but not to goal attainment, <italic>r</italic>(36) = .030, <italic>p</italic> = .086.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>As hypothesized, use of the long-term projection tool clearly improved the development of more effective long-term strategies, yet it appears to have detracted participants from engaging in information acquisition behaviors (i.e., reduced frequency). Participants displayed a poor ability to anticipate the system’s behavior (i.e., low Level 3 SA) in both conditions, yet contrary to our hypothesis, results were significantly lower in the cognitive support condition. Although the projection tool helped overcome a serious limitation in human processing abilities in terms of outcome projection (thus helping participants develop better strategies), it also came with a drawback. Participants in the cognitive support condition, although focusing more on long-term strategic analysis and planning, acquired less structural knowledge, thus leading to a reduced ability to accurately project short-term outcomes compared with those in the baseline condition. More specifically, it is the frequency of information acquisition behaviors that differed across conditions, not their comprehensiveness. This finding means that the same information was consulted repeatedly in the control group (more so than in the cognitive support condition).</p>
<p>The redundant acquisition of information was not useless however, since the control group achieved a better Level 3 SA, arguably because of an improved retention and/or understanding of that information in memory (i.e., better structural knowledge). By teaming up with a tool to improve effectiveness, the human component of this joint cognitive system naturally adapted its sensemaking process and delegated part of the cognitive work to the computational component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1555343412446193">Woods &amp; Hollnagel, 2006</xref>). When evaluating the impact of cognitive support, assessing cognitive functioning as a whole rather that just the targeted function can help ensure that other essential functions are not unintentionally impaired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1555343412446193">Lafond, Vachon, Rousseau, &amp; Tremblay, 2010</xref>). In the present experiment, the potential negative impact on cognitive readiness of the reduced Level 3 SA for those with cognitive support (measured when unaided by the tool) was likely canceled out by the fact that after taking this measure, participants did receive Level 3 SA support (and long-term anticipation support) from the projection tool before making a decision. The forgoing results therefore suggest in no way that Level 3 SA is not important (indeed, a significant correlation was found in Experiment 2 between Level 3 SA and goal attainment).</p>
<p>A more general analysis, based on partial correlations on the complete sample of participants (controlling for the group effect), showed mixed results concerning the relationship between the Raven’s APM and decision-making effectiveness. Although the score on the APM is not a reliable predictor of goal attainment in the present task, it is related to Level 3 SA. Results show that taking an intuitive approach may not be favorable when dealing with complex systems. A more analytic, integrative, and proactive approach seems to be important to improve the likelihood of success. Cognitive style may thus play a prominent role in determining success in complex operations and may often take precedence to the abstract reasoning abilities of individuals.</p>
<p>Partial correlations also showed that goal attainment was positively related to comprehensiveness of information acquisition, Level 3 SA, and the degree to which the participants’ strategies were proactive (as opposed to reactive). Level 3 SA was also positively associated with both measures of information acquisition (arguably, structural knowledge is a key prerequisite for Level 2 and Level 3 SA) and more analytical decision strategies. These findings show that many measurable characteristics associated with the general concept of tunnel vision (infrequent and incomplete information acquisition, lack of analysis) are indeed closely related to poor goal attainment in a complex situation. Training participants to avoid those behaviors associated with tunnel vision may constitute an effective way to improve complex decision-making ability. Although educational material can help trainees become aware of best practices for decision making, simulated training scenarios can help participants actually practice novel decision-making approaches and observe the long-term consequences of their decisions because of the reduced time scale in such simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1555343412446193">Jarmasz, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>We estimated the chance performance level by using a random-response rule by generating 10,000 simulations and then compared this result with those from human participants. Although most participants did better than chance, it is intriguing to see that a non-negligible number of participants, 15% in the baseline condition and 5% in the cognitive support condition, obtained a score that was worse than what would be expected by chance (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1555343412446193">Goode &amp; Beckmann, 2010</xref>, for similar results). This result may be attributed to the fact that the behavior of complex systems is not only difficult to understand and anticipate but also <italic>counterintuitive</italic>, which can lead to interventions that have worse outcomes than if no action was taken (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1555343412446193">Yasarcan, 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>General Discussion</title>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1555343412446193">Morrison and Fletcher (2002)</xref>, cognitive readiness means being able to adapt to meet unforeseen challenges that inevitably arise in complex operational environments. This <italic>readiness</italic> to learn and adapt can substantially contribute to mission success in such situations. The simulated task used herein presented a major adaptation challenge: The interrelated goals partially conflicted so that trying to improve certain aspects of the situation could cause side effects that were detrimental to achieving other goals. Cognitive readiness is deemed critical in this context for one to recognize the nature of this challenge early on, adjust one’s strategy to consider the “network of effects” more comprehensively, and take decisions with fewer unintended side effects. In fact, Morrison and Fletcher assert that cognitive readiness can be seen as a combination of three general abilities (with which the 10 components of cognitive readiness are associated): (a) recognizing patterns in apparently chaotic situations (SA is of key relevance here), (b) modifying problem solutions as required by the current situation (which relates to the problem solving component), and (c) implementing plans of action based on these solutions (relevant to the decision-making component). Hence, the present studies investigated factors that may support competent performance in complex operational environments by focusing on the SA, problem-solving, and decision-making components of cognitive readiness.</p>
<p>Although the exact nature of the interrelationships between SA, problem solving, and decision making remains unclear and warrants further research, we speculate that these and other components of cognitive readiness perhaps do not simply combine linearly to create increasingly adaptive individuals. Rather, cognitive readiness may be an emergent property of these interacting components, which means in logical terms that they may be <italic>jointly necessary</italic> (and sufficient) to lead to high readiness (i.e., compensating for a deficiency in one component by an increase in another may not work here).</p>
<p>In the present research, we sought to test the impact of two tools designed to support cognitive readiness (specifically, the SA component) through the projection of short-term outcomes in Experiment 1 (support for Level 3 SA) and of longer-term outcomes in Experiment 2 (support for Level 3 SA and a hypothetical Level 4 SA conceptualized next). The first tool provided accurate projections of the future state of the environment for the next turn (using the complete system information also shown to participants in the form of an influence diagram and graphs of detailed effects). Also, when a potential decision was typed in, the tool projected the future state of the environment given that decision. The second tool provided relatively accurate projections (either with or without a set of decisions for each turn specified by the participant) but with diminishing reliability as they went farther into the future (up to a maximum of 12 future game turns). In the present task context, involving a complex system with multiple interrelated factors, providing such projections was expected to help participants anticipate problems that might need to be addressed before getting out of control and to help participants become aware of potential unintended side effects of their decisions. Both tools made it possible to consider the effects of different courses of action (what-if simulations) before actually taking a decision.</p>
<p>Whereas Level 3 SA (near-term projection) is currently considered the highest possible level of SA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1555343412446193">Endsley, 2001</xref>), the theoretical notion of a Level 4 SA, referring specifically to long-term projection, could be important to consider especially when seeking to support SA in complex and dynamic situations. We propose to define the boundary between short-term and long-term projection as the temporal horizon in a specific task beyond which decision makers fail to anticipate future states better than the basic chance level. The time scale associated with the notions of short term (Level 3 SA) and long term (Level 4 SA) is thus context specific (i.e., <italic>long term</italic> may refer to several seconds or minutes in certain task contexts and to several years in others). Therefore, according to this definition, Level 4 SA would specifically relate to the awareness of projected future states of the environment obtained using cognitive support tools and extending beyond the natural boundary of Level 3 SA. Level 4 SA would thus be uniquely relevant to contexts of augmented cognition.</p>
<p>The concept of Level 4 SA is proposed here as an extension of the SA concept that may be critical for overall cognitive readiness in complex environments. Indeed, complex systems are known to exhibit “policy resistance” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1555343412446193">Sterman, 2006</xref>). Outcomes that may be positive in the short term may actually lead to undesirable outcomes in the long term. Military doctrine has been advocating the critical necessity to consider “second- and third-order effects” (often observed in the long term) in complex operations, such as irregular warfare and stability operations. Concepts such as the effects-based approach to operations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1555343412446193">Grossman-Vermaas, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1555343412446193">Smith, 2006</xref>) and systemic operational design (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1555343412446193">Banach, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1555343412446193">Sorells et al., 2005</xref>) are essentially intended to prevent tunnel vision and its potentially catastrophic consequences. Although Level 4 SA was not measured in the present experiments, Experiment 2 showed that a tool designed to support long-term projection provided significant benefits in terms of goal attainment, in contrast to Experiment 1, which showed that support to Level 3 SA was not sufficient to improve goal attainment in a complex environment. Experiment 2 also showed that the projection tool apparently reduced the need to acquire system knowledge, acting as a cognitive “crutch,” so to speak. This consequence may be interpreted as a normal outcome of working with cognitive support tools in the sense that some mental effort can thus be avoided (and perhaps accomplished better by the tool). However, there may be risks involved as well, such as the slower development of one’s own mental models and development of expertise over time.</p>
<p>Considering <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1555343412446193">Lerch and Harter’s (2001)</xref> findings discussed in the Introduction, time pressure may be expected to cancel out the potential benefits of feedforward support tools (or even have a negative impact on goal attainment). In fact, despite the moderate-to-high time pressure in Lerch and Harter’s task, the what-if simulations allowed temporarily freezing the simulation (or else the tool would have been virtually useless). Perhaps exploring possible outcomes with the help of such tools gives rise to task interruption and resumption costs in conditions of time pressure (i.e., necessary recovery time when resuming the simulation).</p>
<sec id="section41-1555343412446193">
<title>Implications</title>
<p>The main outcome of the present work is to contribute to the identification of metrics and support requirements that may guide the development of tools and methods to improve cognitive readiness for operational and strategic decision making in complex dynamic environments. The specific task contexts to which this work applies are those involving delayed effects and unintended side effects that must be anticipated and managed to succeed in the long term yet also afford decision makers the necessary time to engage in a comprehensive assessment of the situation (i.e., relatively low time pressure compared with tactical decision-making situations). Examples of such contexts include full-spectrum operations (combining diplomatic, informational, military, and economic dimensions), critical infrastructure management, homeland security, disaster response, health care, and policy making. In light of the present findings, we conclude that providing cognitive support for long-term planning with dynamic replanning is one effective way to improve cognitive readiness in complex operations. Conversely, we conclude that solely supporting Level 3 SA by the means of a short-term projection tool may not be sufficient to improve cognitive readiness in this type of context. Furthermore, we observed that even with the help from the long-term projection tool, there still remained room for further improvement in terms of support for developing and revising effective courses of action to achieve long-term goals. Although this suboptimal performance is partly a matter of improving problem solving (analysis) and decision making (choice, risk management), the observed difficulty to come up with effective strategies also highlights the importance of another key component of cognitive readiness related to adaptation and generation of novel solutions, called <italic>mental flexibility and creativity</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1555343412446193">Morrison &amp; Fletcher, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>According to SA theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1555343412446193">Endsley, 1995</xref>), the buildup of each successive level of SA involves higher-level processing of the outputs of the previous levels. As a logical consequence, each level of SA is necessarily constrained to some extent by the degree of SA at the subordinate level (note that this assumption remains theoretical). It is interesting to consider that in normal (unaided) circumstances, (a) each successive level of SA is developed on the basis of the SA achieved at lower levels, and (b) the cumulative buildup of SA can be seen as synergetic in the sense that higher SA levels help frame information at the lower levels. The tools provided herein were designed to <italic>artificially</italic> support Level 3 SA (in Experiment 1) or Level 3 and Level 4 SA (in Experiment 2) by deriving their projections <italic>independently</italic> from the participants’ understanding of the system (i.e., Level 2 SA). It is therefore conceivable that the effectiveness of these tools in augmenting cognitive readiness might be improved by ensuring that the lower levels of SA are supported (or satisfactorily attained) as well (assuming that there is a dependency and/or synergy between SA levels). Other components of cognitive readiness not considered here may play a key role as well. For instance, it is unclear whether the tools provided respected fundamental constraints associated with human memory (another component of cognitive readiness), which highlights how the design of cognitive support tools can benefit from knowledge of how the various components of cognitive readiness interrelate.</p>
<p>The experiments reported herein explored three components of cognitive readiness: SA, problem solving and decision making. We proposed several ways to measure or characterize either the ability or style of participants along these three components of cognitive readiness and identified several useful predictors of goal attainment:</p>
<list id="list1-1555343412446193" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Short-term anticipation accuracy (Level 3 SA)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Comprehensiveness of information acquisition</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Proactive as opposed to reactive problem-solving approach</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Integrative as opposed to focalized problem-solving approach</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Analytic and opposed to intuitive problem-solving approach</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The degree of strategy elaboration</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Among these six key factors, the first relates to the SA component of cognitive readiness, and all the others relate to the problem-solving component. These findings imply that for particularly complex situations, cognitive readiness may be more a matter of knowing how to approach the problem rather than sheer decision-making ability (i.e., score on a complex pattern recognition test, such as the Raven’s APM). Nonetheless, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1555343412446193">Wittmann and Hattrup (2004)</xref> showed that some fundamental cognitive abilities, such as the reasoning and creativity facets of intelligence as measured by the Berlin model of intelligence structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1555343412446193">Jäger, 1982</xref>), can be good predictors of performance in complex cognitive tasks. Taking a more appropriate problem-solving approach can be trained, yet doing so requires guidelines validated by empirical evidence. Clearly, further research is needed to develop such guidelines and to test their generalizability. For instance, situational factors, such as time pressure, task complexity, and information uncertainty, may mediate which variables are better predictors of goal attainment. Future work should also place an increased focus on the emotional components of cognitive readiness, such as psychological resilience to stress, ambiguity tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1555343412446193">Norton, 1975</xref>), and risk aversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1555343412446193">Mandrik &amp; Bao, 2005</xref>), since these factors may have adverse effects on one’s problem-solving approach.</p>
<p>One limitation in the present experiments is that they were based on a “serious game” that did not allow much scenario manipulation and online behavioral measurement. Using a more research-focused test bed with greater cognitive process tracing capabilities will be essential to measure the behavioral components of cognitive readiness more comprehensively. The complex decision-making experimental platform (CODEM) was developed for that purpose and is being used to pursue this line of research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1555343412446193">Lafond &amp; DuCharme, 2011</xref>). One potential application of CODEM is to provide a generic training to improve complex decision-making skills. Simulated training scenarios complemented by an intelligent tutor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1555343412446193">DuCharme, Lafond, &amp; Rathbun, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1555343412446193">Lafond, Tremblay, Rioux, &amp; DuCharme, 2011</xref>) may be used to augment skills related to cognitive readiness components, such as SA, problem-solving strategies (heuristics), and metacognition. The effectiveness of such training remains to be empirically demonstrated. Future research will also focus on performing extensive data collection to study components of cognitive readiness in relation to each other and to derive a comprehensive model capable of explaining and predicting individual complex decision-making ability.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, the 10 components of cognitive readiness are assumed to contribute to adaptiveness (and hence the probability of goal attainment) when facing novel or unexpected situations in complex environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1555343412446193">Morrison &amp; Fletcher, 2002</xref>). Yet components of cognitive readiness are clearly not independent, and the specific way that these components interact to determine individual adaptability and effectiveness in complex environments remains to be operationalized and implemented into a quantitative model. Such a model could provide valuable input for cognitive engineering, personnel selection, and identification of training requirements.</p>
<p>In many complex situations, situational information is incomplete, the possibility to acquire structural knowledge is rather limited, and modeling may not provide very accurate predictions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1555343412446193">Kurtz and Snowden (2003)</xref> proposed a four-tiered taxonomy of decision-making situations ranging from <italic>well known</italic> to <italic>chaotic</italic>. These four domains correspond to situations of increasingly sparse structural knowledge, constraining strategies to become increasingly reactive. Clearly, providing computational support for Level 4 SA (long-term projection) is an option only when sufficient structural knowledge has been acquired. Until that requisite is satisfied, decision makers need to probe the system, form hypotheses, and learn from direct experience. In these particularly challenging conditions, the need for better cognitive engineering and methods to deal effectively with high levels of uncertainty becomes of utmost importance. One approach, put forward by the sensemaking support tool called the sensitivity model, from which the <italic>Ecopolicy</italic> game was derived, relies on fuzzy logic to facilitate the incorporation of “soft” (i.e., difficult-to-quantify) factors into the models developed by the user (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1555343412446193">Vester, 2007</xref>). Another key approach being put forward pertains to robust decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1555343412446193">Chandrasekaran &amp; Goldman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1555343412446193">Klein, Pfaff, &amp; Drury, 2009</xref>), which relies heavily on computational support for managing risks and uncertainty (to identify robust rather than optimal solutions) and shows great promise to help decision makers adapt to this challenging reality.</p>
<p>The present research has shown one effective approach to support cognitive readiness though technology in a well-understood (i.e., transparent) environment. By integrating user-driven model building and robust decision-making principles to this approach, we surmise that such a tool—designed with the requirements of cognitive readiness in mind—would have the potential to significantly augment the operational adaptiveness of commanders and their staff, particularly in the context of stability operations in which nonkinetic (political, economic, social) dimensions are critical for mission success.</p>

The simulation is turn based, and you must achieve your task within 12 simulated years (1 turn per year). You might be able to balance the situation in Cybernetia. At the beginning, you will see the initial adverse situation in the “Govern” tab (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1555343412446193">Figure A2</xref>). The columns show the state of each area (red = dangerous, yellow = caution, green = OK). To find out the status of each key area, you can go to the “Areas” tab and dive into each section as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1555343412446193">Figure A3</xref>.</p>

<caption><p>The “Functions” tab lets the player see the relations between the eight areas of Cybernetia and “activity points.” By clicking on the arrows, the player is able to see the mathematical function of each relation.</p></caption>

<p>In the “Functions” tab (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1555343412446193">Figure A1</xref>), you can learn more about the relationships between the key areas. By clicking on each interaction, the mathematical relationship becomes visible. For example, you can see the impact of education on the quality of life (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1555343412446193">Figure A4</xref>).</p>

<p>At the start of the game you automatically get “activity points” (lower left of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1555343412446193">Figure A2</xref>). They represent your capital for influence, money, work input, and so on. These points can be invested in the four key areas: sanitation, production, education, and quality of life. You have a certain number of activity points for each subsequent year or round, depending on how successful you are in affecting the key areas of your country. You can also lose points, although the final total of activity points never drops below zero.</p>
