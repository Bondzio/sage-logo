<title>Methodology and methods</title>
<p>In recent years we have witnessed the proliferation of an increasingly sophisticated new instrument of data collection and analysis: camcorders. Camcorders do not only allow for a rich recording of social processes. They also provide and produce a kind of data for sociology, which, with the exception of some pioneers using film before, was hardly available in the Social Sciences. (For the ‘pre-history’ of video analysis see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1468794111436144">Erickson [2011]</xref>.) With the production of the audiovisual data and their use by social scientists, gradually a methodology is emerging that has come to be called succinctly ‘video analysis’. This methodology is expressed in the publication of a series of articles on video analysis and, in the meantime, of several books (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1468794111436144">Heath et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1468794111436144">Knoblauch et al., 2006</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1468794111436144">1</xref></sup> This special issue provides a series of articles that represent this methodology.</p>
<p>As distinct as the methodology of video analysis seems to be, there are still a number of frequent misunderstandings concerning this method, which may lead to confusion:</p>
<list id="list1-1468794111436144" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The method referred to here as video analysis does not cover any kind of methodology applied to video data. While camcorders and other video technologies can record any audiovisual phenomenon, video analysis in the way it is represented here only refers to video recordings of <italic>social interactions</italic>. In general and roughly, all studies in this area cover analyses of social interaction. As broad as the notion may be, ranging from human interaction with humans to human interaction with machines, animals and objects, to technically mediated interactions, interaction with oneself and even to interactions with invisible actors (e.g. spirits and gods in ritual interaction), social interaction, as understood here, is conceived of in the frame of social scientific theories, such as symbolic interactionism, social constructivism or ethnomethodology.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>All these methodologies are, in a manner, qualitative in the sense that they are not in principle aiming at standardizing their observations and quantifying the standardized qualities. In this respect, these methodologies differ essentially from forms of video analysis as they are applied in psychology and some types of sociology, anthropology and education studies. Instead of being misunderstood as a methodology applying categories and codes (derived from theoretical hypotheses) to the audiovisual data and resisting tendencies to digitally pre-determine automatical categories of analysis by software programmes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1468794111436144">Silver and Patashnick, 2011</xref>), this kind of video analysis constructs its theories by interpreting recorded social interaction as something that has meaning on its own or, to be more exact, is considered of constructing its very meaning by way of the actions recorded audio-visually. In this sense, video analysis of this kind must not only be called qualitative, but, moreover, <italic>interpretive</italic>.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>As video is often also used in order to analyse social interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1468794111436144">Knoblauch and Tuma, 2011</xref>) within the frame of experiments, one should stress that the method of video analysis, as represented by the studies in this volume, is typically studying social interaction in what is called ‘natural settings’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1468794111436144">Knoblauch, 2011</xref>). By natural settings it is meant that, typically (with some exceptions in applied research) researchers do not try to create the situations they study but attempt to record interactions where and how they are assumed to happen also without the researchers’ interventions. This does not exclude the study of experiments – if experiments themselves are the subject matter of the study (and not the method). Audiovisual recordings and analyses of ‘natural’ social interactions demand that researchers go to ‘where the action’ is. That is to say that researchers of this type of video analysis regularly enter certain fields in an ethnographic way. Video analysis, in this sense, is <italic>ethnographic</italic>. In order to avoid the misleading notion of ‘natural settings’ and in order to stress the relevance of doing ethnography and in order not to confuse it with quantitative, standardized, and experimental forms of video analysis, it seems to me useful to call it videography.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The preference for such a specification of the methodology seems to me even more urgent in the face of the recent video revolution. While the use of video outside of the social sciences has become somewhat popular already in the late 1980s, the dissemination of videos by the internet has led to an explosion of video. Video produced by lay and professional video producers are easily accessible on the internet, and drawing on this kind of data, another branch of social scientific ‘video analysis’ has emerged that focuses on videos downloaded from the net or even from television and film material recorded on video (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1468794111436144">Reichertz, 2010</xref>). In order to avoid confusion over ‘video analysis’, one should, therefore, stress that the very notion of video refers to two quite distinct aspects. The two aspects are best exemplified in the major technology of video analysis: the camcorder. Camcorders combine two different functions in a quite obvious manner: they provide a technology to record audiovisual events in the common environment of actors, and they also provide a technology for viewing (and analysing by viewing) these recordings. (The digitalization of recordings has, additionally, contributed to the ease in copying recordings.) The distinction between these different technologies, the practices linked to them and the resulting genres of data allows us to tell different forms of research with video. One form of video analysis (a) draws on videos that have been recorded (and produced in a more or less professional way) by actors other than researchers (e.g. as tapes produced by actors and later made available to researchers, as videos uploaded on YouTube, or as ‘video diaries’ intentionally produced for researchers by actors). The type of video analysis referred to in this special issue (b) is characterized by the fact that it is the researchers themselves who are recording the video ‘in the field’ and then using these audiovisual recordings for their analyses. There is no doubt that both types of recordings are produced in some general sense, yet, it is in the second form of video recording in the field and analysis that the researchers can account explicitly about the ways and processes of the production of these data. Again, in order to avoid ambiguities, it seems to me very useful to use a more specific and more pertinent notion: <italic>videography</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1468794111436144">2</xref></sup></p></list-item>
</list>
<p>In addition to their focus on social interaction in natural settings, many videographers also share a number of methodological convictions. On the basis of ethnomethodology, social constructivism and conversation analysis, a number of methodological suggestions for the analysis of video have already been made that tend towards a certain paradigmatic pattern. Given the range of studies in this field and the existence of the introductory texts, this special issue is dedicated to the refinement and clarification of a these suggestions by excellent representatives from the field.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1468794111436144">3</xref></sup> In discussing the various ways of collecting, presenting and analysing data, the special issue aims also at elaborating the common methodological orientation that may contribute in furthering the shared methodological orientation in this promising and rapidly growing field, each in their own way.</p>

<p>I should add that, in Germany alone, there are in the meantime three additional introductory books on video analysis (one forthcoming in 2012).</p>

<p>One should concede that these two types are not separated categorically. Videos produced by actors and made accessible publicly on the internet need either to be studied as ‘products’ and subjected to the first type of video analysis (as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1468794111436144">Reichertz, 2010</xref>), or they can be studied in a more ‘ethnographic way with respect to the ways in which they are produced and received, i.e. as part of ‘wenography’ (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1468794111436144">Wittel, 2000</xref>).</p>

<p>The papers are based on selected presentations at the workshop ‘Audiovisual Interaction Analysis’, held in January 2010 at the Technical University of Berlin. This event has received funding from the European Science Foundation. Papers presented on this occasion opened a vivid discussion on the methodological prospects of video analysis.</p>
