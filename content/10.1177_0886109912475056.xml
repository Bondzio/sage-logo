<p>The expansion of transracial and transnational adoption in the United States in the 20th and 21st centuries is frequently attributed to several factors, including the increased availability of abortion and birth control and women’s greater access to education and careers. In addition, many have argued that the expansion has been due to an increase in age for first marriages and births. In <italic>Somebody’s Children</italic>, Briggs presents an analysis of transracial and transnational adoption that shows that this explanation, which is the narrative most often used to describe changes in adoption practices, is woefully inadequate. Instead, she provides a refreshing and long-overdue feminist/womanist perspective on transracial and transnational adoption practices by giving attention to the interconnectedness of various systems of oppression in women’s lives—and the intersection among ethnicity, race, class, religion, gender, sexuality, and national and international political and economic issues in shaping adoption policy and practice. <italic>Somebody’s Children</italic> uses a broader lens than the primary white middle-class narrative, thereby providing a complex historical narrative of transracial and transnational adoption from the 1930s to today. In particular, the author uses a womanist lens to provide a multifaceted analysis of the experiences of black and Native women both within and outside the United States whose children have been adopted. In addition, she pays attention to current adoption issues using a wider and more critical lens—exploring gay and lesbian adoption, as well as immigration, foster care, and adoption. Interspersed throughout the book are brief descriptions of individual experiences that are placed within the broader context of the politics of adoption practices.</p>
<p>A primary stated goal of the book is “to narrate a history of adoption that pays as much attention to the position of those who <italic>lose</italic> children in adoption as to those who receive them” (p. 18), and this is its greatest strength: to give voice to the invisible birth mothers and the complexity of their lives and challenge the simplistic child rescue ideology of adoption practice. This book presents a powerful argument for a reexamination and reshaping of transracial and transnational adoption policy and practices.</p>
