There is a widespread longing for democracy both in the Arab countries involved in the movements (Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, Bahrein, Syria and Yemen) and in the western countries mostly interfering in, sometimes helping, or simply observing the ongoing process. The point is that possibly the resulting idea of democracy may be different. Western countries are longing for a democratic transformation in the Arab world that looks like the liberal/<italic>liberistico</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0191453713477347">2</xref></sup> political and institutional structures of the West. There is a high risk of paternalism and/or neo-colonialism in this attitude. Interference seems to promote western gains and interests rather than help endogenous developments. For the Arab countries are looking for their own political growth that might look like the liberal/<italic>liberistico</italic> democratic structures of the West, but might just as well follow new ways of political experiments. Islam is a fundamental variable in this framework, because, surely, an Islamic concept of ‘democracy’, no matter how it could be understood, will differ in some aspects from a consolidated western idea of ‘democracy’. And Islam is a major actor in the Arab revolts and presumably will play a growing role in the future.</p><p>Thus, we have to define which Islam and which democracy we are dealing with. There are many ways to be Islamic and there are many ways to be democratic. Islam is a very plural phenomenon although many conservative Islamists are inclined to become essentialist in regards to their religion arguing that there is only <italic>one </italic>Islam outside of history and historical change. Instead, I would argue that the proliferation of sects and currents in Islamic culture and history from the so-called Middle Ages until nowadays is a patent demonstration of the plurality of the Islamic outlook. The same Salafism, which strongly defends an essentialist view of Islam as the <italic>one </italic>religion, is a multifaceted phenomenon ranging from jihadism to political quietism. On the other hand, in discussing democracy, a wide spectrum of opinions is also detectable. Criticism of democracy is a distinguishing feature of the most radical Islamists like some of the Salafis who contend that democracy is tantamount to unbelief. Longing for democracy is characteristic of a number of intellectuals who consider <italic>shurà </italic>[consultation] as the Islamic version of it. A pragmatic attitude has been shown by moderate trends of Islamism like the Muslim Brothers who claim to be ready to accept the procedural rules of democracy (free elections, a multi-party system …) while stressing the superiority of Islamic values and conducts in rights, liberties, duties and so on.</p><p>On the other hand, <italic>present </italic>democracy, which is very different from the democracy of the 1960s and 1970s, where socialism and liberation ideas were widespread, is <italic>liberistico</italic> (unfortunately <italic>not</italic> liberal) and accepts social inequalities and poverty as the unavoidable (and also useful) feature of a free market economy and of a free and competing society. Liberal democracy is not the only kind of democracy, however. Scholars singled out also a ‘totalitarian democracy’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0191453713477347">3</xref></sup> a ‘semi-authoritarian democracy’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0191453713477347">4</xref></sup> and an ‘illiberal democracy’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0191453713477347">5</xref></sup> and many other declensions of the term are viable as well.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0191453713477347">6</xref></sup></p><p>Somebody even spoke of ‘democratizing’ democracy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0191453713477347">7</xref></sup> Maybe, a new kind of democracy is being born: the democracy of the multitude.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0191453713477347">8</xref></sup> The terms ‘people’ and ‘multitude’ have been in competition without a clear difference in substance and meaning along all the history of political philosophy before the age of absolutism. It is only because of Thomas Hobbes, with the institution of the absolute state and the elaboration of the hegemonic concept of sovereignty, that the term ‘multitude’ was discredited as hinting at an anarchic and unruly aggregate whose power [<italic>potentia</italic>] is disciplined and subdued by the external authority of the state. The only thinker standing against this attitude and defending the ‘multitude’ [<italic>moltitudine</italic>], with its plural character and as a source of resistance to oppression, has been Spinoza. From this point of view it is obvious that rebellion against the constituted power is legitimized. The resumption of the term ‘multitude’ in post-Fordist society, when sovereignty declines, stresses the plurality of the sources of power and right while the spirit of difference and the movements cannot be boiled down to unity and holistic representation. The post-Fordist multitude (in agreement with Paolo Virno’s definitions in <italic>Grammatica della moltitudine</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0191453713477347">9</xref></sup>) is not made up of citizens (figure of sovereignty) nor of producers (figure of Fordism), but it fills a middle realm between the individual and the collective, beyond the distinction between the private and the public. It is a living body of the <italic>common </italic>expressing itself through indignation, opposition to the extent and vindication of new forms of democracy, representativeness and participation.</p><p>The people who protested against the dictatorial regimes of Tunisia, Egypt, Syria, or Yemen and toppled ‘pharaohs’ like Ben ‘Ali, Mubarak and ‘Abdallah Saleh and threatened the thrones of Bashar al-Asad and other conservative monarchs in the Arabian peninsula are precisely such a multitude. They assumed antagonism as their way of struggle. Youth and women are prominent. Often they are longing for a secular democracy reducing religion to the private sphere. Unfortunately they lacked a clear and organic political leadership. The proliferation of parties could damage a straightforward transition to the new political order. However, Islamic parties and organizations occupy much of the public space. The Al-Nahda Party won the election of October 2011 in Tunisia. Its leader, Rashid Ghannushi, is a long-time supporter of procedural democracy and human rights. The Hurriyya wa ‘adala [Freedom and Justice] Party, emanating from the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, scored more than 40% in the ballots of the November 2011–January 2012 elections. Other Islamic parties, like the Salafite Al-Nur [Light], occupied the following positions. The moderate Islamist party of Justice and Development in Morocco gained the majority in the political elections of 2011.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0191453713477347">10</xref></sup></p><p>If there is not only one kind of democracy and if there is much more space for Islamic organizations in the present and future political arena of the Muslim countries, it should not seem a heresy to speculate about an Islamic way to democracy. In order to flesh out this original perspective, it is necessary to deal with the developments of Islamic political thought. It constitutes the framework wherein new theoretical developments must be placed.</p><p>I believe that the main feature of the Islamic concept [<italic>tasawwur islami</italic>] lies in the holistic character of the community [<italic>umma</italic>]. The implications of this holism can be very dangerous insofar as they potentially deny the dimensions of historicity and change. Historicity is often an <italic>impensée </italic>(using Muhammad Arkoun’s words) of the Islamic mind. Sayyid Qutb succeeded, however, in keeping a dynamic verve in a potentially blocked environment. Qutb is worth quoting because of his importance in defining modern Islamist trends:<disp-quote><p>[God] made [the Islamic concept, <italic>tasawwur islami</italic>] for the totality of mankind for all times and conditions as a holistic paradigm or permanent system of principles within the bounds of which mankind develops, evolves, grows and advances without ever reaching the boundaries of this framework.</p><p>Motion, it appears, is a law of the universe and it also is a law in the life of man who is a part of the universe. But this law of motion is not free of restrictions or without some control, if only because it is a coherent system. An analogy to the life of a man is a planet with an orbit and an axis. This divinely-revealed Islamic concept is like the sun around which the life of all mankind is to revolve. There is plenty of room for mankind to grow, progress, advance and evolve, while still remaining in the field of attraction of this central concept.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0191453713477347">11</xref></sup></p></disp-quote>This cosmic metaphor implies a dialectical relation between movement and stability, between tension to action [<italic>telos</italic>] and firmness of principles:<disp-quote><p>The characteristic of having ‘permanent realities’ and fixed values in the Islamic system is a guarantee that the Islamic society will ‘move within a fixed orbit around a fixed axis’ and that Islamic thought and action will be consonant with the system of the universe in general, thereby remaining immune to the evil of perturbations of man’s whims, which would destroy even the universe if it were to follow man’s ever changing desires. … The characteristic of ‘permanence’ in the beliefs and values of Islam produces a deep sense of security in the conscience of the Muslim as well as in the Muslim society. This sense of security comes from the knowledge that the orbit and the axis of the Muslim life are firm. A Muslim understands that his every step is a step forward directed toward a goal; that his movements are connected in time, stretching from yesterday through today toward tomorrow; and that his action is purposeful, ascending sequentially toward spiritual heights, under the firm guidance of Allah’s will.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0191453713477347">12</xref></sup></p></disp-quote>Although Islam is a coherent and intertwined image of the universe, many anarchical and antinomian trends operated in the classical Islamic world (and in the modern world as well, as the flourishing of multifarious Islamic tendencies shows). In medieval or classical Islam in various ways, Mu‘tazilites, Zaydites, Isma‘ilites and Kharijites opposed and contested mainstream Islam – Sunni but also Imamite Shiite Islam – both from the point of view of theology and of politics. We cannot define these trends as ‘democratic’ in the contemporary meaning of the term, but they did represent an alternative to the dominant pattern of power.</p><p>Patricia Crone stressed that ‘antinomianism could be said to be the Muslim counterpart to western anarchism. Both are convictions to the effect that humans can live without authority.’ So we find the Najdite among the Kharijites who ‘claimed that the law did not oblige the community to have an <italic>imam</italic>, only to live by the book of God … [so that] the imamate in the proper sense of the word was impossible’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0191453713477347">13</xref></sup> Among the Mu‘tazilites, al-Asamm, al-Nazzam, Hisham al-Fuwati and ‘Abbad b. Sulayman denied that the imamate was prescribed by the law. The Isma‘ilis ‘originated as Gnostics whose messiah was expected to abolish law and politics, not to sanctify them … [so that] the Ismailis had trouble seeing themselves as forming a polity at all’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0191453713477347">14</xref></sup></p><p>On the other hand, we detect a dispersed but well-attested tendency to call into question injustice in government. At least one Mu‘tazilite of the classical period, al-Hakim al-Jishumi, strongly identified the divine command of forbidding wrong with resistance to an unjust ruler.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0191453713477347">15</xref></sup> Zaydism, which largely imported Mu‘tazilite theology, ‘laid claim to, and continued, an old ‘Alid pattern: rebellion against unjust rule with the aim of establishing a legitimate imamate’, so that ‘[the] conjunction of forbidding wrong with political activism remains a prominent feature of the Zaydi tradition’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0191453713477347">16</xref></sup> ‘Such attitudes [rebellion against unjust rulers] characterize the early Kharijites, the Ibadites, the Zaydites and at least one Mu‘tazilite; in addition they are, so to speak, embalmed in the Imami heritage.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0191453713477347">17</xref></sup> Actually, the duty of forbidding wrong in Islam has an unusual character: ‘It is an integral part of the mainstream scholastic tradition of Islamic societies; and yet it retains a marked potential for violence, subversion and egalitarianism. In this combination lies the distinctive character of the Islamic conception of the duty.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0191453713477347">18</xref></sup></p><p>Philosophy also stood often as an alternative to the dominant pattern of power. Alfarabi’s <italic>Madina al-fadila </italic>[Virtuous city] is a utopia projecting a perfect system of government based on a synthesis of political religion, cosmology and political philosophy. Avempace’s <italic>Tadbir al-mutawahhid </italic>[Regime of the solitary] urges philosophers to withdraw from the wicked city in order to create a coenoby of intellectuals devoted to spiritual perfection. Yet there was an anti-democratic stance of philosophy. Plato’s condemnation of democracy deeply influenced Muslim <italic>falasifa </italic>and their vision is overwhelmingly aristocratic and elitist.</p><p>To sum up, although Islam is quite a holistic <italic>Weltanschauung</italic>, antagonism is rooted in its DNA, so to speak. In both cases, the goal of Islamic political thought and praxis is the realization of a fully Islamic state or, lacking the Islamic state, of an <italic>Islamic model of state </italic>that can take the place of the former. I have no room here to develop further these arguments.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0191453713477347">19</xref></sup> Briefly, I mean that the <italic>sole</italic> Islamic state was the Prophet’s Medina (and perhaps – at least for the Sunnites – the four right-guided caliphs’ Medina). Later, neither the Umayyad and Abbasid caliphates nor the sultanates and emirates born from the caliphate’s disruption can be described as <italic>Islamic states</italic>. Rather, a few political thinkers, like al-Mawardi and Ibn Taymiyya (but also Alfarabi), theorized <italic>Islamic models of state </italic>in order to rule the state in accordance with Islamic principles when a true <italic>Islamic state </italic>was impossible to build or to restore. Philosophers’ and theologians’ models of state take the place of an irretrievable system of government where Islam is buried under a heap of secular regulations.</p><p>The idea of an <italic>Islamic state</italic> was assumed again in the 20th century by the new Islamic organizations such as the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt or the Jama`at-i Islami in Pakistan. Actually, the theorizing of the Islamic state is a characteristic feature of contemporary political Islam. Hasan al-Banna was probably the first to suggest the setting-up of an Islamic state in a contemporary environment, but the idea has been articulated in many declensions since that time.</p><p>In 2007, the Muslim Brotherhood confirmed the main principles of Hasan al-Banna’s vision even in the political realm. The objective of the Brotherhood was the<disp-quote><p>… founding in this free homeland [of] a free Islamic state acting in accordance with Islamic rules, applying the Islamic social order, proclaiming the pristine Islamic principles, conveying the wise Islamic message to humankind. This state has not been yet instituted. Thus, all Muslims are guilty and responsible in front of God Great and Sublime because of their incapability in founding it and their refraining from making it exist.</p></disp-quote>The functioning of the Islamic state is grounded on a number of provisions:<disp-quote><p>… the <italic>Umma</italic> – eager of the satisfaction of her Lord in behaviors and conducts, in politics and inclinations; invigorating her members through ties of fraternity that unite them and unify their inter-relations; desiring to live free of constraints or marginalizations – [this Community], on the basis of her comprehension, conscience and satisfaction in these principles, asserts theoretically and practically the following [points]:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p><italic>Umma</italic> is the source of powers [<italic>sultat</italic>].</p></list-item><list-item><p>Justice [<italic>‘adl</italic>] is the goal of government, either on inner or on outer level.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Consultation [<italic>shurà</italic>] must be practised in every affair, leaving no place to dictatorship or individual power. Freedom must be reinforced, defended and affirmed as a right of all humans; [a right] guaranteed by God.</p></list-item></list></p><p>The fulfilling of the Muslim society will bring forth with it the choosing of an Islamic government … which will implement the Law of God [<italic>shar‘</italic>]. God will custody the people, preserve and protect their rights. [The Islamic government] involves the application of the secular law [<italic>qanun</italic>] in order to assure the human rights to liberty, security, job, [freedom of] movement [<italic>intiqal</italic>], [freedom of] expression of ideas, pursuit of the rights within [a framework of] cooperation and [common] decision-making.</p><p>The Islamic government chosen by the Islamic society will carry out its task as a servant and an employee of the Community, and will work for her welfare. Carrying out their duties, the members of this government will be bound by their Islamic commitment and [Islamic] education … although they will ask the help of the non-Muslims who are part of the [Islamic] society in order to realize the welfare and the good of [the whole] <italic>Umma</italic>.</p><p>The Islamic government is chosen freely by the Muslim society and is bound by the Law of God Powerful and Exalted to put in existence the true Islamic state … the state which will lead the [other] Islamic states, collect together the scattered [Islamic people], renew the [past] glory and return back to Muslims the land that has been seized away from them.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0191453713477347">20</xref></sup></p></disp-quote>For Yusuf al-Qaradawi, however, very close to the Brotherhood, the state is not religious but secular. Indeed, the Islamic state is a civil, constitutional and, ultimately, secular state:<disp-quote><p>The Islamic state which Islam brought, and as is known in the history of the Muslim, is a civil state [<italic>dawla madaniyya</italic>]; political power is set up in it on the basis of the pledge of allegiance [<italic>bay‘a</italic>] and choice [<italic>ikhtiyar</italic>] and <italic>shurà </italic>[consultation], and the ruler in it is the agent [<italic>wakil</italic>] of the <italic>umma </italic>or its employee [<italic>ajir</italic>]. It is the right of the <italic>umma </italic>– represented in the people of authority [<italic>ahl al-hall wa’l-‘aqd</italic>] among them – to take him to account; to supervise or censure him; to command him and prohibit him; and to rectify his course if he deviates, and if not – to remove him. It is among the rights of every Muslim, rather of every national citizen [<italic>muwatin</italic>], to disavow him if he sees him sinning and engaging in reprehensible actions, or failing to enjoin what it is just. Rather, it is incumbent on the people to declare revolution [<italic>thawra</italic>] against him if they see that he is a <italic>kafir</italic> according to the criteria of Allah. As for the religious ‘theocratic’ state which the West knew in the Middle Ages, and which was ruled by the men of religion who retained their rule by the necks – and conscience – of people in the name of the ‘divine right’ … it is rejected by Islam.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0191453713477347">21</xref></sup></p></disp-quote>Al-Qaradawi moves from this distinction to an overt and explicit utterance: ‘We declare frankly: Yes … to the Islamic state, and no, and again no … to the religious “theocratic” state.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0191453713477347">22</xref></sup> This is a state where individual responsibility is bound to summon the ruler to virtue and right behaviour [<italic>al-amr bi’l-ma‘ruf wa’l-nahy ‘an al-munkar</italic>] in the name of a strict application of God’s Law, without the mediation of a class of men of religion. It is important to underline the right of people and the individual citizen to overthrow the unjust ruler through a true revolution.</p><p>The last decades witnessed many endeavours to elaborate new ideas of state in a Muslim framework. Democracy has been one of the essential touchstones. For instance, Muhammad ‘Abid al-Jabri criticized Arab political intellect and read <italic>shurà</italic> as an Islamized form of democracy:<disp-quote><p>In contemporary age, no method of democracy is common heritage of the whole humanity. The practice of <italic>shurà </italic>in contemporary age needs the realization of the following three principles: to have the application of <italic>shurà</italic> leading to free democratic elections; to define the scope of the chief of state’s powers within a republican regime and parallel to that have the executive power bestowed upon a government which is liable before the parliament, both in a monarchy and in a republic; to define the specific tasks of the chief of state, of the government and of the nation’s representative assembly, so that only the latter be the sole source of power.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0191453713477347">23</xref></sup></p></disp-quote>Hasan Hanafi and Salim Qammudi plead for democracy as a tool and not as an end. Hanafi spelled out the Islamic concept of democracy in the wider framework of classical Islamic political thought:<disp-quote><p>Democracy is a tool not an end. It is a means to implement something else, namely national objectives. …</p><p>Democracy, no doubt, is a universal value as such and in itself, based on mutual consultation and against monopoly of opinion. The truth, even a relative one, can be reached more soundly by a consensus rather than by a simple individual opinion …</p><p>Democracy as a concept may differ from a culture to another. In the West, it is a quantitative concept based on majority–minority criteria. The truth is with the majority against the minority. …</p><p>Islamic concept of democracy is something else. It is not a quantitative concept, majority–minority, power and opposition, but a qualitative concept based on the right of every person to express himself freely. No one has the right to monopolize the truth and impose his views on others. The right to differ is a legitimate right, a religious duty. The good advice, to order the good to be done and the evil not to be done, is a religious duty surmounting to an article of faith. The truth is the outcome of consensus, <italic>ijma‘</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0191453713477347">24</xref></sup></p></disp-quote>‘Commanding right and forbidding wrong’ (like in al-Qaradawi), consensus, ethical qualification: these are the Islamic fundamentals of a flexible concept of democracy.</p><p>Salim Qammudi<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0191453713477347">25</xref></sup> argues that Islam is grounded on steady and permanent principles that are at odds with the instability and the flawed character of democracy. Moreover, democracy is not an ‘absolute law’ [<italic>qanun qat‘i</italic>] (Qammudi, p. 104). Actually, the Islamic political concept needs to be freed from the conditionings of western political thought. While values are firm, procedures are contingent (ibid., p. 107). An ‘Islamic’ democracy would accept procedures (elections, parliamentary system, pluralism of the parties and so on), but not the ‘westernized’ values of democracy (ibid., p. 109). Actually, <italic>shurà </italic>is a principle and a value that may absorb democracy, which is merely a tool [<italic>tastaw‘ibu al-shurà ka-mubda’ wa ka-qima al-dimuqratiyya(ta) ka-alia</italic>] (ibid., p. 113). From these premises we can argue that the Prophet’s Medina, whose community ruled itself by <italic>shurà</italic>, is an example of ‘Islamic’ democracy and of a ‘democratic’ Islamic state.</p><p>The Arab revolts promise to renew and update these principles. They have been antagonistic to the status quo. They witnessed a comeback of Islamic ideals in a sovereignty’s framework. They promise to experiment with new ways of Islamic commitment stressing the dialectics between the secular and the religious state. The Arab revolts ignited the spark of a deep upset of political schemes in practice and theory. Antagonism and contestation of the pristine political orders is at stake. A non-secondary tradition of the Islamic political thought is rejuvenated. New concepts of democratic declension are put forward. New blood is poured in the veins of political Islam. The question is whether Islamic parties and movements will be protagonists in this transformation. If so, they will probably need a profound revision in the very basis of their conceptual framework. I believe that heuristically it would be very productive to investigate this revision from the point of view of Antonio Gramsci and his theory of hegemony. Gramsci is widely known in the Arab world and his thought has been useful to interpret the main directions of contemporary Arab thought.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0191453713477347">26</xref></sup></p><p>In their recent book on the performance of the Islamic parties before the 2011 revolts in a few Arab countries (Egypt, Jordan, Morocco, Kuwait, Yemen and Palestine), Nathan Brown and Amr Hamzawy argued that the Islamists suffered electoral losses in some countries and steadily deteriorating prospects in others.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0191453713477347">27</xref></sup> This apparent withdrawal in consent and influence can be counterbalanced by their new protagonism in the aftermath of the revolts, invoking an Islamic shift in the popular and overwhelming secular demands put forward by the insurgents. In Brown’s and Hamzawy’s opinion, the Islamic movements will face three major challenges we reread in Gramsci’s perspective:</p><list list-type="alpha-upper"><list-item><p>The first major challenge: Coming up with new arguments that can convince their popular bases that, despite poor payback in the short run, they must persist in participatory politics.</p></list-item></list><p>The Islamic attitude must switch from a counter-hegemonic to a hegemonic stance of social and political guide and participation. It no longer suffices to oppose the regimes; rather assuming the moral and intellectual direction of the movements could get social and political results in mobilization. Participation in politics and the electoral game is the pre-requisite of a democratic involvement. There is a consolidated tradition of participation in democratic dialectics of the Islamic parties before the revolts as Brown and Hamzawy showed. Although Islamic parties did not obtain meaningful results in their rooting in (pseudo-)democratic or at least pluralistic processes, this experience could be very useful in future commitments.</p><list list-type="alpha-upper"><list-item><p>The second major challenge: finding a sustainable and practical balance between the requirements of political participation and the demands of ideological commitment. The realities of restricted pluralism and the ruling elites’ domination of the political system strategically and tactically compel Islamists to adopt compromising positions on major social issues (although the nature of these necessary compromises varies considerably). These same realities also compel them to develop pragmatic understandings with ruling elites and/or secular opposition movements to increase the paybacks from political participation.</p></list-item></list><p>It means first of all the acceptance of procedural democratic rules while developing new categories of political and even theological thought. But it means more, because it enforces a pragmatic evaluation of the old concept of the Islamic state.</p><list list-type="alpha-upper"><list-item><p>The third major challenge: rethinking the substance of the relationship between Islamist movements’ proselytizing and political components, then devising the best possible structures for organizing those components institutionally.</p></list-item></list><p>This is the challenge of hegemony: the building-up of a new set of institutions through the action of (Islamic) political parties that synthesize intellectuals [<italic>‘ulama’</italic>?] and masses, leaders and led.</p><p>These are the conditions of a potential Islamic democracy. That it will succeed is only wishful thinking. The Islamic parties and movements have to demonstrate their capacity to rule, to come to terms with modernity, to take women’s and minorities’ rights for granted. But they cannot demonstrate that they can do it if they do not have the chance to do so. Islamic parties and movements are trying to capitalize from their advantageous position vis-à-vis secular parties and movements with the majority of population. As we said above, Al-Nahda Party in Tunisia won the election for the Constituent Assembly in October 2011 and presented itself as a very responsible force that is eager to make its contribution to the new political path undertaken by the country. Its leader Rashid Ghannushi has always been an outspoken supporter of (at least) procedural democracy. The Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, although threatened by internal splits, tried tactically to retain good relations both with the people of Tahrir Square and with the military junta in the fall of 2011 in order not to compromise its chances of victory in the forthcoming electoral and constitutional process. Later, in the elections, their party, the Freedom and Justice Party, got about 45% of the votes. The Al-Nur Party of the conservative Salafites followed second with about 20%. The Justice and Development Party in Morocco got the relative majority in Parliament in the elections of November 2011. The Islamic forces seem likely to play a relevant role in the future Libya after the breaking-down of Gadhdhafi’s regime. The earthquake of the Arab Spring has not yet a direction, but spurs new openings and dislocations in the Arab political landscape. The moderate leanings of Al-Nahda, the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood and the Justice and Development Party are nevertheless no guarantee of social progression. Their social attitude is on the whole conservative. But their rewriting of the political path could be a really challenging revision of usual political patterns.</p></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other" id="fn28-0191453713477347"><p>A version of this article was presented at the Reset-Dialogues İstanbul Seminars 2012 (‘The Promises of Democracy in Troubled Times’) that took place at İstanbul Bilgi University from 19–24 May 2012.</p></fn></fn-group><notes><title>Notes</title><fn-group><fn fn-type="other" id="fn1-0191453713477347"><label>1.</label><p>I cautiously use the term ‘revolutions’ because – as Antonio Gramsci put it – a revolution takes place only when a radical change in the ruling class and in the institutional structures occurs.
