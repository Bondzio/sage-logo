<abstract>
<p>For many years, the downtown in Clarksdale, with a municipal population of 17,960 and located in the northern part of the Mississippi Delta, had lost its role as the centre providing a wide range of jobs and services to those living in the surrounding region. For many cities and towns in America, downtown decline has been associated with the flight to the suburbs and the growth in shopping malls serving flourishing gated communities. In Clarksdale’s case, downtown decline has been due largely to the advent of big box retailing and the location of new retail and commercial developments along the state highway on the edge of town, combined with the loss of jobs and population associated with agricultural restructuring. Today, however, Clarksdale has taken up the challenge to ‘revitalize’ the downtown in the face of economic adversity. Recovery is under way, and much of this is associated with blues music and Delta culture: Clarksdale is situated at the fabled ‘crossroads’ of Highways 49 and 61 and is also the home to national icons in literature, art and other cultural pursuits. These are key elements around which the downtown revitalization effort is focused. This paper charts the process by which the Clarksdale community has embarked on the road to downtown recovery, and highlights the town’s indelible links with the blues, borne out of years of toil, hardship and social deprivation. The paper emphasizes the importance of ‘champions’ and ‘creative people’, drawing on community support, in achieving downtown revitalization. Positive results are becoming evident with new businesses and jobs, improved levels of service, refurbishment of derelict buildings, a renewed sense of place, and an uplift in community confidence. The significance of cultural tourism to downtown revitalization is highlighted, with particular emphasis on the global appeal of blues, but with its roots firmly established in Clarksdale and the Delta.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>I first visited Clarksdale, a small town in the Mississippi Delta, in 2001 when I was driving from New Orleans to Memphis. As Clarksdale is heralded as the birthplace of blues music, I wanted to see what the place really had to offer to someone visiting from 15,000 km away and with an interest in blues music and Delta culture. As I walked around the rather moribund downtown area I was soon captured by the blues and southern hospitality and the dishevelled edginess of the place.</p>
<p>Since that time I have visited Clarksdale on a dozen occasions, and on each visit I have found the downtown to be undergoing a form of economic renaissance in terms of new businesses, new jobs and new services available to locals and visitors alike. With my interest in small town development and revitalization, I felt that there was a story to be told, especially with this downtown renaissance being so intimately linked with blues and Delta culture. And I could see that, in a very important way, this economic renaissance was closely allied to the so-called ‘creative’ people – those Clarksdale residents with a long history associated with the town, as well as those individuals who had moved there in more recent times, drawn by the same creative, cultural spirit and hospitality that had captured me on my very first visit.</p>
<p>This paper describes the Clarksdale experience to date, and highlights the important steps that contribute to the ongoing revitalization of the downtown, including recognition of the role of music and creativity and the links with cultural tourism.</p>

<sec id="section2-0725513612444559">
<title>Clarksdale: A snapshot</title>
<p>Clarksdale is located in the northern part of the Mississippi Delta, that huge expanse of rich alluvial soils which extends from Memphis in the north to Vicksburg in the south, and which embraces the floodplains of the Mississippi River to the west and the Yazoo River to the east. Situated at the junction of Highways 49 and 61, Clarksdale is located in Coahoma County, some 125 km south of Memphis, and the town has developed as an important centre serving the smaller settlements and farming communities in this part of the Delta.</p>
<p>The City of Clarksdale and Coahoma County have experienced significant changes in population numbers over the past 100 years or so. In 1950 population peaked at approximately 50,000 persons, with one-third living in the city and two-thirds living in the mainly rural areas. By 2011, population had declined markedly to around 26,000 persons, the same number as in 1900. Today, two-thirds now live in Clarksdale (estimated 17,960 persons) and one-third (estimated 8,190 persons) live in the rural areas. Continuing population decline is forecast over the next 20 years.</p>
<p>Population loss has been largely due to the mechanization of farming, especially in the cotton plantations, resulting in significant unemployment levels and the migration of the rural poor to seek jobs in the large industrial cities in the north. Contributing factors include the poor socio-economic conditions of Delta towns and communities, the lack of adequate education facilities, and the perception of better prospects by moving to larger cities.</p>
<p>On average, people living in Clarksdale and Coahoma County tend to have a lower socio-economic profile than the averages for Mississippi and the nation. This situation is reflected in census data relating to education, household income, housing value, poverty levels, and other indicators. Clarksdale/Coahoma is one of the poorest localities in the nation in socio-economic terms, although, paradoxically, it is also one of the richest in terms of its Delta culture and intrinsic relationship with blues music. This richness is critically important in contributing to downtown revitalization and growth in business and employment.</p>
<p>Clarksdale developed over many years as the service centre for this northern part of the Delta, and became the social and economic hub for the community through the provision of jobs, services and amenities. The advent of the railway, followed by the construction of highway networks, reinforced Clarksdale’s role as a centre of trade and commerce.</p>
<p>By the early 1950s, according to the Chamber of Commerce at the time, the city had a total of around 650 retail businesses, most of which were located in the downtown area and were serving a trade area comprising some 130,000 residents. Today, the downtown has just 75 or so retail businesses and the trade area has contracted to around 65,000 persons.</p>
<p>By the 1970s a number of new trends were becoming evident and were to lead to the decanting of business activities away from the long-established downtown. Principal among these trends was the relocation of many businesses to large sites located along State Street on the edge of town, where exposure to high volumes of highway traffic was significant and where the trend for ‘big box’ retailing could be more readily accommodated on large sites with ample room for on-site car parking. Significantly, Wal-Mart opened on State Street, and this led to strong competition with small businesses in the downtown area; since that time many new and expanding businesses have sought locations in State Street as the focus for retail and other business activities.</p>
<p>Other trends adversely affecting Clarksdale’s economy include the growth in competition from other cities and towns (including nearby Memphis, Southhaven, Tunica, Greenwood, Oxford, and Batesville) and the continuing loss of manufacturing jobs. The education sector is also regarded as under-performing, and this situation does not auger well in attracting or retaining young families.</p>
<p>While the downtown businesses have been experiencing tough economic conditions over the past two or three decades, in very recent times a renaissance in downtown business activity has commenced. Much of this is directly related to Clarksdale’s close association with blues music.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0725513612444559">
<title>Blues music and Clarksdale</title>
<p>Driving into the downtown area of Clarksdale, Mississippi, is like entering a small southern town locked in the 1940s. The mainly late 19th and early 20th century buildings have only survived thus far because new development over the past 30 years has located out of town, mainly along State Street. A walk around the downtown soon confirms that not much commercial activity seems to be happening: almost half of the buildings are empty, and many are derelict. Those businesses that are in operation appear to be just making ends meet in terms of local sales. In a word, the downtown appears ‘moribund’.</p>
<p>But the broken pavements and dishevelled character of the downtown also reflect the underlying strength of Clarksdale, rooted as it is in blues music and Delta culture.</p>
<p>This is the crossroads: the place where – as tradition has it – Robert Johnson went down to the intersection of Highways 49 and 61 and sold his soul to the devil in return for the gift of being able to play the blues guitar. This is the birthplace of Son House, John Lee Hooker, Earl Hooker, Jackie Brenston, Ike Turner and numerous other icons. BB King and Muddy Waters were born nearby; Bessie Smith died there. Sonny Boy Williamson, Elvis Presley and Sam Cooke were heralded at the local WROX radio station where Early Wright (who was at the microphone for 50 years) was probably the world’s longest-serving DJ. Others have called Clarksdale ‘home’ at some stage or another, and include Charlie Patton, Bukka White, Pinetop Perkins, Frank Frost and Sam Carr. Big Jack Johnson, one of the Jelly Roll Kings, played most nights at Red’s Lounge. And at the nearby small settlement of Tutwiler, WC Handy in 1903 first came across the music he was to describe as ‘the weirdest music I had ever heard’, and which was to become the blues music phenomenon.</p>
<p>Today, a new phalanx of blues musicians call Clarksdale ‘home’, or at least come by on a regular basis, playing at the popular local juke joints and blues music festivals. Examples include T-Model Ford, Super Chikan, Cedell Davis, Robert Belfour, Dave ‘Honeyboy’ Edwards, Dick Lourie, Watermelon Slim, Big George Brock, RL Boyce, LC Ulmer, Robert ‘Bilbo’ Walker, Terry ‘Harmonica’ Bean, and many others.</p>
<p>The Juke Joint Festival in April draws some 5000 visitors into the downtown, while the Sunflower River Blues and Gospel Festival in August attracts some 20,000 people over the weekend. These are now well-established annual events for locals and increasing numbers of visitors from across the USA and from abroad. Numerous other music events are on the calendar, as well as literary and film festivals</p>
<p>But it’s the blues that provides the basis of Clarksdale’s appeal: a map (Red Rooster and Delta Blues Museum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0725513612444559">1995</xref>) showing the birthplace of Mississippi blues musicians indicates that of 310 musicians listed in 1995, approximately 180 or 60 per cent were from the Delta; yet the Delta occupies just 22 per cent of the state’s land area. Another 15 per cent of musicians come from the adjoining ‘hill country’, including the late RL Burnside and Junior Kimbrough; their offspring carry on the blues music traditions today.</p>
<p>Why Mississippi and the Delta? In the words of John Lee Hooker: ‘I know why the best blues artists come from Mississippi. Because it’s the worst state. You have the blues alright if you’re down in Mississippi’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0725513612444559">Gioia 2008</xref>: 37). Bukka White identifies the Delta roots of blues: ‘That’s where the blues start from, back across them fields … It started right behind one of them mules or one of them log houses, one of them log camps or the levee camp. That’s where the blues sprung from. I know what I’m talking about’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0725513612444559">Cobb 1992</xref>: 279). And James Cobb observes that ‘the blues, a music born of incessant toil and demolished dreams on impoverished Delta blacks, exerted … a formative influence on rock and roll [which was] to reflect and shape the sensibilities of successive generations’ (1992: 305).</p>
<p>Peter Guralnick describes Mississippi blues as ‘generally considered to be the richest and most emotionally intense vein of a genre that began sweeping the South in the early days of the century and then, much assisted by the new technology of the phonograph record, became a central strand in the diffusion of Afro-American culture over the next fifty years’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0725513612444559">Guralnick 1989</xref>: 14).</p>
<p>As the centre of the cotton industry, Clarksdale was also the entertainment focus for the mainly black plantation workers. Alan Lomax, an ethnomusicologist exploring southern folk lore in the early 1940s, described Clarksdale as ‘a pleasant shady place. White houses, set far back on cool green lawns, betokened a pleasant and easy way of life’, but goes on to observe that ‘These quiet streets of uptown Clarksdale in no way prepared me for what I encountered when I crossed the railroad tracks and walked into Clarksdale’s black business district, the social and amusement centre for all the plantation workers for thirty miles around’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0725513612444559">Lomax 1993</xref>: 28).</p>
<p>Another observer was Samuel C Adams, who was assisting Lomax and the Fisk University team in its study of Coahoma County. Adams records the bustling hive of activities in what was to become known as the ‘New World’, the black business community south of the railroad tracks. Workers from the plantations, sawmills and road construction gangs were ‘going to the town of Clarksdale and there to dance, gamble or participate in other activities; in addition, there are radios, victrolas, and jukeboxes to pick up popular songs. Through them, the world of the outside comes to plantation Negroes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0725513612444559">Adams 1947</xref>: 251).</p>
<p>While blues is foremost among features of the Delta, creativity is also evident in Clarksdale’s rich wealth of artists, writers and others who have contributed much to the cultural fabric of the town and the Delta. Tennessee Williams spent much of his boyhood in Clarksdale where his grandfather was minister of St George’s Episcopal Church, and often the characters in Williams’s plays were based on Clarksdale identities from that period of his life. Marshall Bouldin III, world-renown portrait painter, has lived here for most of his 80-plus years and he still paints in his studio on the northern edge of town.</p>
<p>Among other features are the regular Barefoot Film Workshops, the annual scholarships provided to young Delta musicians by the world-renown Boston-based Berklee School of Music, the Delta Writers Association, the Clarksdale Film Festival, and so on.</p>
<p>And downtown Clarksdale is changing, slowly but surely. The downtown is undergoing a renaissance in economic terms, and this is helping to form a new sense of place for Clarksdalians and for the many visitors who come to the town each year to appreciate a place that is, indeed, the cradle of blues music. This renaissance is reflected in the growth in new businesses in the downtown, bringing new investment, new jobs, restored and refurbished buildings, new services, and a new sense of identity for the town. Most importantly, the renaissance is also bringing new residents to Clarksdale who add to the creative talents of existing residents and thus help to revitalize the downtown economy and provide a catalyst for renewal and for business and community development.</p>
<p>Although much is available in the academic literature in regard to the ‘creative class’ and ‘creative cities’, the revitalization now under way in downtown Clarksdale is home-grown: the local community came together and identified their need to ‘revitalize’, they became organized and incorporated, employed a co-ordinator, and set about introducing improvements to their downtown.</p>
<p>This paper shows that much of the revitalization is directly related to the town’s close association with blues – the music contributes in so many important ways to the economic and cultural landscape of the town. A survey shows some 60 businesses, buildings and other entities located in downtown which have a relationship with blues and Delta culture, as noted in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0725513612444559">Table 1</xref>. The businesses account for one-half of all of the downtown retail and commercial businesses (with the balance involving antiques, tailors, a supermarket, hairdressers, law firms, accountants, insurance agencies, and so on).</p>

<title>Revitalization: The role of champions and creative people</title>
<p>Downtown Clarksdale’s economic revitalization is intrinsically related to the entrenched traditions in blues music and the growth associated with cultural tourism. Initiatives by local property owners, developers and businesspeople are creating new and expanded opportunities in business and, in so doing, are assisting in supporting the community as well as keeping the blues alive. Local government is contributing to these efforts.</p>
<p>The role of ‘champions’ is important in this regard. Two prominent individuals who provide the inspiration, drive and leadership in the Clarksdale community are Bill Luckett, a prominent lawyer, investor and developer and inaugural Chairman of Clarksdale Revitalization Inc. (CRI), and Kinchen ‘Bubba’ O’Keefe Jnr, a local contractor with a long history in building redevelopment and refurbishment, local enterprise, and community service. Each individual, in his own way, has generated the initiative to identify and implement projects. In some instances the task is huge, such as eventually restoring the historic Alcazar Hotel, while in other cases important achievements are already evident, such as introducing Madidi as the town’s first fine dining restaurant and the iconic Ground Zero Blues Club, and restoring the historic Greyhound Bus Station and the Woolworth building (with lofts above).</p>
<p>While Luckett (with his business associate, actor Morgan Freeman) and O’Keefe provide the necessary inspiration and leadership, many others contribute their ideas, creativity, investment business acumen, and personal time and effort in supporting downtown revitalization in some form or other. All of these individuals can be broadly described as being among Clarksdale’s creative people.</p>
<p>Writers including Richard <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0725513612444559">Florida (2005</xref>) and Charles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0725513612444559">Landry (2000</xref>) have highlighted the contributions of creative people to economic development, although relatively little attention appears to have been focused on small cities and towns like Clarksdale. Florida’s approach places emphasis on the large ‘creative’ cities and he applies his indices (the Bohemian Index and the Gay Index, for example) and multivariate analyses. Unsurprisingly, Clarksdale doesn’t fit any of these descriptors: San Francisco, Clarkdale isn’t. But Florida does recognize that ‘creativity has become the principal driving force in the growth and development of cities, regions, and nations’.</p>
<p>Landry (2000) offers useful direction on the topic: he writes that ‘The cultural industries, hotbeds of creativity, are significant economic sectors in their own right’, and he describes culture as the ‘panoply of resources that show that a place is unique and distinctive’. He goes on to emphasize that ‘Creativity is not only about a continuous invention of the new, but also how to deal appropriately with the old’. Importantly, he notes ‘the dangers of limiting creativity to the ideas stage of projects. It must run consistently from first insight to implementation, consolidation, dissemination and evaluation’. This understanding is clearly evident in Clarksdale’s approach to revitalization.</p>
<p>In Clarksdale, where 30 per cent of families live below the poverty line compared with the national figure of 9 per cent, and where unemployment is at least twice the national rate, ‘creativity’ is not exactly an anticipated feature for this community. Yet, creativity is in abundance and this has become most evident over the past decade or so. In that period, some 30 or so new businesses have been established in the downtown, and this has involved the renovation or renewal of as many as 30 buildings. A quick stock-take shows that approximately 50 per cent of these new businesses and other features are the product of long-time residents, while the other 50 per cent are attributable to newcomers. Information from CRI shows that another 25 downtown buildings are currently undergoing refurbishment.</p>
<p>The following listing provides an indication of the number and type of projects, businesses and events that have been established in the downtown over the past ten years and in more recent times by these local interests, including newcomers.</p>

<p>In sum, Clarksdale has a wealth of arts and related activities, virtually all of which are located in the downtown where they contribute to active street life and business, and add to the town’s amenities. As a result, Clarksdale is now enjoying a renaissance in local economic development, and this is reflected in new businesses, new development, more local jobs and incomes, and a higher level of service for the local community and for visitors. All of this is bound up with growth in cultural tourism.</p>
<p>As a case in point, in 2001 the only ‘fine dining’ restaurant in town was the new Madidi restaurant established in that year by Bill Luckett and Morgan Freeman. Together, they also launched the Ground Zero Blues Club. Today, five new restaurants/dining places are located downtown. Similarly, in 2001 no art galleries were to be found downtown; today, four galleries and the Cat Head folk art store are open for business. And whereas once the only accommodation in downtown was the 1960s Uptown Motor Inn and the long-established Riverside Inn (where many a musician spent the night), quality accommodation is now available at the Big Pink Guesthouse, the Clark Residential Inn, the Lofts at Five and Dime, Blues Hound Flat, and the Delta Cotton Company apartments above Ground Zero. And for a ‘real deal’ Delta accommodation experience, the Shack Up Inn is located about 5 km south of town, with the Shacksdale Motel (‘new’ shacks for rental) establishing just opposite on Highway 49. Hopson’s (the former plantation commissary) also provides overnight accommodation.</p>
<p>Those coming to live in Clarksdale over the past decade have largely been drawn to the place by the blues, having attended the Sunflower Blues and Gospel Festival or the Juke Joint Festival, or simply discovering the place through happenstance. And they return, with investments in new businesses and (for some) the opportunity for a ‘sea change’. All make a contribution to the town.</p>
<p>Roger Stolle, for example, resigned from his senior marketing position in St Louis and set up the well-known Cat Head Music, Folk Art and Books store in Delta Avenue. Roger helped establish the Juke Joint Festival, and is a popular media contributor on blues music in print and radio. For Gary and Carol Vincent from Nashville, Clarksdale was their special destination: Gary, a singer-songwriter, is also a sound recording professional and he has established a state-of-the-art sound stage and studio in Issaquena Avenue, while Carol represents musicians and recording companies; their respective businesses are national in coverage. Another example is Theo Dasbach. Theo, born in the Netherlands, retired from merchant banking in New York City and Europe and, with his New York-based partner Cindy, decided to relocate his personal rock ‘n’ roll museum from the Netherlands to a suitable locality in the USA; he investigated Memphis, Nashville and other places with a music heritage, and ultimately decided on East Second Street, Clarksdale. Theo’s neighbours are Stan and Dixie Street – Stan, born in Rochester, New York, is an artist and musician and established the Hambone Gallery; he plays saxophone with his Hambone Band most nights. Dixie, from Florida, is a drummer with the All Night Long band and writes grant applications by day.</p>
<p>Shonda Warner was born into a farming family in Nebraska and, following years in merchant banking and finance in New York and Europe, arrived in Clarksdale where she now conducts her international and rural investment businesses from above Miss Del’s General Store in Delta Avenue. Shonda has contributed much to the town, including funding of the inaugural Clarksdale Film Festival in 2011 and lending her support to many other local community events and causes. In a similar vein, Janet Coursin, born in California and living in Boston, decided a new life was in order so she left her business management consultancy in the Big Apple and spent months traversing the USA in her campervan, seeking the best place to live; she chose Clarksdale, and today has a list of clients in the Delta and beyond.</p>
<p>A full listing of locally-based creative people is extensive, and their presence in the revitalization of the downtown is crucial to the renewal now under way in the local economy and, just as importantly, in their support to blues music and Delta culture.</p>
<p>Of those born in Clarksdale, many had left town for education and work, but were destined to return home to establish businesses in the downtown. Randall Andrews, an LA-based chef, came back and, with local cotton farmer Clint Davis, established Rust, a popular restaurant in Delta Avenue. Similarly, artist and musician Bradley Gordon returned home after years of travel and set up the Gordon Gallery, as did Austin Britt with his new Foxtrot Gallery, also in Delta Avenue, and Joey Young with his Lambfish Gallery in Third Street.</p>
<p>While blues music is a significant factor in attracting new residents to Clarksdale, it is also true that Southern hospitality and friendship is important. As Magdalena <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0725513612444559">Solé (2011</xref>), New York-based photographer, writes, ‘I have returned to the Delta a dozen times. Always for the same reason: the people’. Solé, who is preparing a photographic essay on the Delta, mentions that ‘People in the Delta have stories, music, love and deep care for their community, irrespective of the hardship they endure. I was drawn to the people I encountered. They were unlike most I had known. They allowed me to slip into their midst as if they had known me for a long time, and we could share stories, laughter, sorrow and silence. This didn’t happen one time, it happened every day in every town’.</p>

<title>Action plan for downtown revitalization</title>
<p>Clarksdalians decided in April 2008 to set in motion a movement to revitalize their downtown. The first public meeting coincided with my arrival in Clarksdale to spend three months writing a personal account about what I had already detected, over numerous visits, to be the slow but certain renewal of downtown activities, mainly associated with blues music and Delta culture. The outcome of the meeting was to establish Clarksdale Revitalization Inc. (CRI), and to seek support and funds from local interests and government sources. Before long, the new board appointed a coordinator and the revitalization effort was under way. During this time I altered course, turning my personal ‘blues odyssey’ into an action plan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0725513612444559">Henshall 2008</xref>) which was subsequently adopted by the new board prior to my return home to Australia.</p>
<p>The action plan provides the following assessments:<list list-type="bullet">

<list-item>
<p>A listing of ten essential do’s and don’ts in promoting downtown revitalization</p>
</list-item>
</list>The action plan is based on a consultation program involving in-depth interviews with 50 individuals in Clarksdale, a personal interview survey conducted among people visiting the Juke Joint Festival, land use and floorspace surveys of downtown businesses, and assessments of retail and tourism business activities.</p>
<p>While the action plan provides a basis for further and appropriate development in Clarksdale’s downtown, the reality remains that local people must develop and support initiatives aimed at increasing the real wealth of their community, and this means supporting CRI in its efforts to generate sustainable economic development focused around blues and local culture. A plan is worthless unless local people give their support.</p>
<p>This support is increasingly evident in Clarksdale, and both the city and the county have also contributed significantly to efforts to identify, promote, fund and develop new and improved infrastructure, local amenities and the like. Examples include assistance with the Cultural Heritage Trail, the designation of a Heritage Area under relevant legislation, the Sunflower River Enhancement Project, and annual contributions to the operations of CRI.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Clarksdale’s experience in downtown revitalization is built upon the legacy of blues music. This legacy – steeped in the toil, hardship and struggles of Delta life over many generations – is now promoted as a feature of cultural tourism. Benefits are emerging for downtown businesses and for the wider community in terms of more jobs and improved services and amenities. To a large extent this revitalization is the work of so-called local ‘champions’ and ‘creative’ people in all walks of life in this small town – not just those in the music and entertainment sector.</p>
<p>While much of the renewal involves time-consuming and costly refurbishment and restoration of old buildings, it is fortunate that the locale has retained these buildings in their historic built form over many years, thus providing the opportunity to authentically re-present Clarksdale’s cultural links to new generations. In contrast, places like Nashville have surrendered their music heritage to new Disney-esque constructions. In Nashville’s case, the city’s focus for country music is now located far from its roots which were associated with the original Grand Ole Opry, held weekly at the historic Ryman Auditorium in downtown. Branson, Missouri, is another example where the introduction of mainly ‘Middle-of-the-Road’ music venues (155 shows are currently listed on the website) has led to a proliferation of tacky downtown souvenir shops and fast food outlets. In stark contrast, Clarksdale’s motto is ‘Keepin’ it Real’.</p>
<p>Lessons also emerge for other small towns and cities, ranging from the need to involve the community and gain the support of local government, through to getting a plan in place and encouraging a new attitude to economic and community development which recognizes and builds on cultural tourism as a growth sector. While the music scene is an essential ingredient – as in Clarksdale’s case – it is critically important to ensure the supporting infrastructure exists or can be developed. For Clarksdale, this ranges from visitor accommodation and restaurants and cafes, to venues and recording facilities, museums and the like. Ten years ago, the downtown had very little provision of such infrastructure; today, the situation is far more positive.</p>
<p>It is also necessary to recognize the place of ‘comprehensiveness’ in planning for cultural tourism and downtown revitalization – ‘it’s not just about downtown’. In Clarksdale’s case, the education system needs to be addressed as it appears to be failing the community, 30 per cent of whom live below the poverty line. It’s no good fixing the physical form of the downtown unless the poor social and economic conditions are also positively addressed. This need is highlighted in the Clarksdale Action Plan, especially the positive link between education and creating employment for residents, particularly those in the African American community where unemployment remains high. If downtown is healthy, then other parts of the city can also be addressed, and hopefully the positive outcomes are reflected across the whole municipality.</p>
<p>The revival of downtown business is already generating new opportunities for local job-seekers, with many of the new jobs being taken up by those involved in catering and food service, in venue operation, management and performance, and in visitor accommodation services.</p>
<p>Detractors will always be around (‘this town is dead’), and they need to be dealt with in a positive way so that the wider community really can understand the benefits to be gained from downtown revitalization and encouragement to cultural tourism.</p>
<p>And it’s important to monitor and review progress so that we know how the downtown or town centre is travelling in its efforts to ‘revitalize’. Each year, measure the numbers of new businesses, new jobs, new events and patronage levels, visitor origins, tourist information sources, media representation, retail sales levels, local tax revenues, market share changes, accommodation occupancy rates, and so on. These tasks need not be onerous or costly, and can give ‘ownership’ of the revitalization project to the local community.</p>
<p>Downtown now enters its third full year with CRI in place, and with the action plan providing helpful directions under the guidance of board members and their creative coordinator, who together are responsible for introducing many initiatives aimed at downtown revitalization. For those involved in town centre renewal and re-growth, or involved in cultural tourism, the positive lessons from Clarksdale should not be news; however, these lessons do reinforce the importance of supporting local champions and creative people, attracting community support, having an action plan in place, and ensuring the implementation of initiatives which improve the economic, social and physical conditions of our town centres.</p>
<p>No doubt, in the years to come, those travelling along Blues Highway 61 from New Orleans to Memphis and on to Chicago will readily locate Clarksdale on their tourist map and find time to stay over for a few nights and enjoy a serving of blues and Delta culture. As Mississippi-born blues musician Charlie Musselwhite says, ‘once you’ve been to Clarksdale, life will never be the same’.</p>
