<abstract>
<p>Lymphomas are a diverse group of malignant disorders of lymph nodes, extranodal organs and the bone marrow. Lymphomas can broadly be divided into Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphomas. The World Health Organisation's classification, created in 2008, recognises over 30 separate clinical entities, each with defined clinical, histological, immunophenotypic and genetic characteristics. Consequently, though lymphadenopathy and classic ‘B’ symptoms are common presenting features, the variety of clinical presentations can lead to delays in diagnosis and treatment. Many lymphomas are curable, and refinements in treatment have significantly improved survival for patients with incurable lymphomas. This review aims to provide a broad overview of lymphomas, and outline a practical approach to symptom recognition, diagnosis, supportive care and the psycho-social aspects of management. These are important in the primary care setting as prompt diagnosis, continuity and good supportive care are crucial elements of high-quality treatment.</p>

<sec id="sec3-1755738013475435"><title>Non-Hodgkin lymphoma</title>
<p>Non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs) account for about 4% of all newly diagnosed cancers in the UK. The incidence of NHL has been increasing gradually over time, and the risk of developing NHL increases with advancing age. NHLs are the fifth most commonly diagnosed cancers in men, and the seventh in women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1755738013475435">Cancer Research UK, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>NHLs are a diverse group of diseases, and currently comprise about 30 distinct entities within the most recent World Health Organisation (WHO) classification (Swerdlow et al., 2008). These can be broadly divided, on the basis of their modes of clinical presentation, into high-grade B-cell lymphomas, low-grade B-cell lymphomas, systemic T-cell lymphomas and cutaneous T-cell lymphomas. This broad classification is important as it provides a basis for treatment of these disorders. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1755738013475435">Box 1</xref> provides some examples of NHLs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1755738013475435">Figure 1</xref> provides a scheme for subdividing lymphomas into broad categories.

<sec id="sec4-1755738013475435"><title>Hodgkin lymphoma</title>
<p>Thomas Hodgkin published his paper ‘On some morbid appearances of the absorbent glands and spleen’ in 1832. The disease was named after him by Samuel Wilks, who published a further description in 1856. The Reed–Sternberg cell (now termed Hodgkin–Reed –Sternberg cell) was then independently described by Dorothy Reed and Carl Sternberg, in the early 1900s.</p>
<p>Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is relatively rare, and accounts for less than 1% of all new cancers in the UK. There are two peak ages of incidence, in the 20s and 70s. As such, HL is one of the most common cancers in adolescents and young adults. The incidence of HL has remained remarkably constant over the last 30 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1755738013475435">Cancer Research UK, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>HLs are broadly divided into classic HL (95%) and nodular lymphocyte-predominant HL (5%). Classic HL includes the nodular sclerosing and mixed-cellularity types. These share histological and immunophenotypic characteristics, and typically have the Hodgkin–Reed–Sternberg cell. The nodular-lymphocyte predominant type is characterised by the expression of CD20, a mature B-cell antigen, and behaves as an indolent B-cell NHL.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1755738013475435"><title>Pathophysiology</title>
<p>A detailed discussion of the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of lymphoma is beyond the scope of this article but the development of lymphoma is associated with a wide variety of acquired genetic abnormalities and micro-organisms. These tend to be specific to histological subtypes. The Epstein–Barr virus, for instance, is associated (although not invariably) with classic HL, endemic Burkitt's lymphoma, plasmablastic lymphoma and nasopharyngeal T/NK-cell lymphoma. Other specific aetiological agents include <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> infection in gastric marginal zone lymphoma.</p>
<p>Some disorders, for instance Burkitt's lymphoma and follicular lymphoma, are associated with specific gene mutations. Mutations involving the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus on chromosome 14q32 are common in B-cell lymphomas (Swerdlow et al., 2008). Chronic immunosuppressive states are associated with the development of HL and high-grade B-cell lymphomas. These are due either to chronic antigenic stimulation or unchecked proliferation of hitherto latent viruses, in particular the Epstein—Barr virus. Patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, allogeneic transplant recipients, and congenital and acquired immunodeficiency states are amongst those at risk.</p>
<p>Many of the mechanisms underlying the development of lymphomas remain to be elucidated. However, there has been a recent proliferation in the knowledge of the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms of these diseases, and it is anticipated that new therapeutic modalities will emerge from this work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1755738013475435">Foon et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1755738013475435"><title>Clinical features</title>
<p>While painless lymphadenopathy remains the most common mode of presentation for most lymphomas, many patients present with non-specific symptoms such as malaise, lethargy and pruritus. Classic ‘B’ symptoms are present in a minority of patients, usually those with advanced stage disease. These are defined as weight loss of greater than 10% of body mass over the preceding 6 months, persistent unexplained fever or persistent drenching night sweats. Pruritus, whilst not regarded as a ‘B’ symptom, can also be a presenting symptom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1755738013475435">Mauch, 2011</xref>). Drenching night sweats and weight loss may signify more rapidly proliferative disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1755738013475435">National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), 2005a</xref>). Non-specific symptoms may result in delays in diagnosis.</p>
<p>Patients may also present with symptoms associated with specific sites of disease, such as abdominal pain caused by abdominal nodes, and neurological sequelae caused by central nervous disease. Para-neoplastic phenomena, such as peripheral neuropathy, autoimmune disease and skin disease, can occur. In addition, each disease group tends to have its own characteristic modes of presentation. These are discussed briefly in the following sections.</p>
<sec id="sec7-1755738013475435"><title>Hodgkin's lymphoma</title>
<p>The majority of patients with HL present with painless asymptomatic lymphadenopathy. The most common sites of lymphadenopathy at presentation are the neck and axillae. Other common modes of presentation include symptoms caused by the presence of mediastinal masses, such as cough, breathlessness and retrosternal pain. Alcohol-induced pain is rare but is a highly specific symptom.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1755738013475435"><title>High-grade B-cell NHL</title>
<p>Patients with high-grade B-cell NHL most commonly present with rapidly enlarging lymphadenopathy, with or without constitutional symptoms. Extranodal involvement is common. Patients with very rapidly proliferative disease (typically those with Burkitt's lymphoma) may present with spontaneous acute tumour lysis syndrome (release of intracellular ions and uric acid due to spontaneous or treatment-induced apoptosis of malignant cells, which can cause acute renal failure or life-threatening electrolyte abnormalities).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-1755738013475435"><title>Low-grade B-cell NHL</title>
<p>Low-grade B-cell NHL generally runs an indolent or relapsing/remitting course. The majority of patients present with asymptomatic lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly or cytopenias. Systemic symptoms are relatively uncommon. On occasion, patients may present with large masses from which they were previously asymptomatic.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-1755738013475435"><title>Systemic T-cell NHL</title>
<p>Systemic T-cell NHL can behave either aggressively, or follow more indolent disease courses. The mode of presentation tends to reflect the rate of growth, and can therefore either mimic the presentation of high- or low-grade B-cell lymphoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1755738013475435">Freedman et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-1755738013475435"><title>Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma</title>
<p>Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma presents with skin disease of varying severity and degree of involvement. Some patients may present with systemic involvement, particularly later in the course of disease (Swerdlow et al., 2008).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec12-1755738013475435"><title>Assessment in primary care</title>
<p>General practitioners have a vital role in identifying possible lymphoma at an early stage so as not to delay diagnosis and treatment. Unfortunately, lymphoma can present with many non-specific symptoms, presenting significant challenges to diagnosis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec13-1755738013475435"><title>Clinical</title>
<p>Clinical assessment should include a history, specifically aimed at eliciting the presence of ‘B'symptoms or other constitutional symptoms suggestive of a lymphoma. A history of autoimmune disease, chronic immunosuppression, HIV infection and family history of lymphoma should be sought. Clinical examination should incorporate all major lymph node groups in the neck, axillae and groins, and palpation of the abdomen for masses and hepatosplenomegaly.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec14-1755738013475435"><title>Baseline laboratory investigations</title>
<p>Baseline investigations include a full blood count and film, which may reveal a lymphocytosis or cytopenias, and ESR. Other investigations may include serum biochemistry, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), serum urate, serum immunoglobulins and protein electrophoresis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1755738013475435">Freeman &amp; Freidberg, 2012</xref>). Findings which may signify the presence of an underlying lymphoma are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1755738013475435">Box 2</xref>. A plain chest radiograph may also be useful in patients with neck nodes or chest symptoms, but should not delay referral.

<sec id="sec15-1755738013475435"><title>Referral</title>
<p>If there are any clinical, laboratory or radiological features that are suspicious for lymphoma refer for urgent specialist review . Where an obviously palpable node is present, referral to the relevant surgical speciality for biopsy (e.g. ear, nose and throat for neck nodes, general surgery for axillary or groin nodes) is appropriate. However, when there is a lymphocytosis, or lymphadenopathy is either impalpable or of low volume, referral to haematology is indicated. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1755738013475435">Box 3</xref> summarises the current NICE guidance on referral (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1755738013475435">NICE, 2005a</xref>).

<sec id="sec17-1755738013475435"><title>Assessment in secondary care</title>
<p>It is important that GPs are aware of what may happen to their patients once they have been referred. An understanding of this process helps GPs to facilitate appropriate support during the different stages of the patient's journey.</p>
<sec id="sec18-1755738013475435"><title>Diagnosis</title>
<p>Assessment in secondary care incorporates further clinical assessment and blood tests. If indicated, investigations aimed at establishing a formal histological diagnosis should take place as soon as is feasible. This may be guided either by clinical examination or imaging. In practice, the test of choice will be a lymph node or solid organ biopsy, or less commonly, a bone marrow biopsy. Fine needle aspiration is usually unreliable either for diagnosis or subtyping. As such, tissue biopsy is always recommended (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1755738013475435">British Committee for Standards in Haematology, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Any tissue sent for cytological or histological examination should also routinely be considered for cytogenetic and/or molecular genetic analysis. In addition, if clinical, laboratory, or imaging assessment suggests an infective aetiology, any tissue obtained should also be sent for culture (including mycobacterial culture if appropriate).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec19-1755738013475435"><title>Staging</title>
<p>The most widely adopted staging system for most lymphomas remains the Ann Arbor system. As a general rule, stage does correlate with outcomes, although additional variables also provide valuable prognostic information. In brief, the Ann Arbor stages are:
<list id="list9-1755738013475435" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Stage I: Involvement of a single lymph node or single extranodal site or single extralymphatic site (stage I<sub>E</sub>)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Stage 2: Involvement of two or more lymph nodes on the same side of the diaphragm or of one lymph node region and a contiguous extranodal site (stage 2<sub>E</sub>)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Stage 3: Involvement of lymph nodes on both sides of the diaphragm, which may include the spleen (stage 3<sub>S</sub>) or a single contiguous extranodal site (stage 3<sub>E</sub>)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Stage 4: Extranodal disease</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>The absence of ‘B’ symptoms is signified by the addition of the letter ‘A’. The suffix ‘X’ is added for bulky disease (greater than 10 cm diameter). For example, therefore, a patient with nodes above and below the diaphragm without ‘B’ symptoms is described as having stage 3A disease.</p>
<p>All patients with proven diagnoses of lymphoma should undergo staging investigations appropriate to their disease type or subtype. These generally include imaging techniques such as contrast-enhanced computerised tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography-CT (PET-CT), and bone marrow biopsy. In addition, in select circumstances, additional tests such as lumbar puncture and magnetic resonance imaging may be appropriate. Other investigations which may be indicated include HIV testing in patients with HL and high- grade NHL, and investigations geared toward assessing fitness for treatment, such as echocardiography in patients about to undergo anthracycline-based chemotherapy.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec20-1755738013475435"><title>Treatment</title>
<sec id="sec21-1755738013475435"><title>The multi-disciplinary team</title>
<p>All treatment decisions at diagnosis and relapse should be made within the context of the multi-disciplinary team (MDT), which reviews all diagnoses and formulates treatment plans. In addition to providing a ‘quality control’ mechanism, MDT meetings facilitate communication. Furthermore, the introduction of the ‘key-worker’ (in practice, usually the Clinical Nurse Specialist), who must be an integral part of the MDT structure and process, ensures that patients have a focal point of contact within the team, and have an accessible team member for advice and information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1755738013475435">NICE, 2003</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec22-1755738013475435"><title>Treatment</title>
<p>Treatment can either aim to cure, prolong life, or palliate. The decision as to whether treatment is indicated, and the modality and type of treatment, depends on a number of factors. These include:
<list id="list10-1755738013475435" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The disease subtype</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Presence or absence of symptoms or organ damage (such as bone marrow failure)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Patient fitness or performance status</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Extent of disease – for example, patients with localised disease may be considered solely for local treatment</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Fertility preservation – cytotoxic chemotherapy has the potential to render patients infertile or subfertile. Sperm cryopreservation should be offered to all male patients, and oocyte cryopreservation to female patients of child-bearing age when time allows</p></list-item>

<p>Asymptomatic patients with low-grade lymphomas are observed until they become symptomatic or develop organ damage. While there are ongoing prospective trials of treating asymptomatic patients, the standard of care at present remains active monitoring.</p>
<p>The mainstay of treatment for other groups is either combination cytotoxic chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Chemotherapy can either be curative (as in classical HL or high-grade NHL), or palliative (albeit life-prolonging, as in low-grade NHL or cutaneous T-cell lymphoma). Chemotherapy is usually given in cycles (i.e. a predictable length of time in- between each treatment) and may be given orally, parenterally or a combination of the two.</p>
<p>The majority of treatment side-effects of cytotoxic chemotherapy are predictable, and are generally related to the intensity of treatment used. Patients should be counselled in detail as to these, and given written information. Patients should also be given chemotherapy alert cards, as well as given departmental contact details for information and emergency care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1755738013475435">National Patient Safety Agency, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Radiotherapy is either given on its own or as part of combined modality treatment, and has the potential to provide very good local disease control or cure. Radiation oncologists should be part of MDT decision-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1755738013475435">NICE, 2003</xref>). Side-effects of radiotherapy are generally related to the site of treatment and dosage given.</p>
<p>There is much interest at present in targeted therapies and risk-adapted therapies. Examples of targeted therapies include monoclonal antibodies, epigenetic regulators and protein kinase inhibitors. These may either used on their own, or in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy. A good example of this is the use of the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab, which has greatly improved outcomes in patients with B-cell malignancies. Risk-adapted therapy aims to tailor treatment according to currently available prognostic tools, with the intention of reducing long-term side-effects in patients in with good-risk disease, and escalating treatment in patients with high-risk disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1755738013475435">Hodgson, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Stem cell transplantation is generally used in relapsed or refractory disease, and can be curative. Immune reconstitution following allogeneic stem cell transplant can take many months, and patients remain at risk of opportunistic infections for at least 12 months following transplant.</p>
<p>The GP has a crucial role in the supportive care of patients. An example of this includes administering appropriate vaccinations, such as the seasonal influenza vaccination and pneumonococcal vaccination. These elements should be communicated from the treating haematology team to primary care. Equally GPs should act as advocates on behalf of their patients if there are details that the hospital team may have overlooked.</p>

<sec id="sec23-1755738013475435"><title>Clinical trials</title>
<p>Clinical research is an integral part of haemato-oncology practice, and the UK has been at the forefront of multi-centre collaborative trials since the early 1970s. Clinical trials have led to significant improvements in outcomes in a variety of haematological malignancies, and as such, participation in clinical trials is encouraged. Clinical trials are governed by the International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice codes, and the ethics and governance structures around modern clinical trials are highly rigorous. In light of this, patients should not be disadvantaged in any way by consenting to entering into clinical trials, and it is good practice to offer all eligible patients entry into clinical trials. Primary care physicians should be notified when patients are entered into clinical trials.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec24-1755738013475435"><title>Treatment side-effects relevant to primary care</title>
<p>The majority of chemotherapy side-effects are reasonably well-tolerated and self-limiting. The complication most likely to cause major morbidity and mortality is infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1755738013475435">National Confidential Enquiry into Patient Outcome and Death, 2008</xref>). Neutropenia is not the only mechanism of immune compromise in haemato-oncology patients. As such, an unwell or febrile patient presenting in primary care should at least be discussed with the patient's haematology/oncology team, and may need admission irrespective of neutrophil count. From this perspective, having access to the local haematology/oncology unit's admission policy is useful. Patient's may have a written care plan at home, in the event that they become unwell.</p>
<p>Patients, and particularly younger patients, are at risk of long-term complications of therapy. These are numerous, and include secondary malignancies (haemic, skin, lung, breast), and endocrine complications such as primary gonadal failure or cardiac dysfunction. These should be considered in patients presenting with non-specific symptoms months or years after completion of treatment for their lymphoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1755738013475435">Davids &amp; Fisher, 2012</xref>). In addition, monitoring for late relapses is mandatory, though most haematology/oncology units will have policies in place for follow-up and discharge. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1755738013475435">Box 5</xref> summarises some of these complications.

<sec id="sec25-1755738013475435"><title>Supportive care</title>
<p>A variety of supportive measures are used to improve patients' tolerance of treatment and reduce the risk of complications. These include the use of antimicrobial prophylaxis, anti-emetics, laxatives and recombinant human granulocyte stimulating factors. The nature of these agents and the timing and duration of administration are usually regimen-specific. In addition, most units will have their own protocols for administration, which should be communicated to primary care teams at the onset of therapy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec26-1755738013475435"><title>Psycho-social support</title>
<p>A diagnosis of cancer is invariably a distressing time for patients and carers. Many will experience significant psychological morbidity after diagnosis, which can persist for many months or years even after completion of treatment. Referral to appropriate counselling or psychology services is strongly encouraged in this setting. Many haematology/oncology units have access to trained counsellors and clinical psychologists with specific expertise in cancer. It is also, however, imperative to exclude potentially treatable medical causes such as endocrine dysfunction.</p>
<p>In many instances psychological morbidity may be related to loss of income and consequent financial difficulties. Referral to benefits counselling services, such as those offered by Macmillan, is recommended (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1755738013475435">NICE, 2004</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec27-1755738013475435"><title>Palliative care</title>
<p>An integral part of the ‘journey’ of many cancer patients is the need for symptom control. This may either be required in conjunction with their cancer therapy, or at the end of life. Good communication between secondary and primary care is essential to ensuring that patients' symptoms needs are adequately addressed, particularly at the end of life. This may entail the involvement of specialist palliative care teams, particularly when a transition from hospital-based care to community care is planned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1755738013475435">NICE, 2004</xref>). The Gold Standards Framework (GSF) is a useful resource aimed at improving the ability of generalist healthcare workers to deliver end-of-life care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1755738013475435">GSF, 2012</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec28-1755738013475435"><title>Young people with cancer</title>
<p>Finally, an important and complex aspect of adult haemato-oncology practice is the treatment of teenagers and young adults (TYAs, by definition aged between 16 and 24). These are a relatively small group of patients, but often have complex psycho-social needs. Many patients with lymphomas in this age group will be cured of their disease and may be at risk of long-term treatment complications. As such, appropriate long-term follow-up arrangements are crucial. These patients should be offered the option of treatment in centres with TYA expertise. Treatment plans should be discussed at specialist TYA multidisciplinary team meeting, and robust provisions for additional psycho-social supportive measures should be in place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1755738013475435">NICE, 2005b</xref>). The Teenage Cancer Trust is a helpful source of information and guidance.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec29-1755738013475435"><title>Prognosis</title>
<p>Prognosis depends on many variables, including disease type and stage. In addition, many lymphomas have tools to aid pre-treatment prognostication, though few of these at present influence choice of therapy. These include, for example, the International Prognostic Indices for HL, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma. Classic HL and high-grade lymphomas, even those presenting with advanced stage disease, are curable.</p>
<p>An example of the utility of stage and prognostic indices is in classical HL, where patients with limited stage disease without adverse prognostic features have greater than 95% chance of cure, whereas that figure drops considerably to around 50% in patients with advanced stage disease and adverse prognostic features. Low-grade B-cell lymphomas remain incurable, but advances in treatment have improved survival in these diseases too, particularly in patients with advanced stage disease. The prognosis from lymphomas is expected to continue to improve further as new developments in targeted therapies emerge.</p>
