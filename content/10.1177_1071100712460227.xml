<title>Background:</title>
<p>Osteotomies of the fifth metatarsal may disrupt the nutrient artery and result in nonunion. The location of the nutrient artery foramen relative to the location of common osteotomies has not been described. The goal of this study was to describe the vascular supply of the proximal fifth metatarsal, including the artery of origin of the nutrient artery and the location of the nutrient artery foramen.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1071100712460227">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>Fifty-six adult cadaver specimens were amputated below the knee. The anterior tibial, posterior tibial, and peroneal arteries were injected with India ink and Ward’s Blue Latex. The specimens were frozen for 48 hours and then thawed to room temperature. The soft tissues were débrided with sodium hypochlorite, and the extraosseous vascularity was recorded. The fifth metatarsal was then removed and the intraosseous vascular anatomy elucidated using a modified Spälteholz technique.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1071100712460227">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>The dorsalis pedis, posterior tibial, and peroneal arteries branch in predictable patterns to supply the fifth metatarsal. The nutrient artery arose from the fourth plantar metatarsal artery in 100% of specimens and inserted into the plantar medial diaphysis in 83% of specimens. The nutrient artery foramen was an average of 26.8 mm (range, 19-40) from the medial aspect of the base of the fifth metatarsal.</p>

<body>
<p>Bunionette deformities of the fifth ray, although less common than hallux valgus deformities, can cause similar symptoms of pain and difficulty with shoe wear. When conservative treatment measures fail, operative interventions, including corrective osteotomies, are indicated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1071100712460227">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1071100712460227">11</xref></sup> Bunionette deformities are typically classified into 3 types.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1071100712460227">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1071100712460227">5</xref></sup> Type 1 bunionette deformities are characterized by an enlarged fifth metatarsal head. These are typically treated with a distal chevron or sliding oblique osteotomy and medial capsular release.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1071100712460227">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1071100712460227">9</xref></sup> Type 2 bunionette deformities involve a lateral bowing of the fifth metatarsal neck and head. Distal or midshaft osteotomies of the metatarsal have been described for treatment of this type of deformity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1071100712460227">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1071100712460227">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1071100712460227">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1071100712460227">19</xref></sup> Type 3 bunionette deformities, characterized by an increase in the 4-5 intermetatarsal angle, can be more difficult to correct. In a severe type 3 bunionette deformity, similar to severe hallux valgus deformities, adequate correction cannot always be achieved with a distal osteotomy alone. Many surgeons are wary of proximal osteotomies in the fifth metatarsal, however, owing to concerns about the vascular status of the proximal bone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1071100712460227">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1071100712460227">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Several proximal osteotomies of the fifth metatarsal have been described. A transverse opening-wedge osteotomy of the base of the fifth metatarsal has been described but is considered high risk for nonunion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1071100712460227">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1071100712460227">6</xref></sup> A closing-wedge osteotomy of the base of the fifth metatarsal was first described early in the 20th century. Shrum et al wrote a detailed operative technique guide in 1989 describing placement on the medial side of the proximal diaphyseal-metaphyseal junction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1071100712460227">17</xref></sup> In 1987, Diebold and Bejjani described a proximal chevron osteotomy placed 1 cm distal to the insertion of the peroneus brevis in the metaphysis of the proximal fifth metatarsal.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1071100712460227">3</xref></sup> They reported good results with this technique at a minimum of 3 years but acknowledged the risk of nonunion of fractures in this region of the bone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1071100712460227">2</xref></sup> More recently, Okuda et al described a proximal dome osteotomy placed in the proximal third of the diaphysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1071100712460227">13</xref></sup> The authors reported outcome on 10 patients and noted delayed union in 3. Recognizing the risk of nonunion in proximal osteotomies, Coughlin described a long oblique diaphyseal osteotomy extending from the dorsal proximal diaphyseal-metaphyseal junction to plantar distal diaphyseal-metaphyseal junction. This oblique diaphyseal osteotomy is not traditionally considered at high risk for nonunion, but the proximal extent of the osteotomy may place the primary blood supply at risk.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1071100712460227">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Since the first reports of nonunion developing in the proximal fifth metatarsal, several studies have reported on the blood flow to this region. In a study of 20 cadaveric specimens, Shereff et al reported that a nutrient artery entered the medial aspect of the bone at the junction of the proximal and middle thirds.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1071100712460227">16</xref></sup> The nutrient artery entered through an oblique foramen, then divided into a branch running distally in the diaphysis and a branch running retrograde to provide blood flow to the proximal metaphysis. Smith et al reported similar findings in 10 cadaveric specimens.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1071100712460227">18</xref></sup> Due to technical limitations, these studies were unable to determine the origin of the nutrient artery.</p>
<p>In a plastination study of 22 cadaver specimens, Rath et al reported that the nutrient artery arose from the lateral plantar artery in 50% of specimens, the fourth dorsal metatarsal artery in 40.9% of specimens, the fourth plantar metatarsal artery in 4.6% of specimens, and the arcuata artery in 4.6% of specimens. These findings suggest that 50% of the nutrient arteries entered the bone from the lateral aspect, contradicting the findings in the previous 2 studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1071100712460227">14</xref></sup> In addition, none of these 3 studies reported an objective distance between the nutrient artery foramen and the base of the metatarsal.</p>
<p>When correcting type 2 and type 3 bunionette deformities, knowledge of the exact location of the nutrient artery entry point would be beneficial to allow for the most proximal osteotomy possible without disrupting the blood supply from the nutrient artery to the watershed zone in the proximal metaphysis. The goals of this study were to determine the origin of the nutrient artery and the distance from the metatarsal base at the articular surface to the nutrient artery foramen in the diaphysis. The location of the nutrient artery and the implications for diaphyseal osteotomies were also explored.</p>
<sec id="section6-1071100712460227" sec-type="materials|methods">
<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>Twenty-eight pairs of legs from adult human cadavers were obtained from a university-associated body donation program. Only cadavers that had died within 72 hours and had not been frozen or embalmed were accepted. Cadavers with evidence of prior foot or ankle trauma, surgery, deformity, or congenital abnormalities were excluded.</p>
<p>The legs were amputated below the knee at the junction of the proximal and middle thirds of the tibial shaft. Skin incisions were also made on the dorsum and plantar surface of each toe at the level of the proximal interphalangeal joint. The anterior tibial, popliteal, and posterior tibial arteries were each cannulated with an 8-French triple lumen catheter and injected with saline until the effluent from the toes was clear. Any obvious atherosclerosis of the vessels at the level of the amputation was noted. India ink was then injected into each artery under constant manual pressure until staining was obvious on the cutaneous surface of the foot and the ink flowed out of the skin incisions on the toes. Ward’s Blue Latex was then injected in a similar fashion.</p>
<p>The specimens were then frozen for at least 48 hours and subsequently removed from the freezer and allowed to thaw at room temperature for 48 hours. Once fully thawed, the specimens were amputated through the tibia 5 cm proximal to the ankle joint, and the toes were amputated at the metatarsophalangeal joints. The skin and subcutaneous tissues were sharply dissected away, and the specimens were submerged in 6% sodium hypochlorite for 4-6 hours to complete the debridement of the soft tissues. The specimens were checked every 30 minutes, and the sodium hypochlorite was refreshed as needed. The debridement process was stopped once the soft tissues had débrided adequately to allow examination of the vessels and bones. Although the vessel walls were débrided with the sodium hypochlorite, casts of the vessel lumens filled by the Ward’s Blue Latex remained. At this point, the extraosseous vascular supply to the base of the fifth metatarsal was carefully examined, documented, and photographed.</p>
<p>Once the extraosseous vascular supply was documented, the fifth metatarsal was removed from 53 specimens, and any residual soft tissue on the bone was sharply dissected away. The fifth metatarsal was then decalcified and dehydrated using a modified Spälteholz technique. The fifth metatarsal was placed into 100% formalin for 24 hours, then washed in a water bath for 1 hour, and placed into 30% formic acid. The formic acid solution was changed twice weekly for 3 weeks to completely decalcify the bone. After 3 weeks of submersion in 30% formic acid, the fifth metatarsal was again washed in a water bath for 1 hour and placed into 30% hydrogen peroxide for 72 hours. The bone was then dehydrated by placing it into 70% ethanol for 1 day, 90% ethanol for 1 day, and 100% ethanol in a vacuum environment for 1 week. Following the dehydration process, the fifth metatarsal was placed in chloroform for 72 hours, then into methyl salicylate until the bone appeared translucent, usually 24 hours. Once the fifth metatarsal appeared translucent, the intraosseous vascular supply outlined by the India ink was examined, documented, and photographed.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Branches from the dorsalis pedis artery, the posterior tibial artery, and the peroneal artery all contribute to the vascular supply of the proximal fifth metatarsal. The lateral tarsal branch of the dorsalis pedis artery terminates at the level of the proximal epiphysis of the fifth metatarsal. The terminal branches penetrate the bone at this level, contributing to the rich intraosseous blood supply seen in the proximal epiphysis. Terminal branches of the lateral tarsal artery also form an anastomotic network with plantar vessels arising from the posterior tibial circulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1071100712460227">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1071100712460227">2</xref>).</p>

<p>The posterior tibial artery divided into a lateral and medial plantar artery at the level of the calcaneus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1071100712460227">Figure 3</xref>). The lateral plantar artery traveled along the lateral plantar surface of the foot and provided small branches to the proximal fifth metatarsal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1071100712460227">Figure 4</xref>). The terminal branches in this area also anastomosed with the terminal branches of the lateral tarsal artery from the dorsalis pedis circulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1071100712460227">Figure 2</xref>). The fourth metatarsal plantar artery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1071100712460227">Figure 4</xref>) arose from the lateral plantar artery and traveled along the medial surface of the fifth metatarsal diaphysis. In 26 of the 56 specimens (46.4%), a previously described fibular plantar superficial artery branched from the lateral plantar artery and ran along the lateral diaphysis of the fifth metatarsal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1071100712460227">15</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1071100712460227">Figure 5</xref>).</p>

<p>The contribution of the peroneal artery to the vascular supply of the fifth metatarsal was less prominent than the supply from the dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial arteries. However, terminal branches of the peroneal arteries also formed an important part of the anastomotic network around the base of the fifth metatarsal that made up of the terminal branches from the dorsal pedis circulation and the posterior tibial circulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1071100712460227">Figure 6</xref>).</p>

<p>The intraosseous blood supply seen in our series confirmed the previously described watershed zone in the proximal metaphysis of the fifth metatarsal. A discrete nutrient artery inserting into the proximal diaphysis with retrograde branches running to the metaphysis was visualized in all specimens. In each specimen, including the specimens with a fibular plantar superficial artery on the lateral side of the diaphysis, the nutrient artery arose from the fourth plantar metatarsal artery, which ran directly on the medial aspect of the fifth metatarsal diaphysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1071100712460227">Figures 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1071100712460227">8</xref>).</p>

<p>The nutrient artery entered the bone via a foramen on the diaphysis in each specimen. In 44 of the 53 specimens (83.0%), the nutrient artery entered the diaphysis from the plantar medial aspect of the bone. In 6 specimens (11.3%), the nutrient artery entered directly from the medial aspect of the bone, and in 3 specimens (5.7%), the nutrient artery entered directly plantar. The distance of each nutrient artery entry point was measured from the most medial aspect of the metatarsal base (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1071100712460227">Figure 8</xref>). The average distance was 26.8 mm (range, 19-40 mm).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results of this study support the findings of Smith et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1071100712460227">18</xref></sup> and Shereff et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1071100712460227">16</xref></sup> and demonstrate that the nutrient artery of the fifth metatarsal enters the diaphysis from the medial aspect. In this study, the nutrient artery arose from the fourth plantar metatarsal artery in 100% of the specimens, in contrast to some previous descriptions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1071100712460227">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>The location of the nutrient artery in the fifth metatarsal is important when planning a corrective osteotomy for a bunionette deformity. In this study, the nutrient artery insertion was seen as distal as 40 mm from the medial aspect of the base of the fifth metatarsal, although the average distance was 26.8 mm from the base. Proximal osteotomies carry the highest risk of nonunion given their proximity to the nutrient artery. However, long diaphyseal osteotomies will also place the artery at risk in individuals with an entry point at the more distal measurements seen in this study (40 mm). In general, care should be taken to avoid this region during osteotomy placement to preserve the blood supply to the proximal bone and avoid a nonunion of the osteotomy site. Approaches to the bone and bone preparation for osteotomy should also take into consideration the medial-plantar entry point of the nutrient artery to avoid disruption at the time of surgery. Similarly, approaches to the bone in the fixation of fifth metatarsal fractures carry the same risk of injury to the nutrient artery.</p>
<p>While the Spälteholz method is a powerful tool for studying small vessels and intraosseous anatomy, there are several limitations. First, as with any anatomic study, this method is limited by the quality of the specimens. Any specimen with atherosclerotic disease or peripheral edema with dilated vessels could confound study results. The method is also limited by the number of cadaveric specimens studied. There may be other, less common patterns of vascularity that this study did not identify due to a limited sample size.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This study verified the results of previous studies describing a watershed area of the blood supply of the proximal fifth metatarsal area and the presence of a single nutrient vessel that enters the diaphysis to supply retrograde branches to the proximal metaphysis. In our study, 100% of the nutrient arteries arose from the fourth plantar metatarsal artery. This analysis provides quantitative data regarding the location of the nutrient artery foramen, which was located on the plantar medial aspect in 83% of specimens and an average of 26.8 mm from the medial aspect of the base of the fifth metatarsal. We anticipate that this data will be helpful for surgeons while planning operative approaches to the fifth metatarsal for correction of a bunionette deformity or fracture fixation.</p>
