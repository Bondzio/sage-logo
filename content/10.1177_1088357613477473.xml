<abstract>
<p>We investigated the effectiveness of using constant time delay (CTD) with young adults with intellectual disability on their vocabulary acquisition and retention, as well as expository reading comprehension. Four learners, ages 19 to 21 years, from a postsecondary education program for individuals with disabilities participated in the study. During the intervention, instructors used CTD to teach unknown vocabulary embedded in expository texts. In the context of an alternating treatments design, we found that CTD resulted in greater acquisition and retention of the vocabulary knowledge than the control condition. However, the effects of the vocabulary instruction on comprehension of the expository texts were less clear. Implications for practice are provided.</p>

<body>
<p>As technology advances, American society has an increasing demand for individuals who have a postsecondary education. In comparison with 20% of the jobs requiring at least some college education in 1959, the number has increased to 56% in 2000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1088357613477473">Carnevale &amp; Fry, 2000</xref>). Along with the growing emphasis on postsecondary education, enrollment of students with disabilities in postsecondary education has become more prevalent. Results from the National Longitudinal Transition Study-2 (NLTS2) indicate that 45.6% of young adults with disabilities received a postsecondary education in 2005, a 19.3% increase relative to 1990 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1088357613477473">Wagner, Newman, Cameto, &amp; Levine, 2005</xref>). However, young adults with intellectual disability continued to be the least likely to participate in postsecondary education. As a result, these individuals are not likely to benefit from occupations that offer opportunities for advancement and financial security (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1088357613477473">Wagner et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>One of the factors that leads to low enrollment of young adults with intellectual disability in postsecondary education is their limited academic skills, particularly in the area of reading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1088357613477473">Browder, Wakeman, Spooner, Ahlgrim-Delzell, &amp; Algozzine, 2006</xref>). Traditionally, academic skills are not the focus of instruction for learners with intellectual disability because educators incorrectly assume that these learners cannot learn to read (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1088357613477473">Allor, Mathes, Roberts, Jones, &amp; Champlin, 2010</xref>). Approximate 80% of children with mild or moderate intellectual disability do not have even minimal literacy skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1088357613477473">Katims, 2001</xref>). It is not surprising that learners with intellectual disability therefore continue to struggle with reading when they enter the postsecondary education setting. Moreover, expository reading materials, the most common type of text that learners are expected to comprehend at the postsecondary level, pose additional challenges to these learners. Different from narrative texts, the purpose of which is to tell a story, expository texts are meant to be knowledge-based and dense with unfamiliar ideas so that readers may learn something from reading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1088357613477473">Baker, Gersten, &amp; Grossen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1088357613477473">Weaver &amp; Kintsch, 1991/1996</xref>). Comprehension of expository text is considered an essential skill as most reading that adults find necessary to succeed at work and everyday life involves expository text (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1088357613477473">Stanovich, 1994</xref>). Unfortunately, comprehension of expository text is more difficult than narrative text (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1088357613477473">Baker et al., 2002</xref>). It is estimated that approximately 27 million Americans adults, the majority of them individuals with disabilities, do not have proficient literacy skills to acquire information from such educational materials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1088357613477473">Williams, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>One aspect of reading that appears to be a barrier to successful comprehension of expository text is the frequent occurrence of unknown vocabularies embedded in the texts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1088357613477473">Kucan &amp; Beck, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1088357613477473">Lapp, Flood, &amp; Ranck-Buhr, 1995</xref>). Vocabulary knowledge is an essential component of reading and is correlated with reading comprehension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1088357613477473">National Reading Panel, 2000</xref>). Researchers suggest that vocabulary size and speed of access to vocabulary knowledge affect reading comprehension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1088357613477473">Beck &amp; Mckeown, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1088357613477473">Stanovich, 1986</xref>). Typically, learners with intellectual disability tend to have an inadequate exposure to basic vocabulary terms and inefficient working memory to process word meanings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1088357613477473">Browder &amp; Xin, 1998</xref>). Vocabularies found in expository text are especially difficult to comprehend because they are more likely to be information-packed “long nouns” that represent unfamiliar abstract concepts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1088357613477473">Fang, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1088357613477473">Horn, 2010</xref>). Consequently, struggling readers are less likely to comprehend text containing these words and learn from what they have read.</p>
<p>Although the importance of vocabulary to expository text reading comprehension is unequivocal, research in the area of vocabulary instruction and comprehension of expository text for postsecondary students with intellectual disability is sparse and unable to guide practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1088357613477473">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2004</xref>). Comprehensive reviews of professional literature regarding reading instruction for learners with intellectual disability ranging from mild to moderate and severe intellectual impairment did not reveal any studies that addressed vocabulary knowledge as a means to derive meaning from connected text (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1088357613477473">Browder et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1088357613477473">Joseph &amp; Seery, 2004</xref>). Most of the work focused on identification of sight words in the context of functional activities (e.g., grocery shopping, preparing for a recipe). Based on the available empirical evidence, researchers found that effective sight word instruction for learners with intellectual disability should include systematic prompting and fading with frequent practice opportunities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1088357613477473">Browder, Trela, Gibbs, Wakeman, &amp; Harris, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1088357613477473">Waugh, Alberto, &amp; Fredrick, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>One sight word instructional procedure based on these principles, which has an extensive research base, is constant time delay (CTD). CTD is typically implemented by first pairing the stimulus (e.g., sight word on a flashcard) with a teacher response (e.g., teacher says the word or picks a picture representing the word) with 0-s time delay. Systematically, the teacher prompts student responses using a fixed-time interval of delay after the presentation of the stimulus (e.g., wait 3 s before telling student the correct response). This teaching procedure continues until the student makes a correct response within the fixed-time interval without teacher prompts. Researchers found that CTD is an effective sight word instruction procedure for students with intellectual disability in areas including matching words with pictures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1088357613477473">Alig-Cybriwsky, Wolery, &amp; Gast, 1990</xref>), using words in functional daily activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1088357613477473">Collins &amp; Griffen, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1088357613477473">Dogoe, Banda, Lock, &amp; Feinstein, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1088357613477473">Kennedy, Itkonen, &amp; Lindquist, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1088357613477473">Lalli &amp; Browder, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1088357613477473">Smith, Schuster, Collins, &amp; Kleinert, 2011</xref>), and comprehension of sight words in community settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1088357613477473">Gast, Wolery, Morris, Doyle, &amp; Meyer, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1088357613477473">Schloss et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1088357613477473">Wolery, Werts, Snyder, &amp; Caldwell, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>Although the utility of CTD as an intervention designed to teach vocabulary knowledge in expository text to young adults with intellectual disability is yet to be proven, CTD has been shown to be an effective vocabulary instructional method for school-age children with learning disabilities. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1088357613477473">Schuster, Stevens, and Doak (1990)</xref> taught 10 word definitions to three elementary students with learning disabilities using a 5-s CTD procedure. Schuster and colleagues found that all three students learned and retained the definitions of the 10 target words after receiving intervention. In addition, the students generalized the acquired vocabulary knowledge to skills that were not taught during the intervention (i.e., when given a definition, the student correctly identified the target word).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1088357613477473">Alberto, Waugh, and Fredrick (2010)</xref> investigated the effects of the sight word instruction on connected text reading of school-age children with intellectual disability. After receiving sight word instruction with modeling and systematic prompting, participants of the study generalized the word knowledge to reading of connected texts that are typically found in the community and leisure reading materials. Therefore, it is possible that educators can teach learners with intellectual disability knowledge of vocabularies embedded in the expository text and improve their reading comprehension. However, we cannot assume that this intervention will be equally effective with older learners who have intellectual disability for several reasons. First, adult learners with intellectual disability may have characteristics that affect the effectiveness of the intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1088357613477473">Edmonds et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1088357613477473">Kruidenier, 2002</xref>). Researchers suggest that to make meaningful gains in reading, individuals with intellectual disability require more intense repetition and practice than learners with mild disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1088357613477473">Conners, Atwell, Rosenquist, &amp; Slight, 2001</xref>). Due to their unsuccessful learning history in reading, adults with intellectual disability may become more resistant to academic intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1088357613477473">Allor et al., 2010</xref>). Second, interventions developed to address vocabulary learning and comprehension needs of narrative texts may not be as effective with expository texts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1088357613477473">Bos &amp; Tierney, 1984</xref>). Therefore, we decided to investigate the effects of vocabulary instruction on word knowledge and comprehension of expository text for young adults with intellectual disability. Specifically, we asked the following questions:</p>

<title>Participants and Setting</title>
<p>Four participants with intellectual disability participated in the study. At the time of the study, all four participants were enrolled in a postsecondary education program for young adults with learning and/or intellectual disabilities at a Midwestern university. The program encompasses a variety of collegiate experience, including academic coursework, career development, student life, and community living. The program’s academic coordinator recommended the four students for participation in the study because of their reading difficulties.</p>
<p>Before the study, we assessed participants’ oral reading fluency (ORF) using curriculum-based measurement (CBM). Based on the reading placement criteria recommended by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1088357613477473">Fuchs and Deno (1982)</xref>, we found that the four participants’ instructional reading level was sixth grade. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1088357613477473">Table 1</xref> presents a detailed description of each participant. We obtained intellectual quotient scores for each of the four participants from a review of their records.

<title>Materials</title>
<p>We identified health care and money management as two important areas for instruction, and specified six topics in each area. We then identified five to six terms that readers were very likely to encounter in each topic. This procedure resulted in a list of 62 potential vocabulary words.</p>
<p>As learners may have larger speaking and listening vocabularies than their reading vocabularies and know words at different levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1088357613477473">Curtis &amp; Kruidenier, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1088357613477473">Dale &amp; O’Rourke, 1986</xref>), we pretested participants’ knowledge of the terms from the list to identify words that were not in participants’ reading or listening vocabularies (i.e., words they failed to decode and understand). During the pretest, we asked the participant to orally read the terms from the list and define them. A word was excluded if the participant either accurately read it or gave one correct definition in any context within 3 s or less. If the participant failed to read the word within 3 s, the instructor read the word and asked the participant to define it. Terms that participants could not define after the instructor’s verbal prompt were retained as unknown vocabulary for the participant. This procedure resulted in a list of 42 words unknown to all four participants.</p>
<p>We created 12 expository passages similar to educational materials (e.g., pamphlet, educational website) that typically are found in the identified areas. Based on the relevance and context of the passage, we chose 36 terms from the previously identified list and included them in the individual passages; each passage had 3 unknown words. The passages were written at an average reading level of 6.48 (range = 5.0–8.1) according to Flesch-Kincaid, with an average length of 309 words (range = 301–329). We embedded the terms in such a way that (a) the 3 terms appeared relatively evenly across the passage (i.e., front, middle, and end), and (b) each term appeared with similar frequency in the text with an average of 2.72 occurrences per passage (range = 2–4). To facilitate the comprehension of vocabulary knowledge via reading from context, we added a simple definition adjacent to the sentence that contained the unknown terminology (e.g., “Glucose means sugar.”) as researchers found decreasing the distance between the unknown word and its definition may enhance reader’s acquisition of vocabulary knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1088357613477473">Carnine, Kameenui, &amp; Coyle, 1984</xref>).</p>
<p>We created 10 comprehension questions for each passage. Three of the questions addressed comprehension of the unknown words in the passage by asking the participants to give a definition (e.g., “What does glucose mean?”). The other 7 questions assessed participants’ comprehension of the factual knowledge from the passage (e.g., “What is an example of hallucination in the passage?”). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1088357613477473">Table 2</xref> presents the list of topics and vocabulary used in the study.</p>

<title>Procedures</title>
<p>The instructors implemented the intervention and collected data during one-on-one sessions twice a week (i.e., Tuesday and Thursday) in a small conference room (3 m × 3 m). Each intervention session lasted for approximately 15 min. During each session, participants were asked to read one expository text under either control or CTD conditions. During the control condition, the instructor asked the participant to read a passage aloud with the following statement: “I want you to read the following passage. Pay attention to what you are reading as you will need to answer some questions after you read.” The participant read aloud the whole passage, including the sentences containing definitions to the adjacent unknown terms. After the participant finished reading, the instructor removed the passage and asked the participant to orally answer the 10 comprehension questions. The instructor recorded the participant’s responses on the instructor’s copy without providing any prompt or feedback. At the end of the session, the instructor thanked the participant and gave a brief and generic praise (e.g., “Thank you. Good job!”). The instructor then recorded the number of comprehension questions answered correctly using a key of acceptable answers.</p>
<p>During the CTD condition, the instructor printed each word on a flashcard (11 cm × 28 cm) with its definition from the passage presented on the back of the flashcard. The instructor taught the three terms using a 3-s CTD procedure similar to that used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1088357613477473">Schuster and colleagues (1990)</xref>. Each intervention session began with a 0-s time delay. First, the instructor pointed to the term printed on the flashcard, modeled the pronunciation, and asked the participant to read it (e.g., “This word is <italic>glucose</italic>. What word?”). Second, the instructor showed the definition printed on the back of the flashcard, read the definition, and asked the participant to read it (e.g., “Glucose means sugar. What is glucose?”). After the 0-s delay, the instructor checked the acquisition of the terminology by asking the participant to read the words and give a definition without referring back to the flashcard (e.g., “What is this word? What does it mean?”). If the participant failed to decode the words or provide a definition within 3 s, the instructor repeated the 0-s tine delay teaching sequence. After the participant read the term and provided a correct definition, the instructor taught the next word using the same procedures. After teaching the three words, the instructor checked the participant’s acquisition of the vocabulary by randomly pointing to each term on the flashcard and asking the participant to read it and give a definition independently. If the participant did not decode or define the word correctly within 3 s, the instructor repeated the teaching sequence of the target word. After the participant read all three words and gave his or her definitions correctly two consecutive times, the instructor asked the participant to read the whole passage aloud and answer the 10 comprehension questions following the same procedures as the control condition.</p>

<p>We task-analyzed the procedures used in control and the CTD intervention, and created a procedural checklist for each experimental condition; the control condition contained three steps, and the CTD condition contained six steps. During training, we provided the three instructors with the checklist and modeled the procedures. The instructors then role-played the procedures with each other while receiving the first author’s prompts and feedback. Before the conclusion of the training session, the instructors participated in individual simulated sessions to check their mastery of the procedures. All of the instructors reached 100% accuracy criterion on the procedural checklists.</p>

<sec id="section6-1088357613477473">
<title>Experimental Design</title>
<p>We used an alternating treatment design to examine the effects of each condition on participant vocabulary knowledge and reading comprehension. Before the experiment, we randomly assigned half of the passages from each content area to either control or CTD condition. Each week, the participants read passages from the two content areas under the two experimental conditions. The experimental conditions and the content areas were counterbalanced across the sessions. To control for passage-specific variables that could have an impact on student reading (e.g., difficulty of the passage and topics), we also counterbalanced the passages assigned to the two experimental conditions. John received vocabulary instruction when reading passages that were assigned as the control condition for the other three participants. Likewise, during the control condition, John read passages that were assigned as the CTD condition for the other three participants. Rapid alternation and counterbalanced order of experimental conditions allowed us to compare the effects of treatment conditions on the nonreversible academic behaviors in a relatively brief period of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1088357613477473">Tawney &amp; Gast, 1984</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section7-1088357613477473">
<title>Dependent Variables</title>
<p>Vocabulary knowledge acquisition, retention, and expository text comprehension were the three dependent variables. Immediately following each reading, we measured participant’s acquisition of the vocabulary knowledge and reading comprehension by asking the participant to orally answer the comprehension questions. Vocabulary knowledge acquisition was defined as total number of vocabulary comprehension questions answered correctly. Reading comprehension was defined as total number of comprehension questions answered correctly. We assessed vocabulary knowledge retention 1 day after the experimental session. The instructor presented the three terms taught the previous day on paper slips (21 cm × 5 cm) in random order and asked the participant to read and give a definition of each word. The terminology was considered retained if the participant decoded and defined it correctly within 3 s. Therefore, vocabulary knowledge retention was defined as total number of words retained by the participant 1 day after reading. During data collection, the instructor recorded participant’s responses on the instructor’s copy without providing any feedback or prompt.</p>

<sec id="section8-1088357613477473">
<title>Reliability and Procedural Integrity</title>
<p>We trained a graduate student who had 2 years of research experience to conduct procedural integrity and interobserver reliability checks. We conducted the interobserver reliability and procedural integrity checks during 25% of the sessions across the two experimental conditions for each participant. Interobserver agreement was calculated as the total number of agreements, divided by agreements plus disagreements, and multiplied by 100%. The mean agreement for number of vocabulary comprehension questions answered correctly, reading comprehension questions answered correctly, and vocabulary words retained was 100%, 98% (range = 90%−100%), and 100%.</p>
<p>Using the procedural checklists we developed for control and CTD conditions, the observer conducted procedural integrity checks 25% of the sessions across the two experimental conditions. Fidelity was calculated by dividing the number of steps in the checklist, which were completed correctly by the total number of steps and multiplying by 100%. Control and CTD procedures were implemented with 100% fidelity.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1088357613477473">Figure 1</xref> presents the number of vocabulary words the participants learned from each passage during the control and CTD conditions. For Michelle, Don, and Charles, there was an average of 5.6% overlap of data points between CTD and control conditions (range = 0%−17%). In comparison with the control condition, these three participants learned an average of 2.18 more words per passage during the CTD condition. Therefore, the low overlap of data points between the two experimental conditions and the clear separation of the two data paths on the number of terms learned from each passage demonstrated the superiority of the CTD condition on vocabulary acquisition for three of the participants. For John, the CTD condition resulted in the acquisition of 1.5 more words per passage than the control condition; however, there was a higher degree of overlapping data points between the two conditions.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1088357613477473">Figure 2</xref> presents the cumulative number of vocabulary words retained under control and CTD conditions. During the control condition, the four participants had a relatively low rate of vocabulary knowledge retention. Charles and John cumulatively retained two words while Michelle and Don failed to retain any new vocabulary. In comparison with the control condition, the four participants retained more vocabulary knowledge after they received instruction using CTD. The cumulative number of terms retained for Michelle, Don, Charles, and John was 12, 3, 6, and 13, respectively. Although more effective than the control condition, the varied slopes of the CTD data paths across participants suggest that the participants may have different responsiveness to this intervention with regard to vocabulary knowledge retention.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Educators at the postsecondary level tend to neglect the need to teach vocabulary knowledge because they incorrectly assume learners who can decode are able to learn word meanings from reading the text (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1088357613477473">Edmonds et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1088357613477473">Roberts, Torgesen, Boardman, &amp; Scammacca, 2008</xref>). However, based on the results of this study, we conclude that relying on learners with intellectual disability to acquire the definitions of unknown vocabulary words from expository texts did not result in successful vocabulary knowledge acquisition or retention. In comparison with the reading level of typical education materials at the postsecondary level (i.e., ninth grade or above; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1088357613477473">Rudd, Colton, &amp; Schacht, 2000</xref>), the passages in our study were written at lower reading levels. Moreover, unlike typical expository reading materials that require readers to integrate information scattered throughout the passage to derive meaning of unknown words (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1088357613477473">Cain, Oakhill, &amp; Lemmon, 2004</xref>), we embedded definitions adjacent to the sentence containing the unknown terms (e.g., “___ means ___”), further lowering the processing demand for the participants. However, three of the participants comprehended only an average of 17% of the unknown terms they encountered during reading, whereas one participant (Don) failed to acquire any of the vocabulary words. In addition, only an average of 37% of the vocabulary acquired through context was retained (range = 0%−67%) across the three participants (Michelle, Charles, and John). Clearly, without additional help, individuals with intellectual disability are not likely to benefit from reading the typical educational materials they will encounter in their adult lives.</p>
<p>In comparison with the control condition, we found that teaching vocabulary knowledge using CTD resulted in more successful vocabulary acquisition and retention. In the study, each vocabulary teaching sequence began with instructor’s demonstration of the correct pronunciation and definition of the terminology, followed by learners’ imitation of the word and definition. The instructors gradually faded the prompts by providing the learners with frequent opportunities to respond to the target words and definitions within the predetermined constant time interval. The learners also received immediate feedback from the instructors so that their correct responses were reinforced and the errors were corrected using a consistent protocol. In addition, the 3-s CTD allowed the instructors to maintain a brisk instructional pace and keep the learners engaged during the instruction. Therefore, this errorless learning procedure created a learning environment that was highly motivating for the learners. As a result, the participants in the study not only gained more vocabulary knowledge but also had higher vocabulary retention after the intervention. An average of 84% of the unknown terms from the passages (range = 67%−89%) were acquired by the four participants and 50% of these words were retained (range = 23%−78%). Therefore, the results of the study are interpreted to suggest that young adults with intellectual disability can benefit from learning vocabulary knowledge using CTD.</p>
<p>Although the participants in the study retained more vocabulary knowledge when receiving vocabulary instruction, the high degree of variability of the number of words retained between the participants indicated that educators may need additional instruction to facilitate word retention for young adults who struggle with reading. In the study, the participants had limited encounters with the terms and did not receive any additional opportunities to practice them. Evidence suggests that for struggling readers to acquire and retain word knowledge, they need to have multiple encounters with the words in a variety of contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1088357613477473">Beck, Perfetti, &amp; Mckeown, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1088357613477473">Stahl &amp; Fairbanks, 1986</xref>). Therefore, educators should arrange more drill and practice opportunities through cumulative reviews to facilitate the retention and maintenance of vocabulary knowledge.</p>
<p>The results of the study can be used to highlight the necessity of including additional instruction to increase the likelihood that initial word knowledge can be generalized to reading comprehension. We did not find that teaching vocabulary knowledge using CTD improved comprehension of the expository texts. Several factors may have contributed to this finding. It is possible that the participants needed additional vocabulary instruction to have an impact on reading comprehension. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1088357613477473">McKeown and Beck (1988)</xref> recommended that educators differentiate vocabulary teaching procedures depending on instructional goals. For example, the vocabulary instruction we utilized in the study was an effective approach if the goal of instruction was to initiate the word learning process and to familiarize the learners with the meanings of the words that they are going to encounter during reading. However, for vocabulary instruction to have an impact on reading comprehension, learners need a deeper and more complete understanding of vocabularies other than association of simple definition or synonym. To achieve this level of knowledge, educators can enrich instruction by teaching the words in a variety of contexts, illustrating the word with examples and nonexamples, and using additional procedures, including concept maps and semantic feature analysis to compare and contrast the relationships between the words (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1088357613477473">Archer &amp; Hughes, 2010</xref>). It also is possible that the learners in the study needed interventions that directly address the comprehension of the expository texts in addition to vocabulary instruction. We conclude that vocabulary knowledge is a necessary condition for comprehension, but simply having vocabulary knowledge per se does not appear to be sufficient for successful comprehension of text (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1088357613477473">Cain et al., 2004</xref>). When examining the interrelationships between vocabulary knowledge and reading comprehension, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1088357613477473">Sabatini, Sawaki, Shore, and Scarborough (2010)</xref> found that vocabulary knowledge alone was not a substantial and independent contributor to reading comprehension outcomes of adults with low literacy. The complicated and varied structures of the expository texts and reading long passages that are not typical to the everyday conversation may make comprehension of the expository text even more difficult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1088357613477473">Baker et al., 2002</xref>). Therefore, young adult learners with intellectual disability may need vocabulary interventions that enhance the learning of the vocabulary knowledge and comprehension strategies that can transfer this knowledge so as to assist with the comprehension of text (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1088357613477473">Bryant, Goodwin, Bryant, &amp; Higgins, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1088357613477473">Mellard, Fall, &amp; Woods, 2010</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section11-1088357613477473">
<title>Limitations and Future Research</title>
<p>The results of this study must be interpreted within the context of its limitations. First, we did not control for participants’ prior knowledge of the topics. Learners who have prior knowledge of passage topics are more likely to have better text comprehension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1088357613477473">Pressley, Disney, &amp; Anderson, 2006</xref>). For instance, when asked to read a passage regarding cancer and treatment, John showed great interest and later commented that he knew the topic very well because of the recent diagnosis of a family member. In addition, we controlled the passage only with regard to length and reading level without controlling for the complexity of the text structure of each passage. Therefore, future researchers may be well advised to consider using more rigorous control of these variables when investigating the relationship between an intervention and the learner’s expository reading outcomes.</p>
<p>Second, the dependent measures we used in the study were experimenter-developed rather than standardized measures of the same construct. Although sensitive to student learning, exclusive use of experimenter-developed measures make it difficult to determine whether the effects of the instruction will generalize to other contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1088357613477473">Gersten, Baker, &amp; Lloyd, 2000</xref>). As recommended by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1088357613477473">Scammacca et al. (2007)</xref>, future researchers need to use standardized measures and measures that are closely aligned to the intervention to assess whether the vocabulary instruction can produce a generalized impact on reading.</p>
<p>Third, we interpret our evidence to suggest that teaching vocabulary words using CTD was an effective instructional approach to improve word acquisition and retention for postsecondary students with intellectual disability, only four learners participated in the study and the variability of the data between the participants indicated that they may have different responsiveness to the intervention. Given the large discrepancies of needs and proficiency levels in the area of reading for this population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1088357613477473">Conners, 1992</xref>), researchers need to determine whether other young adults with intellectual disability also would benefit from the vocabulary instruction we implemented in the study.</p>
<p>Fourth, given the initial success of this intervention with individuals with intellectual disability in the area of comprehension of expository vocabulary, future researchers should investigate the effectiveness of CTD using different instructional formats with this population. Educators successfully taught sight words using CTD in a small group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1088357613477473">Gast et al., 1990</xref>) or had students without disabilities deliver the CTD procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1088357613477473">Wolery et al., 1994</xref>). Changing the CTD delivery format may increase the efficiency of the intervention (i.e., requiring less time and fewer teacher resources) and will, ultimately, increase the likelihood that the intervention will be adopted by educators.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1088357613477473">
<title>Practical Implications</title>
<p>Results from NLTS2 indicate that the category of individuals with intellectual disability had the highest increase of postsecondary education enrollment since 1990 (i.e., 19% difference; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1088357613477473">Wagner et al., 2005</xref>). For these young adults to benefit from a postsecondary education, educators need to address the vocabulary and comprehension learning needs so that these students can comprehend information that will result in independent functioning in daily living, places of employment, and education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1088357613477473">Alwell &amp; Cobb, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The vocabulary instruction procedure implemented here included not only essential components of a research-based intervention but also features that made the intervention more likely to be adopted by educators in postsecondary education settings. First, we made the intervention brief and frequent. We worked with the participants’ academic coordinator and scheduled the vocabulary instruction sessions as part of their supplemental academic curriculum. The 3-s CTD procedure lasted an average of 5 min for the instructors to teach three vocabulary words. Second, we ensured the consistency of instructional delivery by having the instructors use a script and a procedural checklist. In addition, we provided training and collected procedural integrity data throughout the intervention to check the quality of the delivery of the intervention. Third, we used an informal assessment to progress monitor student vocabulary development and its impact on comprehension of the expository texts throughout the intervention. At the end of the study, the instructors reported that they felt confident using this intervention to teach vocabulary knowledge in their content areas because they felt the procedure was easy to learn and did not require extensive preparation.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Postsecondary education experiences may prepare learners with intellectual disability for the demands and challenges of adult life. Previously, researchers have documented evidence suggesting that these learners can benefit from systematic and explicit literacy-instruction programs using age-appropriate reading materials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1088357613477473">Browder et al., 2007</xref>). This study extended the literature by utilizing a CTD procedure in the area of expository reading for young adults with intellectual disability at the postsecondary level. Investigators should continue this line of research for this population with a focus on comprehension of vocabulary and connected text.</p>
