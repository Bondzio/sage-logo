<p>This article seeks to understand differences in the evolution of policies to combat domestic violence against women in the Netherlands and Spain. Although policy change is often viewed as incremental change toward more <italic>progressive</italic> policies, the two countries studied here reflect opposing dynamics. The Netherlands moved from being a pioneering country to one that gradually marginalized the policy issue, whereas Spain, in contrast, recently developed innovative and far-reaching policies after a long period of low to moderate state responses. The case study points to the central role of frame negotiation, left-wing governments, and strong feminist mobilization.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In the 1980s, the Netherlands was one of the first European countries to develop specific policies to combat violence against women. In 1982, the Dutch government invited feminist activists and policy makers to set goals and principles for state policy combating different forms of violence against women. This resulted in a comprehensive policy plan that was issued in 1984. In this plan, a feminist analysis of the problem was adopted that framed violence against women as a problem rooted in the unequal power relations between men and women and as a central mechanism in maintaining inequality. Now, almost 25 years later, the Netherlands has lost its lead, and recent policy development has a potential negative effect for women. Spain, in contrast, for a long time could be considered a laggard within the European context and did not initiate specific policies until the 1990s (with the exception of a minor legal reform in the late 1980s), despite the efforts of women’s organizations to get the issue on the political agenda. Recently, however, Spain has become a vanguard country in this policy domain by introducing a comprehensive law against gendered violence. In this article, I try to explain the different evolution of policies combating domestic violence in the Netherlands and in Spain. Although policy change is often viewed as incremental change toward policies that are more <italic>progressive</italic>, the two countries studied here show opposite dynamics. This indicates that the achievements of women’s organizations are not necessarily definitive, but that there is a risk that they may lose their previous advancements.</p>
<p>Comparative studies on cross-national variations in domestic violence policies are relatively scarce and recent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1077801212455359">Elman, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1077801212455359">Johnson &amp; Brunell, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1077801212455359">Kantola, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1077801212455359">Kriszán, Bustelo, Hadjiyanni, &amp; Kamoutsi, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1077801212455359">Weldon, 2002</xref>). Although all of these studies focus on the interaction between state response and women’s movements in the emergence and development of policies, they do not analyze the long-term mechanisms of state/movement interaction and how these mechanisms translate into policy outcomes in the long run. This study aims to fill this gap, by examining the interaction between the state and the women’s movements in two countries over a period of almost three decades.</p>
<p>In the rest of this article I first discuss how different studies available have tried to <italic>measure</italic> policy responses toward domestic violence and then apply these criteria to make a first evaluation of Dutch and Spanish policy evolutions. Next, I explain what methods and data I used to analyze the emergence and change of domestic violence policies over time in both countries. I then continue with a reconstruction of the development and framing of domestic violence policies in the Netherlands and Spain between 1980 and 2009. Finally, I draw some theoretical conclusions from this reconstruction that explain the divergent developments in the two countries.</p>

<title>Changing Domestic Violence Regimes in the Netherlands and Spain</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1077801212455359">Johnson and Brunell (2006)</xref> have introduced the concept of “domestic violence regimes” to refer to the way “The response to domestic violence has been <italic>institutionalized</italic> in a combination of state and nongovernmental policy, discourse and practice” (p. 575). To characterize different forms of state response to domestic violence, they use a number of criteria based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1077801212455359">Weldon (2002)</xref>:</p>
<list id="list1-1077801212455359" list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item><p>Is there a separate provision in the criminal code that specifically pertains to domestic violence?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Is marital rape recognized as a crime?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Is there separate legislation addressing domestic violence?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Are there public campaigns to raise awareness?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Are restraining orders and/or orders to protect victims available?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Is training available for police intervention and/or requiring police to keep records of incidents?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Do shelter services receive state support?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>A government that addresses more areas is valued as more responsive than a government that has taken measures in fewer areas because the scope of the response is broader. This output-oriented way of measuring state response has the important advantage that it facilitates cross-national comparison, but at the same time this list of indicators provides us with very little or no insight as to how the state approaches the problem of violence, in particular the definition of the problem and the logic behind the policy. The implicit logic behind the set of indicators appears to be that a state that addresses all these areas has a <italic>woman-friendly</italic> or gendered policy, but the question arises if this necessarily is the case. Does a high score of state responsiveness automatically imply that the problem of domestic violence is perceived and treated as a gendered problem as has been the central claim and aim of feminist organizations? This may not always be true. The adoption of the concept of domestic violence often implies that the problem is framed as a gender-neutral problem. To illustrate the point, a government that takes a law-and-order approach to domestic violence may adopt a number of policy measures that are included in the list of criteria, without acknowledging that domestic violence is a gendered problem that needs an integral response to reduce gender inequalities. We need to be aware of the risk of cooptation that lies behind the facade of state responsiveness as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1077801212455359">Stratigaki (2004)</xref> convincingly argues. According to Stratigaki, the state may address a problem raised by women’s organizations and adopt certain feminist concepts, but in doing so transform the concepts and the underlying feminist analysis of the problem. This may result in gradual deterioration of policy effect on gender inequality. It may also work against mobilization and pressure of interested groups (e.g., As the state addresses the issue, it becomes more difficult to make new claims). Likewise <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1077801212455359">Ferree, Gamson, Gerhards, and Rucht (2002)</xref> argue that the strategic integration of gender interests into larger, more inclusive issues on the policy agenda may help to create strategic coalitions supporting the issue; it may also lead to fragmentation or dilution of the issue.</p>
<p>Instead of limiting the set of indicators to measure state responsiveness to formal criteria, it is crucial to pay attention to the way the policy problem is framed, because these underlying frames evoke different notions of what the problem of domestic violence is about, the way the problem is located in society, and how it should be solved. It is relevant for the choices in policy making, the areas that are included in the policy, and the selection of policy instruments. Analyzing policy frames also makes clear whether the cultural transformation the women’s movement aims for reaches the political agenda and translates into an integral policy approach that addresses underlying causes and mechanisms. Moreover, the framing of the issue has implications for the women’s organizations that politicized the issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077801212455359">Charles, 2004</xref>). For instance, it affects which organizations receive funding for their activities. If domestic violence is framed as a housing issue or a security issue, refuge groups may obtain funding to provide services. If domestic violence is framed as criminal justice issue, the risk of losing state funding or being controlled by the state is much larger as demonstrated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1077801212455359">Matthews’ (1994)</xref> study of rape crisis centers in the United States. A broader definition of both policy response and movement success, that also includes the framing of the problem, helps to further elaborate the concept of domestic violence regimes to include frame negotiation and institutionalization.</p>

<sec id="section3-1077801212455359" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method and Data</title>
<p>In order to explain the emergence and evolution of policy responses in the Netherlands and Spain, I combine frame analysis with “process tracing” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1077801212455359">Weldon, 2002</xref>). Process tracing is a method for “Assembling bits of evidence into a story of what happened, detailing a sequence of events leading up to the event of interest” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1077801212455359">Weldon, 2002</xref>, p. 26). I trace temporal sequences in policy developments to show when key documents and legislation were formulated (time) and the progression of developments (sequence). Attention to timing and sequence highlights that political decisions are made with regard to previous policies and their effects. This feedback mechanism can cause a revision or strengthening of policies, constituting a path of dependency. This way I can trace the process of policy making over a longer period of time (1980-2009) to understand when and how changes in state policies occur.</p>
<p>I use frame analysis to study the (re)construction of domestic violence as a policy problem and the solutions that are proposed to combat this problem. The frame analysis method seeks to discover dominant and/or competing frames in the discourse of actors engaged in the political process that make sense of different situations and events, attribute blame or causality, and suggest lines of action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1077801212455359">Schön &amp; Rein, 1994</xref>). Frame analysis can help identify how discursive strategies—whether intentional or not—modify the process itself by excluding certain frames or actors and promoting others. Contested issues, such as domestic violence, provide a space for competing frames, and among the different actors involved in the policy process. Over time, political actors negotiate these frames through coalition-building, challenge, and debate; different framings of the problem may become dominant in policy making. These framing processes are always situated in broader contexts with institutions and culture defining the repertoire of acceptable problem definitions and policy actions. Frame analysis examines the relationship between institutional settings, political opportunity structures, and agency by lending insight into how actors active in different institutional contexts deal with institutional, political, and cultural impediments and opportunities for change.</p>
<p>The frame analysis used in this study is based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1077801212455359">Snow and Benford’s (1992)</xref> distinction between diagnostic and prognostic framing. The category of diagnosis asks what is represented as the problem, why it is seen as a problem, and what is mentioned as causes of the problem. It also analyses the attribution of roles in the diagnosis, such as who seems to have made the problem, who is the problem-holder, and who are possible victims and perpetrators. The category of prognosis contains what is represented as the solution to the problem, what goals are formulated, and how these goals should be achieved.</p>
<p>To reconstruct the policy evolutions in relation to domestic violence in the Netherlands and Spain, I analyzed all major policy plans and legislation concerning domestic violence issued between 1980 and 2009 (see Appendix 1 for the list of documents). In addition, I traced the origins of the politicization of the problem and how it was framed by women’s organizations who acted as agenda setters by examining organizational documents from women’s organizations against domestic violence in both countries, ranging from leaflets and papers to minutes of meetings and correspondence. I retrieved these documents from national archives such as the <italic>International Archive of the Women’s Movement in Amsterdam</italic> (IIAV), the archives of <italic>Casa de la Mujer</italic>, the <italic>Coordinadora de Casas de Acogida</italic>, the <italic>Instituto de la Mujer</italic> (Madrid), <italic>Ca la Dona</italic> (Barcelona), organizational archives of <italic>Blijf van mijn lijf</italic>, <italic>Federatie Opvang</italic> (the Netherlands), and <italic>CIMTM, Themis, CAA, Asociación de Mujeres Separadas y Divorciadas</italic> (Spain). Newspapers and available research allowed this material to be placed within its historic social and political context.</p>

<title>The Netherlands</title>
<p>In 1984, the Dutch government issued its first policy plan to combat violence against women, titled <italic>Combating sexual violence against women and girls</italic> (Bestrijding van seksueel geweld tegen vrouwen en meisjes; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1077801212455359">Dutch Department of Social Affairs, 1984</xref>). One of the main issues addressed in the plan was domestic violence. The policy plan was a response to a decade of feminist mobilization against domestic violence, which had started in 1974 when a group of feminist social workers began to politicize the issue of women’s abuse (<italic>vrouwenmishandeling</italic>) and opened the first shelter in Amsterdam. Their initiative rapidly spread all over the Netherlands; within a few years, an extensive national network of women’s shelters had been formed under the shared name <italic>Blijf van mijn lijf</italic> (Don’t touch my body; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1077801212455359">Roggeband, 2002</xref>). The state started to grant funding to the shelters in 1976. In 1982, a left-wing government, more notably a feminist secretary of state, invited feminist activists and policy makers to set goals and principles for state policy to combat violence against women. This conference resulted in a document published by the Ministry of Social Affairs that provided an analysis of the problem and formulated measures to combat violence against women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077801212455359">Acker &amp; Rawie, 1982</xref>). The succeeding right-wing government that took office in 1982 surprisingly adopted the feminist analysis, including most of the goals and principles set out in this document, and issued a first national policy plan in 1984.</p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1077801212455359">Table 1</xref> illustrates, abuse is framed as a clearly gendered problem by using the concept of “women’s abuse” defined as “One-sided use of physical and/or sexual force against the will of the woman by her male (ex)partner” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1077801212455359">Dutch Department of Social Affairs, 1984</xref>, p. 7). “Women’s abuse” was represented as part of a wider problem labeled violence against women that was framed as a problem “Rooted in the unequal power relations between men and women,” and as a “Central mechanism maintaining this inequality” (p. 8). The leading principles of the policy plan were “Women’s constitutional right to protection and physical integrity and women’s right to sexual self-determination” (p. 7), pulling the problem out of the private sphere. State intervention was legitimized by asserting that violence against women is a structural social problem related to women’s unequal position in society. The measures proposed against abuse included the enhancement of women’s possibilities to resist violence (which was connected to diminishing unequal power relations and providing economic independence and autonomy to women; p. 12), improving (sex-specific) care and shelter facilities for victims of sexual violence (p. 12), and raising awareness among professionals engaged in fighting sexual violence (p. 13). Apart from the policy plan, the government also proposed a specific regulation for state support of shelter services. The Dutch policy approach thus consisted of a feminist framing of the issue combined with a soft measures policy approach including consciousness raising and assertiveness training, police training, and sex-specific care service. The only legal measure, that was already in place and not specifically directed toward domestic violence, was the possibility of keeping the perpetrator away from the victim. The implementation of the new policy plan, however, was soon hindered by a large privatization operation. The coalition government of Christian Democrats (CDA) and Conservative Liberals (VVD) that had taken office in 1982 agreed that “Next to deregulation and decentralization, privatization forms a crucial part of government policy: the achievement of budgetary savings, the improvement of administrative control, and the strengthening of the market sector” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077801212455359">Handelingen Tweede Kamer, 1983</xref>, p. 1). The coalition was in power for two periods (1982-1986 and 1986-1990). In 1988, the government announced its plans to integrate services for victims of violence into the regular (mental) health infrastructure and to reduce financial support of sex-specific services created by women’s groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1077801212455359">Handelingen Tweede Kamer, 1988</xref>).</p>

<title>Spain</title>
<p>In Spain, feminist efforts to politicize the issue started in the early 1980s. In 1982, after the left-wing <italic>Partido Socialista Obrero Española</italic> (PSOE) won the national elections, feminists found new opportunities to get the issue of women’s abuse on the political agenda. A group of lawyers and social workers, some of them closely allied to PSOE, founded the Research Commission on Women’s Abuse (<italic>Comisión de Investigación de Malos Tratos a Mujeres, CIMTM</italic>). This group was well-informed by international examples and focused mainly on political advocacy and raising awareness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1077801212455359">Gutiérrez, 1990</xref>). CIMTM successfully used its contacts to lobby for police registration of domestic violence. Beginning in 1984, members of CIMTM offered women’s rights courses at the police training college (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1077801212455359">Gutiérrez, 1990</xref>). About the same period, other autonomous groups, such as the Grup Alba in Barcelona, aimed to establish shelter services, but had difficulty finding the necessary funding. In response to these feminist actions, in the mid-1980s the Spanish Senate commissioned a special group for the study of the phenomenon. In 1989, they published their report, which had the status of policy advice to the government.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1077801212455359">Table 2</xref> makes clear that the framing offered in the Senate committee’s report was mainly based on international studies and policy documents(e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077801212455359">Council of Europe, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1077801212455359">United Nations, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1077801212455359">1995</xref>). Furthermore, CIMTM and other women’s organizations were consulted. This can be traced in the problem definition offered in the committee’s final report. Domestic violence was represented as a structural problem related to economic dependence of women and cultural patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1077801212455359">Comisión de Derechos Humanos del Senado, 1989</xref>, pp. 12183-12184). Also, the report stated that “Patriarchal attitudes, in which everything that belongs to the realm of the family (women, children, and goods) fall under the authority of men, make it difficult to intervene” and “That there is a strong tendency in Spanish society to legitimate violence in the family sphere” (p. 121834). It recommended some soft law measures to prevent domestic violence (such as a consciousness raising and a <italic>know your rights</italic> campaign, and police training). Although the different parties in the Senate and many women’s organizations reacted positively to the report, the government did not take any concrete policy measures in response. Therefore, during the spring of 1989, a number of women’s organizations started an intensive campaign to demand reform of the Penal Code (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077801212455359">Comisión AntiAgresiones, 1989</xref>). Based on experiences of other women’s groups in Europe that had struggled to improve legislation in relation to domestic violence, Spanish organizations presented a detailed proposal for new legislation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1077801212455359">Roggeband, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1077801212455359">Valiente, 1999</xref>). One central point in this proposal was to replace the existing legal definition, which labeled sexual violence as “offenses against purity,” with a definition that framed sexual violence as an offense against the sexual freedom of women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077801212455359">Comisión AntiAgresiones, 1989</xref>). Politicians and trade unions offered their support to the campaign. In response, the government proposed a legal reform in November 1989 (Organic Act, No. 10 of 23 November 1989). The new Penal Code included “malos tratos” as a crime, although the legal description remained rather vague and did not, for instance, include psychological violence. Repeated domestic violence (perpetrated at least three times) was punished with a period of imprisonment ranging from 1-6 months (Organic Act, No. 10 of 23 November 1989). Women’s organizations, feminist lawyers, and legal scholars reacted with disappointment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1077801212455359">Maqueda, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1077801212455359">Roggeband, 2002</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1077801212455359">Maqueda (2009)</xref> notes, the new law did not take the specific (gendered) nature of partner violence into account and remained very ineffective. From the mid-1980s, some shelter services started to function, but no structural funding was offered by the government. In 1987, the shelters organized a network, the <italic>Coordinadora de Casas de Acogida</italic> (<italic>CCA</italic>), that demanded central regulations and funding for shelters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1077801212455359">Roggeband, 2002</xref>). The government, however, did not respond to this petition, which provoked skepticism among many autonomous feminists, about the role of the state. Thus, Spain, in contrast to the Netherlands, took a more legislative approach, but despite efforts of feminists and also the Senate committee, the state did not adopt a gender-specific framing and approach, responding only in a very limited way to feminist demands for state-funded services. The policy response remained limited to a (weakly defined) separate legal provision, police training, and record keeping by the police.</p>

<title>The 1990s</title>
<sec id="section9-1077801212455359">
<title>The Netherlands</title>
<p>In the Netherlands, the early 1990s represented further regression for the women’s movement against violence. Despite a change in government to a coalition of Christian Democrats and Labor Party, the government continued its decentralization and privatization operation. To legitimate this, the leader of the Labor Party redefined privatization as the less neoliberal term “autonomization” and framed organizational reform as a purely administrative issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1077801212455359">Yesilkagit &amp; De Vries, 2004</xref>, p. 969). The mid-1990s seemed to provide a new window of opportunity when a historical new “purple” coalition, consisting of the Labor Party and two Liberal parties, took office. For the first time in decades the Christian Democrats did not participate in the government and the purple coalition took a more progressive stance in ethical issues. However, they adopted a neoliberal “managerial” style of government with an emphasis on efficiency and the market (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1077801212455359">Outshoorn &amp; Oldersma, 2007</xref>, p. 187; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1077801212455359">Yesilkagit &amp; De Vries, 2004</xref>, p. 970). Also, the coalition adopted a gender-neutral discourse, which made it hard to reframe women’s problems as it made any distinction between the sexes appear discriminatory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1077801212455359">Outshoorn, 2000</xref>). As a result, the two policy documents issued in the 1990s imply a gradual shift from a gendered framing of the problem and a gendered policy approach toward a gender-neutral approach that paid no attention to the underlying gendered mechanisms of violence. Privatization affected the existing sex-specific services and women’s organizations working actively in the field. Cutbacks in state support implied the disappearance of most services and organizations.</p>
<p>When we limit our focus to the policy outcomes in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1077801212455359">Table 3</xref> without paying attention to policy framing, we cannot trace some of the important changes in policy orientation and content that took place in the Netherlands in the 1990s. Whereas the list of measures was amplified with the definition of rape in marriage as a crime in 1991, the new legal definition was very much at odds with feminist demands. The women’s movement had been struggling for this reform since the early 1980s, arguing that the sexual self-determination of women should be the legal ground for penalizing rape within matrimony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077801212455359">Blijf van mijn lijf, 1984</xref>). The government, however, refuted this frame and instead introduced the “protection of vulnerable subjects” as the rationale for legal reform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1077801212455359">Lünneman, 1996</xref>). In addition, the two policy plans issued in the 1990s gradually left behind the gender-specific approach of the 1980s, as <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1077801212455359">Table 3</xref> exemplifies. The 1990 <italic>Progress Note on Policy to Combat Sexual Violence Against Women and Girls</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077801212455359">Dutch Department of Welfare, Public Health, and Culture, 1990</xref>) adopted the problem definition of the 1984 policy plan, yet two important shifts in the diagnosis also became apparent. First, the new frame emphasized violence against women as a public health issue and advocated a mainstream, instead of gender-specific, approach. This coincided with a shift in policy responsibility for the issue of violence from the gender equality unit within the Department of Social Affairs and Employment to the Department of Welfare, Public Health and Culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1077801212455359">Roggeband, 2002</xref>). Second, the role of perpetrators became more highlighted, and treatment of perpetrators was defined as a central policy goal: “In thinking about prevention, the treatment of perpetrators should be a policy central issue” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077801212455359">Dutch Department of Welfare, Public Health, and Culture, 1990</xref>). In spite of that, the empowerment of (potential) victims to prevent violence, which is central in the earlier plan, received scant attention. The 1990 plan included a proposal for reformation of the penal code to penalize marital rape. Other proposed measures in the second plan were researching, improving police services and registration of domestic violence and integrating sex-specific services in mainstream services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077801212455359">Dutch Department of Welfare, Public Health, and Culture, 1990</xref>). As a result of this latter policy measure, many women’s organizations lost their subsidies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077801212455359">Dutch Department of Welfare, Public Health, and Culture, 1990</xref>), and a number of sex-specific services, such as hotlines and rape crisis centers, stopped functioning. Also, notwithstanding the opposition of left-wing parties in Parliament, the government decided to decentralize its financial responsibility for the shelter services in 1994. In reaction, some groups decided to close down their shelters, whereas others continued with local funding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1077801212455359">Lima, 1994</xref>).</p>

<p>In 1999, the “purple” government launched a new gender equality plan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1077801212455359">Handelingen Tweede Kamer, 1999</xref>) that included an action plan against domestic violence. This action plan was developed in response to two international events: the 1995 Beijing UN World Conference on Women and the 1997 Resolution of the European Parliament on the need to establish an EU-wide campaign for zero tolerance of violence against women. Despite the reference (p. 33) to these policy events that took a clear gendered approach to violence, the Dutch government adopted the concept of “domestic violence” and introduced a gender-neutral framing of the problem. Domestic violence was defined as “violence committed by someone in the victim’s domestic circle” (p. 34), meaning that both victim and perpetrator were defined in gender-neutral terms. It emphasized that “Boys and men become victims of domestic violence as often as women” (p. 34). In contrast to the 1984 policy plan, the new plan did not include an underlying analysis of how violence relates to gender inequality. Instead, the problem was framed as a coordination problem: “Policy to prevent and combat violence in the Netherlands is mostly a problem of direction, communication, and attuning in execution (where, who, how), rather than a question of content (what)” (p. 35). Policy measures focused on research, creating more expertise among professionals, and public information campaigns. As a result of this policy shift, the initial feminist analysis and demands disappeared from the policy agenda. There was, however, virtually no resistance against this new policy direction, because the network of women’s organizations against violence had almost completely disappeared as a result of the cutbacks in state support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1077801212455359">Roggeband, 2002</xref>).</p>

<title>Spain</title>
<p>In 1998, the Spanish government finally issued a first national policy plan to combat domestic violence. Despite this late governmental response, feminists made some progress in developing initiatives in the 1990s and managed to receive some support to create the services from the national Women’s Institute or regional and local gender machineries. By the end of 1992, 81 shelters had been established across Spain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077801212455359">Instituto de la Mujer, 1992</xref>). Also, CIMTM, received support to run a national hotline for women in violent relationships in 1991. Inspired by international developments, particularly the 1993 UN Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women, Spanish feminists exerted pressure for legal change and more comprehensive policies. In 1993, the group of women jurists, <italic>Themis</italic>, started to lobby for a general law to cover all forms of violence against women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1077801212455359">Pleguezuelos, 2007</xref>). National opportunities, however, became less favorable after the right-wing Partido Popular defeated the PSOE and took over the government in 1996. The Partido Popular had opposed a gender analysis of the problem of violence when the special Senate Commission presented its report in 1989 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1077801212455359">Diario de Sesiones del Senado, 1989</xref>). The change in government implied that organizations with close ties to the PSOE, such as CIMTM, could no longer use their direct lobbying strategy, and started to use more direct protest tactics. In general, the perceived backlash resulted in more public actions of women’s organizations. Mobilization further intensified after a dramatic media event in December, 1997. Ana Orantes was killed by her former husband after giving testimony on a well-known TV show of the domestic violence she had suffered. Her death provoked massive protests, and a few months later the Spanish government approved a national plan to address women’s abuse (Plan de acción contra la violencia doméstica 1998-2000; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1077801212455359">Maqueda, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1077801212455359">Medina-Ariza &amp; Barberet, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1077801212455359">Osborne, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1077801212455359">Table 4</xref> shows how violence is framed in the first Spanish national policy plan against violence. Although the first national policy plan contained a gendered definition of the problem, stating, “It is mostly women who suffer from this problem” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1077801212455359">Instituto de la Mujer, 1998</xref>), it hardly contained an analysis of the underlying causes or the consequences of abuse. The government argued that “Violence against women has overcome the private dimension and has become a considerable threat to society and an essential attack against democracy” (p. 1), so as to legitimize state intervention. The document made reference to the first European plan to eradicate violence against women and the 1993 UN Resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1077801212455359">Instituto de la Mujer, 1998</xref>, p. 1). The most important measures included a public awareness campaign (p. 4), an expansion of special services to denounce domestic violence (p. 4), and the extension of places and periods of refuge for victims (p. 4). Moreover, the possibility of obtaining restraining orders was explicitly admitted (p. 5). In addition to the plan, the government passed two legal reforms (Organic Law 11/1999 and 14/1999). These reforms comprised three modifications: (1) an expansion of the definition of domestic violence to include psychological violence, (2) violence between partners that are not cohabiting was also considered domestic violence, and (3) new punishments for perpetrators, such as the prohibition to approach the victim. Although women’s organizations active in the field applauded the legal measures, they also protested against the narrow vision and scope of the action plan, labeling it mainly a symbolic plan and criticizing the lack of funding for the execution of the plan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1077801212455359">Medina-Ariza, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1077801212455359">2006</xref>). <italic>Themis</italic>, the association for women jurists, criticized the exclusive focus on the penal code and instead advocated the use of the civil code in the case of domestic violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1077801212455359">Morillas, 2002</xref>). While the 1990s thus marked some progress in getting some state funding for services and some specific legal measures concerning domestic violence, no comprehensive policy approach was developed and a lack of resources limited the implementation of the 1998 policy plan.</p>

<title>Turn of Millennium</title>

<title>The Netherlands</title>
<p>After the turn of the millennium, the issue of domestic violence became more prominent on the political agenda, but mainly as an issue that concerned the ethnic minority population. This shift can be related to the landslide victory of the populist party, Lijst Pim Fortuyn (LPF), which had a high profile on issues such as migration and crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1077801212455359">Outshoorn &amp; Oldersma, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1077801212455359">Roggeband &amp; Verloo, 1999</xref>). In 2002, the LPF allied with the Christian Democrats and Conservative Liberals to form a right-wing government. Although this coalition only lasted nine months, the succeeding coalition government of Christian Democrats and two Liberal parties adopted a very similar discourse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1077801212455359">Outshoorn &amp; Oldersma, 2007</xref>). The integration of Muslim immigrants was problematized in relation to traditional right-wing issues such as law-and-order, but also in relation to progressive issues such as gay rights and gender equality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1077801212455359">Outshoorn &amp; Oldersma, 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1077801212455359">Table 5</xref> presents the framing in the two policy plans issued after 2000.</p>

<p>In 2002, the government issued a new interdepartmental action plan, “Private Violence: A Public Matter,” coordinated by the Ministry of Justice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1077801212455359">Dutch Department of Justice, 2002</xref>). The plan continued framing domestic violence as a gender-neutral problem. Domestic violence was defined as “Violence committed by someone in the domestic circle (p. 5). Like the earlier plan, the document did not examine the specific nature and causes of the problem, nor its relationship to gender inequality. The new Dutch policy plan defined domestic violence as a security issue, stating that “Domestic violence represents an important security problem” and that “the government is responsible for securing the safety of each citizen” (p. 8). This framing of domestic violence had the advantage that violence was (implicitly) linked to citizenship and that it was made a priority issue. Yet, this framing also shifted attention from protecting and assisting victims to punishing perpetrators. New measures proposed along these lines included legislative changes aimed at expelling perpetrators from the house and extending the sentence for domestic violence as well as psychosocial treatment programs (pp. 19-23). Another remarkable feature was the increasing attention given to the issue of violence in ethnic minority groups. The 2002 policy plan marked ethnic minorities as a specific target group in domestic violence policies (p. 28). The succeeding government of Christian Democrats and Liberals started to develop policies for “culture-specific” forms of gender violence such as honor killings, forced marriages, and female genital mutilation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1077801212455359">Dutch Department of Justice, 2004</xref>). In 2004, the government presented a policy plan that associated the culture of migrants with unequal gender relations; violence is regarded as a means to reinforce this inequality and many forms of violence against women were labeled “culturally legitimated” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1077801212455359">Dutch Department of Justice, 2004</xref>). Whereas the issue of domestic violence was defined in gender-neutral terms, in the case of violence in ethnic minority groups the problem became framed as a gendered problem.</p>
<p>In 2007, both the UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077801212455359">Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women, 2007</xref>) and the special UN Rapporteur on Violence Against Women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1077801212455359">Ertürk, 2007</xref>) criticized the Dutch gender-neutral approach to domestic violence. In response, a new center-left government issued a policy plan titled, “The Next Phase” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1077801212455359">Handelingen Tweede Kamer, 2008</xref>) in 2008. In this plan, the government recognized that 85% of the victims of domestic violence are female, that “[gendered] power differences between perpetrator and victim play a role,” and that “male dominance is an underlying cause of violence” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1077801212455359">Handelingen Tweede Kamer, 2008</xref>, p. 4). “Therefore the struggle against violence cannot be seen in isolation from social structures and cultural norms that represent and legitimize such behavior” (p. 4). Despite this explicit gender approach in the diagnosis, the prognosis does not make any reference to a gender-specific approach. Instead, the government announced to study “during the next period how domestic violence policies can become more gender specific” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1077801212455359">Handelingen Tweede Kamer, 2008</xref>, p. 9). It thus remains to be seen whether the frame will result in specific policy outcomes in the near future. The measure to expel perpetrators temporarily from their home, proposed in the 2002 plan, finally resulted in the Temporary Restraining Order Act (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1077801212455359">Staatsblad van het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden, 2008</xref>). This new law entered into force on January 1, 2009 and makes it possible to impose a 10-day restraining order on perpetrators of domestic violence in situations where there is an acute threat to victims and/or any children.</p>

<title>Spain</title>
<p>The turn of the millennium marked a heightened politicization of domestic violence in Spain. A “cascade” of plans and measures has been the result. During the electoral campaigns in 2000, all political parties gave explicit attention to the issue of violence against women. In May 2001, the new PP government presented its second action plan against domestic violence (II Plan Integral contra la violencia doméstica 2001-2004; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1077801212455359">Instituto de la Mujer, 2001</xref>). In December 2001, the PSOE presented a proposal for an “integral” law against gender violence in Parliament. The PP was the only party that voted against the proposal and blocked passage of the law in Parliament. After PSOE’s victory in March 2004, the party executive started to prepare an integral law against violence. The Partido Popular finally dropped its resistance and voted in favor of the new law. The new <italic>Organic Law 1/2004 on Comprehensive Protection Measures against Gender Violence</italic> (<italic>Ley Orgánica-1/2004, de Medidas de Protección Integral contra la Violencia de Género</italic>) was then accepted on December 28, 2004. The framing in the different policy plans and measures is summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1077801212455359">Table 6</xref>.</p>

<p>The policy plans and legal measures gradually moved toward a more comprehensive approach, which finally resulted in a new law against gender violence in 2004. The 2000 policy plan, presented by the PP government, makes explicit that “violence is a manifestation of gender inequality, it is the means to which many men recur to dominate women and keep their privileges in the family” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1077801212455359">Instituto de la Mujer, 2001</xref>, p. 1) Despite the statement that “Violence should be prevented through gender equality education” (p. 2), the main emphasis in the solution to the problem is on handling and punishing perpetrators and protecting “vulnerable victims.” In addition, “It is necessary to develop new and more efficient legal measures that from the start attack every kind of behavior that in the future may become more severe. In sum, it is necessary to take integral actions that include penal measures against the aggressor to prevent further violence and protective civil and social measures for the victims of violence who are in a situation of special vulnerability” (p. 6). In 2003, a number of legal changes passed: to protect the witness during trial by allowing, for instance, videoconferencing (Ley Orgánica 13/2003); prohibition of the aggressor to approach the “victim” (15/2003); and a protection order for “victims” (27/2003). In these laws, women are mainly seen as victims in need of state protection even against their will. Feminist legal experts criticized this paternalistic approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1077801212455359">Maqueda, 2006</xref>) and questioned the “law and order” approach of raising punishments without fighting the problem from its roots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1077801212455359">Laurenzo Copello, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1077801212455359">Maqueda, 2009</xref>). A growing coalition of organizations, not just women’s organizations, continued their pressure in favor of an integral law.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1077801212455359">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>In December 2004, the new PSOE government introduced the new gender explicit Organic Law 1/2004, of 28 December, Comprehensive Protection Measures against Gender Violence. Article 1 of the new law states that “Gender violence is not a private problem. Instead, violence is the most brutal symbol of the inequality that exists in our society. It is about a form of violence directed against women for the simple reason of being women, and to be considered, by their aggressors, as lacking the minimum rights of liberty, respect and decision-making capacity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077801212455359">Boletín Oficial del Estado, 2004</xref>, p. 42166). Although the law adopts the broad label of “gendered violence,” it focuses exclusively on “violence of men against women who are or have been their wives or who are or have been in similar affective relationships even without living together” (p. 42168), which limits the domain to intimate partner violence and excludes other forms of violence against women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1077801212455359">Laurenzo Copello, 2005</xref>). The law labels gender violence a form of gender-based discrimination (p. 42168) and a political and structural problem requiring commitment from all public institutions (p. 42167). The law focuses on the awareness, prevention, and early detection of gender violence acts and establishes a comprehensive range of multidisciplinary measures that include not only judicial and penal measures, but also a wide range of educational, healthcare, social, and assistance measures with an emphasis on the social and economic rights of women (p. 42169). Although women’s organizations perceived this new legislation as a victory and crucial breakthrough, the new law also provoked controversy and has been subjected to several changes. In particular, the concept of “gender violence” generated resistance, especially as its interpretation has resulted in specific legislation that criminalizes forms of violence against women and punishes those violent acts in terms different from other crimes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077801212455359">Larrauri, 2007</xref>). Also, domestic violence is punished with different jail terms depending on the sex of the offender. These points raised considerable objections and the law was alleged to violate the Spanish Constitution gender equality provision by favoring women’s interests over men’s. The Constitutional Court in May, 2008 dismissed all appeals and ruled the envisaged sanctions as appropriate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1077801212455359">Maqueda, 2009</xref>). Feminist legal scholars also criticized the use of the penal code as an instrument to fight gender discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1077801212455359">Laurenzo Copello, 2005</xref>). Finally, the implementation and coordination of the law was the subject of debate. One concern was the lack of a sufficient budget to make the law successful. Another matter was that as the implementation of the Act corresponds to different public authorities, including Autonomous Communities, developments have been uneven in the different communities, leading to difficulties in implementing the Act. All these points make clear that although the Spanish law is internationally acclaimed as “best practice,” it also has some difficult aspects, and its effectiveness needs to be proven over time.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In this article, I examined the opposite evolution of policies in the domain of domestic violence in the Netherlands and Spain. My main argument is that if we only take into account policy outcomes to assess state responsiveness, we overlook changes and shifts in policy framing that have important implications for policy measures, the definition of target groups, and allocation of resources. As my analysis shows, shifts in diagnostic frames have implications for the solutions proposed (prognostic frames) and influence the outcomes of policy making. An exclusive focus on policy outcomes points to a gradual improvement (Spain) or stagnation/regression (the Netherlands) in policy responses in relation to domestic violence. However, a reconstruction of the framing processes in both countries reveals the underlying dynamics of these changes. We are able to see, for instance, why in the Netherlands the state first opted to finance shelters and other specific care services and then gradually abandoned this policy. The initial focus on gender inequality as the underlying problem resulted in a broad and integral response. In the late 1990s, the general policy to combat violence against women was narrowed to the issue of domestic violence, which was explicitly framed as a gender-neutral problem. In this new frame, no analysis of the problem and underlying causes was made, resulting in a law-and-order policy without measures to prevent violence. Also, this shift in framing implied a gradual loss of the service infrastructure developed by women’s organizations. Spain, in contrast, moved from a very moderate response that paid little attention to the gendered nature of the problem to a “punishment and victimization” framing, and finally developed a comprehensive policy response. The 2004 law on gender violence frames violence against women as a problem connected to gender inequality and includes a wide range of measures that also try to tackle the underlying problem of gender inequality.</p>
<p>A frame analysis also reveals another central difference in policy approach between the two countries. Whereas the Dutch policies focused on prevention and providing services to victims, Spain took a more “legislative approach” with a strong focus on the criminal justice system. Law and justice have been promoted as crucial instruments of change, resulting in the 2004 law on gender violence. This difference may help to explain why Dutch policy achievements were more vulnerable and got lost over time. Legal measures are not only more difficult to establish, as they require a broad consensus, but also are more institutionalized and therefore more difficult to change. Of course, in the Spanish case it is too early to know whether the new integral law fulfills the expectations that have been raised.</p>
<p>Several factors explain the shifts in framing and policy outcomes: First, my findings, in line with the studies of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1077801212455359">Elman (1996)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1077801212455359">Weldon (2002)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1077801212455359">Johnson and Brunell (2006)</xref>, point to the fundamental role of strong mobilizing networks to get the issue of domestic violence on the political agenda and get governments to respond to the issue. My findings also suggest that a continuing mobilization of strong and autonomous movements is necessary to prevent a stagnation or decline in policy responsiveness. The case of the Netherlands shows how early goal attainment and getting state support resulted in a decline of feminist mobilization. In the Spanish case, nonresponse had a positive side effect in the sense that it helped to reinforce and unite women’s organizations that were active in the field to jointly pressure for policy change. Women’s organizations are not only crucial for getting and keeping the issue on the political agenda, but also play a role in the framing of the problem. The different perceptions of feminists about the nature of the state and judicial system, the effectiveness of state response and legal measures determine the kind of demands feminists have made to the state; whereas, Spanish feminists, among them a good number of women jurists, opted for legal measures. Dutch activists, who had a background as social workers, opted for other measures such as services and intervention programs. This difference thus reflects their professional background, but also mirrored different feminist views at the time of mobilization. In the 1970s, feminist activists were mostly rather skeptical of state and legal intervention, whereas this attitude changed during the 1980s when they increasingly saw engagement with the state as necessary to reinforce structural change. The different strategies in both countries, however, are also determined by different political and legal traditions. The Dutch tradition of codification (law mostly follows social change or jurisprudence) in contrast to the Spanish preference for modification (in which the law has an instrumental character for forging social change) also explains the different policy outcomes in the two countries.</p>
<p>Second, although the different orientation of governments does not explain whether or not a government responds to the problem of violence, it does explain the nature of the response and more particularly the framing of violence as a policy problem. As my findings indicate, both left- and right-wing governments may adopt policies on domestic violence, but I found that the most far-reaching policies in terms of framing violence as a problem related to gender inequality and developing measures to prevent violence in both countries were taken by left-wing governments, particularly by profeminist politicians or political allies.</p>
<p>Finally, my study highlights the role of international institutional frameworks, in particular the policy frameworks of the UN and EU, in relation to violence against women. These international frameworks of the EU and UN not only served as points of reference for policy making, but also could be used by feminists to make their national governments comply with international agreements. However, as has been the case in the Netherlands, international agencies have also served to correct some deviations in the Dutch policies, particularly questioning the Dutch framing of the problem.</p>
