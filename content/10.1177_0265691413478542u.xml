<sec id="sec41-0265691413478542u"><title>Martyn Housden and David J Smith, eds, <italic>Forgotten Pages in Baltic History: Diversity and Inclusion</italic>, Rodopi: Amsterdam and New York, 2011; 332 pp.; 9789042033153, €68.00 (pbk)</title>
<sec id="sec42-0265691413478542u"><title><bold>Reviewed by:</bold> Andres Kasekamp, <italic>University of Tartu, Estonia</italic></title>
<p>This <italic>Festschrift</italic> comprises 14 articles by German, Baltic and Anglo-American colleagues and students of John Hiden, Professor Emeritus of the University of Bradford. Though <italic>Festschriften</italic> are often heterogeneous, this volume succeeds in having a relatively coherent theme. It reflects the fact that though Hiden began his career as a historian of German diplomacy, his focus during the past two decades has been the German minority in the Baltic states and the remarkable cultural autonomy that they achieved during the period of independence between the two world wars. The bulk of the articles could roughly be categorized into four groups: questions of national identity; diplomatic history of the 1920s; minorities in the interwar independent republics, in particular Baltic German intellectuals who championed cultural autonomy; and memory politics – the contested collective remembrance and commemoration of the Second World War Soviet and Nazi occupations and their political uses today.</p>
<p>Within the first of these four groups Rimantas Miknys and Darius Staliūnas discuss the identity types of ‘old’ and ‘new’ Lithuanians at the <italic>fin de siècle</italic> through the eyes of those who considered themselves as both Lithuanian and Polish. Andrejs Plakans traces the historical development of the distinct eastern region of Latvia known as Latgale. Joachim Tauber shows how similarly German military occupation authorities during the First and Second World Wars looked down upon the Lithuanians and used the concept of ‘culture’ to justify their superiority.</p>
<p>In the second group of essays Marko Lehti looks at the noble, but failed attempt to create a Baltic League in 1920, when diplomats of Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania, Poland and Finland idealistically pursued regional integration as the means for securing international peace. Martyn Housden examines the achievements of the League of Nations in the Baltic Sea region in the 1920s regarding returning prisoners of war, epidemics and territorial autonomy and shows how this work presaged the concept of ‘human security’ in vogue at the UN today.</p>
<p>The third group of essays focuses on ethnic minorities, more precisely, prominent individual thinkers among the Germans of Estonia and Latvia in the 1920s and 1930s, who theorized about the status of loyal minorities in new nation states. Jörg Hackmann introduces an unknown book manuscript by Werner Hasselblatt, who drafted the Estonian cultural autonomy law of 1925, Michael Garleff analyses the historiography on Paul Schiemann, and Martyn Housden and David Smith compare Schiemann with Ewald Ammende and the leading Estonian-Russian intellectual Mikhail Kurchinskii. Of these, Schiemann was clearly the most outstanding figure (the subject of a monograph by Hiden). The editor of a German newspaper in Riga, a member of the Latvian parliament, and committed opponent of the Nazis, he was a driving force in the creation of the European Nationalities Congress where he propagated the unique example of non-territorial autonomy pioneered by Estonia as an example for other European states to follow.</p>
<p>The final, and most polemical set of essays deals with memory politics, which has become a hot topic in Baltic scholarship since the relocation of the Soviet war memorial, ‘the Bronze soldier’, from central Tallinn in 2007. David Smith discusses the ‘war of monuments’ in Estonia, focusing on the mainly ethnically Russian border town of Narva and its Swedish heritage from the Great Northern War. Eva-Clarita Pettai analyses the work of the historical commissions established by the presidents of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania and shows how Western and Baltic historians involved in the work of these commissions have often talked past one another and have proceeded from completely different underlying assumptions. Erwin Oberländer discusses the usage of the term ‘genocide’ and whether crimes against humanity committed by the Nazis and Soviets in Latvia are comparable. The volume concludes with a thought-provoking and wide-ranging essay by Lithuanian political philosopher Leonidas Donskis.</p>
<p>There are a couple of essays which fall outside of the categories delineated above. Frank Nesemann examines how the concept of autonomy was understood by Count Fabian Steinheil, a Baltic German who served as Governor-General of the Tsarist Grand Duchy of Finland. Valters Ščerbinskis dissects prime minister Kārlis Ulmanis’s coup d’état of 1934 in Latvia. This is certainly not a forgotten page, but rather a central episode, which, however, has regrettably thus far not received any adequate treatment in English. Ščerbinskis remedies this admirably and his article confirms that a <italic>Festschrift</italic> is not necessarily a volume for manuscripts on marginal topics which have been waiting in drawers, but can be a venue for the publication of important research. In sum, this is a book which historians of the Baltic region and those with a wider interest in national minorities will certainly find of considerable value.</p>
