<abstract>
<p>Nanocrystalline mesoporous silver vanadate oxides were successfully prepared using a ball milling process. Under the optimal conditions, the silver vanadate oxides sample milled at 12 h (SVO12) powder has larger Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface area (5.81 m<sup>2</sup>/g as opposed to 0.02 m<sup>2</sup>/g) than the starting silver vanadate oxides. The photocatalytic activity of the milled silver vanadate oxides was higher than that of unmilled silver vanadate oxides. The SVO12 exhibits the best photocatalytic activity; it has a reaction rate constant (<italic>k</italic><sub>app</sub>) of 0.11 min<sup>−1</sup>, much higher than that of unmilled silver vanadate oxides (<italic>k</italic><sub>app</sub> = 0.02 min<sup>−1</sup>). The photoactivity enhancement is due to increasing photoabsorption efficiency and improving reaction/diffusion of molecules through the mesoporous structure.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Semiconductor photocatalysts have been extensively studied for environmental remediation and energy conversion purposes. Among the many semiconductor photocatalysts investigated, TiO<sub>2</sub> is the most widely employed. There are two limitations for TiO<sub>2</sub> being an effective photocatalyst. Owing to the relatively high energy band gap (3.2 eV), sunlight cannot be effectively utilized to drive TiO<sub>2</sub> photocatalytic reactions. A second drawback is that the relatively rapid recombination of photogenerated charges of TiO<sub>2</sub> limits the degradation rates of pollutants. Recently, the porous structure of macro/mesoporous TiO<sub>2</sub> has been reported as effective to enhance its photocatalytic activity, in which supramolecular templates of various surfactants were used.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1740349912440933">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1740349912440933">2</xref></sup> However, the template process for the preparation of porous TiO<sub>2</sub> requires high-temperature calcination (673 K or higher) to obtain good crystallinity of TiO<sub>2</sub> and eliminate the supramolecular templates. A simple and template-free route to obtain porous and visible-light active photocatalyst is desirable. Ball milling has proven to be a very effective route in preparing nano-sized porous powders, which can cause not only a reduction in particle size, but also a structural change through the imposition of impact and friction forces.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1740349912440933">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1740349912440933">4</xref></sup> In the present work, we demonstrated the preparation of nanosized silver vanadium oxide through the ball milling process, without using a template. Photodecomposition of benzene was selected as a model reaction to evaluate the effect of the ball milling time on the physico-chemical properties and the photocatalytic performance of silver vanadium oxides since benzene is a common atmospheric indoor and industrial air pollutant.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1740349912440933">5</xref></sup></p>

<title>Catalyst preparation</title>
<p>Silver nitrate (AgNO<sub>3</sub>) and ammonium vanadate (NH<sub>4</sub>VO<sub>3</sub>) were used as the silver and vanadium precursors, respectively. In a typical procedure, 0.1 M AgNO<sub>3</sub> (60 ml) was added drop-wise to 0.1 M NH<sub>4</sub>VO<sub>3</sub> (20 ml) under constant stirring for 30 min. The pH of the mixture was adjusted to 7 using ammonia solution. After the mixture was maintained at room temperature for 24 h, the suspended solution was poured into a 100 ml Teflon-lined stainless autoclave and heated at 413 K for 4 h. After cooling to room temperature, the obtained light orange slurry was filtered, washed several times using distilled water to remove NO<sup>3−</sup> and NH<sup>4+</sup> residues, and dried at 383 K for 6 h. This sample was denoted as SVO. To prepare nano-sized silver vanadate oxides, the as-prepared silver vanadate oxides (16 g) and ethanol solution (114 g) were milled in a high-energy ball milling machine at the speed of 700 r/min using 500 ml zirconia vial and zirconia balls of 0.05 mm diameter at ambient temperature. The ball-to-powder weight ratio was 38:1. During the ball milling process, the milling was paused for various times (6–24 h) to collect a small amount of the suspension for analysis. After that the as-prepared solid precipitate of silver vanadate oxides was dried at 373 K for 24 h. Samples SVO6, SVO12, SVO18 and SVO24 correspond to milling times of 6, 12, 18 and 24 h, respectively.</p>

<title>Sample characterization</title>
<p>The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the powders were measured using an X-ray diffractometer (Panalytical X’Pert PRO) with Cu radiation (λ = 0.15418 nm) in the 2<italic>θ</italic>-range from 10° to 60°. The surface morphology was examined using a field emission scanning electron microscope (Hitachi S-3000N). Chemical properties of the catalyst surface were determined using a diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) cell with a Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrophotometer (Perkin-Elmer spectrum GX). The DRIFTS cell was equipped with a heating cartridge controlled by a proportional–integral–differential (PID) controller (REX-P200). During the experiment, 120 scans were accumulated; these were recorded at a resolution of 4 cm<sup>−1</sup> in the region of 4000–1000 cm<sup>−1</sup>; an MCT detector was used.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1740349912440933">6</xref></sup> The spectra were presented in the Kubelka–Munk mode and some of the selected infrared (IR) peaks were deconvoluted into several Gaussian curves to obtain individual intensities of the specific peaks. The samples were degassed in situ under purging nitrogen flow (10 ml/min) at 523 K for 30 min prior to the IR measurements. The surface area and pore volume of the as-prepared samples were determined using a volumetric sorption analyzer (Micromeritics ASAP 2020). The samples were degassed at 473 K in vacuum condition for a period of at least 4 h prior to measurements. The nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms were measured over a relative pressure (<italic>P</italic>/<italic>P</italic><sub>0</sub>) range from approximately 10<sup>−3</sup> to 0.995. The surface areas were calculated by Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) equation using adsorption data in <italic>P</italic>/<italic>P</italic><sub>0</sub> ranging from 0.06 to 0.2. The pore size distributions were determined from the analysis of the adsorption isotherm, using the Barret–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) algorithm. The total pore volumes were estimated from the adsorbed N<sub>2</sub> amount at <italic>P</italic>/<italic>P</italic><sub>0</sub> = 0.973.</p>

<title>Photocatalytic activity evaluation</title>
<p>Each photoreaction was conducted in an annular photoreactor containing 0.05 g of photocatalyst evenly spread on a Pyrex tube.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1740349912440933">7</xref></sup> Prior to the experiments, the samples were pre-treated in situ using a dry N<sub>2</sub> flow (100 ml/min) at 383 K for 30 min. A certain amount of liquid benzene was injected into the photoreactor, yielding a saturation concentration of 906 ppm. Then, the photoreactor was kept in the dark for 60 min to achieve gas–solid adsorption equilibrium, a white daylight lamp (TFC, FL10W-EX) was turned on. The outlet gas was sampled and determined using a quadrupole mass spectrometer (SRS QMS300) at regular intervals. In addition, in situ DRIFT technique coupled with MS at the gas outlet was applied to simultaneously monitor the adsorption of benzene on the catalyst surface and the composition of the effluent vapors.</p>

<title>Results and discussion</title>
<p>The XRD patterns of bulk silver vanadate oxides and the silver vanadate oxides milled for various times are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1740349912440933">Figure 1</xref>. The reflections of α-Ag<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub> broadened with the increase of the milling time, due to the decrease of the grain size; moreover, the increase of a new phase was formed during milling. Characteristic peak of the new phase is indexed to the standard cards of Ag<sub>0.35</sub>V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> (JCPDS 28-1027). The new phase of Ag<sub>0.35</sub>V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> may result from the repeated welding, fracturing and rewelding of the ball milling process.</p>

<p>The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the samples are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1740349912440933">Figure 2(a)</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1740349912440933">(e)</xref>. Before milling, the particle size of the silver vanadate oxides was from a few µm to a few tens of µm. The average particle size was decreased rapidly by deformation and fragmentation mechanism to about 300 nm after 6 h milling and to about 200 nm after 12 h milling. It also can be seen that when the ball milling time is 24 h, the aggregation degree of the sample is seemingly higher than that of the sample ball milled for 12 h. Thus, when the ball milling time is longer than the optimum time, with the increase in the ball milling time, the fresh surfaces formed by high-energy ball milling possess high surface energy and prefer to agglomerate. In order to determine the aggregation degree of the sample, an experiment investigating the specific surface area was made. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1740349912440933">Table 1</xref> shows the milled samples had much higher surface area, pore volume and pore size than the values for the unmilled sample. Besides, when the ball milling time is longer than 12 h, with the increase in the ball milling time, the specific surface area of the sample decreases.</p>

On the basis of the Brunauer, Deming, Deming and Teller (BDDT) classification,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1740349912440933">8</xref></sup> the adsorption/desorption isotherm of unmilled silver vanadate oxides belongs to a typical type II, which is characteristic of the physical adsorption of gases by non-porous solids. In contrast, SVO12, SVO18 and SVO24 had type IV adsorption with a H3 hysteresis loop, indicating a mesoporous characteristic. SVO12, SVO18 and SVO24 possess more porosity in the adsorption volumes of these pores, which is due to the milling effect on the texture properties. The BET surface area, total pore volume and pore size of the optimal resulting SVO12 are 5.8 m<sup>2</sup>/g, 0.042 cm<sup>3</sup>/g and 25.2 nm, respectively, as compared to those (i.e. 0.02 m<sup>2</sup>/g, 0.001 cm<sup>3</sup>/g and 0.001 nm) of the starting SVO.</p>
