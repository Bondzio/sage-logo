<p><italic>The Volunteer Management Handbook</italic>, second edition, is a worthwhile, substantial book for any Volunteer Resource Manager (VRM). Although it veers back and forth from the practical to theoretical, its sixteen chapters will inspire and equip readers to tackle previously murky or uncharted areas. Throughout the book, the most compelling material includes practical examples and scenarios that VRMs can potentially incorporate directly into their work.</p>
<p>With chapters written by academics, consultants, and nonprofit professionals, the book offers the latest research and best practices to help develop, expand, or revamp numerous areas of volunteer programs. One of the book’s strengths is its unrelenting support of VRMs. In the first chapter, a look back at volunteer management since the 1960s, the authors point out that “previous models have not adequately addressed the personal and professional growth of the individual volunteer manager” (p. 20). This chapter also includes an empirically based model, based on studies done with seven practitioners, and questionnaires sent to hundreds of members of the Association of Volunteer Administrators. The resulting model, the first of its kind, outlines seven requisite professional competencies needed to oversee an effective volunteer program.</p>
<p>The chapter on volunteer demographics discusses the changes among volunteer applicants in recent years, cautions against making stereotypic assumptions, and offers helpful insights about the values, needs, habits, and abilities of groups identified as various generations such as boomer, X, Y, and even Z. The authors also provide an intriguing look at stages of volunteering from childhood, to early and middle adulthood, to the senior years. An excellent chart including the physical, social-emotional, and cognitive aspects of each stage, points out the implications for volunteerism (p. 36). Study of this material will assist VRMs not only with volunteer placement but also with recognition, and orientation and training.</p>
<p>The more years I spend as a VRM, the more I understand the significance of developing apt position descriptions. I therefore value the advice of authors Cheryle N. Yallen and Barbara K. Wentworth in their chapter, “Assessment, Planning, and Staffing Analysis.” The authors provide an excellent explanation of competency modeling, which ties job analysis to the organization’s goals. The chapter includes templates that guide the reader through an exercise of preparing a sample position description.</p>
<p>The chapter entitled “Policy Development for Volunteer Involvement” is exceptional. Writing policy to guide safe and effectual engagement of volunteers is complex and can be confounding, but when done properly, it is a triumph. Author Linda Graff explains that policies are so complicated because they accomplish much: they embody values and beliefs, are tied to an organization’s mission, affect procedures, and are ever changing. Because of this complexity and, to be honest, the chore of writing policy, there is a temptation to overlook its importance. Graff responds, “Simply put, volunteer work has become far too important . . . to function in a policy void” (p. 156). Without policies, a volunteer program risks undermining the professionalism of the involved volunteers. Graff also prudently points out the connection of policy to liability management, one of the most compelling reasons policies should exist. The last portion of this chapter consists of helpful, practical samples of a variety of risk management policies ranging from day-to-day details such as “Backup for Volunteers on Duty” and “Volunteer Driving” to the more difficult-to-articulate topics such as “Relationships with Clients” and “Volunteers as Agents.” Graff adds to the list of potential policies with sections on “Policies as Values and Belief Statements,” “Policies as Rules,” and “Policies as Program Improvement Tools.” The chapter is rounded out with the helpful section “How to Write Policies for Volunteer Programs,” and includes templates and checklists.</p>
<p>Similarly, there are some excellent suggestions in the subsequent chapter, “Orientation, Welcoming Volunteers into the Organization.” This chapter clarifies how orientation differs from training and how the afore-defined policies should be shared with new volunteers. There is a useful checklist (p. 230), tips on delivery such as using technology (which is expected these days), and recommendations for using veteran volunteers.</p>
<p>Another strong chapter, again authored by Linda Graff, addresses risk management. This can be intimidating territory and should be read closely. Risk management is critical because “risks may cause harm to individuals or the organization itself, potentially threatening the organization’s future sustainability and mission accomplishment” (p. 323). The chapter’s advice includes seeking out industry standards and finding help to identify legal precedents. A useful discussion and corresponding worksheet are provided to assess and prioritize risks among volunteer activities (p. 345). There is also specific advice about preparing position descriptions, working with clients, staffing events, handling confidential information, and more—all from the perspective of risk management.</p>
<p>The final chapters handle evaluation, confirming that reporting numbers of hours and volunteers is not enough: volunteers want to know that their efforts have been worthwhile. Author Jeffrey L. Brudney wisely points out, “volunteers may derive motivation from learning about the value of their efforts and the results they help to bring about for organizations and their clients” (p. 364). There is a thorough discussion of the purpose of evaluation and an interesting and informative statement on the value of volunteering with suggestions on calculating the economic worth of volunteers for organizations, volunteers themselves, and clients. The author points out that this endeavor remains one of the most enduring and controversial questions in volunteer management and can be harmful. Placing monetary value on volunteer services might actually undervalue the work of a volunteer since volunteer support can be difficult to measure and could be considered intangible. But it can also be necessary to determine if developing a volunteer program is a worthwhile investment of resources. Samples of evaluations distributed to any of the above-listed stakeholders would be a welcome addition to this chapter.</p>
<p>I found the chapters on volunteer recruitment and volunteer performance management intriguing, but less useful. Chapter 8, “The Latest Approach to Volunteer Recruitment, Competency—Competence Pathways and Volunteer Resource Management Systems,” describes a systematic process of recruitment, recognizing that VRMs require efficiency in their volunteer selection process. The attractive aspect is its sense of logic, structure, and transparency; the challenge is the commitment and preparation required to put such a system in place, should an organization wish to commit to this approach.</p>
<p>For readers of <italic>The Volunteer Management Handbook</italic> who were not content with its 400-plus page heft, editor Tracy Connors has capitalized on the capabilities of technology and made additional chapters available online. Similar in size to the book’s chapters, the digital chapters dive deeper into topics of volunteerism such as Social Media and Volunteer Programs, Mission Fulfillment (Even During Challenging Times), and National, State, and Local Community Programs for Volunteer Resource Managers. I commend the editor and publishers for expanding the book in this manner.</p>
<p><italic>The Volunteer Management Handbook</italic>, second edition, covers a wide breadth of material and is remarkably up-to-date. Researchers will find data on and suggestions for tools in nonprofit areas will discover strategies and approaches to enhance their studies. Finally, VRMs who invest in this book are sure to discover material researched by expert authors that will unquestionably prompt program updates and refinements.</p>
