<p>Mantena’s story begins with a brief account of the 1857 Sepoy Mutiny and the transformative effects of this rebellion on Henry Sumner Maine and by implication on the practices and nature of the British imperial project. In military terms, the mutiny was a rather ephemeral and insignificant event, yet for Maine, as Mantena stresses, it represented ‘the greatest fact in all Anglo-Indian history’ (p. 1). It vividly pointed to the failure of what Maine referred to as the ‘liberal enterprise’, namely the attempt to assimilate difference and thereby to prefigure modernity. Taking this as a starting point, <italic>Alibis of Empire</italic> argues succinctly and persuasively that 1857 represented a rupture in the liberal pedagogical project of modernisation and assimilation. As civilising justifications lost their purchase, the distinction between modern and traditional society hardened and the notion that the latter ought to be protected and its institutions preserved emerged. Imperial rule began to be construed as indispensable to protecting native society from external and internal forces, as well as, or perhaps mostly, from itself. In this sense, so Mantena argues, ‘native society’ functioned ‘both as pretext and solution, as an alibi for the <italic>fait accompli</italic> of empire’ (p. 11). Describing ‘native society’ as pretext ‘and’ solution, rather than merely the latter, Mantena also moves beyond purely cultural-constructivist historical interpretations of ‘native’ society, customs and usages, as well as the politically more explicit arguments of scholars such as Mahmood Mamdani. Put simply, Mantena argues that once early nineteenth century liberal universalism gave way to culturalist alibis, as well as the entailing idea of incommensurability, the notion of indirect rule became entrenched in British imperial policy. This ideological stance, as it were, produced new racialisations and racial categories that clearly located the failure of the civilising mission with the indigenous population rather than with the structure and/or nature of imperial rule.</p>
<p>The book is divided into five main chapters, an introduction on the ideological origins of indirect rule and a Coda. Chapter One surveys the crisis of early nineteenth century imperial ideology and contextualises liberalism’s main advocates, in particular John Stuart Mill and James Fitzjames Stephen. It then compares these worldviews to Maine’s interventions. Chapter Two covers the ‘invention of traditional society’ and its relation to Maine’s status/contract dichotomy, as well as the stadial model of society. This sheds light on the ways in which ‘late’ imperial ideology depended on the idea of ‘native society’ and it spells out the reasons why scientific knowledge of the ‘native’ purportedly represented ‘the’ epistemic antidote to uprisings such as the Sepoy Mutiny and indeed all other ‘outbursts of terrified fanaticism’ (pp. 4, 49, 153). The crux of the book lies, however, in Chapter Three, which deals with Maine’s efforts to codify Anglo-Indian law, and Chapter Four, which engages in a riveting discussion of the pre-eminence of collective property (as opposed to individual property). These two chapters also outline how the imposition of English-style codification tended to arrest the elasticity of Hindu law by rigidifying native rules beyond previous practices (p. 108). Finally, Chapter Five presents Maine’s defence of native society as an authentic system of organisation of societies threatened by ‘insecurity’ and ‘instability’—two concepts Mantena revisits frequently. Overall <italic>Alibis of Empire</italic> is an outstanding scholarly work—a very well-structured essay that makes its argument with great coherence and persuasiveness.</p>
<p>I would like, however, to highlight some points for reflection, starting with the Coda which briefly discusses earlier readings of liberalism and empire by Uday Mehta, Sankar Muthu, Jennifer Pitts, Thomas Holt and Partha Chatterjee. It would have been fascinating, for example, to see Mantena directly engage Mehta’s argument that the most influential liberal justifications of Empire were rooted in ‘<italic>infinite</italic> patience’ to ‘serve and realize a future’ which was strangely indistinguishable from missionaries’ eschatological purposefulness and which allowed indefinite deferral of its realisation. In <italic>Liberalism and Empire</italic> (n. 51), Mehta suggests that ‘the permanence of the British Empire in India assum[ed] greater tenacity…after the mutiny in 1857’. While Mantena’s argument remains convincing, closer attention to arguments about how imperial paternalism abated so swiftly would have helped contextualise this book’s own contributions. It would have been interesting too, to learn about the anxieties and sensibilities the Empire underwent after the ‘failure’ to create people who were ‘Indian in colour and blood’ but ‘British in taste and morals’. Likewise, while early nineteenth century liberals like John Stuart Mill or Tocqueville clearly defended European rule over non-European people, I wonder whether Muthu’s work and indeed the three-part anti-imperialism definition of humanity, can be used to narrate (or partly illuminate) the ideological ascendency of indirect rule. Did Muthu’s Rousseau, Diderot, Herder, Kant and their idea(s) of ‘incommensurability’ resulting from universal ‘cultural agency’ inform Maine or Stephen’s understanding of traditional society?</p>
<p>Mantena offers a careful survey of racial and other categorisations springing from culturalist alibis, as well as their mutually incubating relationship with ‘native society’. The processes through which these racialisations and categorisations became translated into practices of rule, and their logical priors and intellectual genealogies remain elusive.</p>
<p>Mantena’s insights into ‘culture’ and ‘civilisation’, particularly her discussion of the universalist project of ‘civilisation’ versus the notion of deep-seated ‘cultural’ differences are, like the rest of her book, stimulating. One wonders, however, whether her approach may not have gained by a further exploration of the evolution and historical semantics of these concepts. For instance, complicating ‘culture’ and ‘civilisation’ <italic>à la</italic> Zygmunt Bauman or Philippe Bénéton might help nicely to address this study to the Empire’s anxiety-laden denial of cultures and civilisations in the plural.</p>
<p>In short, <italic>Alibis of Empire</italic> is a valuable contribution to the lively ongoing debate about liberalism and nineteenth century imperialism, as well as to the growing literature on the interconnections between liberalism, colonialism and mechanics of exclusion. It spans political theory, history, sociology and anthropology, yet with uncompromising rigour. <italic>Alibis of Empire</italic> deserves to be read not only by scholars of the nineteenth century British empire but also by anyone with an interest in theory, colonialism and the pathologisation of ‘indigenous’ social and political structures.</p>
