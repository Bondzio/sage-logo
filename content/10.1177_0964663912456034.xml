<p>This article contributes to debates about gender and punishment by providing a critical analysis of the appeal of Ruth Ellis which took place in 2003, 48 years after her trial and execution in 1955. Utilising original transcripts, the article argues that, despite considerable gains for women in terms of formal equality during the five decades since the trial, ideological/discursive gains have remained more elusive. To this end, comparisons are made between legal discourses activated during the trial and those that featured in the appeal. This allows the identification of continuities within the operation of the legal system, particularly with respect to the subject positions available to women who kill their abusive partners. Specific aspects of the partial defence of provocation are explored, as is its replacement – the ‘loss of control’ defence, effective since 2010. The article concludes by applying Thomas Mathiesen’s concepts of ‘silent’ and ‘hidden’ silencing in order to further illuminate the processes involved in preserving continuities within the legal process with respect to the social control of women.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In September 2003 the appeal of Ruth Ellis, the last woman to be hanged in Britain, was finally heard, 48 years after her execution. The case had been surrounded by controversy since Ruth’s trial and execution in 1955, as evidenced within the popular media, true crime writing and academic literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0964663912456034">Ballinger, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0964663912456034">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0964663912456034">BBC1, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0964663912456034">Goodman and Pringle, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0964663912456034">Hancock, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0964663912456034">Rose, 1993</xref>). The appeal was nonetheless dismissed.</p>
<p>The trial had taken place during a decade in which feminist activism was relatively low, whereas the appeal was heard in an era in which women had achieved considerable gains, largely as a result of the activities of second-wave feminism. Yet while ‘women have undoubtedly benefited from greater economic, civil and political freedom’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0964663912456034">McNay 2004</xref>: p. 171) since the 1950s, ideological progress – following feminist challenges to the discourses of traditional femininity since this era – is more difficult to identify or measure. For example, over the past four decades feminist theorists have noted that the courtroom remains a gendered space that frequently functions as a key arena for observing these discourses in operation when female defendants stand trial; hence, they continue to have an impact on the capacity of the legal system to deliver justice for women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0964663912456034">Ballinger, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0964663912456034">Carlen, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0964663912456034">Worrall, 1990</xref>). This delivery is further compromised through the law’s symbolic superiority in the production of knowledge and truth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0964663912456034">Inglis, 2003</xref>: p. 3) owing to its claim to be objective, value-free and apolitical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0964663912456034">Ballinger, 2011</xref>: p. 109).</p>
<p>This article utilises transcripts from the trial and appeal of Ruth Ellis in order to provide a critical analysis of this issue. In particular, it argues that, in contrast to the easily identifiable economic, civil and political gains experienced by women during the past 50 years, female defendants have made rather less discursive progress since the 1950s, as demonstrated by the lack of new subject positions available to them within the courtroom in the twenty-first century. Morrissey, for example, maintains that even feminist legal discourses rely on a limited range of subject positions and that these frequently mirror mainstream discourses – exemplified in the portrayal of women as lacking in agency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0964663912456034">Morrissey, 2003</xref>: p. 3).</p>
<p>Furthermore, utilising Thomas Mathiesen’s concept of ‘silent silencing’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0964663912456034">Mathiesen, 2004</xref>: p. 22), the article seeks to explain the apparent discrepancy between formal and discursive/ideological gains for women, by identifying the processes involved in maintaining this limited number of subject positions available to women such as Ruth Ellis who stand trial after having killed their abusers. Thus, following Mathiesen, the article will demonstrate how potential new subject positions are ‘silently silenced’ by ‘common sense’ and ‘taken for granted’ discourses deeply embedded within jurisprudence and law, which ultimately allows them to ‘have a disciplining function far outside the ranks of the legal profession itself’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0964663912456034">Mathiesen, 2004</xref>: p. 17). The article argues that this disciplining function played a key role in ensuring that the Ellis appeal was heard through similar discourses in 2003 as prevailed at the original trial, regardless of our increased understanding of the behaviour of abused women who kill their victimisers, including the creation of discourses such as ‘battered women’s syndrome’, through which such cases can now be heard. Within this context the fact that the original verdict was upheld in 2003 was predictable and unsurprising.</p>

<title>Unfinished Business: Contesting and Defending the Original Trial Verdict</title>
<p>Ruth Ellis shot her lover David Blakely on Easter Sunday in 1955. Towards the end of the relationship, David had intensified his use of physical and psychological cruelty towards Ruth, repeatedly leaving her guessing and uncertain about the future ‘as he see-sawed from promising her marriage to ignoring her for days, even weeks, during which he would be involved in other sexual relationships’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0964663912456034">Ballinger, 1996</xref>: p. 13). Psychologically drained from this erratic behaviour to the point where she was taking prescribed medication for her nerves, and physically exhausted from a miscarriage only 10 days earlier – as a result of one of David’s beatings – she finally shot him in front of several witnesses outside a pub in Hampstead.</p>
<p>Within the austere, morally anxious climate of post-war Britain, where the population remained sharply divided by social class, the intrigue and scandal surrounding this case ensured it immediately became a <italic>cause celebre</italic>. During a decade when the moral standards of women were under intense scrutiny, Ruth – who became a single parent at the age of 17 – was variously described as a ‘club-hostess’, ‘model’ and ‘typical West-end tart’, which implied that she was of morally dubious character and had failed to conform to expected standards of respectability. In contrast, David, seven years younger than Ruth, was an ex-public school boy, enjoyed a private income and was considered to be a ‘play-boy’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0964663912456034">Ballinger, 2000</xref>: p. 293; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0964663912456034">Goodman and Pringle, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0964663912456034">Marks and Van den Bergh, 1990</xref>). Details such as these ensured that the case was to achieve iconic status for decades to come.</p>
<p>The focus of this article will be the controversial aspect of Ruth’s defence of provocation, which formed the key ground of the appeal, as will a second controversial aspect of the case – ironically, presented by the Crown in its attempt to strengthen the original verdict – that Ruth had had an accomplice who assisted her in carrying out the murder.</p>
<p>At the trial Ruth had pleaded ‘not guilty’ due to ‘provocation’, and indeed, the extensive amount of evidence that supported the violence she had suffered at the hands of David was never contested, not even by the prosecution:<disp-quote>
<p>I accept fully that there is evidence before the jury that this woman was disgracefully treated by the man who died, and I accept my learned friend’s proposition that it would tend to lead her into an intensely emotional condition, even as that hypothetical person ‘the ordinary reasonable human being’. (DPP2/2430/23271, p. 69)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>However, as the law stood in 1955, no allowance could be made for a ‘cooling off’ period between the time of the provocation and the fatal act carried out in response to it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0964663912456034">Carline, 2005a</xref>: p. 16). Instead, Mr Justice Havers ruled that ‘the whole doctrine relating to provocation depends on the fact that it causes … sudden and temporary loss of self-control’ (DPP2/2430/23271, p. 68). Moreover, the acceptance of the ‘heat of the moment’ retaliation has traditionally been closely linked to how the ‘reasonable man’ would act – involving the notion that the retaliation must be in proportion to the provocation, or that ‘the reasonable person would have reacted in a similar manner’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0964663912456034">Carline, 2005b</xref>: p. 217; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0964663912456034">Lacey, 2000</xref>: p. 91). As Ruth had not had contact with David for two days prior to the shooting, Havers ruled ‘that the evidence in this case does not support a verdict of manslaughter on the grounds of provocation’ (DPP2/2430/23271, p. 71). Extraordinarily, Mr Melford Stevenson, defending, responded by stating that there would be no closing speech on behalf of the defendant, since he did not wish to invite ‘the jury to disregard your Lordship’s ruling’ (DPP2/2430/23271, p. 72). This resulted in the summing-up commencing immediately after the prosecution’s cross-examination of Ruth, which consisted of only one question and ended with a particularly damaging reply:<disp-quote>
<p>Mrs Ellis, when you fired that revolver at close range into the body of David Blakely, what did you intend to do?</p>
<p>It is obvious that when I shot him I intended to kill him. (DPP2/2430/2371, p. 58)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The judge’s ruling effectively left the jury with no choice as to the verdict, and she was found guilty after only 14 minutes of deliberation.</p>
<p>The second contentious aspect of the case related to the claim that Ruth had had an accomplice, Desmond Cussen. While awaiting execution she made this statement:<disp-quote>
<p>I had been drinking Pernod … in Desmond Cussen’s flat and Desmond had been drinking too. We had been drinking for some time. I had been telling Desmond of Blakely’s treatment of me. I was in a terribly depressed state. All I remember is that Desmond gave me a loaded gun. Desmond was jealous of Blakely as in fact Blakely was of Desmond. I would say that they hated each other. I was in such a dazed state that I cannot remember what was said. I rushed out as soon as he gave me the gun. He stayed in the flat. I rushed back after a second or two and said: ‘Will you drive me to Hampstead?’ He did so, and left me at the top of Tanza Road. (Cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0964663912456034">Marks and Van den Bergh, 1990</xref>: pp. 204–205)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Although these circumstances were reported to the police, only a half-hearted attempt was made to locate Cussen, and he was in fact never traced or interviewed on the matter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0964663912456034">Ballinger, 2000</xref>: p. 321).</p>

<title>Five Decades On: The Appeal Hearing</title>
<p>An appeal was not sought after the trial and Ruth Ellis was executed on 13 July 1955, three weeks after being sentenced to death. However, her family’s fight to have the conviction overturned finally resulted in the re-opening of the case in 2003 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0964663912456034">Dyer, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The appeal judges stated that the case was not ‘about the decision as to whether she should have been executed but … whether she should have been convicted of the offence of murder’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0964663912456034">1</xref>
</sup> Hence:<disp-quote>
<p>The appeal … primarily focuses on the ruling of the judge about provocation and the consequent directions to the jury. A further point was taken in [<italic>sic</italic>] the grounds suggesting that, not withstanding that the statutory defence of diminished responsibility had not been created at the date of trial, the court can still conclude that factors that might today have permitted such a defence to succeed, render the conviction in 1955 unsafe. (<italic>Ellis v R</italic>, 2003: p. 2)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The judges acknowledged that David had beaten Ruth on numerous occasions, including one where she was hospitalised, and that 10 days prior to the shooting she had suffered a miscarriage after he had ‘punched her in the stomach.’ They further recognised that, despite acting ‘kind’ and ‘devoted’, he broke all his promises and abandoned her without explanation. In response, Ruth made numerous attempts to contact David by telephone and in person as ‘she remained obsessed by his absence and the unexplained change in his behaviour.’ She also observed him ‘putting his arm around a young woman [and] by now she was persuaded that the deceased might be having an affair with somebody else.’ On the evening of the second day of David’s absence, she was ‘very upset and had “a peculiar idea” that she wanted to kill the deceased … She said that she had not been able to control the peculiar idea that she had formed’ (<italic>Ellis v R</italic>, 2003: pp. 3–4).</p>
<p>Finally, the appeal judges acknowledged the evidence of the only other witness, apart from Ruth herself, to speak on behalf of the defence –a psychologist, Mr Whitaker, who gave expert testimony:<disp-quote>
<p>the situation in which she found herself was one that she was likely to think was absolutely intolerable for her. She was convinced that he would return to her despite further unfaithfulness and that when he did so she would be unable to resist taking him back … women were far … ‘more prone to hysterical reactions than men’. (<italic>Ellis v R</italic>, 2003: p. 5)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Within this context the family’s barrister argued that:<disp-quote>
<p>on the law as it was at the time of trial, the judge was wrong to withdraw the issue of provocation from the jury. It is contended that applying the law as it was in 1955, there was evidence upon which a jury properly directed could have returned a verdict of manslaughter by provocation. (<italic>Ellis v R</italic>, 2003: p. 6)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In other words, ‘since there was unchallenged evidence that at the time of the killing Mrs Ellis was unable to control the impulse to kill the deceased, the issue of provocation should have been left to the jury’ (<italic>Ellis v R</italic>, 2003: p. 7). It was further argued that the conviction for murder should be quashed in order to reflect legal changes that had taken place <italic>since</italic> the trial, such as ‘a much better psychological understanding of what has come to be known as “slow burn provocation”’. Moreover, according to the appellant’s barrister, ‘the court is entitled to set aside the conviction’ for murder in the light of the Homicide Act 1957, which introduced a statutory defence of diminished responsibility (<italic>Ellis v R</italic>, 2003: p. 8).</p>
<p>In response to these arguments, the Crown argued that ‘the only provocative conduct recognised by the Common Law as sufficient’ for reducing an offence from murder to manslaughter ‘was some form of violent act by the deceased and the only exception that was recognised was the finding by a man of his wife in the act of committing adultery’ (<italic>Ellis v R</italic>, 2003: p. 8). Moreover, ‘it is not possible to take the purely statutory defence of diminished responsibility created by … the Homicide Act 1957 and apply it as if it had been enacted at the date of the killing or the date of the trial’ (<italic>Ellis v R</italic>, 2003: p. 9). Additionally, there was no evidence that Ruth had suffered from diminished responsibility and ‘no act that could properly be seen as a provocative act in response to which Mrs Ellis had acted.’ Instead:<disp-quote>
<p>She had responded in a pre-meditated way to the situation in which she found herself, which may have caused her distress, but it was that situation rather than any act or acts of the deceased which caused the distress. It may have been ‘transport of passion’ but it was a calm, deliberate, pre-meditated killing. The plea of provocation is inconsistent with planning and here there was evidence of such planning. (<italic>Ellis v R</italic>, 2003: p. 9)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Lastly, her response to her situation was entirely disproportionate, hence the judge had been ‘entitled to conclude that no reasonable jury could have concluded, even on the version of the facts that were most favourable to Mrs Ellis, that her reaction was not one that a reasonable woman would have had’ (<italic>Ellis v R</italic>, 2003: p. 9).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0964663912456034">
<title>The Ruling</title>
<p>Nearly three months after hearing the appeal the three judges ruled that it should be dismissed on the grounds that ‘we must apply the substantive law of murder as applicable at the time, disregarding the changes brought about by the Homicide Act 1957’ (<italic>Ellis v R</italic>, 2003: p. 9). The verdict could therefore not be ruled unsafe on the grounds of a partial defence of diminished responsibility that did not exist in 1955.</p>
<p>With regard to Mr Justice Havers’s dismissal of the defence based on provocation, the appeal judges accepted that the Crown’s conduct of the case ‘on the basis that there could be no reliance on provocation where the killing was carried out intentionally … did not represent a correct interpretation of the Common Law’. However, this misinterpretation had no impact on the outcome of the appeal because ‘the question … is not whether the Crown’s view may have been wrong but whether the judge’s ruling was in any way based upon such an approach’ (<italic>Ellis v R</italic>, 2003:10). The judges were adamant this had not been the case:<disp-quote>
<p>in no sense was he ruling that, because Mrs Ellis had admitted that the killing was intentional, her guilt must follow … that was not the basis upon which he ruled that the issue of provocation was not to be considered by the jury. <italic>It follows that this mistaken view of the law had no impact upon the conviction of Mrs Ellis for murder</italic>. (<italic>Ellis v R</italic>, 2003: p. 10; emphasis added)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The appeal judges were able to reconcile the ‘unchallenged evidence that over a significant period of time, the deceased had subjected Mrs Ellis to violent conduct’, including the beating that preceded the miscarriage, with their refusal to accept provocation as a defence by arguing that, if she ‘had reacted immediately to one of these violent episodes then there can be little doubt, both on the law as it was at the time of trial and as it is now, that there would have been a clear issue of provocation that the judge would have been obliged to leave to the jury’ (<italic>Ellis v R</italic>, 2003: pp. 10–11). Thus, the fact that a 10 day interval had occurred since the latest violent attack further legitimised the original rejection of the provocation defence.</p>
<p>Apart from challenging Mr Justice Havers’s refusal to accept a defence of provocation, Mr Mansfield had also asked for permission to submit new evidence to support his claim that Ruth has suffered from Battered Woman Syndrome (BWS). The judges refused to hear this evidence on the grounds that this condition was unknown at the time of the trial.</p>
<p>The second controversial aspect of the case was raised by Mr Perry on behalf of the Crown, who sought permission to present new evidence relating to the claim that Desmond Cussen had acted as Ruth’s accomplice. This too was refused owing to ‘significant problems that would have to be overcome before the Crown could rely upon this evidence … [hence] we considered that the interests of justice did not require us to embark upon this difficult exercise’ (<italic>Ellis v R</italic>, 2003: p. 13). However, if such evidence <italic>had</italic> been heard, it was likely that it would have considerably <italic>strengthened</italic> the case against Ruth, since it could suggest that ‘this killing was even more premeditated than it must have seemed at the time of trial … it would suggest that this was a case very, very far removed from the sort of case in which the law recognises a sudden and temporary loss of self control’ (<italic>Ellis v R</italic>, 2003: pp. 12–13).</p>
<p>Thus, despite nearly half a century of controversy over what has almost universally become regarded as an incompetent and inadequate defence, culminating in a contentious execution, and not withstanding the public outcry at the time of the trial,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0964663912456034">2</xref>
</sup> as evidenced in National Archive documents (HO291/235, HO291/236), <sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0964663912456034">3</xref>
</sup> when the Ellis appeal was finally heard in 2003, it <italic>strengthened </italic>her original conviction by dismissing it on legal grounds and rejecting the possibility that the conduct of the legal actors involved had been questionable. The gulf between what has widely become regarded as a lack of social justice by both scholars and casual observers, and the judiciary’s insistence that the outcome of the case was a legitimate representation of justice according to the law, is thus wider than ever. At its starkest, the dismissal of the appeal further <italic>legitimated </italic>the execution of a woman who had endured physical and psychological abuse over a protracted period, to the extent of suffering a miscarriage as a consequence of what was to be the last of those beatings by her partner, and who furthermore had been poorly served by a defence that was dismissed <italic>before</italic> the trial was over, resulting in the failure to provide a closing speech in a <italic>capital</italic> case.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0964663912456034">4</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Yet, on the other hand, within a culture where Enlightenment reasoning is taken for granted and ‘facts speak for themselves’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0964663912456034">Inglis, 2003</xref>: p. 172), the appeal judges’ ruling that ‘it is not possible to take the purely statutory defence of diminished responsibility created [in] 1957 and apply it as if it had been enacted at the date of the killing or the date of trial’ (<italic>Ellis v R</italic>, 2003: p. 9), appears incontrovertible and self-explanatory – beyond common sense. Nonetheless, when juxtaposed, these two positions emphasise the persistence of the chasm between social and legal justice in the twenty-first century and challenge the nature and extent of the progress achieved towards gender equality within the legal system since the 1950s. This challenge is reinforced by Mr Mansfield’s attempt to win the appeal on the grounds of BWS, itself a contentious concept (elaborated below) that – arguably – exemplifies the limitations of progress towards gender equality in recent decades.</p>
<p>In short, while the Ellis case has been resolved from a purely legal perspective, for those in pursuit of social justice it remains a troubling example of the long history of social <italic>in</italic>justice that retaliating women have encountered when standing trial for having killed their abusers. The following section explores some of the key arguments behind this claim in relation to the social construction of knowledge and the gendered nature of law.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0964663912456034">
<title>Retaliating Women, Knowledge Production and the Gendered Nature of Law</title>
<disp-quote>
<p>The idea of judicial neutrality is central to current legal ideology in Britain … [Yet] judicial utterances about the characteristics … of females fairly jump from the law reports … [Indeed] for six decades, from 1869 to 1929, British judges wrestled with the problem of whether or not women could be regarded as ‘persons’. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0964663912456034">Sachs, 1976</xref>: p. 104)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To claim that law is gendered is to claim that it is ‘constructed around a masculine subject and an associated set of masculine characteristics’ that reflect male norms and values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0964663912456034">Davies, 1997</xref>: p. 28). Thus, taken for granted legal terms such as ‘the reasonable person’ are imbued with male values because they are socially constructed according to the characteristics of masculinity. As such, masculine constructions are taken as a given and hence remain unspoken in law. Yet, to make assumptions about the population as a whole based on such constructions is to privilege ‘the understanding of the world of the group which has dominated legal and public life: white, middle-class, heterosexual males.’ Their ‘experiences, perceptions and concerns … are defined as normal’ despite the fact that behaviour, reactions and perspectives are all sites of difference according to gender, ‘race, ethnicity, class and sexuality’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0964663912456034">Hunter and Mack, 1997</xref>: p. 182). Thus, experiences and behaviour that fall outside the parameters of this hetero-patriarchal norm are in effect silenced:<disp-quote>
<p>this silencing and exclusion is perpetuated by the adoption of an epistemology which posits the existence of objective knowledge and truth which is universal, transcending time, culture and gender, existing outside the realm of human existence. In this framework, there is one reality, and it applies to us all. This reality however, is constructed by the dominant standpoint, thus maintaining power relations and excluding the reality of divergent perspectives. Hence, the male view of reality becomes universal, and the female reality is excluded, thus perpetuating female subordination.

</p>
<p>The consequent hierarchy of knowledge which flows from this male-centred epistemology has particular benefits for the legal system, which derives legitimacy from its claim to be based on the principles of reason, rationality, objectivity and neutrality, and hence, to possess the tools needed to uncover the ‘truth’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0964663912456034">Lacey et al., 1990</xref>: p. 152; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0964663912456034">Smart, 1989</xref>: p. 11). Through naming its tools for knowledge production ‘due process’ and ‘rule of law’, the legal process and the ‘juridical professionals’ within it enjoy a ‘symbolic domination’ of knowledge production that enables them ‘to declare their opinions and theories as if they were facts’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0964663912456034">Inglis, 2003</xref>: p. 178). As such, the judiciary crowns the pyramid of the hierarchy of credibility.</p>
<p>This double exclusion of the female experience owing to the gendered nature of law <italic>and</italic> the hierarchy of knowledge has specific consequences for legal responses to domestic violence in general, and for the Ellis case in particular, because it is <italic>precisely </italic>due to meaning and reality being constructed predominantly from a male-centred perspective that retaliating women have experienced severe difficulty in having a defence of provocation accepted.</p>
<p>The origin of this defence can be traced to the seventeenth century, when to the ‘judicial mind there was no higher degree of provocation that for a husband to find himself cuckolded. Delivering a fatal blow was regarded as fully morally justified, such was the affront to a man’s honour’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0964663912456034">Burton, 2001</xref>: p. 254). Not until 1946 did the judiciary finally accept that the defence of provocation could also be utilised by wives who had killed their husbands (Taylor in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0964663912456034">O’Donovan, 1991</xref>: p. 226). The provocation defence is thus a powerful example of ‘the manner in which law has been constructed from a male perspective, according to male standards, so that it either excludes, devalues or distorts women’s experiences and motivations’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0964663912456034">Fox, 1995</xref>: p. 171). In turn, this helps to explain why male domestic killers have frequently been able to utilise ‘provocation’ as an excuse for their crime, while women, historically the property of men, have not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0964663912456034">Burton, 2001</xref>: p. 254; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0964663912456034">O’Donovan, 1991</xref>: p. 224). Instead, due to the gendered nature of law, retaliating women have had to rely on explanations and subsequent defences that confirm stereotypical notions of female characteristics, conduct and behaviour. Thus, while in recent decades the legal system has undeniably made efforts to recognise the specific circumstances in which battered women kill their abusers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0964663912456034">Burton, 2001</xref>: p. 253; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0964663912456034">Carline, 2005a</xref>: p. 29; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0964663912456034">Leader-Elliott, 1997</xref>: p. 166), the specific manner in which the law has adapted to take account of these circumstances remains contentious, with one form of stereotyping replacing another, as exemplified by the widespread adoption of BWS as a partial defence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0964663912456034">Nicolson and Sanghvi, 1993</xref>: p. 735).</p>
<p>Originally introduced to assist women defendants by demonstrating that their ‘actions were reasonable given the circumstances’, BWS was soon appropriated to reinforce traditional discourses of femininity and is now mainly utilised to support the defence of diminished responsibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0964663912456034">Morrissey, 2003</xref>: p. 73; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0964663912456034">Fox, 1995</xref>: p. 182; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0964663912456034">Worrall, 2002</xref>: p. 57). Law’s willingness to adopt BWS as a partial defence may thus be linked to the ease with which it could be made to reflect dominant stereotypes of femininity. Carline notes:<disp-quote>
<p>Whilst significant gains may have been made in relation to the growth of manslaughter over murder convictions, and reduced sentences, this advantage has come at a considerable cost of constructing women in a stereotypical and negative manner. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0964663912456034">Carline, 2005a</xref>: p. 33)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Such stereotyping has detrimental consequences not only for the development of subject positions which can take account of female agency, but also for the inclusion of a wider social context within which violence against women is commonplace:<disp-quote>
<p>the focus on syndromes, psychosis and depressive conditions … empty the woman’s act of external social meaning and act as a ‘safety valve’ for criminal law’s refusal to consider the social context and causes of crime. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0964663912456034">Nicolson, 2000</xref>: p. 171)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Thus, legal changes introduced in recent decades which at first glance appear to be progressive developments in dealing with the specific circumstances surrounding retaliating women, on closer examination turn out to ‘reinforce notions of female inferiority, passivity and weakness’, leading Nicolson to argue that ‘what the law giveth, it also taketh away’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0964663912456034">Nicolson, 2000</xref>: p. 170). It is thus questionable to what extent these developments equal ‘progress’, for while they have undoubtedly resulted in a measure of success in terms of the outcome of individual trials, as evidenced in notorious cases such as those of Thornton, Humphrys and Aluwalia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0964663912456034">Minkes and Vanstone, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0964663912456034">Nicolson and Sanghvi, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0964663912456034">Stanko and Scully, 1996</xref>), the discursive battle continues with little indication that new subject positions are about to become legally recognised. As Jackson notes:<disp-quote>
<p>Legal reform, without a fundamental overhaul of the interpretative background, amounts to little more than tinkering with the edges of systematic and structural injustice. (Cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0964663912456034">Chan, 2001</xref>: p. 169)</p>

</p>
<p>Having de-constructed the gendered nature of law and the hetero-patriarchal nature of judicial knowledge production, feminist analysis is able to identify key issues which were evident in both the Ellis trial and appeal, and remain the focus of feminist debate in the twenty-first century. They include the limited number of subject positions and ‘gender constructions available for women who kill’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0964663912456034">Carline, 2005a</xref>: p. 35); the de-contextualisation of this crime; and the phallocentric nature of legal knowledge production. In what follows, specific aspects of the Ellis appeal ruling are identified in order to demonstrate how continuities within judicial epistemology have contributed towards the maintenance of the chasm between legal and social justice over the past half a century, and thus also towards the inability to deliver justice for retaliating women.</p>

<title>Hidden and Silent Continuities in Law Since 1955</title>
<disp-quote>
<p>[Although] overt discrimination by law on the basis of sex has been more or less eliminated with the attainment by women of full formal status as legal persons … it remains the case that many areas of law are gender-specific in that the discriminations which they enforce are gendered. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0964663912456034">Davies, 1997</xref>: p. 29)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Prior to its replacement with the ‘loss of control’ defence in 2010, the provocation defence had periodically been re-visited and re-formulated since 1955. Yet a definition of it, guaranteeing legal as well as social justice for both men and women, remained elusive, and the Ellis appeal exemplifies the fact that contentious issues within it remained unresolved into the twenty-first century. The following analysis does not seek to provide a detailed or complete account of the legal changes to provocation since 1955. Nor is it intended to challenge the accuracy of the <italic>legal </italic>outcome of the appeal. Instead, it focuses on the hidden and ‘silent’ nature of gendered assumptions that remain deeply embedded within the operation of the judiciary, regardless of the expansion of equality legislation, for it is these very assumptions that can be understood as contributing towards the chasm between social and legal justice for retaliating women. Davies’s words capture the essence of this process:<disp-quote>
<p>The law is seen to be gendered because it takes up abstract gender characteristics in particular ways, while carefully avoiding sexual specificity or overt discrimination on the basis of sex. Using this style of thinking, we could even say that the law prohibits sex discrimination, but entrenches, assumes, and often requires gender discriminations. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0964663912456034">Davies, 1997</xref>: p. 29)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>This process can be observed in the Ellis ruling, when the judges considered two major interrelated aspects of the feminist critique of the provocation defence – qualifying trigger events and time lapse. First, they stated that ‘a violent response … might … be considered not to be unreasonable if the whole background was taken into account. This is the whole basis of the concept of “slow burn provocation”’ (<italic>Ellis v R</italic>, 2003: p. 11). Thus, they demonstrated some recognition of the gendered nature of retaliation in response to provocation and responded to the feminist demand that ‘the context of a history of violence’ must be considered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0964663912456034">Burton, 2001</xref>: p. 253).</p>
<p>Second, they quoted from Lord Hoffman’s ruling in <italic>R v Smith (Morgan) </italic>[2001] that ‘male possessiveness and jealousy should not today be an acceptable reason for loss of self control leading to homicide’ and concluded that ‘we can see no proper basis for distinguishing between male and female behaviour in this regard’ (<italic>Ellis v R</italic>, 2003: pp. 12–13). Here the judges addressed another key feminist critique – the acceptance of provocation based on ‘faithless conduct or disenchantment’ following murder by men of an erring female spouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0964663912456034">Burton, 2003</xref>: p. 280). Their refusal to accept this defence, coupled with their determination to enforce legal equality between the sexes in such cases, thus appears exemplary.</p>
<p>However, in their consideration of the ‘triggering event’, some form of <italic>action</italic> must occur to qualify as justification for retaliation (<italic>Ellis v R</italic>, 2003: p. 11). In 1955, ‘the only provocative conduct recognised by the Common Law as sufficient for these purposes was some form of violent act by the deceased’ (<italic>Ellis v R</italic>, 2003: p. 13). The judges confirmed the contemporary validity of this definition by reiterating that ‘even the modern approach … [requires] something more than mere possessiveness and jealousy’:<disp-quote>
<p>There was no event of the requisite kind that could have triggered this killing after the physical violence preceding the miscarriage. This attack had taken place approximately a fortnight before the killing. (<italic>Ellis v R</italic>, 2003: p. 12)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In short, despite the judges’ reference to ‘slow burn’, this state of mind must still culminate in a qualifying trigger according to the masculine norm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0964663912456034">Munro, 2007</xref>: p. 134). In the Ellis appeal, the failure to do so resulted in ‘slow burn’ being re-defined as ‘inaction’ within a legal definition of provocation where only <bold>‘</bold>the male model of violent response to behaviour qualified as provocative is ruled in’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0964663912456034">O’Donovan, 1991</xref>: p. 224). The judges stated:<disp-quote>
<p>Everything alleged is in reality an <italic>omission</italic> rather than a positive act. Mr Mansfield argues that although omissions they nonetheless involved positive acts. For example the failure to go back to Mrs Ellis is an omission seen in that sense but it involved the positive act of going to the Findlater’s home. Whilst we recognise the force of this argument what ‘provoked’ Mrs Ellis was not the going to the Findlater’s home but the failure to come back to her. (<italic>Ellis v R</italic>, 2003: p. 11 emphasis added)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Yet, it was <italic>precisely</italic> this ‘inaction’ – this ‘omission’ – that fuelled Ruth’s ‘slow burning anger’ throughout the weekend that culminated in the killing. Within the wider context of her relationship with David, the longer the omission lasted, the more she felt provoked, as ‘the fires of her jealous insecurity [were being] continuously stoked during the last week before the murder’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0964663912456034">Hancock, 1989</xref>: p. 185). Moreover, whilst recognising that ‘law operates with an extremely narrow conception of those situations in which an omission can take the place of an act’, it is nevertheless the case that ‘a failure to act is not “just nothing”’ and ‘omission can be as much the cause of an event as acts’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0964663912456034">Norrie, 2001/2006</xref>: pp. 120, 121). The failure to recognise this in both the trial and appeal confirms the continuity of phallocentric<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0964663912456034">5</xref>
</sup> assumptions within legal discourse because it could not, and cannot, comprehend that ‘inaction’ reinforces women’s existing powerlessness and lack of control. As such, inaction or ‘omissions’ are experienced in gender-specific ways and accordingly carry particular meaning; hence, may indeed become part of the ‘trigger event’ where retaliating women are concerned. Law, however, takes a ‘“wholly unrealistically restrictive view” on provocation’ which relates ‘not only to the male model of violent response to behaviour qualified as provocative, but also to the limitation of the notion of provocation to certain actions and incidents’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0964663912456034">O’Donovan, 1991</xref>: p. 224). In short, the gendered nature of the ‘trigger event’ could not, and, in the twenty-first century, still cannot, be articulated or understood within a phallocentric legal structure and culture. O’Donovan notes:<disp-quote>
<p>What seems to be overlooked by defence lawyers and judges is the notion of the ‘slow burn’, that is, the gradual build up in the powerless of feelings of anger and helplessness which eventually erupt, but not necessarily at a moment suitable for the definition of provocation. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0964663912456034">O’Donovan, 1991</xref>: pp. 224–225)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Thus, the lack of a ‘recent’ trigger, and the consequent time lapse in the Ellis case, is in fact typical in cases of retaliating women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0964663912456034">Barnett, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0964663912456034">Burton, 2001</xref>: p. 248; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0964663912456034">Edwards, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0964663912456034">O’Donovan, 1991</xref>). Yet, the appeal judges ruled:<disp-quote>
<p>It was never suggested by Mrs Ellis that she had acted as a result of this earlier violence and it would, in reality, on the evidence have been quite impossible for her so to do [<italic>sic</italic>]. It is an essential feature of such provocation which there is ‘sudden and temporary loss of self control’. (<italic>Ellis v R</italic>, 2003: p. 12)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>This statement affirms the understanding of the law as it stood in 1955, only six years after Lord Devlin had ruled that ‘the further removed an incident is from the crime, the less it counts’ (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0964663912456034">O’Donovan, 1991</xref>: p. 223). However, the judges’ acceptance of Devlin’s ruling in 2003 adds contemporary affirmation to the masculine reaction to violence, associated with an immediate response to provocation as a result of anger, rather than a delayed response as a result of ‘“a state of despair” that may drive an abused woman to kill’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0964663912456034">Burton, 2001</xref>: p. 251; Carline, 2005s: p. 25).</p>
<p>In sum, the Ellis appeal ruling serves as an illustrative example of Nicolson’s claim that ‘what the law giveth, the law taketh away’, for despite the appeal judges’ <italic>inclusion</italic> of a gendered context and <italic>exclusion</italic> of the sexist ‘faithless conduct and disenchantment’ defence, their ruling nevertheless confirmed that the experiences of retaliating women still cannot be accommodated; instead, their knowledge about violence remains subordinated within contemporary law (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0964663912456034">O’Donovan, 1993</xref>: p. 430).</p>

<sec id="section7-0964663912456034">
<title>Immediacy and Subject Positions</title>
<p>The issue of immediacy ‘has engaged feminist and legal scholarship’ since the 1970s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0964663912456034">Edwards, 2010</xref>: p. 226) because a delay is constructed as either leading to revenge or calming down, both of which result in a legal construct within which the person is rational and calculating, and hence, in possession of ‘legal responsibility’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0964663912456034">O’Donovan, 1991</xref>: p. 228). Consequently, it has repeatedly been addressed since 1955, and to some extent discredited, particularly since the cases of Ahluwalia, Thornton and Humphreys during the 1990s, as noted above. Yet, it remains a contentious and gendered issue within law, as the Ellis appeal illustrates. This was reaffirmed with the introduction of the ‘loss of control’ defence in 2010, where, despite the removal of the ‘immediacy principle’, Edwards maintains that ‘a lapse of time will nevertheless be taken into consideration as background circumstances’, weakening this defence to the point where a jury ‘may not concur with her assessment that the killing was justifiable’. This is important because ‘a battered woman’s reaction to her abuser’s violence does not necessarily follow from the severity of the last act of violence…’. Conversely, she may consider ‘that she has a justifiable sense of being seriously wronged, but where the last qualifying trigger is not in itself extremely grave’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0964663912456034">Edwards, 2010</xref>: pp. 226, 233).</p>
<p>Virtually every aspect of Edwards’s critique could have been written specifically for the Ellis case, yet, it is written in response to the latest law reform – loss of control – designed to improve the way in which cases like hers are dealt with – thus revealing the continuity of phallocentric law. This is unsurprising since ‘continuity’ is sustained by the very nature of legal reasoning, where every norm within the ‘system must in some way be validated by a higher reference point which is also within the system’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0964663912456034">Davies, 2007</xref>: p. 160), thus ensuring a self-perpetuating logic and method of reasoning that can only ever consider issues that are already legally recognised:<disp-quote>
<p>Legal methods for determining truth come from within its own system. The rules and procedures by which the content of law is determined are legal rules. Rules of evidence determine what the knower can know, what the ‘relevant facts’ are, the story that the object who is known can bring into the court. Where a contest over knowledge occurs judicial pronouncements as to truth have high status. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0964663912456034">O’Donovan, 1993</xref>: p. 431)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In contrast, the factors by which women’s ‘“difference” is constructed are social’, rather than legal in character and it is this characteristic that excludes them ‘from having their subject positions represented by law’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0964663912456034">Davies, 2007</xref>: p. 161). Thus, the progress in establishing legal equality has had no impact upon creating new <italic>subject</italic> positions for retaliating women since legal changes merely introduce reform to existing subject positions – they do not address women’s subordinate position within the social order where the problem of domestic violence itself is rooted:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Through the reform process law may appropriate new ideas, narratives, or doctrines, but this does not necessarily entail a change to law’s basic technologies of exclusion. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0964663912456034">Davies, 2007</xref>: p. 162)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In other words, relying on law to remedy problems it itself has created – the disqualification of ‘women’s accounts and experiences’ – allows its power as ‘a system of knowledge’ with a monopoly on ‘the definition of events’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0964663912456034">Smart, 1989</xref>: pp. 86, 162) to remain unchallenged:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Law’s power to name its own boundaries enables it to define a particular question as outside its scope and responsibility … the cloak of neutrality hides … the power of the judge as knower, and the difficulties for outgroups in bringing their knowledge to legal attention. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0964663912456034">O’Donovan, 1993</xref>: p. 432)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This continuity of phallocentric law becomes further exposed when considering how <italic>male </italic>subjectivities – through ‘patriarchal narratives of provocation have been incorporated into law and recognised by its hierarchy. They are appropriately validated and have the correct “pedigree”’, hence:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>The subjectivity of men who react suddenly and aggressively to what they see as provocative conditions has been legally valued over that of their … female victims and … over the subjectivity of women who have been assaulted for years and who end it by killing their partners. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0964663912456034">Davies, 2007</xref>: p. 161)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Davies’s analysis has particular significance for cases of separation homicides like Ruth’s – a category usually noted for the over-representation of men whose killing is ‘motivated by possessiveness or jealousy resulting from the breakdown of a relationship’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0964663912456034">Leader-Elliott, 1997</xref>: p. 150) – because it helps to explain why, in sharp contrast to the Ellis ruling, the departure of a <italic>female</italic> spouse – and her subsequent failure to return to her male partner – is not constructed as ‘inaction’ or ‘omission’. On the contrary, despite departing female spouses belonging to the group ‘most likely to be battered or killed’, when male perpetrators stand trial for their murder, separation is understood and accepted as the ‘trigger event’ and can become a mitigating circumstance in itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0964663912456034">Messing and Heeren, 2009</xref>: p. 182). Ironically, then, in her pursuit and murder of an erring partner, Ruth had in fact killed according to ‘a typical masculine pattern’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0964663912456034">Leader-Elliott, 1997</xref>: p. 152) – conforming to the role culturally scripted for men. Thus, the fact that neither David’s departure nor his unfaithfulness were constructed as ‘triggers’ leading to the killing during either the trial or appeal goes to the very heart of phallocentric continuity in law, illustrating what is ‘understood as “normal” in society’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0964663912456034">Norrie, 2001/2006</xref>: p. 121) is itself phallocentric. In this case the taken-for-granted assumption that ‘sexual provocation … claims for itself a constituency almost exclusively masculine’, was revealed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0964663912456034">Leader-Elliott, 1997</xref>: p. 153). In that sense the ruling offers a rare opportunity for the exposure of the historical continuation of deeply embedded – usually hidden – gendered assumptions inherent within legal proceedings, despite substantial progress in implementing legal and formal equality since 1955. Indeed, the ruling is illustrative of the ongoing process whereby legal proceedings ignore ‘the personal … meaning and logic of what happened’ and instead construct a logic and understanding of events built on masculinist official discourse and ‘supplanted by the force of law’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0964663912456034">Inglis, 2003</xref>: p. 16). Had this process not been ongoing, the failure to identify David’s behaviour as the trigger would have been noted for its absence – itself an example of ‘omission’. Instead it serves as another reminder that women’s ‘difference’ is constructed within the social arena, and ‘the narrow law of omissions excludes the social context in order to draw a tight line around those whose conduct has already been constructed as deviant by the state and its various actors’ (Norrie, 2001: pp. 121, 133).</p>
<p>Yet, David’s departure – together with his various affairs and general womanising, including the fact that Ruth had observed him with ‘his arm around a young woman’ shortly before the murder – constituted behaviour amounting to more substantial provocation than that which frequently qualifies as trigger events when contemporary male killers claim provocation as part of their defence in similar circumstances:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>There are plenty of examples in the late twentieth [and twenty-first] century of men successfully pleading provocation relying on what their partners <italic>allegedly</italic> said to them. Not even prosecutors question the confessions of adultery, or taunts about sexual prowess which defendants claim provoked them to kill.

<p>Once again, taken-for-granted assumptions around ‘normality’ are relevant because it is rare for women to kill a departing partner, particularly an abusive one, as Ruth did, for while ‘both men and women are seeking relief from pain induced by separation … they do so in a gendered manner’ (Messing and Heeren, 2008: p. 284). Ruth however, failed ‘to conform to approved “gendered scripts’”, which resulted in her subject position becoming that of ‘an unintelligible gender’ – rendering her version of events silent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0964663912456034">Carline, 2005b</xref>: p. 216), thus closing down the opportunity for a more complex explanation in both the trial and appeal. Consequently, her anguish went unrecognised as mitigation and the meaning that her act carried for her as an individual could not be understood:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>requirements of criminal law defences produce and perpetuate the silencing of women, especially in relation to domestic violence. This silencing occurs due to the dominance of the male gender … [resulting in] the voices and experiences of women [being] ignored. Reality and truth is [<italic>sic</italic>] based upon the male voice and the female voice is excluded. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0964663912456034">Carline, 2005a</xref>: p. 24)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The ongoing failure to create new subject positions for retaliating women such as Ruth meant that, as in 1955, her identity in 2003 still carried the threat of a ‘crisis of sexual difference’ and her femininity could appear only ‘as inappropriate and out of place’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0964663912456034">Rose, 1993</xref>: pp. 50–51). In turn, this failure to create new subject positions can be related to the stability and continuity of the actual <italic>operation</italic> of law – particularly the ‘ability to impose its definition on events of everyday life’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0964663912456034">Smart, 1989</xref>: p. 4). This ability is reinforced by its position at the top of the hierarchy of credibility where knowledge production is concerned, which means that, once state representatives who speak through legal discourses ‘have determined what is “true”, limits and controls are set on the production of other alternative, resistant truths’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0964663912456034">Inglis, 2003</xref>: p. 6), thus, further enhancing its operational stability.</p>
<p>In sum, despite the apparent ‘progressive’ changes to law since the Ellis trial, the outcome of her appeal nevertheless symbolises the <italic>maintenance</italic> of the gendered nature of law in particular and the social order in general. Utilising Mathiesen’s concept of ‘silent silencing’, this article now explores some key factors which sustain this resilience to structural changes within the legal system. Implicit to this analysis is the identification of processes that prevent new subject positions from developing, despite protracted feminist critiques of phallocentric law.</p>

<title>Silence Unplugged</title>
<disp-quote>
<p>Jurisprudence contains a peculiar potential to transform political questions of conflict into apparently neutral, technical and professional questions – something which … silences the rest of us when confronting the questions. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0964663912456034">Mathiesen, 2004</xref>: p. 17)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In his book <italic>Silently Silenced</italic> Thomas Mathiesen is concerned with the way in which ‘silencing’ works ‘as an insidious force’ to prevent political action from developing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0964663912456034">Mathiesen, 2004</xref>: p. 14). The burgeoning volume of feminist critique represents a sustained challenge to phallocentric law and indicates vigorous political activity. Yet, as demonstrated above, the response to this onslaught of activism has manifested itself in legal <italic>reform</italic> to the <italic>existing</italic> system, rather than the creation of new subject positions. Thus, various reforms since the Ellis case took place unarguably recognise feminist critiques of law, yet may also be understood as examples of Mathiesen’s concept of ‘absorption’. To elaborate, within the context of sustained critique, a ‘failure to change carries its own risks to legitimacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0964663912456034">O’Donovan, 1993</xref>: p. 434); hence, far from being impervious to feminist concerns, various reforms implemented since the ‘diminished responsibility’ defence in 1957 testify to law’s awareness of, and response to, vociferous feminist critiques of its patriarchal application. However, instead of responding to the demand for new subject positions, these reforms demonstrate an ability to absorb progressive goals: ‘goals are given “rounded edges” so they are not threatening to the prevailing order (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0964663912456034">Mathiesen, 2004</xref>: p. 15). Thus, instead of retaliating women being ‘able to tell their own stories in court’, the ‘translation of feminine agency and responsibility into masculine understandings of irrationality and provocation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0964663912456034">Morrissey, 2003</xref>: p. 102) continues, irrespective of legislative changes:<disp-quote>
<p>attitudes and actions which in origin <italic>are transcendent are integrated in the prevailing order in such a way that dominant interests continue to be served</italic>. This way, they are made unthreatening to the prevailing order. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0964663912456034">Mathiesen, 2004</xref>: p. 15 original emphasis)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Mathiesens’s concept of ‘legalisation’ is also relevant to the analysis of the operational stability of law, because ‘the distinctive form of talk or presentation of lawyers constitutes a language of power which in itself has a strong silencing effect on others.’ Mathiesen’s emphasis on the power of jurisprudence to determine ‘what falls “inside” and what falls “outside” a particular line of reasoning’ chimes with the feminist critique of legal reasoning outlined above. He adds that the emphasis on ‘legal basis’ for given actions transforms ‘a clearly political debate – for and against a political standpoint – to being an exchange of opinions concerning the apparently neutral and unpolitical issue of whether legal authority or basis “exists”’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0964663912456034">Mathiesen, 2004</xref>: p. 17). This process was evident in the Ellis trial, during the gendered, political construction of what constitutes ‘provocation’ that was reduced to the non-political ‘precedent’ of the <italic>Holmes v DPP</italic> 1946 ruling (<italic>Ellis v R</italic>, 2003: p. 6). Half a century later, it was still evident in the appeal, where the same set of gendered, political debates was reduced to, apparently, non-political differences between common and statute law. It was further evident when Cussen’s alleged involvement in the crime was raised. His role – supplying a loaded gun to an intoxicated, traumatised, distraught woman before transporting her to the scene of the crime – when discussed within a <italic>gendered</italic> context, arguably <italic>reduces </italic>Ruth’s culpability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0964663912456034">Ballinger, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0964663912456034">BBC1, 1999</xref>). However, when transformed into a <italic>legal</italic> issue, it becomes a case of conspiracy to murder, thereby <italic>strengthening</italic> the Crown’s case. For Mathiesen, this process involves the ‘lifting’ of the debates ‘from the political to the professional-juridical level, the professional-juridical level being regarded as superordinate and therefore more “elevated”’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0964663912456034">Mathiesen, 2004</xref>: p. 17).</p>
<p>It is when this process of legalisation is brought to the forefront of analysis that phallocentric law’s ability to deny new subject positions for retaliating women becomes most visible, for within a system of knowledge production built on legal–patriarchal commonsense, it appears ‘obvious’ that the Ellis appeal could not be heard within the context of a partial defence created <italic>after</italic> her trial (BWS), and that, if she and Cussen had planned the crime together, she had committed the additional crime of conspiracy to murder. The power of commonsensical language ‘enables a claim that legal knowledge is not artificially limited’, that judges ‘are in touch with the everyday world, that they know what ordinary folk think … From this evocation of human nature and ordinariness comes a judgement of normalcy and law’s claim to universality’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0964663912456034">O’Donovan, 1993</xref>: p. 433). Thus, the utilisation of common sense disguises law’s own epistemological stance – it remains hidden and therefore difficult to challenge. Yet, given the important role that judges play in ‘determining what passes for common sense’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0964663912456034">Morrissey, 2003</xref>: p. 37), it is important to understand and de-construct these processes, for new subject positions can only be developed after the dismantling of existing, dominant regimes of truth production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0964663912456034">Foucault, 1980</xref>: pp. 132, 133).</p>
<p>The fact that women’s knowledge can only be heard via experts while men’s ‘definitions and understanding of human behaviour’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0964663912456034">O’Donovan, 1993</xref>: p. 428) can claim universal status – is central to explaining the misfit between social and legal justice. The power of legal–patriarchal discourses ensures they themselves identify which issues can be challenged or discussed. Feminist knowledge – constructed within the social – falls outside the framework of legal reasoning. It is, in Foucauldian terms:<disp-quote>
<p>A whole set of knowledges that are either hidden behind more dominant knowledges but can be revealed by critique or have been explicitly disqualified as inadequate to their task or insufficiently elaborated: naïve knowledges, located low down on the hierarchy, beneath the required level of cognition or scientificity. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0964663912456034">Foucault, 1980</xref>: p. 82)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>This ‘scientificity’ also contributes to ‘silent silencing’ because scientific positivism abounds in the phallocentric courtroom where only the ‘“positive”, projecting or protruding knowledge … shows itself [and is] registered’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0964663912456034">Mathiesen, 2004</xref>: p. 25). This helps to explain why, within phallocentric law, David’s separation from Ruth became constructed as a ‘failure to return’ – an <italic>omission</italic> – and did not count as an act either in 1955 or 2003. The taken-for-granted ‘scientific’ method of constructing ‘truth’ within legal discourse is indicated by its ability ‘to deny or nullify alternative truth accounts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0964663912456034">Pratt and Gilligan, 2004</xref>: p. 9). Crucially for Mathiesen, silent silencing is a subtle, non-conspiratorial process:<disp-quote>
<p>The actual silencing of opinions and actions which in fact continually takes place … is hidden both to the participants themselves and to the spectators. No external orders … or noisy methods are brought in. The surface is clean and shiny, we do not see the political silencing which in fact is there. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0964663912456034">Mathiesen, 2004</xref>: pp. 24–25)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the five strategies identified by Mathiesen as necessary to the maintenance of ‘hidden silencing’ are all represented in the Ellis case and further illuminate how continuities within the trial and appeal have been sustained. The first of these is ‘individualisation’. By prioritising the legal over the social, law in 2003 as in 1955, <italic>individualises</italic> cases of retaliating women, thus ensuring that inequalities inherent within relationships between men and women remain unchallenged.</p>
<p>Mathiesen’s second strategy – ‘normalisation’ – may seem paradoxical to ‘individualisation’; however, the two complement each other, for the event must not be individualised to the point where it becomes inexplicable, since concern may then ‘be raised on <italic>that</italic> basis’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0964663912456034">Mathiesen, 2004</xref>: p. 26). Thus, the Ellis case was compared with other cases involving retaliating women in both the trial and appeal (<italic>Ellis v R</italic>, 2003: p. 6). Crucially, however, ‘normalisation’ also involved the ‘un-gendering’ of domestic killing by comparing the murder of a female by her male partner, and even a man killing his ex-partner’s lover, as if such killings are similar (<italic>Ellis v R</italic>, 2003: p. 11). The unspoken implication is: there will always be a number of (un-gendered) individuals who behave violently, this is unavoidable in intimate relationships, it is rare, but common enough to make it ‘normal’. ‘Normalisation of this kind … functions as a reassurance together with its counterpart … individualisation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0964663912456034">Mathiesen, 2004</xref>: p. 26).</p>
<p>The third strategy is ‘co-optation’ – whatever aspect of the case raised concerns can be co-opted by emphasising that it ‘should be used as a point of departure for making further improvements of procedures which were all right earlier, but which may of course always be made better’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0964663912456034">Mathiesen, 2004</xref>: p. 27). This is exemplified in the ‘diminished responsibility’ defence introduced in 1957, frequently cited as being a direct consequence of the Ellis case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0964663912456034">Ballinger, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0964663912456034">Goodman and Pringle, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0964663912456034">Hancock, 1989</xref>), thus offering further reassurance to those who felt disturbed by her punishment.</p>
<p>Mathiesen’s fourth strategy is ‘superficial endorsement’:<disp-quote>
<p>‘Superficial endorsement’ occurs when the criticism is too strong just to be punctured through individualisation, normalisation or co-optation. It is expressed through thoughtful and responsible – judiciously formulated – agreement that something particular is the matter and should be corrected. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0964663912456034">Mathiesen, 2004</xref>: p. 27).</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The appeal judges offered superficial endorsement to critics by noting the law has <italic>already</italic> been corrected: ‘If her crime were committed today, we think it likely that there would have been an issue of diminished responsibility for the jury to determine…’ (<italic>Ellis v R</italic>, 2003: p. 13).</p>
<p>Mathiesen’s final strategy is that of ‘displacement of responsibility’, which ‘implies that the responsibility in the area’ will in future be placed on another agency and hence improve the system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0964663912456034">Mathiesen, 2004</xref>: p. 28). It occurs when the implementation of the four previous strategies by themselves cannot reduce strong criticism and was exemplified after the Ellis case by the transference from judge to jury of the consideration of a diminished responsibility defence. Taken together, these five strategies prevent ‘the public from being disturbed by thoughts of a somewhat more long-term character’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0964663912456034">Mathiesen, 2004</xref>: p. 29).</p>
<p>The Ellis case exemplifies the ebb and flow of hidden silencing, for while all five strategies were evident, they appeared to have limited success in silencing critics of the case, and arguably, at particular moments, carried the potential to generate a crisis of legitimacy. Ultimately, however, the appeal exemplifies the legal system’s proficiency in bringing ‘closure to controversial incidents’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0964663912456034">Pratt and Gilligan, 2004: p. 4</xref>), thus also demonstrating that the contest over knowledge between masculinist law and feminist epistemology is an unequal one. Burton and Carlen summarise the power of official discourse over its critics:<disp-quote>
<p>The task of inquiries into particular crises is to represent failure as temporary, or no failure at all, and to re-establish the image of administrative and legal coherence and rationality. One of the political desiderata of official discourse is therefore to retain the intellectual confidence of parties, elites and functionaries within the state apparatuses. To create a discourse of unity and cohesion between parties … [thus] demonstrating the state’s sovereign reason. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0964663912456034">Burton and Carlen, 1979</xref>: p. 48)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In short, ‘the battle for truth’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0964663912456034">Foucault, 1980</xref>: p. 132) is not being fought between equals. Instead, as a result of its position at the top of the hierarchy of credibility, legal discourse is able to construct ‘an official, objective truth about crime, criminal justice and punishment’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0964663912456034">Pratt and Gilligan, 2004</xref>: p. 4), and it is this ability that closes the potential for the development of new subject positions. Within this context, the appeal <italic>strengthened</italic> the case against Ruth, and, in all likelihood, silently silenced her for the foreseeable future – paralysing our power of resistance in the process, and further ensuring that ‘the prevailing [gender] order is maintained’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0964663912456034">Mathiesen, 2004</xref>: p. 19).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Following legal changes in Victoria, Australia in 2005 similar to those introduced in England and Wales in 2010 – the replacement of the provocation defence with ‘loss of control’ (‘defensive homicide’ in Victoria) – Fitz-Gibbon and Pickering found that, since its implementation, ‘of the 15 convictions obtained for defensive homicide to date, only two have involved a female defendant’, leading one judiciary member to comment: ‘it is disturbing that defensive homicide has been resorted to by men in circumstances that the Law Reform Commission didn’t … envisage.’ Meanwhile, anti-violence campaigners noted: ‘the offence does not adequately address “the grim, gendered realities of family violence”’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0964663912456034">Fitz-Gibbon and Pickering, 2012</xref>: p. 166). Such testimonies led Fitz-Gibbon and Pickering to conclude that the new law of defensive homicide mirrors ‘the problems previously associated with the defence of provocation’ – the legislation may have changed but little ‘has been achieved in practice’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0964663912456034">Fitz-Gibbon and Pickering, 2012</xref>: pp. 167, 169).</p>
<p>Meanwhile in England and Wales, following the announcement in the Coroners and Justice Act in 2009 (see Ministry of Justice Circular 2010/13) of the replacement of the provocation defence with ‘loss of control’, <sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0964663912456034">6</xref>
</sup> Edwards observed:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Given that there is no change in the nomenclature, we can expect a mirror image of the behaviour and legal descriptors that passed for loss of self-control under the old law of provocation to be replicated. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0964663912456034">Edwards, 2010</xref>: p. 224)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Moreover, the new law has returned the judge’s ‘power to remove cases from the jury’s consideration’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0964663912456034">Edwards, 2010</xref>: p. 240; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0964663912456034">Norrie, 2010</xref>: p. 280) – the very power that led to the collapse of Ruth’s defence and subsequent omission of a closing speech.</p>
<p>Such developments confirm the validity of Smart’s view that feminism should not become seduced by law – new laws will not necessary make things better (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0964663912456034">Smart, 1989</xref>: p. 160) – instead law itself should be de-centred in favour of a critical consideration of the wider social context within which it operates. Thus, rather than demanding new laws which address gender inequality, it is the power of law itself which should be challenged. This is because new legislation adds legitimacy to the legal forum by confirming that it is the most appropriate body to initiate change and reform. As such, new legislation <italic>increases</italic> the power of law. Therefore it is ‘law’s power to define and disqualify which should become the focus of feminist strategy … It is in its ability to redefine the truth of events that feminism offers political gains’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0964663912456034">Smart, 1989</xref>: p. 164). It thus remains for feminism to complete the task of de-centring law in order to establish ‘the legitimacy of feminist knowledge’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0964663912456034">Smart, 1989</xref>: p. 165). In relation to the arguments presented above, this would enable a re-definition of the experiences and motivations of retaliating women. Without such a de-centring, law’s superior position at the apex of the hierarchy of truth production will be maintained and the continuity of ‘hidden silencing’ assured, as demonstrated by the outcome of the Ellis appeal.</p>

<p>In itself an interesting comment since, if Ellis had been found guilty of a lesser crime, her punishment could not have been that of execution. While the reasoning behind this comment remains within the realm of speculation, it suggests the appeal judges, perhaps inadvertently or subconsciously, had considered the punishment, rather than the verdict, controversial.</p>

<p>For example, ‘large crowds registered their protests by standing outside the prison gates’ the night before Ruth Ellis’s execution, chanting ‘Evans, Bentley, Ellis’, the implication being that this was the third unjustified execution to take place in recent years. Moreover, both ordinary members of the public and celebrities of the day such as the American writer Raymond Chandler registered their disapproval of the verdict by writing to local and national newspapers. Reverberations from the case continued to make themselves felt weeks after the execution had taken place, with the Howard League repeating its demand for the abolition of the death penalty, and the National Campaign for the Abolition of Capital Punishment was launched only weeks later. Years later the then Labour MP Tony Benn was to state that the case undoubtedly ‘played a large part in developing public opinion against capital punishment’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0964663912456034">Ballinger, 2000</xref>: p. 324).</p>

<p>The letters from the public to the Home Secretary within these files are too numerous to count. Within the category of letter-writers who made a case for a reprieve, certain key themes can be identified. Amongst them are that Ruth was the victim of ‘blind passion’; that it is unacceptable to execute the mother of young children, and that compared with the crimes of many other convicted murderers who had been reprieved in the past, her crime was less repugnant , hence, in the interests of judicial fairness she ‘deserved’ to be reprieved.</p>

<p>Prior to reaching this point, inadequacies in this defence included the failure to call key witnesses such as the psychiatrist, Dr Rees, who had been treating Ruth in the period leading up to the murder, or witnesses who could have testified that David Blakely, apart from his violent, erratic and faithless conduct, had also been responsible for Ruth losing her job, her home and her money (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0964663912456034">Ballinger, 2000</xref>: p. 317).</p>

<p>The term ‘phallocentrism’ is defined by Carol Smart as referring ‘to a culture which is structured to meet the needs of the masculine imperative.’ However, it ‘is meant to imply far more than the surface appearance of male dominance … [It thus] invokes the unconscious and raises profound questions on the part that the psyche and subjectivity play in reproducing patriarchal relations’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0964663912456034">Smart, 1995</xref>: p. 78).</p>
