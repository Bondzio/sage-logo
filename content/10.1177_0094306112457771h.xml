<p>Today, more than ever, our everyday lives are influenced by forces outside our local spaces. But Harvey Perkins and David Thorns, as the authors of <italic>Place, Identity, and Everyday Life in a Globalizing World</italic>, argue that we are not only influenced by but also influence in return the lives and shared cultures of others outside our city, region, or nation in a bi-directional, interactive process. The authors mix the theoretical with practical and real space with virtual place to provide a comprehensive foundation of modern research on everyday life and identity in modern global cities.</p>
<p>The book is divided into three sections, each building on the previous. First, the authors establish their conceptual framework by reviewing the intellectual and theoretical developments of understandings about the role of place in constructing identity and the everyday lived experience. They also provide a clear and comprehensible working definition of globalization and the expansion of understandings of globalization into the social and cultural. In the second part, the authors begin with a socio-historical explanation of urbanization. They continue with an explanation of the role of place and both real and imagined spaces in the development of everyday identities. The final section of the book addresses modern issues of sustainability, especially as climate change discourses shift from the global and national level to what can be done at the city and community level (i.e., the everyday experience level).</p>
<p>This book presents a clear introduction to the theoretical foundations and literature regarding culture, identity, experience, and economy in the modern world. It would serve as a useful text for upper level undergraduate or introductory graduate courses, especially within geography, sociology, and urban studies.</p>
