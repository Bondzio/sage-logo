<p>The work of Joseph Bracken is well known to English-speaking audiences with an interest in process theology. He has published dozens of articles in leading journals and authored or edited numerous books on various topics in systematic theology.</p>
<p>The central concept that runs throughout this text is an evolutionary understanding of the relationship between the One and the Many based on Bracken’s proposed revision of Alfred North Whitehead’s concept of society. This revision argues that the three persons of the Trinity co-constitute an infinitely extended field of activity proper to them as the One God. This divine field of activity is then the ground of all created reality and the result of the free decision of the divine persons to share their life. In this way, all individual subjects of experience (which for Bracken exist as sub-atomic energy events) organize themselves as fields of activity ‘structured by the interplay of ever-new generations of the momentary subjects of experience’ (p. 9). The work is then divided into three parts, each consisting of four chapters, which apply this paradigm to controverted questions in cosmology, the social sciences, and Christian doctrine.</p>
<p>In the section on cosmology, Bracken begins by developing his paradigm and applying it to the issue of contingency. He argues that life as an open-ended field of activity means that all that exists develops through the complex interaction of individual subjects of experience in a constantly evolving pattern. Even the one God is understood primarily in these evolutionary terms. Thus, Bracken is able to answer the title question of the book: God does indeed roll dice if this is understood as God empowering creatures to make their own self-constituting decisions, rather than pure randomness or pure determination. The second chapter in the volume further develops the theme of contingency in light of the importance of creativity and the relative freedom of self-constituting entities in the interplay of the divine field. Bracken argues that the freedom of the created realm (from humans to their more basic self-constituting elements) is constantly developing within the field of interactions. These interactions are ordered and reordered through the activity of the all-embracing divine matrix of the Trinity. The final two chapters in this section treat the question of intelligent design and causality within the created realm. In each case Bracken envisions the entire cosmos as participating in the process of its own creation in relation to the divine. This process-oriented theology, like existentialism, places a prime emphasis on freedom and self-constituting activity.</p>
<p>In the second section, Bracken investigates the connections between his metaphysical paradigm and systems thinking in the social sciences. The first chapter in this section addresses the issue of truth and objectivity in an open-ended system. Here Bracken argues that his process-oriented doctrine of God involves understanding truth as a communal process. Because all of reality is in a constant state of development through relation, this means that truth too is in the process of development. This does not mean, however, that truth is purely relative. Rather, it emphasizes the provisional nature of human understanding and Bracken’s belief that ‘the day that truth was seen as timeless and unchanging … long ago ceased to exist’ (p. 69).</p>
<p>The remaining chapters in this section are devoted to Bracken’s working out of the unity of the systems, the relationship between subjectivity and objectivity, and democracy. In each of these arenas, Bracken seeks a moderating position between the ontological priority of the self-constituting moments and the fields or societies that they create through their interactions. If, for example, one were to think of a human in this paradigm, one would recognize that humans are made of a complex interaction between a variety of organic systems that allow an individual to function. These systems are in turn constituted by their own complex systems of organs, cells, molecules, and atoms. In this system, creativity and unity exist at every level of the system. In contrast to other process- and system-oriented thinkers, Bracken seeks to balance the top-down agency and bottom-up agency. This requires the actual unity and integrity of the fields that are created by the nexus of relations generated by momentary subjects of experience as well as their own agency. Likewise, it requires balancing awareness of subjects (many subjects of experience) with the persistent patterns of interrelation that they develop from moment to moment (objects). At the level of political reality it requires balancing out the needs, rights, and responsibilities of the many individuals in a nation, with what is in the best interest of the nation as a whole.</p>
<p>In the final section, Bracken works out the implications of his system for the incarnation, resurrection, and the Catholic Church (as well as its relation to religious communities). First, he develops his understanding of the hypostatic union as the interaction between the human field of the Jesus of Nazareth and the divine field of the Son. Although all creatures exist within the divine field created by the interaction of the Father, Son, and Spirit, Bracken argues that Jesus was unique because his human will consistently corresponded to the will of the divine. This union developed throughout his life and reached its completion at the moment of the crucifixion when the persistent patterns of interrelation unique to Jesus were transformed and integrated into the persistent pattern of the Trinity. This then is also how he understands resurrected bodies. Human bodies, at the end of their natural lives, cease to exist as persistent patterns of existence and are integrated (back?) into the field of the Trinity. The church, as the communion of the kingdom of God, is a field generated by individual lives of the community of believers and uniquely constituted through the sacramental rituals of the community. However, this communal system of believers exists alongside and in relation to other communities of faith—both Christian and non-Christian. Thus the autonomy and individuality of these religious communities must be respected, but also understood in relations to unity of all religious systems and ultimately the unity of the triune God.</p>
<p><italic>Does God Roll Dice?</italic> is the working out of key insights from a master theologian in his maturity. This one thin volume demonstrates Bracken’s creativity and the far-reaching implications for his unique theological vision. It also demonstrates, what this reviewer takes as the weaknesses in his system which include his reduction of ontological unity to cooperation and his ultimately reductionist eschatology. While accessible in its approach, it leans heavily on the technical language of process philosophy and systems theory. The work would make a fine introduction to Bracken’s theology or as a part of a graduate course on process theology or religion and science.</p>
