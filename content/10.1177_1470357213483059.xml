<abstract>
<p>This article shows how NGO films deploy melodramatic modes in constructing the narrative arcs of their campaign films and it explores the potential of this mode for generating solidarity between the spectator and the suffering subject. The author analyses how, through the use of music, colour and gesture, a visceral emotional response is evoked that produces an identification of the spectator with the experiences of the suffering subject. She argues that the criticism of melodrama as a mode or genre that substitutes politics with compassion is misplaced; compassion for distant others may be at least as critical to the formation of solidarity as a politically informed understanding of the structural causes of social injury.</p>

<p>The core aim of international non-governmental organisations (INGOs) is to address the causes of poverty and to ameliorate its effects. In this aim they are caught between the apparent intractability of poverty in developing countries and the necessity of convincing their donors that the funds they provide will make a difference to the lives of the poor. This article explores the mode or genre that INGOs deploy in campaigning to increase awareness of the impacts of poverty on children and to raise funds for their work in alleviating childhood poverty in developing countries. I focus specifically on children because of the central place that the figure of the child continues to play in representations of poverty disseminated by INGOs, notwithstanding a putative shift in the sector from child-saving to child-rights.</p>
<p>The three INGO campaigns discussed in this article were chosen because of the different niches that they occupy in the landscape of humanitarian aid. Save the Children is one of the ‘big five’ NGOs that together account for over 90 per cent of funds mobilised by this sector; Plan UK is a smaller child-focused INGO that relies largely on child-sponsorship for their income. Plan UK differentiates itself from World Vision (who also rely on child-sponsorship funds) and Save the Children (who also focus on children) by its support for a rights-based approach to including children in development. ActionAid differentiates itself through its political engagement and analysis. Despite these differences in what might be called the NGO brand, I show in this article that they each deploy melodramatic modes in constructing the narrative arcs of their campaign films.</p>
<p>I explore the potential of this mode for generating solidarity between the spectator and the suffering subject. In developing this argument, I use the term ‘mode’ rather than ‘genre’ to signify the melodramatic conventions that cross both genre and medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1470357213483059">Anker, 2005</xref>: 23; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1470357213483059">Williams, 2001</xref>: 16–18). In particular, I argue that the visceral emotional response and moral legibility of the melodramatic mode produces an identification of the spectator with the experiences of the suffering subject. Progressive scholars have critiqued this form of solidarity, one based on identification, for its refusal of difference and its narcissism. This critique rests on the assumption that solidarity based on group-identification (narcissism) necessarily sets boundaries to inclusion that leave others excluded and thereby reproduces forms of social injury. In this critique, difference should not be considered as inimical to the formation of solidarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1470357213483059">Young, 1990</xref>). Furthermore, melodramatic modes and NGO campaigns of the type analysed here have been criticised for simplifying the structural issues and eliding the broader structural context that causes poverty and hunger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1470357213483059">Anker, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1470357213483059">Chouliaraki, 2010</xref>: 107–114; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1470357213483059">Kakoudaki, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1470357213483059">Siomopoulos, 2006</xref>). In contrast, I argue that melodrama directly confronts the emotional and ethical question of what kind of world we want by making visible the injury wrought by social inequality in ways that elicit a visceral response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1470357213483059">Butler, 2004</xref>: 128–151). Indeed melodrama has been one of the most important cultural forms for giving expression to the felt experience of class, racial and gender injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1470357213483059">Siomopoulos, 2006</xref>: 179) and engaging working-class audiences. It has done so since its inception in early 19th-century theatre by simultaneously deploying a Romantic Manichean vision in which good triumphs over evil with realist representations of the privations of working-class life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1470357213483059">Holmes, 2001</xref>: 7; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1470357213483059">Newey, 2000</xref>: 29).</p>
<p>My analysis of the following films suggests that the structural powerlessness of the NGO subject, the intractability of their situation, lends itself easily to representation in a melodramatic mode. In these films, which take as their central figure the suffering child, the spectator is invited to identify with the grieving parent who watches their child suffer. The deployment of the melodramatic mode allows a visceral identification with a subject whose life is radically different to that of the putative audience of the film. Despite their differences, the cultural familiarity of the mode in which they are represented, and of the conditioned response to that mode, invite an identification which might otherwise be withheld. Central to the power of the melodramatic mode is its moral legibility; I argue that both the transparent emotional demand made by the figure of the child and the simplicity of the solutions offered to their problems contribute to the moral legibility of these NGO campaign films. Moral legibility is made visible through the actions of the villain who orchestrates the fall from grace of the innocent, undeserving victim. In the NGO films analysed here, I show that the role of the villain is occupied by the unresponsive spectator. The final sequence of a melodrama is the space of return or redemption. This space is occupied by a projection of a different future that will be made possible through the responsive spectator’s intervention. In the final section of this article, I argue that the criticism of melodrama as a mode or genre that substitutes politics with compassion is misplaced; compassion for distant others may be at least as critical to the formation of solidarity as a politically informed understanding of the structural causes of social injury.</p>

<title>The Films</title>
<p>I analyse three short NGO films used for campaigning and sponsorship: Save the Children’s ‘A child like Asha’ from its No Child Born to Die campaign, Plan UK’s Sponsor a Child Campaign and ActionAid’s Happy Homes from its Sponsor a Child campaign. All of the films are available online. These films effectively convey the ubiquity of the melodramatic mode in NGO campaigns and their deployment of familiar tropes of poverty to make an emotional appeal for help with the assurance that ‘the solutions are simple’.</p>

<title>The Save the Children film</title>
<p>The Save the Children film (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvMgtTkVj18">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvMgtTkVj18</ext-link>) opens with a tableau scene of a very young child lying almost completely still on a bed. The film is accompanied by plaintive piano music. The camera gradually moves in to focus on the child’s face. As it does so the voiceover says:<disp-quote>
<p>Asha would ask you something/ if she could/ She’d ask you to save her life/ but she’s too exhausted./ She’s starving./ She’d look you in the eye,/ she’d ask you again./ If she thought that someone, somewhere had the heart to help./ If Asha could ask you, would you help?</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The camera moves closer in and then fades to black. A second later the voiceover says ‘you can help’ and a telephone number appears on a black screen. In the next scene a naked child is lying on a cloth on a bed, tubes protruding from his nose, a blanket between his legs. The voiceover says: ‘you can save children’s lives by calling Save the Children today/ to help a child survive will you give just £3 a month?’ Scene 3 is a head and shoulders shot of a young child wearing a necklace with a cowrie shell. As the infant turns towards the camera, the voiceover says: ‘please give your support today’. The child nods his head, opens his eyes wide and raises his eyebrows as the voiceover says ‘Please/ help a child like Asha right now.’ The screen fades to black and the phone number of the Save the Children Fund (SCF) appears on screen. In the next scene a child held in a woman’s arms laughs as she feeds her a packet food. The voiceover says: ‘We know what it takes to save a child’s life. The solutions are simple.’ The scene changes: a boy leans forward to eat a substance from a packet being offered by an unseen adult’s hand: ‘but we need your help.’ Screen fades to black, ‘£3 can buy the food to keep a child alive.’ In the final scene, the first image is shown again. The starving child looks blankly at the camera. The red banner of SCF is shown at the bottom of the screen. ‘Asha can’t ask you/ but we can/ start saving lives/ give £3 a month/ please will you stop children dying?/ Call 0800 119 4013 and give £3 a month./ Thank you. The music stops and the child’s face stays on screen, completely still for a moment before the screen fades to black.</p>

<title>The ActionAid film</title>
<p>The ActionAid film (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.actionaid.org.uk/100044/child_sponsorship.html?&amp;gclid=CKvfrZu8yKUCFY4f4Qodugiuog">http://www.actionaid.org.uk/100044/child_sponsorship.html?&amp;gclid=CKvfrZu8yKUCFY4f4Qodugiuog</ext-link>) is narrated by the main protagonist. She speaks about her transition from a life on the streets to living in ‘Happy Homes’ supported by ActionAid, and eventually working in a shop and imagining a future in which she owns an embroidery shop. As she speaks, the film intersperses head and shoulder shots of the narrator speaking to the camera with a series of scenes of girls begging, washing pots, living on the pavements in shelters made of polythene. Aklima then meets her rescuer who tells her about ActionAid. She moves to ‘Happy Homes’ and the film shows her being taken by ‘Happy Homes’ to a shop in the market and working in a shop. The film ends with the narrator talking to the camera. She is standing in front of shelves of cloth and smiling: ‘My name is Aklima Akter Liza/ I am ActionAid.’ The final scene brightens to white and the screen fills with text: ‘currently the best option for girls like Aklima is to have a job/ otherwise they would be back on the streets of Dhaka’/ ‘Happy Homes can only offer shelter for girls up to the age of 15. ActionAid wants girls to stay in Happy Homes until they are 18.’ The music stops as the ActionAid logo fills the screen.</p>

<title>The Plan UK film</title>
<p>The Plan UK film (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doYW55UXbYo">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doYW55UXbYo</ext-link>) opens with a girl sitting on a bench in front of a hut looking through a photo album. The narrator, says: ‘For too many girls like Adisa, childhood brings few happy memories.’ As the narrator continues, a series of images are shown with statistics written over them: a girl carrying water: ‘they don’t go to school, instead they fetch water’; a girl wearing a white cardigan and an elaborate necklace: ‘they get married young …’; a young girl holding a baby: ‘… and often die giving birth. Girls like Adisa want someone that believes in them.’ The film returns to the girl looking at the photo album in which she is looking at a photograph of the previous scene: ‘they want a plan.’ The scene switches to a white woman sitting at a table reading a folder. ‘Call 0800 130 30 11 now and sponsor a girl with Plan.’ The woman starts to complete a direct debit form. ‘Your £15 a month will go to supporting grassroots projects in her country (shot of children in school uniform running across a field towards a school). With your support (shot of children at desks in school), more children can go to school; ‘have clean water close to their homes’ (image of children at a water pump); ‘and enjoy’ (image of child with medic taking temperature) ‘a healthy childhood’. ‘As a sponsor you can encourage her through letters and photos’ (shot of girl sitting at a desk writing a letter). The camera pulls back to show children walking past the girl towards school as the narrator says: ‘giving her the confidence to reach her full potential’ (shot of sponsor reading the girl’s letter). In the final scene, a large group of school children in uniform speak direct to camera: ‘we are the plan.’</p>

<title>Narrative Excess and Visceral Identification</title>
<p>Melodrama developed out of the legal prohibition against speech in popular theatre in 18th-century Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1470357213483059">Brooks, 1995</xref>). Because of this prohibition, producers were forced to deploy pantomime with its dependence on gesture and scenery to convey character and plot development; music (the ‘melo’ of melodrama) worked with these other non-verbal signs to the same effect. When the prohibition against speech was lifted after the French Revolution, melodrama became <italic>the</italic> popular mode of theatrical representation. Its acuity in conveying the internal struggles of characters through gesture, music and mise-en-scène was important to the adaptation of European melodramatic theatre into silent film (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1470357213483059">Elsaesser, 1987[1972]</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1470357213483059">Williams, 2001</xref>: 87). In the transition to talking film, the melodramatic mode remained important for its economy of sign-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1470357213483059">Singer, 2001</xref>). Character in melodrama is not expressed through dialogue but through situations, mise en scène, action-tableaux and episodic narration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1470357213483059">Gledhill, 1987</xref>: 23). Through these signs, the spectator is invited to viscerally identify with other people’s experience, particularly their suffering and the incontrovertible unfairness of their situation. The key to melodrama is its moral legibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1470357213483059">Brooks, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1470357213483059">Buckley, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1470357213483059">Gledhill, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1470357213483059">Kakoudaki, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1470357213483059">Williams, 2001</xref>), the clarity with which it identifies and differentiates the victim from the villain. The appeal of melodrama turns on its representation of innocence wronged through no fault of its own. Critical to the effective representation of innocence is the powerlessness of the suffering subject; it is the subject’s lack of structural power and capacity that signifies the impossibility of being culpable for his or her own suffering. It is for this reason that melodrama invariably centres on women and children and, to a lesser extent, racialised minorities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1470357213483059">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Film scholars have argued that the dependence on non-verbal signs in melodrama is a function of the inability of the narrative to be resolved through action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1470357213483059">Brooks, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1470357213483059">Mercer and Shingler, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1470357213483059">Singer, 2001</xref>). This inability arises because of the constraints on the range of action available to the characters as a consequence of their structural position. So, for example, the poor girl who is threatened by a rapacious landlord has limited scope for challenging him because no power supports her. The inability of the narrative to be resolved through action generates an excess that cannot be contained within the script and is displaced onto colour, music, gesture and other non-verbal signs. In melodrama, the action is constrained by the passivity and impotence of the victim in his or her confrontation with villainy and injustice. The realism of the narrative, the child’s exposure to hunger and extreme poverty, and the urgency of rescuing the child from starvation and privation cannot be resolved within the narrative: an adult sits next to a child but is powerless to stop the child’s suffering. The action is externalised to the audience and to the mise en scène and music. It is the audience that gasps, shrieks and is horrified by melodrama whilst the characters themselves are resigned to their fate. Echoing Spivak’s famous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1470357213483059">1988</xref>) declaration in the NGO melodrama, the characters cannot speak.</p>
<p>In this section I explore through my analysis of the non-verbal signs deployed in these three films, how the NGO campaign film resolves its narrative access through non-verbal signs that invite a visceral identification with the suffering subjects of the film.</p>
<sec id="section6-1470357213483059">
<title>Colour</title>
<p>In each of these films, colour is used to signify shifts in the narrative, although none make use of deep, saturated colours that are generally associated with Hollywood melodrama (specifically with Douglas Sirk’s films) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1470357213483059">Haralovich, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>In ‘Happy Homes’, the film is mostly shot in naturalistic colour; however, the tones of the first half of the film are less bright than those of the second half of the film. Once the narrative moves into its second half, after the narrator speaks about meeting the women from Happy Homes, the colours are bolder and brighter. Vivid, block colours (red and green) are used in the scenes of the girls learning to sew. In the shop where Alkima goes to work, the shelves are stacked with brightly coloured cloth and a roll of bright red cloth is being cut on the table as the employer and her rescuer speak. The room where the narrator is shown using a sewing machine is bathed in light. In the last frame where Alkima is seen striding confidently along, the scene is again brightly lit. Finally, she is shown laughing against a background of neatly stacked brightly coloured textiles. The scene is then flooded with light and black writing appears on a white background, in contrast to the white writing on a black background that opened the film, signifying a shift from mourning to celebration. The Plan UK film changes from monochrome to colour when the scene shifts from the girl looking through a photo album to the sponsor looking at a folder: from Africa to Europe. When the camera returns to Africa, after the sponsor’s intervention, it is now filmed in colour. In both of these films then, the space of suffering is conveyed through the use of monochrome and subdued colours and the space of redemption through bright, vibrant colours. The use of colour in the ‘A child like Asha’ film is the most ambiguous. In each of the scenes, the main character(s) are wearing or lying on different colour textiles: purple, lilac, orange and blue are prominent in the first scene, yellow in the second, green in the third, white in the fourth, soft pink in the fifth. While no clear semiotic schema can be discerned in these colours, changes in colour are used to signify a new episodic moment or tableau (from dying, to sickness, to healing, to healthy, to developing) and these episodic moments are loosely related to shared cultural readings of colour: purple/death, yellow/sickness, green/newness, and white/life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1470357213483059">Kress and Van Leeuwen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1470357213483059">Van Leeuwen, 2008</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1470357213483059">
<title>Gesture</title>
<p>Gesture is used in these films to give voice to the film’s characters who are otherwise literally speechless. In none of the films do the people who populate the narrative speak. In the ActionAid film, the main character speaks but, as she does so, the film cuts between head/shoulders shots of her speaking to camera and scenes of poverty that represent the life she once lived. In the Save the Children film, the suffering (and then recovering) children plead with the spectator through facial gestures: opening their eyes, nodding, even raising an eyebrow in a peculiarly quizzical gesture. In the ActionAid film, gestures indicate the shift in circumstances from begging to industriousness. In the first half of the film, the main gestures are those of a girl begging – clasping her hands in supplication, prodding a woman to get her attention, gesturing to her mouth to signify her hunger. The camera focuses on the begging girl’s gesturing hands. In one scene, a girl walks along holding a bottle of water and an orange, she is adequately dressed and neither begging, working or scavenging (as the other children in these episodes are); she walks with a pronounced limp, and it is this disability that explains her inclusion in the narrative. In melodrama, ‘physical disability, operating as a material “mark or sign” within this system, produces emotional meaning that works to reify the disabled as “necessarily” suffering, and thus deserving of others’ compassion’ (Klages, 1999: 17, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1470357213483059">Moeschen, 2007</xref>: 434). In the second part of the film, after Alkima’s rescue, the film focuses on the girls’ hands as they work – learning to embroider, or to use a sewing machine. In melodrama, the body itself becomes a gesture made by ‘speaking bodies’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1470357213483059">Holmes, 2001</xref>: 6) ‘whose very physical presence evokes the extremism and hyperbole of ethical conflict and manichaeistic struggle’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1470357213483059">Brooks, 1995[1976]</xref>: 57, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1470357213483059">Holmes, 2001</xref>: 6).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1470357213483059">
<title>Music</title>
<p>In Save the Children’s film, the accompanying music is mournful. In many NGO campaigns, the tempo of the music shifts at the point when the donor’s gift takes effect on the lives of the poor. In the Save the Children film, for example, the spectator might anticipate that the music accompanying scenes 3, 4 and 5 – which show that the nutrition paste that Save the Children use to treat children with malnutrition is effective – would be more uplifting, even exuberant than in the earlier scenes. The music does change in scene 3 but it does not have the rousing quality of the shift in tempo of, for example, the Plan UK sponsorship campaign film. Similarly, in the ActionAid film, the music stops when Aklima meets her rescuer from Happy Homes and is told about the shelter. It starts again as she begins to speak of her new life. The tempo of the music changes and, although hardly uplifting or exuberant, it has a lighter quality.</p>
<p>Music is a central element of melodrama; before colour film, it was the one of the main modes of expression through which shifts in the pace of the drama, the entrance of the villain, the fall from grace, the redemption or return of the heroine, were signified. Save the Children retains throughout its film mournful, plaintive piano music. In contrast to the Plan UK and ActionAid film, which both follow the classic melodramatic narrative arc from fall to redemption and signify this through changes in the tempo of the music, the pathos of the Save the Children film rests partly on the pathos of its failure to provide a space of redemption or return to innocence for the child in the opening shot. The film both starts and ends with her dying.</p>

<title>Identification and the Adult Gaze</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1470357213483059">Williams (2001</xref>: 14) locates sympathy for victims at the centre of what she calls ‘the melodramatic mode’. For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1470357213483059">Singer (2001</xref>: 44), identification is produced in melodrama through pathos, defined as a ‘visceral physical sensation triggered by the perception of moral injustice against an undeserving victim’ with whom the spectator closely identifies. The implication here is that the identification is narcissistic – that the spectator identifies with someone like themselves of whom they can say ‘there but for the grace of God, go I.’ It is important that this sense of identification is not abstract or intellectual but visceral. It is the visceral sensation, the heightened emotion and its erasure of calculation that contribute to the easy moral legibility that is the hallmark of the melodramatic narrative. We <italic>feel</italic> the injustice, our desire for the injury to be repaired is intuitive rather than rational. The power of melodrama (and the reasons it is viewed with suspicion) is this appeal to bodily feeling over rational thought.</p>
<p>The Save the Children film is surely the most powerful here: when looking at Asha dying of starvation in the opening and closing scenes of the film, it is surely difficult not to experience an intense unease at watching a child apparently dying in real time; presumably Save the Children intend that this unease will mobilise a desire to stop <italic>this</italic> child from suffering. This desire may be overlaid with awareness that it is unlikely that Save the Children did not save this particular child. The identification asked of the spectator here is surely not based on similarity. Western spectators will generally not feel that what is happening to this child could have happened to themselves as a child or that this particular injury could happen to their child. The spectator’s identification as an adult is not in fact with the child who suffers but with the (unseen) parent who watches their child suffer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1470357213483059">Wells, 2012</xref>). In the Save the Children film, an adult is watching over the child in all but one scene. In the first two scenes, in which the child is dying (scene 1) or critically ill (scene 2), only the arm of a watching adult is visible; increasing the space for the spectator to insert himself or herself into the narrative of the film as the anxious adult watching over their suffering child. In this respect, the Save the Children film is in a classic melodramatic mode; the suffering of innocent (white) children being watched over by their grieving (white) mothers was a staple of Victorian fiction and melodrama. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1470357213483059">Linda Williams (2001</xref>: 47–48) argues in her brilliant study of race and melodrama that adaptations of the anti-slavery story ‘Uncle Tom’s Cabin’ and the many adaptations of this story to theatre and film deployed this identification with the pain of loving (white) mothers and dying (white) children to invoke in white audiences empathy with racially victimized black slaves. In the NGO film, or at least this NGO film, European and North American audiences are asked to draw on a melodramatic imagination to map the history of the suffering of mothers and children from the effects of poverty in their historical narratives onto the contemporary experience of African families.</p>
<p>In the ActionAid film, the main character narrates her life story of suffering, rescue and redemption over scenes of much younger children living the life she lived. As with the Plan UK film, here we are presented with a montage of scenes of children suffering the effects of living in poverty before being rescued through the intervention of a kindly adult. The identification of the spectator with the adult who intervenes rather than with the suffering child is most explicit in the Plan UK sponsorship film since it is this spectator that the film is directly addressed to (‘with your support more children can go to school, have clean water close to their homes’). In the ActionAid film, my contention is that the spectator, as an adult identifies with the adults in the film: the couples being asked for money, the aid worker explaining ‘Happy Homes’ to a child, Nahid Apa imploring an employer to hire the once destitute Alkima.</p>

<title>The Space of Action and Moral Legibility: Just in Time and too Late</title>
<p>Peter Brooks, in his influential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1470357213483059">1995[1976]</xref>) study of melodrama, <italic>The Melodramatic Imagination</italic>, locates the emergence of theatrical melodrama as a response to modernism and, in particular, the loss of faith in a religious order attendant on modernism. In other words, melodrama provides a moral certainty that had once been provided by religious faith and a political order that legitimated its sovereignty through natural right. Whether or not we are living in a post-sacred age is debatable; however, moral certitude is widely recognised as one of the defining characteristics of melodrama. Ben Singer in his (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1470357213483059">2001</xref>) study of the relationship of melodrama to modernity suggests that 19th-century melodrama<disp-quote>
<p>filled a psychological need by offering moral certainty through utterly unambiguous designations of virtue and villainy … [its] paranoid fixation on the relentless victimization of innocents expressed the inherent anxiety and disarray of the post-feudal, post-sacred world of nascent capitalism. (p. 11)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This moral clarity, or perhaps more accurately the absence of ambiguity, makes melodrama a powerful device for ensuring that the range of possible responses to the image are rather constrained. Even if the spectator does not respond in the way that the melodramatic representation demands, the cultural familiarity of the mode makes it likely that she or he will at the very least know what the expected response is. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1470357213483059">Linda Williams (2001</xref>: 300) claims that melodrama is<disp-quote>
<p>a democratic, modern form that believes it is on the side of the weak and oppressed against the power of the strong … its key, however is not simplistic ‘black and white’ moral antinomies, but what stands behind them: <italic>the quest to forge a viscerally felt moral legibility in the midst of moral confusion and disarray.</italic> (emphasis added)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In her view, melodrama endures, despite criticism both ideological and aesthetic, because it is a ‘mode of storytelling crucial to the establishment of moral good’ (p. 12). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1470357213483059">Mercer and Shingler (2004</xref>: 21) in their account of the genre, note, among other features, the recurrence of ‘obscured (camouflaged) social criticism’ and they note that one of the earliest film studies texts on melodrama, Elsaesser in ‘Tales of Sound and Fury’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1470357213483059">1987[1972]</xref>), suggested that ‘under certain social and production conditions, melodrama could be seen as ideologically subversive’. Far from being a degraded form, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1470357213483059">Gledhill (2000</xref>: 317, fn 25) claims that ‘melodrama’s goal of moral legibility asks “how to live, who is justified, who are the innocent, where is villainy at work now”’?</p>
<p>These are simple matters to adjudicate on in melodrama, and this is the case in the NGO films analysed here: ‘We know what it takes to save a child’s life. The solutions are simple.’ In the Save the Children film, the simple solutions include the provision of nutrition pastes and medicines. In the Plan UK film, educating girls is the simple solution to poverty. Is it correct to call these moral solutions, aren’t they simply pragmatic or technical solutions to more or less specific (and not morally invested) problems? My argument is that the people in these films are morally invested and the spectator is interpellated as a moral subject (rather than say a political or managerial subject). It is not simply that Plan UK’s campaign centres on girls but that girls are represented in development discourse as more ethical, exemplary people than boys are. Happy Homes provides housing for girls; no justification is given for this focus of ActionAid’s support. The barely disguised implication is that girls on the street are vulnerable not only to sexual violence but to prostitution. The innocence of the children – they have done nothing wrong and yet they suffer – is central to establishing the immorality of refusing to help ‘girls like Alkima’ or ‘children like Asha’.</p>

<sec id="section11-1470357213483059">
<title>Villains</title>
<p>Melodrama is not only about wordless gesture and the external signs that convey internal character. The melodramatic mode is concerned with the struggle between right and wrong, good and evil, virtue and villainy. Suffering children unambiguously signify virtue, but where is the villain in the NGO campaign?</p>
<p>Melodrama offers a critique of the worst excesses of economic inequality but crucially it does so in relation to (im)morality rather than (in)justice. In melodrama, the Manichean struggle between good and evil is not so much polarised as twinned. The rapacious landlord is thwarted in his attack on a virtuous woman by the gentlemanly tenant. It is this, I suggest, that offers a clue to who the villain is in the melodramatic narrative of the NGO campaign: it is the spectator.</p>
<p>This may seem like a puzzling, even melodramatic, claim. My argument is that the voiceover is addressed to spectators who if they refuse the invitation to ‘stop children dying’ or ‘to help a child survive’ by giving ‘just three pounds a month’ will reveal themselves to be heartless, indifferent, and uncaring; substantiating Asha’s implied fears that there is not ‘someone, somewhere’ with ‘the heart to help’. The question, ‘If Asha could ask you, would you help?’, is posed not only rhetorically (of course you would help) but also as a moral choice.</p>
<p>The villain in the melodramatic mode is not only the one who refuses to help but the one who causes the fall from virtue. This raises a further question; granted that the children are depicted as virtuous, in what sense is their death which the film anticipates a fall from grace? Is it that their suffering itself signifies their fall from grace? Suffering children are ambiguous figures. If, on the one hand, they invite the sympathy of the spectator, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1470357213483059">Erica Burman (1999)</xref> has suggested that a kind of rage against the defilement of our psychic investment in and nostalgia for a happy childhood may also be invoked in regarding images of suffering children. In any event, the implication is that suffering is here a fall from virtue caused by our (the spectators’) prior refusal to feed this particular child/children in Africa.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1470357213483059">
<title>A Space of Redemption and Return</title>
<p>If suffering and arrested development are the signs of the child’s fall from grace, then the home that they return to is signified in the Save the Children film by laughter, the presence of a loving mother, and the appropriately developing body. In the Plan UK film, the depiction in colour of the girl’s life post-sponsorship signifies the return to a proper childhood, to education and the anticipation of a future. The space of return represented in these melodramas is the return to our contemporary ideal of childhood. When the film begins, the child is already distressed; the loss of innocence has already taken place. We bring to the image of the suffering child our knowledge of the beginning of their story and anticipate in the melodramatic mode, their return to innocence. Yet, here ‘Asha’ is not returned to innocence and the film ends as it began, with the image of her suffering body. This is the dialectic that Williams identifies in the melodramatic mode between ‘in the nick of time’ and ‘too late’; between pathos and action.</p>
<p>Similarly in the ActionAid film, an ongoing story of other children who continue to live on the streets, beg and are hungry is the storyline that both illustrates and is the excess of Aklima’s story. Aklima’s space of return to innocence is signified by the break in the music when Aklima meets her rescue. This moment of silence, as if we are holding our breath whilst we find out if Aklima will be rescued, is followed by happier music. Aklima says, ‘you would not recognise me/ I am working now’ exactly mirroring the 19th-century before and after narratives of Dr Barnardo’s in which organised work for an employer in a trade is the new start, the making of a respectable child.</p>

<sec id="section13-1470357213483059">
<title>Melodrama and the Exclusion of Politics</title>
<p>Melodrama has been widely criticised for its reduction of politics to ethics or morals. It has been claimed, for example, that the news coverage of the September 11 attacks by Al Qaida on the USA deployed a melodramatic mode in which ‘designations of right and wrong became depoliticized because they were codified as universal moral truths’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1470357213483059">Anker, 2005</xref>: 35). It is interesting that the construction of ‘universal moral truths’ should be counterposed to the sphere of politics since it could equally be argued that universal moral truths are precisely where the rule of politics can be legitimately grounded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1470357213483059">Kelly, 2000</xref>). If politics is not about moral decisions about questions of the public good, then what is it about? Nevertheless, this suspicion of melodrama for its simplifying of complex causes and its insistence on simple solutions, for in short its moral legibility is a recognised characteristic of critiques of the melodramatic mode.</p>
<p>Clearly melodrama does not offer a deep or thorough analysis of political problems. The economy of the mode in relation to language is what lends it its emotional power. It works precisely because it does not insist that for spectators to really understand what goes on here, they need to become familiar with a whole history, sociology or political economy of the suffering that confronts them in these representations. Melodrama refuses the claim that knowledge is a precondition for action. The epistemology of melodrama is the gut feeling that what the spectator witnesses is wrong. It is this insistence, this privileging of feeling over rationality, that has both made of melodrama a discredited cultural form and ensured its central place in popular culture from the soap opera to the disaster film. Given the long history and broad dissemination of the melodramatic mode through different media forms from silent film to the soap opera, it is a fair bet that most spectators will have the genre literacy necessary to understand the form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1470357213483059">Kakoudaki, 2002</xref>: 109); it is this which makes melodrama such an obvious mode for NGO communication.</p>
<p>The deployment of the melodramatic mode to discuss political questions has also been criticised for the individual relationship that it sets in place between the spectator and the suffering subject. Here the argument is not so much that melodrama renders the causes and solutions to suffering as legible and simple as that the singularity of individual identification is antithetical to the multiplicity of political identification. However, although melodrama’s power does rest on its ability to engage the individual spectator in a visceral emotional response with another individual’s suffering, both the spectator and the subject are at the same time rendered as one of a multitude of spectators. The NGO films in melodramatic mode strive to destabilise the solution of public problems through personal recovery by its insistence that the main character in their films is both singular and multitudinous. It is, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470357213483059">Boltanski (1999</xref>: 12) says, that the spectator should be made to feel that ‘it is he, but it could be someone else; it is that child there who makes us cry, but any other child could have done the same.’</p>
<p>Although many scholars accept that melodrama has generated sympathy ‘for disenfranchised political subjects’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1470357213483059">Siomopoulos, 2006</xref>:180), they also doubt the political significance of compassion. Siomopoulos, for example, starkly argues that this sympathy has ‘never translated into political progress’ (p. 180). Her commentary is on the historical and political context in which the melodrama Stella Dallas (about a mill worker rising to a higher class through marriage) was produced and she relates its plot to the wider political discourse of the New Deal.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1470357213483059">2</xref></sup> She points to the limits of the melodrama for critiquing the underlying structural issues that generate the inequalities and impoverishment of working-class families represented in the film. Furthermore, she argues that sympathy cannot be mobilised for politics because it supports the distribution of public resources on the basis of empathy with suffering rather than entitlement; empathy cannot be an effective site from which to base social justice. In support of her argument, she cites Hannah Arendt’s commentary in her chapter on ‘The Social Question’ from <italic>On Revolution</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1470357213483059">2006[1963]</xref>). However, this is misplaced since what Arendt is arguing in the Social Question is not only that this particular mode (an emotional mode or compassion) of responding to the suffering of poverty is an inappropriate, indeed dangerous, place from which to make political decisions about the distribution of resources, but that poverty itself is not part of the proper sphere of politics. She claims that nothing ‘could be more obsolete than to attempt to liberate mankind from poverty by political means; nothing could be more futile and more dangerous’ (p. 104). Arendt’s point is not that compassion is less effective than entitlement for resolving the ‘social question’, that is, the suffering of poverty. Her point, in fact, is that the French revolutionaries insisted that compassion demanded that the poor should have an entitlement to being released from poverty. This fact was so unequivocal for the revolutionaries that it could not countenance discussion and dialogue but should be resolved through violence. Compassion, Arendt says,<disp-quote>
<p>will shun the drawn-out wearisome processes of persuasion, negotiation, and compromise, which are the processes of law and politics, and lend its voice to the suffering itself, which must claim for swift and direct action, that is, for action with the means of violence. (p. 77)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For Arendt, revolution should be about freedom and not about necessity. She argues that:<disp-quote>
<p>the whole record of past revolutions demonstrates beyond doubt that every attempt to solve the social question with political means leads into terror, and that it is terror which sends revolutions to their doom. (p. 102)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Arendt’s argument does not, then, support Siomopooulos’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1470357213483059">2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1470357213483059">2012</xref>) claim that compassion is no basis for political progress because it refuses the entitlement of the poor or marginal to economic resources. In fact, Arendt is arguing that the poor do not have an entitlement to economic resources. Nonetheless, Siomopoulos’s objection to melodrama – that it substitutes empathic identification for entitlement – is widely held. For two reasons, firstly, politics of identification provoke anxieties about how the boundaries of inclusion are drawn (of who the ‘we’ is that identification rests on). Secondly, emotion as a call for political action is seen as at least potentially reactionary since an emotional response to injury cannot in itself be adjudicated as right or wrong. However, the belief that political claims should be evidence based and rely on rational argument when applied to social injury is also problematic. It assumes that, for example, racism or other forms of exclusion on the basis of (non) identification arise from a cognitive dissonance and can be corrected through knowledge, information and rational inquiry. However, this simply substitutes information for emotion without addressing the necessity of a dialogue about values, about what kind of world we want (and who the ‘we’ is that wants this world). Melodrama is at least as capable of forcing us to confront the question of what kind of world we want, and whom we stand in solidarity with, as are realist modes that assume this question has already been answered.</p>
