<abstract>
<p>Although it is assumed that most patients with terminal cancer are reluctant to receive life-sustaining treatment, there is a paucity of evidence supporting this assumption. We retrospectively analyzed the advance directives of terminal cancer patients to determine the preferences of patients. Patients with cancer who had life expectancy of less than 6 months were admitted to a palliative care unit in Seoul Medical Center from March 2008 to February 2010. Among a total of 247 patients, advance directives were present in the medical records of 168 patients (68.0%). Most of the advance directives were written by the patients’ families (95.2%) and they stated that they did not want most of the invasive procedures. Patients with advanced cancer mostly requested that only minimally invasive treatments that eased suffering be performed.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Patients with advanced cancer commonly have “do not resuscitate” requests. For a fair number of elderly patients with cancer in Korea, most of the important medical management issues are decided by family members and physicians rather than patients themselves. However, the families and physicians do not always see eye to eye with regard to decisions about the end-of-life care for patients with terminal cancer.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049909111435811">1</xref>
</sup> In instances of such discord, patient-derived advance directives (ADs) can be used to decide how the patient should be treated. Advance directives are documented instructions given by individuals that specify what actions should be taken for their health in the event that they are no longer able to make decisions due to illness or incapacity.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049909111435811">2</xref>
</sup> Until now, ADs have not been widely used in Korea.</p>
<p>Recently, several Korean medical associations have issued joint guidelines about the termination of life-sustaining treatments as a result of the legal affairs associated with a case of an elderly woman with irreversible brain damage that occurred in September 2009.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049909111435811">3</xref>
</sup> These guidelines stipulate that when a terminally ill patient expresses reluctance in advance with regard to cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) or an artificial respirator, such medical actions should not be performed, and treatment should focus on the supply of basic nutrition and pain control.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049909111435811">1</xref>
</sup> Furthermore, these guidelines categorize life-sustaining treatments as either general or special (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1049909111435811">Table 1</xref>). According to the guidelines, physicians and families can withdraw or withhold special life-sustaining treatments if a patient states such a desire in an AD. Despite these experts’ guidelines, we have very limited data on the opinions of Korean patients with cancer and their families about this topic.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049909111435811">4</xref>
</sup> There is a possibility that there is discord between patients and medical teams about end-of-life care. Therefore, we designed this study to investigate the level of treatment that is thought to be acceptable in the end-of-life care by patients (or their family members in cases in which the family member wrote the AD) with terminal cancer.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>Patients were consecutively enrolled from March 2008 to February 2010 at Seoul Medical Center, a municipal teaching hospital with hospice facilities and a hospice team. Inclusion criteria for patients were as follows: (1) patients must have had advanced cancer and no further plans for anticancer treatment (major surgery, chemotherapy, or radiotherapy), (2) patients had to have a life expectancy of less than 6 months, (3) patients had to agree to be admitted into a palliative care unit, and (4) patients (or their family) had to have insight about their diagnosis and understand the natural course of their disease. In Korea, a considerable percentage of the children of elderly cancer patients do not want the patient to know the exact diagnosis, stage, and prognosis of their disease. The children are concerned that if presented with the facts, the patient will become despondent and refuse any further treatment. For this reason, many Korean patients with cancer do not know their exact disease status and prognosis. Hence, we decided to include patients who lacked full insight about their stage of cancer or prognosis in this study.</p>
<p>In our institution, ADs have been included in the official medical records since 2007. Since they are written in Korean, a translated AD form is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1049909111435811">Figure 1</xref>. It consists of 18 items about individual medical practices that could be a part of palliative or life-sustaining treatments. Among the 18, 11 questions are about special life-sustaining treatments such as intubation, mechanical ventilation, tracheostomy, cardiac massage or defibrillation, and hemodialysis. The remaining 7 questions are more general in nature. Before an AD was completed, attending physicians gave a detailed explanation of the individual practices, including the potential harms and benefits, to the patients or their families. Furthermore, an AD could be updated whenever a patient or a family wanted. When death was approaching, if a proxy had written an AD for a patient, the physicians confirmed the content of the AD with the proxy. However, if the document was written by patient, the AD was not confirmed unless the patient requested such confirmation.</p>

</fig>
<p>For each question in the AD form, patients (or proxies) had 3 options; to do, not to do, or delegate decision to doctor.</p>
<p>The demographics, clinical information, and ADs of the patients were collected by a retrospective review of medical records. The study was approved by institutional review board of Seoul Medical Center. Statistical analysis was performed with Excel (Microsoft, 2007) and PASW Statistics version 18.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The median survival time was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 247 patients were enrolled in the study, with male patients outnumbering female patients (male: n = 156, 63.2%). The median patient age was 65 years (range: 20-94). The majority of the patients had died (79.8%) by the time of the investigation. Of the 247 patients, 168 (68.0%) had ADs in their medical records. Most of the ADs were written by family members, as only 8 patients (4.8%) wrote the AD themselves even though most of the patients were not cognitively impaired. The characteristics of the patients are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1049909111435811">Table 2</xref>. The median duration from the time the AD was signed to death was 9 days (95% confidence interval: 6.4-11.6, range: 0-69), and the majority of patients (88, 53.9%) died within 10 days of signing of the AD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1049909111435811">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<p>The patients’ or proxies’ preferences with regard to individual treatments and procedures are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1049909111435811">Table 3</xref>. The overwhelming majority of the ADs stated that the patient or proxy refused CPR, intubation and mechanical ventilation, tracheostomy, hemodialysis, and surgery requiring general anesthesia. In contrast, most ADs requested antibiotic treatment for severe infections with a very low probability of recovery, intravascular pain control, parenteral nutrition, and the supply of oxygen via nasal prong or mask. There were no trends about preferences regarding thoracentesis/paracentesis, transfusion, and the use of inotropics, and a considerable portion (10%-13%) delegated the decision making about these 3 treatments/procedures to the physician. However, a slightly higher percentage wanted thoracentesis and/or paracentesis to be performed because these procedures are essential in relieving the symptoms related to fluid retention in the pleural and peritoneal cavities. Similarly, transfusion was often requested to alleviate anemia-associated dyspnea and weakness. On the other hand, a greater percentage of patients refused inotropics.</p>

<p>It is interesting that only 8 patients (4.8%) wrote their own ADs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1049909111435811">Table 4</xref>). Most ADs were written by patients’ spouses or offspring, with sons being the most common AD writers and health care proxies. In contrast, spouses were most likely to be the caregivers. Hence, the main caregiver was not always the decision maker.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study investigated the contents of advance directives written by patients with advanced cancer or their health care proxies to determine their preferences regarding end-of-life treatments. As expected, the majority of patients with terminal cancer (or their proxies) did not want to be resuscitated or to receive invasive treatments. Although there are slight differences, overall, these results correspond well with the Korean guidelines about the termination/refusal of life-sustaining treatments. Patients/proxies refused most special life-sustaining treatments, including CPR, mechanical ventilation, tracheostomy, hemodialysis, and surgery requiring general anesthesia, but requested blood transfusions and advanced antibiotics. As we did not ask patients/proxies the reason for their choices, it is not clear why they wanted to receive these treatments but not the others. However, one would assume that they would accept transfusions and antibiotics because they are simple, painless procedures with no (or very little) harm. Similarly, as thoracentesis and paracentesis can immediately relieve disconcerting symptoms like dyspnea and abdominal fullness, patients/proxies often requested that malignant pleural effusions or ascites be drained.</p>
<p>Many studies have already investigated the topics of end-of-life decisions and advance care planning.<sup>

</sup> However, there is limited data about the preferences of patients with terminal cancer (or their families) about individual medical practices that may be required to sustain the lives of severely ill patients. Recently, there have been other published studies that are similar to our study.<sup>

</sup> A Swiss study described 50 ADs of elderly patients with advanced cancer.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049909111435811">10</xref>
</sup> In this study, ADs were defined in broad categories and then classified, and patients showed preferences similar to the patients in our study in terms of resuscitation and the administration of artificial nutrition. On the other hand, an American study focused on 20 advanced cancer patients’ sense of how much control they had of their care and did not investigate patient preferences regarding individual medical treatments and procedures.<sup>

</p>
<p>Our study focused on whether patients wanted individual medical practices performed to sustain their lives and had a larger patient population than previous studies. The data from this study could be helpful in establishing the proper level (intensiveness) of care for patients with advanced cancer. As many people stated similar views in the ADs reviewed in this study, some kind of social agreement could be drawn from larger scale studies in the future.</p>
<p>This study has several limitations. First, most of the AD writers in this study were family members, not the patients themselves. Due to the cultural atmosphere of Korea, many families do not want to discuss end-of-life issues with patients. Many Koreans think that talking about an AD is to allude to imminent death. Hence, we had to cautiously assume that how a patient’s proxy answered the questions on the AD form was a true reflection of the patient’s views. Second, this is a retrospective study that did not investigate the preferences of patients who refused to write an AD. Third, most ADs were written when death was imminent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1049909111435811">Figure 2</xref>). While it is doubtful that these important decisions would have been the same if they were made in less exigent circumstances, since this decision often occurs in similarly urgent circumstances in everyday practice, we feel our results reflects reality.</p>
<p>In summary, patients with advanced cancer (or their proxies) did not want to be resuscitated or have their life prolonged in a manner that would be painful. Instead, they wanted supportive measures performed that would reduce suffering regardless of whether these measures had any life-prolonging benefits.</p>
