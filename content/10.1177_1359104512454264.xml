<abstract>
<p>George Kelly’s <italic>The psychology of personal constructs</italic> put forward a new psychology that viewed people as actively constructing and anticipating their worlds. This paper considers personal construct theory and its philosophy; personal construct assessment techniques; the personal construct view of psychological disorder and its treatment; and the wide range of other applications of personal construct theory. It is concluded that personal construct psychology remains a radical approach over half a century after Kelly published his magnum opus.</p>

<body>
<p>George Kelly’s magnum opus, <italic>The psychology of personal constructs</italic>, spanning 1218 pages in two volumes, was first published in 1955. What began life some 20 years earlier as a handbook of clinical procedures for Kelly’s students had at this stage developed into no less than an exposition of a whole new psychology that was a radical departure from existing approaches. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1359104512454264">Kelly (1955</xref>, p. ix) described it, ‘we had wandered far off the beaten paths of psychology, much further than we had ever suspected’. This process of development included three years in which colleagues were invited to Kelly’s home every Thursday evening to discuss drafts of the manuscript, a ‘weekly ordeal’ which he found ‘painfully stimulating. Attendance ran as high as thirty and pages covered in an evening ran as low as one’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1359104512454264">Kelly, 1955</xref>, p. x). It culminated in the day when, as described by one of the ‘Thursday-nighters’, Brendan Maher, ‘Twelve copies were made, packaged and addressed to leading publishers (without any advance warning to them, I believe) and taken to the Post Office by George and some students in George’s station-wagon’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1359104512454264">Fransella, 1995</xref>, p. 12). Maher goes on to describe Kelly’s amazement when he received offers of publishers’ contracts. Kelly’s ambivalence at the publication of his work has also been noted, which some think was due to the sense that his ideas were so ahead of their time that they would struggle to be accepted.</p>
<p><italic>The psychology of personal constructs</italic> is certainly not an altogether easy read. Indeed, in his introduction its editor, Fillimore Sanford, warned that ‘getting from one end to the other of this book can be a genuine adventure – a stimulating, absorbing and sometimes frustrating adventure’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1359104512454264">Kelly, 1955</xref>, p. xvii). Part of the frustration faced by readers is that, since he was putting forward a novel psychology, Kelly did not use most of the terms employed by existing theories, but instead coined a new language; and even when a reader might take comfort in at last finding a familiar word, such as anxiety or guilt, s/he would then discover that it is defined in a very unfamiliar way.</p>
<p>The book is also unusual in that personal construct theory is presented very formally, in terms of a ‘fundamental postulate’ and 11 corollaries of this postulate. In his description of these corollaries, and in his amendments to the draft of the manuscript for the book (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1359104512454264">Kelly, n.d</xref>.), it is very clear that Kelly carefully weighed up every term that he used. This precision is evident throughout most of the book, even going as far as a taxonomy of 10 different types of weeping, although perhaps less so in the two chapters devoted to psychological disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1359104512454264">Winter, 2009a</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite the formality, or tightness in Kellyan jargon, of much of the book, Kelly’s ‘preferred world’ was that of looser construing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1359104512454264">Fransella, 1995</xref>). A looser, narrative style is more apparent in his papers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1359104512454264">Maher, 1969</xref>) than in his magnum opus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1359104512454264">Mair, 1989</xref>), but nevertheless it, and Kelly’s playfulness, also permeate most sections of the book. Take, for example, this whimsical passage from a section on the nature of the universe:<disp-quote>
<p>…ordinarily it would appear that there is a closer relationship between the motion of my fingers and the action of the typewriter keys than there is, say, between either of them and the price of yak milk in Tibet. But we believe that, in the long run, all of these events – the motion of my fingers, the action of the keys, and the price of yak milk – are interlocked. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1359104512454264">Kelly, 1955</xref>, p. 6)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A more narrative style is also apparent in the numerous clinical vignettes with which Kelly illustrated aspects of his theory.</p>
<p>We shall now look back on some of the main areas covered by the book over half a century after it was published, and consider whether they have stood the test of time.</p>
<sec id="section1-1359104512454264">
<title>The theory and its philosophy</title>
<p>Kelly’s vision of the person was of someone who actively constructs their world, like a scientist, by formulating anticipations, testing them out, and if necessary revising them. This may not seem exceptional now, but at the time it was a radical departure from the deterministic, mechanistic, and reductionist view taken by the principal psychologies of the day. His approach is generally now seen as fitting comfortably amongst those more recent developments that have come to be termed constructivist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1359104512454264">Raskin, 2002</xref>), and he and Jean Piaget are sometimes regarded as the early pioneers of constructivism, despite differences between their positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1359104512454264">Rychlak, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1359104512454264">Soffer, 1993</xref>). However, there is a view that Kelly was a minimum realist rather than a constructivist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1359104512454264">Stevens, 1998</xref>), and concerns have also been expressed that his psychology would ‘sink without trace’ if subsumed under the constructivist umbrella (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1359104512454264">Fransella, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>The challenge of neatly pigeonholing Kelly’s theory has been apparent ever since his book first appeared. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1359104512454264">Kelly (1969)</xref> himself expressed his surprise and amusement at the various ways in which personal construct theory had been classified: for example, as cognitive; emotional; existentialist; dialectical materialist; a learning theory; psychoanalytic; and Zen Buddhist. This variety of classifications is itself consistent with Kelly’s philosophical assumption of constructive alternativism, namely that everything is open to alternative constructions.</p>
<p>Probably the most common current construction of personal construct psychology to be found in psychology textbooks is that it is a cognitive theory. For example, Kelly has been described as ‘perhaps the first cognitive-behavioral theorist’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1359104512454264">Ivey, Ivey, &amp; Simek-Downing, 1987</xref>, p. 302) and ‘the first truly cognitive personologist’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1359104512454264">Wiggins &amp; Pincus, 1992</xref>, p. 496). This is despite <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1359104512454264">Kelly’s (1969)</xref> observation that he had ‘been so puzzled over the early labelling of personal construct theory as “cognitive” that several years ago I set out to write another short book to make it clear that I wanted no part of cognitive theory’ (p. 216). One of the reasons for Kelly’s position is that, in his holistic view of the person, ‘The classic threefold division of psychology into cognition, affection, and conation has been completely abandoned’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1359104512454264">Kelly, 1955</xref>, p. 130). His theory is therefore no more cognitive than it is a theory of affect, and indeed the provisional title of the ‘short book’ which he considered writing was ‘The human feeling’. That many textbook authors apparently do not appreciate this has been viewed as an attempt to contain a revolutionary by ‘putting him in his place’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1359104512454264">Bannister &amp; Fransella, 1986</xref>), but it is just one instance of many misunderstandings of the theory by such authors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1359104512454264">Walker, 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>That personal construct theory itself, as opposed to applications of the theory, has not been developed greatly over the years since it was first presented perhaps indicates that it has stood the test of time, and of research investigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1359104512454264">Adams–Webber, 2003</xref>), as well as the comprehensiveness of Kelly’s vision. The areas in which additions have been proposed to Kelly’s original list of corollaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1359104512454264">Katz, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1359104512454264">Procter, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1359104512454264">Thomas, 1979</xref>) have been those in which some writers have argued that the theory was insufficiently elaborated, namely the development of construing and social construing. Rebutting the latter criticism, a case has been made for personal construct psychology being regarded as a social psychology, which has much to say about construing beyond the individual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1359104512454264">Kalekin-Fishman &amp; Walker, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1359104512454264">Walker &amp; Winter, 2007</xref>). Nevertheless, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1359104512454264">Procter’s (1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1359104512454264">2012)</xref> family and relational construct psychologies are significant developments that have highlighted links between the theory and systemic approaches.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1359104512454264">
<title>Assessment techniques</title>
<p>Kelly’s theory is perhaps less well known than his techniques for the assessment of construing, particularly the repertory grid, one of the variations of the Role Construct Repertory Test presented in the first of his two volumes. Indeed, over 90 per cent of personal construct research has employed this technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1359104512454264">Neimeyer, Baker, &amp; Neimeyer, 1990</xref>). This burgeoning of research and other applications of the repertory grid in part reflects developments in computer software, allowing a very wide range of measures to be extracted much more easily from a grid than was the case, for example, with Kelly’s rather laborious original method of nonparametric factor analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1359104512454264">Fransella, Bell, &amp; Bannister, 2004</xref>). Above all, however, the popularity of the technique reflects its flexibility. For example, while in its original form it involved the person sorting significant people (in grid jargon, ‘elements’) fitting various role titles in terms of constructs elicited from him or her, the elements need not be other people but can be any aspect of the world of interest to the investigator (e.g. different selves; relationships; life events), while the constructs may be elicited, or supplied, in various different ways. The grid can also be regarded as one of the first ‘mixed methods’ approaches in psychology, being amenable to both quantitative and qualitative analysis, and suited to both idiographic and nomothetic investigations. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1359104512454264">Kelly (1955)</xref> himself anticipated some of the possible developments in the use of grids, for example in exploring the construing not only of individuals but also of groups.</p>
<p>The other major assessment technique that Kelly introduced in <italic>The psychology of personal constructs</italic> was the self-characterisation, which involved writing an autobiographical sketch in the third person. This presaged the narrative approaches to psychology that have become popular in recent years. However, it was radical at the time, and still is to this day, in that it adopts a ‘credulous attitude’, taking the person’s story at face value as having an ‘intrinsic truth’. In the words of what has become known as Kelly’s ‘first principle’: ‘if you do not know what is wrong with a person, ask him, he may tell you’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1359104512454264">Kelly, 1955</xref>, pp. 322–323).</p>
<p>The years since the publication of Kelly’s two volumes have seen not only the development of various modifications of his two major assessment techniques, but also of new methods for the assessment of construing inspired by Kelly’s ideas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1359104512454264">Caputi, Viney, Walker, &amp; Crittenden, 2012</xref>).</p>

<title>Psychological ‘disorders’ and their treatment</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1359104512454264">Kelly (1955)</xref> was highly critical of the traditional psychiatric approach to psychopathology, and described psychiatric diagnosis as ‘all too frequently an attempt to cram a whole live struggling client into a nosological category’ (p. 775). He went on to say that ‘It is not practical to attempt to catalogue all the typical psychological disorders – even if he could, who would have the stomach for writing that kind of cook book?’ (p. 836). Sadly, the answer to his question is now all too apparent: namely, the authors of successive editions of the <italic>Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders</italic>, whose stomachs appear to extend to devising a catalogue that will be able to cram most of the population into nosological categories.</p>
<p>Given Kelly’s views, it is ironic that many clinicians, particularly in the UK, first became aware of personal construct psychology through a diagnostic grid test of schizophrenic thought disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1359104512454264">Bannister &amp; Fransella, 1966</xref>). Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1359104512454264">Fransella (2001)</xref> subsequently wrote that she was ‘not proud of having used the grid in that nomothetic way’ (p. 375), this body of work did demonstrate that the predicament of people labelled as thought disordered schizophrenics could be explained in terms of the same processes of construing as are used by anyone else. As such, it reflected <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1359104512454264">Kelly’s (1955)</xref> ‘transitive’, dimensional approach to diagnosis, in which the client’s pathways of movement were mapped in terms of a set of diagnostic constructs, which were ‘neither good nor bad, healthy nor unhealthy, adaptive nor maladaptive’ (p. 453). This, in effect, is formulation, currently championed as the approach that clinical psychologists should be using as an alternative to psychiatric diagnosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1359104512454264">Division of Clinical Psychology, 2011</xref>). Although generally regarded as deriving from the cognitive-behavioural tradition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1359104512454264">Bruch, 1998</xref>), formulation was the term that Kelly used to describe his approach in 1955. With some refinements, perhaps including the replacement of the term ‘disorder’ by a less mechanistic alternative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1359104512454264">Winter, 2003a</xref>), this approach and its underlying assumptions are as relevant and necessary today as they were then (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1359104512454264">Winter &amp; Procter, 2013</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1359104512454264">Kelly (1955)</xref> made clear that ‘Transitive diagnosis is not complete until a plan for management and treatment has been formulated’ (p. 180). Although his book contained a description of a particular novel therapeutic technique, fixed-role therapy, Kelly also indicated that the treatment approaches used by the personal construct psychotherapist could be borrowed from other models if, on the basis of the formulation, they were best placed to facilitate reconstruing. Despite this eclecticism at the level of therapeutic techniques, ‘The theoretical grounds upon which the varying procedures are accepted do not, however, represent eclecticism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1359104512454264">Kelly, 1955</xref>, p. 810). Personal construct psychotherapy has some commonalities with more recent integrative approaches to psychotherapy, and is regarded by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1359104512454264">Neimeyer (1988)</xref> as representing a ‘theoretically progressive integrationism’.</p>
<p>Personal construct psychotherapy is commonly classified as a cognitive therapy, but, despite the fact that leading cognitive therapists such as Beck and Ellis acknowledge debts to Kelly, such a classification is no more appropriate than textbook classifications of Kelly’s theory as cognitive. As well as theoretical differences, there is some evidence that the process of personal construct psychotherapy differs significantly from that of rationalist cognitive therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1359104512454264">Winter &amp; Watson, 1999</xref>), although arguably there is more similarity with some ‘third wave’ cognitive approaches.</p>
<p>Personal construct psychotherapy has over the years been applied successfully with a wide range of client groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1359104512454264">Winter, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1359104512454264">Winter &amp; Viney, 2005</xref>). Why, then, is it not more popular and recommended in treatment guidelines? One reason for this is that, tending to view themselves as revolutionaries, personal construct psychologists have never been very concerned with gaining acceptance, marketing their approach, or playing the ‘evidence base’ game (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1359104512454264">Neimeyer, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1359104512454264">Winter, 2010</xref>). Since such attitudes ultimately threaten the survival of personal construct psychotherapy, it is fortunate that not all have taken this view, and that consequently there is now not inconsiderable evidence that this form of therapy is roughly as effective as other therapeutic approaches, including cognitive-behavioural therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1359104512454264">Holland, Neimeyer, Currier, &amp; Berman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1359104512454264">Metcalfe, Winter, &amp; Viney, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1359104512454264">Viney, Metcalfe, &amp; Winter, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1359104512454264">Winter, 2003b</xref>). However, this still often goes unreported since, with its eschewal of psychiatric diagnosis as a way of defining research participants, and an emphasis on outcome measures focussing on reconstruing rather than symptomatic change, the evidence base for personal construct psychotherapy is, as noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1359104512454264">Roth and Fonagy (2005</xref>, p. 492), ‘philosophically at variance with a conventional review such as this one’ (namely their influential book, <italic>What works for whom?</italic>). Ironically, when this evidence base <italic>has</italic> been reported in reviews of the psychotherapy research literature, it has been included in sections devoted to cognitive-behavioural therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1359104512454264">Carr, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1359104512454264">Cooper, 2008</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1359104512454264">
<title>Other applications</title>
<p>Although, to use Kellyan jargon, the ‘focus of convenience’ of the theory expounded in Kelly’s two volumes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1359104512454264">Kelly, 1955</xref>, p. 23) was therapy, or ‘the psychological reconstruction of life’, he also made clear that ‘a good theory should suggest predictions concerning people’s behaviour in a wide range of circumstances’ and ‘encourage the invention of new approaches to the solution of the problems of man and his society’ (p. 24). That personal construct psychology has stood the test of time in fulfilling these specifications for a good theory is evidenced by the extraordinary breadth of its applications since it was introduced to the world in 1955. In addition to areas already mentioned in this paper, these include applications in the fields of education, organisational psychology, forensic psychology, politics, the arts, sport, anthropology, religion, and artificial intelligence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1359104512454264">Fransella, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1359104512454264">Walker &amp; Winter, 2007</xref>). Kelly’s psychology has spawned an extensive literature, two journals, several national associations, and national and international conferences, including a biennial international congress that has now met on 19 occasions. Although, perhaps fulfilling Fransella’s predictions and concerns about the theory being subsumed, one of the journals and one of the associations have now changed their titles to reflect a broader concern with constructivism, in general the ideas presented in <italic>The psychology of personal constructs</italic> would still appear to be alive and well. Paradoxically, this might, in Kelly’s view, indicate that his was not such a good theory after all for, in his view, a theory, like any construction of the world, should be ultimately expendable!</p>
<p>Over 40 years ago, when I first read Kelly’s two volumes, his ideas restored in me a faith in, and enthusiasm for, psychology that had been severely dampened by courses with a behaviourist focus and clinical services dominated by organic psychiatry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1359104512454264">Winter, 2009b</xref>). Although sad that my clinical psychology trainees once again have to work in settings dominated by quick-fix cognitive-behavioural approaches applied to psychiatrically labelled clients, I am gratified that many of them seem to find that personal construct psychology provides as fresh and inspiring an alternative view as I did in my own student days. For me, and for them, when we despair at the state of the health service, of our profession, or of our capacity to effect any change, Kelly’s words have the capacity to reawaken optimism. Perhaps nowhere is this better demonstrated than in the final quote that I shall provide from his magnum opus:<disp-quote>
<p>We take the stand that there are always some alternative constructions available to choose among in dealing with the world. No one needs to paint himself into a corner; no one needs to be completely hemmed in by circumstances; no one needs to be the victim of his biography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1359104512454264">Kelly, 1955</xref>, p. 15).</p>
