<p>An edited collection emanating from discussions at a recent restorative justice conference, this text offers original insight into the practice of restorative justice and its potential for future development. A wide range of authors contribute to this work, ranging from practitioners to seminal theorists including Howard Zehr, Ron Classen and Mark Umbreit. This diversity provides a unique perspective regarding restorative justice and its potential within modern society. Within the foreword, Umbreit identifies the ability of restorative justice to operate in a variety of situations and prepares the author for the discussion to follow. The collection is composed of 18 chapters, divided into Part 1, which addresses restorative justice interaction with victims and offenders and Part 2, which explores its impact within the broader world.</p>
<p>Previous literature exploring the practice and philosophy of restorative justice inevitably focused upon its role within the criminal justice system. This collection offers a synoptic assessment of the extent to which restorative justice philosophy can and has informed practice well beyond the field of criminal justice. Whilst providing a primarily descriptive commentary of the individual practices involved and their potential benefits, many of the locations in which restorative justice practices are described as being employed are both unexpected and surprising. This collection discusses the use of restorative justice in a diverse range of situations including the obvious criminal justice context, correctional settings with sex offences, educational institutions including schools and higher education, athletic and team settings and aid work following natural disasters. Authors identify the potential for utilising restorative justice practices and philosophy within varied, often surprising contexts with apparently high success. The focus upon restorative justice within these varied contexts provides a discussion of practice which is grounded in reality, as opposed to theoretical arguments which are often explored without reference to their implementation.</p>
<p>Many chapters employ the term ‘restorative justice’ in a broader linguistic context than readers from a legal background would expect. They address the underlying philosophy of restorative justice practices and their relevance to non-criminal events. This broader interpretation is evident within chapters appearing to employ ‘restorative justice’ practices in the absence of any offender or in other cases without any direct victim. However, this illustrates the extent to which restorative justice philosophy is capable of adaptation and utilisation in an expansive context. The extent to which chapters within this collection utilise the term ‘restorative justice’ and the broadening of its remit is surprising, given that a criticism of restorative justice theory focuses upon its persistent latent ambiguity and absence of a universally accepted definition. </p>
<p>Through offering an expansive review of the role that restorative justice can occupy within the wider context, this collection provides breadth of discussion, at the expense of in-depth analysis. Consequently, this collection may benefit to some extent from greater discussion and debate regarding the philosophy itself and the extent to which it can integrate or operate in tandem with existing processes, although this holds the potential for accommodation within a second volume. Indeed, within the foreword, Mark Umbreit identifies the potential for future editions to explore the development of restorative justice within those areas examined within the individual chapters.</p>
<p>The dominant theme across the edited collection is that restorative justice (as a broader term) is not limited to the criminal justice system. It questions the notion that restorative justice is appropriate only for minor offences and identifies the ability of restorative practices to address complex social contexts of which the traditional western criminal justice system remains incapable. Several chapters draw upon the personal experiences of the authors and the impact of restorative justice upon their lives, offering a unique insight into the impact of restorative justice practices. Such insight is both unusual and valuable due to previous evaluations apparent reliance upon quantitative statistical measurement. </p>
<p>Whilst this optimistic text espouses the potential of restorative justice, it would benefit from some degree of critical reflection or identification of the possible limits of restorative justice and the potential consequences of unsuccessful restoration. However, despite this, it remains a valuable text, identifying the extent to which restorative justice can operate within contexts other than that of the formal criminal justice system in a manner not previously addressed within extant literature.</p>
