<abstract>
<p>Convergence rates of cluster analysis results are studied for six sets of partition sorting data. Hierarchical cluster analysis, fuzzy cluster analysis, k-medoids clustering and four variants of the consensus clustering method are covered. The six data sets are kinship terms, colour plates, drug data, consultancy Web site items, social groups and prenatal tests. Convergence rates depend on the number of clusters extracted, on the clustering method and on the domain. For domains of 25 items or more, cluster analysis results identical to the final result were most consistently obtained using the third method of Gordon and Vichi (2001). Example evaluations are given for the most stable numbers of clusters for five sets of partition sorting using the method of Gordon and Vichi. The interpretations resemble previously published interpretations of results obtained from non-partitioning statistical methods.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Sorting is a simple method used for collecting data about cognitive structures. When it is applied, participants of a sorting study are given a set of items (often printed on paper cards). The participants are asked to sort the items into groups that make sense to them. A common variant is free sorting, where the participants are free to build any groups with respect to number, size or meaning. So far, sorting into partitions has been the most commonly applied mathematical model for sorting. The groups of items built are forced to be mutually exclusive and to cover the domain of items exhaustively. Several authors claimed that sorting requires a small sample of participants as compared to other methods. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0759106312465553">Miller (1969)</xref> recommends using a sample of 20 participants. In a set of 50 illustrative examples of sorting experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0759106312465553">Coxon, 1999</xref>: <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0759106312465553">Table 4</xref>), sample sizes vary between 5 and 200, with a median of 50. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0759106312465553">Tullis and Wood (2004)</xref> performed a simulation study based on a sample of 168 participants. They recommend a sample size of 20 to 30 participants, which leads to an average Pearson correlation of 0.95 between results of subsets of this size and results of the full set of sorting data. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0759106312465553">Nielsen (2004)</xref> regards a Pearson correlation of 0.9 as sufficient. Using the data of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0759106312465553">Tullis and Wood (2004)</xref>, he recommends a sample size of 15. The present study adds to that information. It employs data from six different free partition sorting studies, investigating if the results from different item sets converge differently to the final result. Any investigation should probably lead to a reproducible, stable result. Therefore, the present study compares the results of hard cluster analysis from random subsamples of increasing size to that of the full sample. A set of cluster partitioning methods that have been commonly used for partition sorting data is employed for cluster analysis. The present study investigates if these methods require different sample sizes. Finally the most stable cluster analysis results for each of the data sets will be presented and discussed. This way it will be tested if the results are not only stable but also readily interpretable.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>Six sets of sorting data are used in the present study. All of them have already been used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0759106312465553">Harloff (2012)</xref>. The data sets differ in the theme, but also in the number of items sorted, the number of participants employed, and in the variation within the set of sortings.</p>
<sec id="section3-0759106312465553">
<title>Kinship Terms</title>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0759106312465553">Rosenberg and Kim (1975)</xref> conducted a multiple sorting study of 15 kinship terms, sorted by participants into partitions repeatedly. A part of their data, which is used herein, has subsequently been reinvestigated and published by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0759106312465553">Rosenberg (1982)</xref>. It has since become a famous, repeatedly scrutinized and well-known set of sorting data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0759106312465553">Arabie et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0759106312465553">Coxon, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0759106312465553">Gordon and Vichi, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0759106312465553">Hornik, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0759106312465553">De Leeuw and Mair, 2009</xref>). The data set is electronically available as part of the <italic>clue</italic> package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0759106312465553">Hornik, 2005</xref>), as well as the <italic>smacof</italic> package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0759106312465553">De Leeuw and Mair, 2009</xref>) in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0759106312465553">Gordon and Vichi (2001)</xref> found a solution for 3 clusters to be particularly interesting for their fuzzy cluster analysis methods. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0759106312465553">Rosenberg and Kim (1975)</xref> used Individual Differences Scaling to identify 3 major dimensions in the full data set, where single-sort conditions differed from multiple sorting conditions and female respondents differed from males. But the present subset of multiple sorting of 15 terms by 85 female respondents should be rather homogeneous. But in this paper, the kinship terms data set is the only one showing a multimodal frequency distribution of the number of item moves required to transform all the partitions into each other. All other data sets show a unimodal item move frequency distribution resembling a normal distribution. This may point to an as yet hidden way of systematic variation within the data set, possibly related to the multiple sorting condition.</p>

<title>Colour Plates</title>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0759106312465553">Harloff (2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0759106312465553">2008a</xref>) used a set of 20 colour plates sorted under different methodological conditions. The sorting samples representing partitions are re-used herein, plus a few as yet unpublished data. The applicable methodological differences were found to be unimportant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0759106312465553">Harloff, 2008a</xref>). The full sample of participants consists of 76 students from the University of Munich. Using Fuzzy Cluster Analysis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0759106312465553">Harloff (2008a</xref>) found a number of 5 to 7 clusters to be an optimal structure for a data set of fuzzy sorting origin. Judging from silhouette widths, the item set does not fit well to a partition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0759106312465553">Harloff, 2008a</xref>), but the data are still useful for considerations about stability of partitioning results.</p>

<title>Consultancy Web Site Items</title>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0759106312465553">Harloff (2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0759106312465553">2008a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0759106312465553">2008b</xref>) already used this items set, consisting of 25 short descriptions of content items of a consultancy Web site, edited qualitatively to be mutually exclusive and exhaustive. The items were sorted by economically proficient participants in Munich as well as students of economy enrolled with the University of Munich. As with the colour plate item set, the data used herein all represent partition sortings with no significant methodological difference between. Some as yet unpublished data from economically proficient participants in Oldenburg and Munich were added, the full sample size is 53. The optimal number of dimensions for non-metric scaling and a network representation was found to be 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0759106312465553">Harloff 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0759106312465553">2008a</xref>), while the smallest maximum likelihood factor analysis solution with an acceptable p level was obtained for 9 factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0759106312465553">Harloff, 2008b</xref>). A partition model is probably less adequate for this domain than a cover set model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0759106312465553">Harloff, 2008a</xref>). But the data are still useful for considerations about stability of partitioning results.</p>

<title>Social Groups</title>
<p>Adrian Stringer contributed sorting data about social identities of 46 Northern Irish church members, sorting 27 different social groups in terms of which went together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0759106312465553">Stringer, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0759106312465553">Stringer and Coxon, 2011</xref>)<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0759106312465553">1</xref>
</sup>. The data set is available and Anthony <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0759106312465553">Coxon (2010)</xref> examined the data in detail, using partitioning into 5 groups and multidimensional scaling methods. The full data set is a combination of data sets obtained for four different religious congregations, using the same methods for each congregation. According to Coxon's (2010) analysis, the data represent overlapping groups (covering sets) rather than partitions. But the data are still useful for considerations about stability of partitioning results.</p>

<sec id="section7-0759106312465553">
<title>Drug Data</title>
<p>Anthony Coxon kindly contributed sorting data from 69 participants, who sorted 28 drugs. Unfortunately these data are likely to remain unpublished. A valid interpretation is not evident at present. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0759106312465553">Coxon (2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0759106312465553">2006</xref>), multidimensional scaling leads to a clear structure of 3 groups of drugs.</p>

<sec id="section8-0759106312465553">
<title>Prenatal Tests</title>
<p>Jennifer Perry, formerly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0759106312465553">Hawkey (2005)</xref>, produced and examined a set of 50 sortings from British women who had to imagine they were pregnant. The participants had to sort prenatal tests for 30 different conditions according to similarity. Two groups of participants were given instructions of different elaborateness, but it appears the difference in instructions had no effect on the results. Two-dimensional scaling led to the interpretation of the factors “manageability” (how easy is it to cope with the condition?) and “lifespan” (would the condition reduce the lifespan?).</p>

<sec id="section9-0759106312465553">
<title>Estimation of Cluster Analysis Result Stability</title>
<p>Large sets of random subsamples were drawn from each of the sorting data sets with subsample sizes increasing from 5 to the full sample size in steps of 5. Each subsample of each of these sets was subjected to each of the partitioning methods described below. For each of the sorting data set and partitioning method combinations and for each subsample of each set of subsamples, clustering solutions were obtained for each number of clusters from 2 to 8 (kinship terms), from 2 to 10 (colour plates) and from 2 to 15 (all other sorting data sets). Note that for the kinship terms, drugs and social groups data sets, the respective maximum number of clusters forces the creation of at least one singleton cluster. For all partitioning methods, only true partitions were obtained since one of the aims of the present study is to give advice for design purposes. Design usually allows for true partitions only (also called “hard” or “crisp” solutions) since intermediate (fuzzy, also called “soft”) placement of items is usually impossible. The number of moves of items required to transform the partitioning results of subsamples to the partitioning result obtained from the full sample was determined. Moves measures of partition distance as a Q-mode measure have been introduced and suggested for use with sorting data by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0759106312465553">Boorman and Arabie (1972)</xref>, while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0759106312465553">Rubin (1967)</xref> discussed their virtues as compared to various common indices. The algorithm used for computation has been presented by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0759106312465553">Ford and Fulkerson (1962)</xref>. The single moves measure is known to be suboptimal for Q-mode multidimensional scaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0759106312465553">Boorman and Arabie, 1972</xref>: discussion of measure A), but here rather a measure of stability of clustering results is required. The face validity of single item moves is good for this purpose. Finally, the proportion of clustering results of subsamples identical to the full sample clustering result was determined (identity means a 0 moves of items distance). A more relaxed condition is the proportion of clustering results of subsamples within 3 moves from the full sample clustering result. A 3 moves distance means a more relaxed condition for the kinship term data (15 items total) and the colour plate data (20 items) than the other sets of data (25, 27, 28 and 30 items). All calculations were done using R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0759106312465553">R Development Core Team, 2010</xref>) employing the <italic>multicore</italic> package of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0759106312465553">Urbanek (2010)</xref> to speed up the calculations. The hierarchical cluster analysis and fuzzy cluster analysis were done using the <italic>cluster</italic> package of R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0759106312465553">Maechler et al., 2005</xref>), while consensus cluster analysis and all item move distance calculations were done using the <italic>clue</italic> package of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0759106312465553">Hornik (2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0759106312465553">2010</xref>: “consensus” and “dissimilarity” functions).</p>
<sec id="section10-0759106312465553">
<title>Hierarchical Cluster Analysis</title>
<p>Distance matrices of items were constructed for each sorting of a sample using the Jaccard index subtracted from 1 as a distance measure. (In this context the Jaccard index, also called Tanimoto index, of two items is the number of groups containing both items divided by the number of groups containing at least one of the two items.) The distance matrices were then averaged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0759106312465553">Miller, 1967</xref>) and a hierarchical cluster analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0759106312465553">Johnson, 1967</xref>) performed using the average linkage, weighted algorithm. The algorithm continues to join the two closest clusters (initially, items), redetermining the distance matrix after each join, until one single cluster is left. For average linkage distance, values of joined clusters are calculated as the average of the cluster members values. Herein, cluster agglomeration stopped when the desired number of clusters was left (the tree was cut at that height). In a few percent of cases, an unambiguous result could not be obtained due to ties in tree height. Hierarchical cluster analysis has been commonly used for sorting data, especially in the usability branch.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0759106312465553">
<title>K-medoids Method</title>
<p>The same distance matrices and numbers of subsamples as for hierarchical cluster analysis were also used for the k-medoids method as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0759106312465553">Hornik (2010)</xref>, which includes references to other authors. The partition delivered, assigning n objects (indices i, j) to k classes C, minimizes the criterion function. The method has rarely been used on its own. More commonly, its results have been fed into other iterative partitioning methods as a starting partition. Therefore the stability of its results is also important.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0759106312465553">
<title>Fuzzy Cluster Analysis</title>
<p>Once more, the same distance matrices and numbers of subsamples as for hierarchical cluster analysis were also used for the fuzzy cluster analysis method of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0759106312465553">Kaufman and Rousseeuw (2005)</xref>. For all fuzzy methods introduced below, membership of objects is transformed herein to either 0 or 1 at the end to produce a partition. The largest membership value of an item is set to 1 (full member of the respective group), all other memberships are set to 0 (not a member). A membership exponent of 1.5 (instead of 2) was employed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0759106312465553">Maechler et al., 2005</xref>). After some experimentation, a membership exponent of 1.5 seemed to fit for all data, but it may be suboptimal in some cases. The method has been successfully used for sorting data by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0759106312465553">Harloff (2008a</xref>). It does not permit the number of clusters to exceed half of the number of items, avoiding singleton clusters. Therefore the method does not cover the full area available to other methods. Moreover, for some combinations of data sets and numbers of clusters, the method in up to 1/3 of all runs gave unreliable, completely fuzzy clustering results which were omitted herein.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0759106312465553">
<title>Consensus Clustering Methods</title>
<p>Cluster ensembles provide a single classification consolidated from a set of partitions. The consolidation is optimally in some way, disregarding the features or algorithms that determined the original partitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0759106312465553">Strehl and Ghosh, 2002</xref>). The concept is close to consensus classification, which covers more different models of classification. One or more consensus representations of trees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0759106312465553">Adams, 1972</xref>), networks, coverings, partitions, fuzzy sets or ordered sets are identified. Consensus methods cover several independent approaches to classification, the median consensus classification approach being most suitable for free sorting data. The first descriptions of the general scientific problem and related algorithms date back at least to the 18th century; the issue has applications in a wide variety of sciences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0759106312465553">Cucumel and Leclerc, 1987</xref>). As a result of that variety, there exist various positions about what constitutes consensus and what consensus clustering and a median classification actually is. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0759106312465553">Goder and Filkov (2003)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0759106312465553">Topchy et al. (2004)</xref> for example provided an information theoretic view and technically oriented applications. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0759106312465553">Barthelemy and Monjardet (1981)</xref> summarize earlier work and provide a definition of median partitions useful for the social sciences and other sciences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0759106312465553">Domenach and Leclerc, 2004</xref>), which includes a more recent summary. Within that framework, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0759106312465553">Barthelemy et al., (1986)</xref> identify three general approaches to the definition of a median partition. Among these, the so-called optimization approach is the most useful one for sorting data since the sets of partitions do not relate to any mathematical algorithm (after <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0759106312465553">Gordon and Vichi, 1998</xref>). Stated simply, the optimization approach identifies a median partition located at a minimum of a criterion function, the criterion function consisting of some aggregate of Q-mode distances to the set of partitions it represents. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0759106312465553">Gordon and Vichi (1998)</xref> additionally introduced the concept of multiple median partitions, comparing it to other three-way analysis concepts. But, except perhaps for the kinship terms data set (due to the moves measure distribution as explained above), a three-way approach seems unnecessary for the present data sets and therefore only single median partitions were obtained herein.</p>
<p>Except for hierarchical cluster analysis and the k-medoids method, the results of all clustering methods employed herein to some degree depend on initial partitions fed into the algorithms. Therefore, each partitioning datum obtained herein is the result of 50 trials employing random different initial configurations. From the partitioning results of these 50 trials, the single result representing a sample of sortings best was ultimately selected. That kind of procedure has been suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0759106312465553">Gordon and Vichi (2001</xref>: 235) and, similarly, by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0759106312465553">Hornik (2010)</xref>. Experience with trial studies without this step showed that it strongly improves the cluster analysis results of consensus clustering. It seems to be less important for fuzzy cluster analysis. For consensus clustering, the best result among the 50 trials was selected based on a minimum sum of item moves necessary to transform it to the sortings it represents. As explained above, the measure of item moves was also used to compare results of different clustering methods, sample sizes and numbers of clusters obtained. For fuzzy cluster analysis, the best result among the trials was selected based on the total minimum of the objective function achieved. Except for hierarchical cluster analysis, all partitioning methods employed may produce empty clusters. The numbers of clusters may therefore exceed the numbers of clusters actually containing items.</p>

<title>Case Studies</title>
<p>Case studies were prepared for 5 of the data sets presented above. A valid interpretation of the drugs data is not known, therefore this data set was not examined. Judging from bootstrapping results not presented here, method 3 of Gordon and Vichi most consistently produced stable results of cluster analysis. Therefore, this method was chosen for the case studies, as well as numbers of clusters that were optimal in terms of stability of the results. However, the use of the <italic>cl_consensus</italic> method of the <italic>clue</italic> package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0759106312465553">Hornik, 2010</xref>) was altered so that the consensus clustering result was the optimum of 50 different runs of the method, but no starting partition was fed into the method. It turned out that this variant produced results more easily interpreted than the variant used for the bootstrapping which fed 50 different randomly pre-produced starting partitions into the method, with each starting partition being used once.</p>

<p>C, J, M and B denote the four particular religious congregations the participants belonged to (remember the data set is a compilation of four data sets obtained for each of these congregations). The analysis of this domain must avoid some pitfalls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0759106312465553">Coxon, 2010</xref>). Unlike other items, class and gender items were commonly sorted together by participants as clusters of classification criteria, not of persons. “Christian” is not used as a diagnostic criterium, often isolated as a singleton. “Belonging to my family” commonly denotes “our” group, which of course depends on the respondent.</p>
<p>Clusters 3, 4 and 9 can be interpreted in analogy to the results presented by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0759106312465553">Coxon (2010)</xref>, but clusters 5 and 7 do not easily compare to any of Coxon's groups. This may be due to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0759106312465553">Coxon (2010)</xref> using only 5 groups for partitioning. The interpretation of cluster 4 is somewhat vague, comprising both Protestants and the Romanic Catholic Church while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0759106312465553">Coxon (2010)</xref> noted that church was part of the identity of the participants. Therefore the interpretation of this item set is not as simple and straightforward as for the studies presented above.</p>
<p>The domain likely has overlapping clusters (covering sets) and more complex relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0759106312465553">Coxon, 2010</xref>) that cannot be fully displayed by a partition. The membership of the participants to congregations is not fully balanced in the sample. The pitfalls mentioned above may tend to obscure reasonable results somewhat using just one step of cluster analysis for the full data set. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0759106312465553">Coxon (2010)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0759106312465553">Stringer (2011)</xref> used a stepwise analysis approach, removing problematic items and properties first. These properties may present a partial explanation for the bad performance of most cluster analysis methods for this data set in the bootstrap study. On the other hand, the method of Gordon and Vichi converged despite this, while results of the other partitioning methods did not converge for other data sets, too.</p>

<p>The data set was analyzed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0759106312465553">Hawkey (2005)</xref> using multidimensional scaling, identifying two dimensions interpreted to represent the manageability of the conditions and the degree of life span shortening. These dimensions can be applied for interpretation of the clusters obtained as shown. Interpretation of the multidimensional scaling figures led to a similar, but more fine grained clustering into 8 groups reflecting the dimensions somewhat more accurately.</p>

<sec id="section20-0759106312465553">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Some practical advice can be drawn from results of the bootstrap simulations. For stable results, it is essential to carefully select a suitable number of clusters. Sometimes, but not consistently, this number may also be optimal for a dimensional scaling approach. Different cluster analysis methods perform differently on different data sets, and several methods may therefore be tried at least for small domains. The third method of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0759106312465553">Gordon and Vichi (2001)</xref> most consistently leads to a fast convergence of results. The hard clustering variant used herein relates to the method of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0759106312465553">Régnier (1965)</xref>. This method was the only one to deliver stable, basically interpretable results for somewhat difficult domains. All other partitioning methods were of limited value for the domains tried, including more than some 25 to 27 items. Noticeable convergence was usually achieved for these methods and domains only for a relaxed condition of subsample partitioning results lying within 3 moves of full sample results. An individually optimized membership exponent might have improved the performance of fuzzy cluster analysis.</p>
<p>The sample size required generally increases with the number of items sorted, but not uniformly. The social groups domain appears to be most demanding whereas it is smaller than the drugs and the prenatal tests domain. However, this behaviour may be due to some special pitfalls associated with the analysis of this data set. Tentatively, it is suggested that sample sizes leading to identical results vary from 15 to 25 participants for domains with 15 to 20 items, and sample sizes leading to approximately equal results vary from 15 to 35 participants in general providing some extra safety. By and large, this result confirms the statements of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0759106312465553">Tullis and Wood (2004)</xref> about sorting sample size requirements, given suitable numbers of clusters, two-way data and a well behaving analysis method like method 3 of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0759106312465553">Gordon and Vichi (2001)</xref>.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0759106312465553">Topchy et al., (2004)</xref> note that, using their definition of a consensus partition, the chance of failing to discover the true partition drops exponentially with increasing number of partitions in the ensemble.</p>
<p>The present study is restricted to free partition sorting and one-mode cluster analysis methods. Closed sorting data, fuzzy sorting data as well as two-mode, three-way and scaling analysis methods require a different methodology and different sets of sorting data for future related studies.</p>
