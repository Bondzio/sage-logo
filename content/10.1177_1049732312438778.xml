<abstract>
<p>Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and hypertension (HTN) disproportionately affect minority populations in the United States, including Korean American immigrants (KAI). We conducted qualitative interviews with middle-aged KAI in Maryland living with DM and HTN to examine the illness experience to inform future intervention strategies. Study results show that participants utilized strategies to maintain respect and Korean identity, including an image of being healthy and in control of their behavior in the public arena. These strategies included the lack of disclosure of their illness, even to family members, and avoiding outside assistance when engaging in problem solving. Maintaining an outward image of health was a common goal that affected the self-care of KAI in this study, a finding that might prove significant in the management of other chronic illnesses affecting this population. The study findings demonstrate the importance of in-depth understanding of specific populations when treating chronic illness, and caretakers’ sensitivity to each population’s unique cultural issues regarding identity, image, and disclosure.</p>

<body>
<p>Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and hypertension (HTN) are increasing health problems among Korean American immigrants (KAI), one of the fastest growing, as well as one of the most homogeneous Asian immigrant populations in the United States in terms of race, language, and other cultural factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732312438778">Kim, Juon, Hill, Post, &amp; Kim, 2001</xref>). Type 2 DM is an increasingly costly and widespread disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1049732312438778">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2011</xref>). Hypertension commonly cooccurs with DM, affecting people with DM approximately twice as often as it does those without DM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1049732312438778">Sowers, Epstein, &amp; Frohlich, 2001</xref>). Although an accurate assessment of prevalence on a national scale is not available at this time, studies of nonemigrating Koreans and KAI suggest an increasing trend in the incidence of both DM and HTN after emigration to the United States, surpassing the incidence in Korea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049732312438778">Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality [AHRQ], 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049732312438778">Carter, Pugh, &amp; Monterrosa, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732312438778">Choe, Padilla, Chae, &amp; Kim, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732312438778">Jee, Appel, Suh, Whelton, &amp; Kim, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732312438778">Kim et al., 2001</xref>). This comorbidity poses a particularly high risk for micro- and macrovascular disease if not well controlled (Sowers et al.).</p>
<p>The nature of DM requires people with the disease to frequently think about taking care of their health—monitoring food intake, physical exercise, medication administration, and mental activity throughout the day—an often heavy burden to bear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1049732312438778">Saudek, 2002</xref>). Management of DM requires a heavy reliance on self-care behaviors, and might require support that is both clinically and culturally relevant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049732312438778">Funnell et al., 2011</xref>). Qualitative research has shown that other Asian immigrant groups, notably Chinese and Vietnamese, have experienced significant barriers to adequate care while living with chronic illness, which are exacerbated by communication difficulties, including the lack of adequate understanding, lack of comprehension, or lack of communication between the health provider and patient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049732312438778">Anderson, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732312438778">Chan, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049732312438778">Mull, Nguyen, &amp; Mull, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1049732312438778">Zhang and Verhoef, 2002</xref>), as well as financial burdens (Anderson), differences in the cultural understanding of illness origin, and subsequent illness management (Mull et al.). Moreover, cultural barriers add complexity to meeting individual and family needs in the management of DM and accompanying illnesses such as HTN.</p>
<p>Researchers have suggested that greater understanding of KAIs’ cultural practices as they further engage in the United States health care system is necessary to better provide culturally competent care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732312438778">Kim, Han, Kim, &amp; Duong, 2002</xref>). The scientific community has done little to assess the qualitative illness experience and health behavior of KAI with cooccurring DM and HTN within the cultural context. Understanding the meaning of an illness and how it affects individuals’ responses to that illness are important steps in developing appropriate care strategies to address health needs for underserved minorities such as KAI within the larger health care system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049732312438778">Kleinman, 1980</xref>).</p>
<p>Kleinman’s Health Care Systems Conceptual and Explanatory Model provided the theoretical rationale for deriving an understanding of the popular health care system from the perspective of KAI with DM and HTN in this research. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049732312438778">Kleinman (1980)</xref> referred to the “health system” as a cultural system that includes the health-related factors within our society, including the knowledge of the cause of the illness, the evaluation of and response to illness, and choices about treatment. In addition, the health system reflects socially sanctioned roles, interactions, social institutions, and relationships of power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049732312438778">Kleinman, 1980</xref>). Health systems are part of a larger reality <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049732312438778">Kleinman (1980)</xref> called a social reality, that is developed by one’s interaction with others and can change based on one’s social environment, or larger structural or political changes resulting from modernization or change in location, such as immigration. Cultural understanding of the illness and response to illness needs to occur to facilitate healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049732312438778">Kleinman, 1980</xref>). Researchers have used this model in work examining depression in the Chinese (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732312438778">Kleinman &amp; Good, 1985</xref>) and self-care in Korean American elderly women with depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049732312438778">Pang, 1996</xref>). In this article, we examine the illness experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049732312438778">Kleinman, 1980</xref>) of middle-aged KAI in Maryland living with DM and HTN.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section2-1049732312438778">
<title>Study Design</title>
<p>We used a cross-cultural, qualitative descriptive inquiry design to derive a lay cognitive perspective of DM and HTN as experienced by middle-aged members of the KAI community. Twelve middle-aged KAI (8 women and 4 men) were selected from a list of participants in a larger HTN intervention study who had previously consented to participate in future studies. Each varied in his or her control of the health indicators that were available (i.e., HTN, weight). All of the participants met the following criteria: they were (a) first-generation Korean American, (b) diagnosed with type 2 DM and HTN, and (c) aged 40 to 65 years. Prior to participation, individuals in the study sample reported taking medication for the treatment of HTN, received some behavioral education promoting self-help skills to attain adequate blood pressure control, and received information on DM from friends, family members, medical personnel, and/or the media.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1049732312438778">
<title>Procedures</title>
<p>The research study team was comprised of a bicultural and bilingual team from the Korean Resource Center and the University, and the lead researcher, an English-speaking nurse researcher who received training in Korean and had extensive experience working within the KAI community prior to the start of the study. The study team received approval from the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions Institutional Review Board to conduct this research. A bilingual interviewer facilitated the study interviews in Korean after obtaining written consent from each participant. We conducted initial in-depth interviews (lasting 1 to 2 hours) with each of the 12 participants. As we identified concepts and themes, we selected participants for follow-up interviews based on a variety of characteristics so as to explore these concepts more fully.</p>
<p>We selected participants based on the following characteristics to analyze/explore their experiences for purposes of maximum variation and to confirm concepts and themes: (a) nonaffiliation with a church, (b) vigilance with regard to DM and HTN and recommended care, (c) no family history of DM, and (d) use of insulin for DM control. We conducted six follow-up interviews with 6 participants that lasted from 20 minutes to 1 hour; we interviewed 1 participant a third time. In total, we conducted 14 face-to-face interviews in participants’ homes or local community places, and completed five second interviews by telephone.</p>
<p>We conducted the sampling, data collection, and analysis over a 7-month period. The interviewer (third author, Park) used a general interview guide for the unstructured interviews, which allowed participants to engage in personal narratives regarding their experiences of life in relation to their illness, their perspectives on personal caring for DM and HTN, and the meaning of illness within their cultural context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049732312438778">Garro &amp; Mattingly, 2000</xref>). The research team complemented these interviews with ethnographic semistructured questioning; i.e., scenarios, as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1049732312438778">Young and Garro (1981)</xref>, to gain a more specific, in-depth understanding of issues relating to the disclosure and social acceptability of a DM and/or HTN diagnosis. Young and Garro used this technique to evaluate and measure the ordering and variation of treatment alternatives based on hypothetical situations. We utilized scenarios, not to attach numerical value, but to elucidate more deeply the boundaries and the acceptability of disclosure in varied life contexts. We scheduled new and follow-up interviews until data began repeating and interviews appeared unlikely to yield new information.</p>
<p>The English-speaking lead researcher, first author Pistulka, and the bilingual Korean-speaking interviewer (Park) conducted debriefing interviews in English to ensure that (a) Pistulka thoroughly understood the emerging data; (b) Pistulka made a connection with the participant as instrument to address a major tenet in naturalistic inquiry; (c) the values of Park and Pistulka were acknowledged and then discussed to determine their potential influence on the research process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049732312438778">Emerson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1049732312438778">Roberts &amp; Sanders, 2005</xref>); (d) a plan was developed for future follow-up interviews with the current and future participants; and (e) interviewer techniques were refined. We recorded, transcribed, and translated all interviews into English. We then used a team approach to compare the English-translated transcripts against the Korean transcripts to ensure the accuracy of the translations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1049732312438778">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Pistulka managed data using NVivo computer software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049732312438778">QSR International, 2002</xref>) and analyzed using the constant comparative method described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1049732312438778">Strauss and Corbin (1998)</xref>. The constant comparative method of analysis began from the onset of data collection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732312438778">Glaser &amp; Strauss, 1967</xref>). Pistulka read each interview in its entirety before beginning the analysis. The team began analysis with line-by-line open coding, and moved to larger-picture analysis through the use of categorization of data and definition of the quality, consistency, and agreement of the coding. Next, five bilingual Korean nurses and public health researchers from local community organizations reviewed the higher-level conceptual categories in two group meetings. Pistulka also used memos to document the decision making and the discussions from all meetings. In addition, she compared the original debriefing interviews to the evolving analysis to ensure that her interpretation of the narratives was equivalent to that of the bilingual Korean interviewer.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>All of the 12 participants worked full time, and nearly half owned small businesses; all but 2 were uninsured. The mean age of the participants was 55.9 years. All had at least a high school education, and 5 had some college education. All of the participants lived with at least a spouse, and some also lived with children and/or grandchildren. The self-rated degree of acculturation within the dominant American culture varied from poor to well among the participants interviewed. They reported having lived with DM and HTN for an average of 8 and 11 years, respectively. Half of the participants had controlled blood sugar by medical standards; only 1 viewed her health as very good.</p>
<p>The recurrent themes in the 19 interviews reflected perspectives on health, illness, and presentation of the self to others. Particularly noteworthy was the perceived importance of maintaining a healthy outward image in public:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Maybe I was afraid. Once I revealed my problems, I would appear weaker, so maybe I had to keep it under wraps and make it look like everything’s under control . . . . I didn’t want them to see me ill.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The themes reflected the strategies the KAIs had adopted to understand and manage their illnesses and the personal attributes they considered to be ideal (i.e., those that should be presented to others and those that should be kept private), and the Korean identity that motivated them to project an outward image of health, normalcy, and control.</p>
<sec id="section6-1049732312438778">
<title>Projecting an Outward Image of Health in the Public Setting</title>
<sec id="section7-1049732312438778">
<title>The public setting</title>
<p>The participants described their experiences of American culture. Some characterized it as being welcoming, and others as very difficult. Several described life in the United States as being “laborious” with respect to maintaining a work schedule of at least 12 hours per day and to maintaining a home and raising children. Several also remarked that they did not have friends in their new country, and that support was limited to their families and the ethnic church they attended. Consequently, for those who identified themselves as Christian, the church emerged as a major part of their community.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1049732312438778">
<title>Attributes of the image of health</title>
<p>Participants described the ideal outward image as being healthy and disciplined both to prevent illness and to control it. Healthy meant having no illness, and included having physical energy, mental stability, and being a good Christian. One could be healthy with illness, but only as a result of being in control and disciplined. The attributes of “public display of energy” and “presenting a positive state of mind” represented health as the strong connection between mind and body, finding “power” in mind and body equally; that is, having power over thoughts and having the physical strength to overcome weariness. A healthy person’s physical condition was perceived as displaying “strength and energy,” being able to be “moving around freely,” and “looking good.” A participant’s mind was healthy if he or she was “positive” and “optimistic,” and was a “smiling person” “without worries.” Living as a good Christian was also linked with having a positive state of mind. One woman described Christians as healthy because religious people possess sound, healthy minds and lead active lives. Those who identified themselves as strong Christians gave thanks that they were not forced to rely on medication. They had been protected through their faith, citing as evidence the fact that they had not been hospitalized.</p>
<p>Being “in control and disciplined,” with or without illness, was a prominent attribute of the healthy image. The presentation of health was described as being “controlled, able, and mentally sane.” With illness, the term <italic>jo jeol ha da</italic>, meaning “I control” or “I manage,” signified having the discipline to change factors within an individual’s or family’s immediate realm, such as applying acquired knowledge about the disease and subsequently reflecting that control in relevant behaviors “strictly and systematically,” such as through food intake and activity. The notion of controlling body size and condition was also the ethical responsibility of the Korean family. A well-functioning Korean family was considered to be one in which members took care of each other. Not controlling DM might well be a sign that the family members were not doing their job. Encouraging proper food preparation, exercise, and eating together demonstrated family involvement.</p>
<p>A lack of control was particularly connected with developing DM or knowingly failing to adhere to the prescribed diet. Although many of those interviewed privately admitted that they had the tendencies or “personality” of a person with DM, there was a strong disdain and judgment of self and others for having those character “weaknesses,” or not <italic>jae han ha da</italic> (restraining oneself). One woman depicted herself as lacking in discipline:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>I feel so embarrassed to tell anybody that I have been taking so many medicines, because it shows my negligence in not taking care of my health in my ordinary life . . . . I think my character affects all of my behavior.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Taken together, these responses indicate that the KAI participants felt that it was important to maintain a public appearance different from their private reality.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1049732312438778">
<title>Motivations to Maintain the Outward Image</title>
<p>The major reasons or motivations noted for projecting this public image were “being Korean” and being “strong, respected, and not burdensome.”</p>
<sec id="section10-1049732312438778">
<title>Being Korean</title>
<p>Korean identity remained strong within this community, where churches served a Korean-speaking congregation, ethnic grocery stores offered many of the foods found in South Korea, and a thriving media environment provided access to television programs, newspapers, and radio programs of interest to Koreans. The participants reported not speaking much English, and infrequently interacting with non-Koreans, although all had lived in the region for at least 6 years. According to the participants, genetic inheritance passed on to children, and activities that represent Korean ethnicity—such as preparing and eating traditional Korean cuisine—were included in what it meant to be Korean.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1049732312438778">
<title>Genetics: Preserving the family lineage</title>
<p>Many of the participants spoke of DM and HTN as “inheriting it from parents,” as something “genetic,” and perceived that making the diagnosis public marred the image of having healthy genes—consequently affecting the future of their children. As such, the development of DM threatened the fulfillment of one of the most important obligations for the Korean parent, and particularly for the Korean mother: the marriage of a child. One woman even spoke of her own death as something permissible only after the marriage of her son: “I used to say to him, ‘I think I have to do my duty for you to marry before I die.’” Having genes for DM, which were thought by the participants to be passed to their sons or daughters, might make their children less “marriageable” to other Korean singles or their families: “If I say it is genetic, I am afraid it might impact on my son’s upcoming marriage.” These statements indicated a model of illness origin that influenced not only self-image but also outward image.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1049732312438778">
<title>Expressing Korean identity through food</title>
<p>For Korean immigrants, food represents culture, identity and geography, and nourishment for relationships. Traditional Korean dishes include dried or preserved food that contains a lot of salt, such as the popular dish <italic>kimchi</italic>. Rice, the main food staple, is eaten by KAIs at most meals in the home and publicly. The type of rice eaten, white or brown, was an indicator of whether a person was choosing healthy (brown rice) or unhealthy (white rice) foods. All of the participants preferred traditional white rice was but saw it as unhealthy, whereas full-grained brown rice was deemed healthy and was understood to be almost a “prescribed” food for DM patients.</p>
<p>Not only did participants find difficulty in adapting to a healthier lifestyle in their homes; some of the participants reported difficulties when in a church-related or other public setting, when others noticed their portion sizes or types of rice they chose, and if they were refusing food: “I like church life . . . it is warm-hearted, but when a person doesn’t want to eat it is noticed by others . . . . I am embarrassed in that situation.” These KAIs saw divergence from customary eating habits and foods as reflecting a change in their identity as Koreans, causing distress and isolation, and affecting their enjoyment of life.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1049732312438778">
<title>Being respected and not burdensome</title>
<p>Maintaining an outward image, particularly through adherence to expected roles, was a means of retaining the respect that a peer, parent, spouse, elder, or high-ranking person (such as a deacon or deaconess in the church) had earned in the community. Participants highly valued the notion of being respected by others and not being burdensome to loved ones. Both men and women shared and feared the belief that people passed judgment and discussed others’ weaknesses. One man spoke frankly about the weaknesses that others alluded to: “I think no one wants to reveal their weaknesses to others that easily. Not only does a man, but also everybody, I think, not want to show their problems.” One poignant example of the desire to preserve a healthy image to retain respect is that of a woman who, having earned status as a leader in her church, was challenged by her illness:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>It could be a barrier to my leadership. For the beginner Christian, it could be a question that, as a good Christian like me, how come she could be suffering with DM, although she always prays and she looks to have a special relationship with the Lord . . . . I cannot say that this [DM] was given to me by the Lord.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>An awareness of the potential for being a burden, or <italic>bu dam</italic> (causing some worry to others), combined with a strong need to maintain one’s respect, constituted a driving force for maintaining the appearance of a healthy Korean. Burdening others meant that friends, community members, church members, family, and even the participants’ physicians would be forced to worry about them, to accommodate them during meals or medical visits or, in the long term, to care for them when disabled. To avoid burdening others, KAIs spoke of the need to be careful about revealing too much by asking for any type of assistance.</p>

<title>Strategies for Maintaining an Outward Image of Good Health</title>
<p>The participants identified various strategies they adopted for sustaining normal and expected public interactions to prevent knowledge of their illness from being disseminated, and thereby threatening their outward image.</p>
<sec id="section15-1049732312438778">
<title>Maintaining the secret</title>
<p>A number of participants maintained secrecy regarding their diagnosis of DM and HTN and their experience of illness, choosing not to share with members of the community outside their family. Pretending that there was nothing wrong was a reoccurring strategy for maintaining an appearance of health, even when some participants thought they were suffering from acute HTN- or DM-related issues. One woman spoke of her coping strategy as follows:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Maybe I do not look like I am ill. I am also grateful for that. Although I am not well, they cannot tell . . . . They ask me what’s wrong with me, but I just tell them not to worry and I do not have any problem at all . . . . My sickness just goes away after I get some rest, so it is no big deal.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Similarly, the words of another respondent illustrate the great lengths to which she would go to maintain the appearance of being healthy and not disclose her DM diagnosis. She politely refused to eat when she was a guest in someone’s home, to the potential detriment of her own health: “I cannot tell them, ‘No, I have diabetes, so I cannot eat all of what you have given to us.’ You know I have to learn to go hungry.” Considerable energy was spent managing the situation to avoid revelation. Participants sometimes hid their new dietary habits, risking an unfavorable reaction later. Others devised acceptable solutions that would accommodate their health needs, particularly dietary needs, such as hiding what they ate. Sometimes they would participate in an activity, regardless of the effects it would have on their DM and HTN. For some participants, secrecy from family was important; immediate and extended family members, including spouses and children, did not know of the DM diagnosis or were sometimes sworn to secrecy, and others were reassured of their health. There was a clear preference for maintaining normal social interactions, both inside and outside the home.</p>

<sec id="section16-1049732312438778">
<title>Disclosure: Affecting shame and sense of responsibility</title>
<p>Eventually, for some, the diagnosis was revealed on his or her own admission or because he or she felt there was no other choice. Revelations evoked shame for some participants, or conversely for others, support and a sense of responsibility in relation to friends or community. Because of her lack of information, one woman had unfortunately reached a state of such severe illness that she believed she was dying and had no option but to notify her son and daughter, and ultimately her pastor and his wife. She described her feelings of strong regret and shame for revealing her secret, because the church community as a whole came to know of her diagnosis:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>I think I was right—it is not the topic to tell anybody from the beginning. But I ended up disclosing it to my priest and his wife after all, and it spread so quickly. Anyway, I do not want to hear my story from anybody’s mouth . . . . Sometimes, I hate myself for revealing that story.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>From a vastly different perspective, a couple of participants saw disclosing one’s condition to others as an opportunity to gain support and be able to contribute to the lives of others who are suffering from DM and HTN. One man had made a thoughtful decision to disclose his DM to friends after coming to understand, through his newfound faith in God, that his behavior affected others. The severity of his symptoms motivated his disclosure: “For some time, I didn’t tell them that I have diabetes. But recently I confessed to them to help them understand my situation, because I had to go to the toilet frequently to urinate.”</p>
<p>As a result of this man’s disclosure, he received valuable information and advice, and became a resource among his friends who suffered from the same illnesses. When participants realized that by revealing their illness, they still could maintain the respect of others, protect their family, and gain the positive support of others, they were more likely to discuss their DM: “They are interested in knowing all these things [information about DM and HTN] . . . . I feel like sharing my tough experiences with any person I meet. Also, I’d like to talk about food and exercises.” One woman participant shared a like perspective. This altruistic behavior shown by some reflected an understanding of the importance of knowledge to the welfare of others. They were able to take on the role as an expert and maintain an image of “ill, but in control.”</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Results from analysis of the study data suggest that the KAI study participants’ primary goal was to preserve an outward image of health in public, while managing their disease. The development of DM and HTN changed their perceptions of stability and forced them to confront the need to reconsider their image as a result of their life-changing illnesses. A few of the participants made the transition publicly, and without hesitation adopted a new image. Many of the informants, however, assiduously guarded an image of being healthy, and of being a good patient who did not need assistance and would not cause undue burdens; not being a burden was valued among Korean elders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1049732312438778">Yang &amp; Yang, 2011</xref>). This approach limited their access to health-related information, and potentially endangered their health.</p>
<p>The KAIs’ efforts to maintain a code of behavior as a means of preserving their Korean identity supports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732312438778">Goffman’s work (1959)</xref>, in which he asserted that certain roles have been socially sanctioned, and these roles lead to behaviors that are congruent with those expectations, which are tied to self-worth and therefore managed. Building on Goffman’s research, others have found that public self-presentation coupled with making a public commitment to certain behaviors might actually strengthen coping in chronic illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732312438778">Leake, Friend, &amp; Wadhwa, 1999</xref>). In this study, participants reported presenting a healthy “front,” or outward image of health, despite suffering from illness-related issues.</p>
<p>A similar concept of presenting a “front” is to present a “face.” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1049732312438778">Tanner and Timmons (2000)</xref> explored the changing “face,” the projection of an image of self that is approved of and accepted by others, within the context of social role and status. The concept of face has been recognized as a salient feature of Korean culture and Korean American families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732312438778">Kim, Bean, &amp; Harper, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732312438778">Kong, Deatrick, &amp; Evans, 2010</xref>). The ability to put up a front or display two faces—one public and the other private (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732312438778">Goffman, 1959</xref>)—allowed them to maintain harmony in interpersonal relationships, an important value of the Korean culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049732312438778">Kwon-Ahn, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>The Korean community has long been recognized as being extremely conscious of group identity, remaining homogeneous in terms of language and culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732312438778">Kim et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049732312438778">Moon &amp; Song, 1998</xref>). A number of researchers have examined the formation of identity and its role in society. A strong heritage and family lineage are important aspects of the Confucian legacy to maintain a Korean identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049732312438778">Kim &amp; Kim, 1998</xref>), and have contributed to the resistance to interracial marriage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732312438778">Kim &amp; Ryu, 2005</xref>) and possibly to the need to maintain the appearance of having healthy genes, as seen in the present study. Participants in this study used a variety of strategies to maintain an outward image of being healthy as a means of preserving the marriage potential of a family member.</p>
<p>In the public sphere, the KAIs in this study were confronted with stressful and challenging decisions about what strategy they should adopt regarding eating in public environments. The underlying assumption made by many of the KAIs interviewed was that others were perpetually evaluating their behavior and making judgments about their inner character; that there were some discriminating differences among people with DM and HTN, between those who projected an image of having undisciplined behavior, and those who were healthy and in control. Fearing the presentation of an image or outside knowledge that one was dealing with a condition or illness, albeit invisible, that counters the dominant expectation, such as what it means to be healthy and Korean, might lead to further adherence to the shared ethnic or group identity, or the old identity of normalcy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049732312438778">Joachim &amp; Acorn, 2000</xref>), even if DM and HTN are eventually considered the “new normal.”</p>
<p>Nondisclosure emerged as a surprising finding in the study, because the health care researchers/health care providers in the Korean community center in which this study took place were not aware of anyone experiencing difficulty in telling others about their DM diagnosis (or why), nor had DM been identified as a stigmatizing illness in the community. Stigmatization and the decision to disclose DM have previously been addressed in the context of adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049732312438778">Berlin, Sass, Davies, &amp; Hains, 2002</xref>), and in the context of employment, insurance, and its accompanying health care costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732312438778">Johnson, Kass, &amp; Natowicz, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732312438778">Munir, Leka, &amp; Griffiths, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Researchers have observed disclosure within another tight-knit community and have noted that an individual’s decision to disclose might reflect the need or desire to control who owns the information, thus controlling the level of personal stigmatization or embarrassment that might result (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049732312438778">Carmack, 2010</xref>). Stigmatization has already been well documented in this ethnic community with regard to mental health issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732312438778">Kim &amp; Ryu, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049732312438778">Kwon-Ahn, 2001</xref>); for people with mental illness, the fear of stigmatization has affected their ability to speak openly about their illness. Cross-cultural research with Chinese immigrants has identified a reluctance to disclose the diagnosis of DM, and/or the decision to disclose was negotiated within the family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732312438778">Chesla &amp; Chun, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049732312438778">Jayne &amp; Rankin, 2001</xref>). Some participants in the present study did not consider disclosure to be a viable option; these participants, however, also saw no reason for others to conceal their diagnosis, indicating that there are those who disclose and those who do not. This sentiment reflects what a complex decision disclosure might be, based on the visibility of the illness, personal experience with and self-perception of chronic illness, and the potential risk involved in disclosure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049732312438778">Joachim &amp; Acorn, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>The study participants described feeling a sense of isolation from other Korean immigrants in the United States, which was in stark contrast to the close-knit communal life they experienced in South Korea. The church, the one place that was generally considered the hub of social life, actually proved to be an unexpected source of stress. Many KAIs (approximately 70% to 80%) rely on church membership for spiritual, social, and emotional support, and for information and other resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732312438778">Kim &amp; Ryu, 2005</xref>). For most of the participants, the church functioned within the community to preserve group identity, and thus their church community was also the place where their image most needed to be sustained.</p>
<p>Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049732312438778">Kleinman’s (1980)</xref> model proved useful in elucidating the conceptual linkages between the KAIs’ perceptions of the etiology of their illnesses and their subsequent behaviors around managing DM and HTN. The KAIs’ desire to maintain a certain image stemmed from their perceptions of their illness as having genetic or spiritual origins, as well as origins in their uncontrolled and undisciplined behavior. Consequently, there were uncertainties about the legitimacy of portraying an image of suffering from DM and HTN within the community. This finding has important implications, because the level of acceptance of the illness-related identity that a person has achieved affects the level of adherence to managing the illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1049732312438778">Tilden, Charman, Sharples, &amp; Fosbury, 2005</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732312438778">Goffman (1959)</xref> pointed out, the perception of how the larger community will respond can serve as a catalyst for initiating strategies to shape the impression to be maintained in the public sphere. These strategies, or other means to maintain a sense of control, included treating their symptoms privately through learned experiences, as well as presenting a cheerful face and hiding the illness from others in social situations. Keeping secret the diagnosis and progression of an illness could result in delays in treatment at an earlier and more manageable stage of the disease. Certainly obtaining information about DM and HTN care was more difficult for those who did not seek care in a timely fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1049732312438778">Shin, 2002</xref>).</p>

<title>Implications of This Study</title>
<p>Culturally sensitive approaches at both the personal and community levels are needed to address some of the issues regarding DM and HTN management that we identified. It is crucial for KAIs with DM and HTN to find support in a nonthreatening environment, so they can readily obtain the information needed to help curb the progression of their illness. It is similarly important that health providers understand the issue of identity that surrounds the DM and HTN diagnosis, and the potential for nondisclosure. Indigenous care models using community health workers have been successful in reaching out and addressing issues related to stigma surrounding an illness in some cultural groups. Working in conjunction with nurse care managers, community health workers have been shown to have some effect on improving control of DM and HTN in other communities, such as in some African American (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732312438778">Gary et al., 2003</xref>) and Latino (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049732312438778">Deitrick et al., 2010</xref>) communities.</p>
<p>Community-wide education utilizing radio, television, and Internet-based media can improve information exchange, awareness, and knowledge about issues related to DM and HTN, especially for those who do not seek information publicly, preventing the onset of these illnesses and/or maintaining support for their management to avoid costly complications. Developing collaborations with Korean churches and working with respected community leaders are likely important components of health care in this setting. They might be crucial in eliciting community-wide support to redefine the respected Korean identity to include those who might have a chronic illness such as DM and HTN. Persons with DM and HTN can be taught to manage their everyday encounters by reframing their experience as one that is shared by many other KAIs in the community, and as one that allows them to show strength of character by confronting the challenges of their illness and using their own experience to help others. Problem solving around behavior in social situations—through classes for those who are comfortable, or in individual sessions for those who are not—might be especially effective in reducing social anxiety. Promoting healthy food choices and offering variations of traditional recipes that include lower-salt options for public functions would also promote the general health of the KAI community, as well as the health of those who are diagnosed or undiagnosed with DM and HTN. A greater awareness of the extent to which people are affected and are at risk for disease might make disclosure easier for Korean American immigrants, and reduce the possibility of stigmatization resulting from DM.</p>
<p>We also note the strengths and limitations of this study. The strengths of this study were that the qualitative interviews provided the opportunity for the participants to tell their story, contributing to the healing process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049732312438778">Garro &amp; Mattingly, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049732312438778">Kleinman, 1988</xref>). We also used innovative methodological strategies to bridge the language chasm, recognizing the language differences between the lead researcher and the informants as a major challenge. Our selection of informants was made from among those who were already receiving some self-help training for HTN by the research study’s community partner, which was a potential limitation. The responses of these informants might be different from those who are not already learning about self-care strategies. In addition, these participants were middle-aged by the study’s classification; results might not easily transfer to younger members of this community. Finally, we were unable to conduct all interviews face to face, and so were unable to incorporate body language and facial expressions during interviews as part of the data.</p>
<p>Further research is needed to examine the generational differences of the role of stigmatization on the lack of disclosure within this community. Addressing disclosure and stigma and other issues around managing DM within the context of the church community is also an important area for community-based participatory investigation. In addition, in this study participants reported varying degrees of acculturation. Further research that examines disclosure, stigma, and control in relation to participants’ self-perception of acculturation within the Western culture might be an important addition to the work presented here. Focusing on family members and community members, to give a broader perspective to the findings of this study, would also be helpful to support middle-aged KAIs in the care of their illness.</p>
