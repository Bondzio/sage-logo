<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0081175012460852">White, Judd, and Poliandri (this volume, 2012</xref>:43–76), have usefully pointed out the increasing value of qualitative data analysis software (QDAS) for facilitating mixed-methods analyses. Their interest is in building the capacity of researchers to analyze population-based qualitative (e.g., interview-based) data sets in a way that will allow the combination of results from qualitative content analysis with statistical analysis of derived or associated data. They successfully demonstrate that software is underutilized for both qualitative and mixed-methods analyses, using a keyword search of selected (but wide-ranging) literature. They then usefully employ NVivo, as an example of QDAS, to show how software can be used for a conversion design in which qualitative data are both analyzed <italic>in situ</italic> in relation to demographic variables and/or quantified for further statistical analysis.</p>
<p>In the process, the authors make passing comments that are dismissive of small scale qualitative studies when viewed in comparison with larger population-based studies, and suggest that QDAS was originally geared to taking a quantitative approach to qualitative data. While I could take issue with both of these comments, my far greater concern is (1) with their seeing consistency across qualitative studies, in terms of segmentation of data (length of passages) and the scale and hierarchy of coding—“a routine, algorithm if you will, to get from extensive narrative transcript, to coded and analysed text”—as an ideal; and (2) with their view that if members of teams produce the exact same results when using software to code the same data—“same size of coded passages; same codes and hierarchy, same ‘tabulation’ or Boolean search”—then this represents “maturation” in analysis of qualitative data.</p>
<p>Putting these comments and aspirations together, I am left wondering if the authors understand that qualitative analysis is necessarily interpretive, especially where it is applied to open-ended (“narrative”) interview data. Being interpretive means that coding is therefore inherently subject to variability of interpretation by different researchers, and even, perhaps, by the same researcher at different times. Coding, inevitably, will be influenced by the individual researcher’s purpose, approach, personal background, and experience. It also means, if one is to adequately capture the nuances of the text, that large, even vaguely representative samples are unlikely to be achieved. Even when researchers are working in a team, it is simply not feasible, nor necessarily desirable, to expect that they will code with the exactness anticipated by these authors. <italic>Mature</italic> qualitative analysis is built from a foundation of our human capacity to empathize with an interviewee, not on using humans as a machine to produce standardized classifications of text.</p>

<p><bold>Pat Bazeley</bold> (PhD, Macquarie University) provides assistance and time out to local and international researchers at her research retreat at Bowral, in the Southern Highlands of New South Wales. She also holds senior, part-time appointments in Research Centres at the University of New South Wales and at the Australian Catholic University, and has served as an Associate Editor for the <italic>Journal of Mixed Methods Research.</italic> Her particular expertise is in helping researchers to make sense of both quantitative and qualitative data and in using computer software for management and analysis of data. Her publications focus on qualitative and mixed methods data analysis, and on the development and performance of researchers.</p>
