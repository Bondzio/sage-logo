<p><italic>The Embrace of Eros: Bodies, Desires, and Sexuality in Christianity</italic></p>
<p>Edited by Margaret D. Kamitsuka</p>
<p>Minneapolis: Fortress, 2010. 356 pp. $35.00</p>
<p>Growing out of a 2006 gathering of constructive theologians, this volume explores (as the title suggests) the relation between Christianity and <italic>eros</italic>, that particular manifestation of love-as-desire. As the volume’s editor, Margaret D. Kamitsuka notes in the introduction, “Whether through repression, spiritualization, or regulation, Christianity has made the body and its passions central to what it means to be human—and ‘saved’” (1). Eros, unlike the notion of agape (sacrificial love), has historically not enjoyed a particularly positive reception within Christian thought and practice. In certain contemporary Christian communities this is still the case; in others, however, the idea of eros has been positively appropriated. Aware of the former and sympathizing with the latter, the authors of this volume seek to “investigate the possibilities for and the shape of an embrace of eros in Christianity that [is] enlivening not repressive, matter-of-fact not obsessive, plurivocal not uniform” (2). And they succeed.</p>
<p>The volume’s essays are organized into three sections: <italic>History</italic>—biblical and historical considerations, <italic>Culture</italic>—critical theoretical examinations of cultural attitudes and practices, and <italic>Reconstruction</italic>—constructive theological proposals for how Christianity might “embrace eros.” While the essays nicely introduce the various discourses about the place of eros in Christian theology, the volume is not a standard survey. Each essay offers fresh contributions to the evolving debates about eros across fields while effectively orienting the reader to those debates.</p>
<p>Another notable strength of the collection is its diversity of methodologies, perspectives, and voices. Not only in the middle section, but throughout, contributors approach the question of eros through the lenses of race, gender, queerness, and globalization, not in the mode of identity politics, but as a means for exploring the multifaceted ways eros is enfleshed, experienced, and in turn theologized (whether consciously or not). Likewise, many different voices sound here, not all of them speaking in concert, but instead producing productive tensions. For example, Laurel C. Schneider and Laurie A. Jungling disagree about whether conceiving of God’s love as promiscuous invites helpful insights or problematic tropes. Similarly, not all contributors agree that theology can positively appropriate the term eros, a stance particularly evident in Edward P. Antonio’s affecting essay on AIDS in Africa, where “both ‘eros’ and erotic desire have become agents of sickness and death” (181). In sum, the volume combines an overview of the debates with fresh insights and proposals, from challenging interpretations of homoeroticism in the Bible (William Stacy Johnson) and rethinking the place of eros in the thought of Augustine and Aquinas (John E. Thiel and Cory Barnes) to reinterpreting ecclesiology through the rubric of desire (Paul Lakeland) and “queering white male fear in the mirror of hip-hop erotics” (James W. Perkins).</p>
<p>The volume is a good resource for scholars and clergy alike. It would be suitable for use in both graduate and advanced undergraduate courses, especially those exploring the intersection of theology and cultural theories or examining the role of love, desire, and sexuality in Christian thought. Although academic in tone, the essays are accessible and could be fruitfully used in adult education groups in the church context as well. Highly recommended.</p>
