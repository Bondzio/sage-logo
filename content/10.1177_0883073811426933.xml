<abstract>
<p>The incidence of spinal injuries is increased in people with epilepsy although compressive thoracic myelopathy has not been reported. We describe a 15-year-old girl with SCN1A mutation (Dravet syndrome), refractory generalized tonic-clonic seizures, and prior posterior instrumentation and fusion for scoliosis, who presented with progressive lower extremity weakness. Junctional kyphosis with disc herniation and spinal cord compression directly rostral to the instrumentation was apparent on imaging. On history, the patient had suffered a particularly severe convulsive seizure just before developing symptoms. Surgical decompression and stabilization led to a complete neurologic recovery. This unusual presentation of myelopathy illustrates the need to consider this complication in patients with epilepsy and spinal instrumentation.</p>

<p>Pediatric epilepsy is a common neurologic condition with significant morbidity and mortality. The morbidity associated with epilepsy is usually a result of cognitive impairment or neurobehavioral and neuropsychiatric disorders.<sup>

<p>This report describes an unusual mechanism of injury leading to thoracic myelopathy in a patient with refractory epilepsy and previous posterior instrumentation and fusion for neuromuscular scoliosis.</p>
<sec id="section1-0883073811426933">
<title>Case Report</title>
<p>A 15-year-old girl with profound global developmental delays, autistic features, and longstanding epilepsy secondary to confirmed SCN1A mutation (Dravet syndrome) developed progressive asymmetric leg weakness and inability to walk over 4 weeks. Precise characterization of this neurologic deficit was complicated by an underlying developmental delay and ongoing breakthrough seizures with prolonged post-ictal periods. There was no history of recent trauma; however, on further questioning her caregivers recalled a particularly severe 5-minute generalized tonic-clonic seizure before the onset of new motor dysfunction. At baseline, the patient had almost daily seizures and a history of multiple episodes of status epilepticus.</p>
<p>Three years prior to her current presentation, an incidental finding of a progressive double major scoliosis was identified. This was surgically corrected with a posterior instrumentation and fusion from T3 to L3. Intraoperative neurophysiologic monitoring using somatosensory and motor evoked potentials remained unchanged from preoperative baseline traces. She had an uncomplicated postoperative course and went on to achieve a solid spinal fusion clinically and radiologically. She was not on vitamin D or calcium supplements and had no history of metabolic bone disease.</p>
<p>On physical examination, tone was diffusely increased throughout, worse in the lower extremities, particularly on the right. Deep tendon reflexes were symmetrically brisk throughout with bilateral extensor plantar responses and several beats of bilateral ankle clonus. These pyramidal tract abnormalities had been noted on previous examinations. New to her examination was marked plegia of her right leg and limited movement of her left leg. She was unable to bear weight or ambulate. A reactive sensory level to pinprick at T3-T4 was found and her anal reflex was absent. Although there was no indication of bowel or bladder dysfunction (the patient wore diapers), bladder catheterization revealed a large residual volume.</p>
<p>Radiologic examination suggested spinal instability with severe junctional kyphosis and mild anterolisthesis at the T2-T3 interspace (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0883073811426933">Figure 1A</xref>). A computed tomographic myelogram confirmed mild anterior spondylolisthesis of T2 over T3 and degeneration of the T2-T3 disc with posterolateral disc herniation resulting in moderate anterior cord compression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0883073811426933">Figure 1B</xref>). Anterior vertebral body wedging and end plate irregularities were also evident at the T2 and T3 vertebrae.</p>

<p>Compressive myelopathy in the upper thoracic spine following a violent tonic-clonic seizure. The patient underwent posterior instrumentation and fusion for progressive scoliosis from T3 to L3 3 years earlier. An acute junctional kyphosis at T2-T3 with mild anterolisthesis was identified on initial radiographs (A). Computed tomographic myelogram confirmed spinal cord compression secondary to T2-T3 disc herniation (B and inset). Postoperative radiographs showed a substantial correction in the spinal deformity following spinal cord decompression and instrumentation with combined anterior and posterior approaches (C).</p>

</fig>
<p>The patient was treated acutely with halo traction to reduce the junctional kyphosis and indirectly decompress the spinal cord. This resulted in an immediate improvement in her neurologic function. Two days later, surgical decompression and stabilization of the T2-T3 motion segment was achieved through a combined anterior discectomy and instrumentation followed by an extension of the posterior instrumentation and fusion to T1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0883073811426933">Figure 1C</xref>). Because of the more caudal level of the sternal notch, an anterior approach medial to the sternocleidomastoid and carotid sheath was thought preferable and was subsequently performed without difficulty. Within 48 hours of the surgery, the patient was able to completely bear weight on her lower extremities, and after several weeks returned to her baseline motor ability. At 2.5 years of follow-up, there have been no further changes in her neurologic function and no significant complications related to her spinal instrumentation.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The case presented here is an unusual epilepsy-associated spinal injury for several reasons. Thoracic spine instability with associated spinal cord compression secondary to epileptic seizure appears to be very rare as there were no reports detailing this sort of event in our recent review of the medical literature. Second, we are not aware of reports describing seizure-associated spinal injuries in patients with preexisting spinal instrumentation.</p>
<p>The etiology of spinal injuries in patients with epilepsy is likely multifactorial, involving (1) the seizure type, frequency, and severity; (2) impairing neurologic side effects of antiseizure medications; (3) chronic use of antiseizure medications that decrease bone mineral density; (4) limitations in ambulation that may also adversely affect bone growth. In our case, the patient had all of these variables, with the additional complicating factor of an area of increased stress concentration at the transition from instrumented to noninstrumented regions of the thoracic spine.</p>
<p>This latter factor was likely a significant predisposing factor in her injury. For example, arthrodesis of the cervical spine can result in a lengthened lever arm and increased stress on adjacent mobile segments, which can lead to a greater risk of disc degeneration and deformity.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073811426933">5</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073811426933"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883073811426933">7</xref>
</sup> These complications are much less common in the thoracic spine given the relative stability imposed by the adjoining ribs. Despite this, chronic proximal junctional kyphosis has been reported at the rostral end of the spinal instrumentation in 26% of patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis following posterior instrumentation and fusion.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073811426933">8</xref>
</sup> In our patient, the presence of recurrent seizures, coupled with an area of increased stress concentration at the junction between fused and unfused segments, appears to have resulted in the observed spinal instability. Long-term valproate treatment could have further exacerbated the vulnerability to anterior vertebral body wedging and junctional instability, as this anticonvulsant has been associated with significantly decreased bone mineral density.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073811426933">4</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>This case highlights the potential for nontraumatic spinal cord injuries in patients with spinal instrumentation and refractory epilepsy. Although rare at this time, such presentations may become more common if new epilepsy treatments are successful in enhancing mobility and improving survival. Preventative measures for at-risk patients may include serial radiographs at regular intervals to help detect silent junctional instability predisposing the patient to spinal cord compression during seizure. Clinical and neurologic confirmation of compressive myelopathy following seizure should be treated with urgent surgical decompression and stabilization with spinal instrumentation. Attention to overall bone health should also be facilitated through the use of vitamin D and calcium supplementation in patients on long-term anticonvulsants.</p>
