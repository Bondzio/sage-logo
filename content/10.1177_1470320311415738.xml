<p><italic>Background</italic>: The (pro)renin receptor [(P)RR] non-proteolytically, through conformational change, activates prorenin which can convert angiotensinogen to angiotensin I in addition to the classic conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I by circulating renin. Since renal (P)RR is upregulated in hypertension and implicated in the pathogenesis of malignant hypertension, we hypothesized that (pro)renin receptor promoter is enriched with activating histone codes in the kidney of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR).</p>
<p><italic>Methods</italic>: The mRNA and protein expression levels were measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and western blot, respectively. The DNA methylation status of (P)RR promoter region was analyzed by bisulfite sequencing. The histone modifications were determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by real-time PCR.</p>
<p><italic>Results</italic>: The (P)RR mRNA expression in the kidney was about six times greater in SHR than in Wistar–Kyoto (WKY) rats. The (P)RR promoter was little methylated in the kidneys of both WKY and SHR. Acetylated histone H3 (H3Ac) and di-methylated histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me2), activating histone codes, were about 25 and three times higher in SHR than in WKY, respectively. On the other hand, di-methylated histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3K9me2), a suppressive histone code, was 50 times lower in SHR than in WKY.</p>
<p><italic>Conclusion</italic>: These results suggest that the (P)RR promoter is enriched with activating histone codes in the kidneys of SHR.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The renin–angiotensin system (RAS) has pivotal roles in the regulation of blood pressure (BP) and salt balance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1470320311415738">1</xref></sup> Renin is an enzyme of aspartyl protease that converts angiotensinogen into angiotensin I (Ang I) in the first and rate-limiting step of the RAS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1470320311415738">2</xref></sup> Prorenin, the precursor of renin, does not have an enzymatic activity due to an autoinhibitory prosegment, which covers the catalytic site,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470320311415738">3</xref></sup> although circulating levels of prorenin are 10 times higher than those of renin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1470320311415738">2</xref></sup> Prorenin is capable of converting angiotensinogen to Ang I when it is nonproteolytically activated through conformation change by binding with the recently found (pro)renin receptor [(P)RR].<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1470320311415738">4</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>(P)RR is a 350 amino acid with a single transmembrane protein that binds both renin and prorenin with equal affinity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1470320311415738">5</xref></sup> (P)RR, upon binding to (pro)renin, it leads to two reactions: (P)RR not only increases the catalytic efficiency of (pro)renin for Ang I formation from angiotensinogen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1470320311415738">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1470320311415738">6</xref></sup> but also directly stimulates an intracellular signaling independent of Ang I formation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1470320311415738">7</xref></sup> Although a recent study reveals a number of genetic variants between Wistar–Kyoto (WKY) rats and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1470320311415738">8</xref></sup> the relationship between genetic variants and (P)RR expression is still not clear. Some studies reveal that (P)RR regulates BP. BP and heart rate are increased in transgenic rat with human (P)RR overexpression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1470320311415738">9</xref></sup> Knockdown of endogenous (P)RR in the supraoptic nucleus (SON) of SHR attenuates age-dependent increases in mean arterial pressure and causes a decrease in heart rate and plasma vasopressin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1470320311415738">10</xref></sup> On the other hand, enhanced expression of (P)RR in the collecting duct induced development and progression of malignant hypertension in a transgenic rat model.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1470320311415738">11</xref></sup> (P)RR, upon binding to (pro)renin, activates promyelocytic zinc finger (PLZF) protein, a transcription factor, which in turn suppresses (P)RR expression, indicating that PLZF is a negative feedback regulator of (P)RR expression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1470320311415738">12</xref></sup> Although (P)RR is emerging as important regulator for BP control, there are no studies investigating the epigenetic regulation of (P)RR expression in hypertension. Rat (P)RR is encoded by the <italic>Atp6ap2</italic> gene located on chromosome Xq13.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1470320311415738">4</xref></sup> A C-terminal fragment of (P)RR including the transmembrane domain is accessory protein 2 of lysosomal H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1470320311415738">4</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Both the 5′-untranslated region of the (P)RR gene and adjacent intron contain a number of CG dinucleotides that result in a large CpG island. This structure is subject to be methylation by DNA methyltransferases. The methylated promoter represses gene transcription by recruiting methyl-DNA binding proteins and histone tail modifying proteins such as histone deacetylase (HDAC).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1470320311415738">13</xref></sup> Therefore, the regulation of (P)RR gene expression might be highly related according to the methylation status of the CpG island or modifications of the histone tails in the region. The epigenetic regulations including DNA methylation, structural modification of chromatin such as histone methylation, acetylation, ubiquitinylation or phosphorylation, and microRNAs have been highlighted in development, aging and oncogenesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1470320311415738">14</xref></sup> However, there are no studies investigating the epigenetic changes of the (P)RR gene promoter in hypertension. We hypothesized that the (pro)renin receptor promoter is enriched with activating histone codes in the kidney of SHR. To test this, we investigated (P)RR expression, promoter methylation status, and histone code modification in the kidney of WKY and SHR.</p>

<sec id="section3-1470320311415738">
<title>Animals</title>
<p>The investigation is in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the US National Institute of Health. Four pairs of 16-week-old male Wistar–Kyoto (WKY/Izm) rats and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR/Izm), weighing 250–300 g, were purchased from SLC Co. (Shizuoka, Japan). The BP was monitored for 2 weeks. Rats were sacrificed under deep anesthesia with pentobarbital. Aorta, heart, kidney tissues were excised, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at −80°C until further study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1470320311415738">
<title>Blood pressure measurement</title>
<p>The systolic blood pressure of the rats was measured by the tail cuff method. Briefly, rats were preheated on a hotplate at 35°C for 10 min and then placed in plastic restrainers. A cuff with a pneumatic pulse sensor was positioned around the tail. Blood pressure was recorded on a NIBP controller system (ADInstruments Pty Ltd, Castle Hill, NSW, Australia). At least three consecutive readings obtained from each rat were averaged and regarded as the blood pressure of each rat.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1470320311415738">
<title>Hematoxylin and eosin stain</title>
<p>Tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde solution in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 24 h, were processed, and embedded in a paraffin block after washing with PBS for 24 h. The blocks were cut to a 5 µm thickness and slices were mounted on the slide glasses. After hematoxylin and eosin staining, the slides were dehydrated, cleared with xylene, and covered with cytoseal.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1470320311415738">
<title>RNA extraction and reverse transcription</title>
<p>Tissues (about 100 mg) were homogenized in a glass homogenizer and RNA was extracted by using Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. All of the aortae were denuded of endothelium by gentle rubbing of the internal surface using forceps. The concentration and purity of extracted total RNA was determined by a spectrophotometer. Five micrograms of total RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA using ImProm-II Reverse Transcription system (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) in a 20 µl reaction volume according tothe manufacturer’s instructions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1470320311415738">
<title>Quantitative real-time RT-PCR</title>
<p>Real-time RT-PCR was performed using ABI Prism 7000 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Ten microliters of SYBR Green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems), 4 µl of cDNA, and a 200 nM primer set were used for amplification in 20 µl reaction volume. All samples were amplified in triplicates in a 96-well plate and the cycling conditions were as follows: 2 min at 50°C, 10 min at 95°C, and 40 cycles at 95°C for 15 s followed by 1 min at 60°C. The relative mRNA expression level was determined by calculating the values of Δcycle threshold (ΔCt) by normalizing the average Ct value compared with its endogenous control (<italic>Gapdh</italic>) and then calculating 2<sup>−ΔΔCt</sup>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1470320311415738">15</xref></sup> All primer sets used in real-time PCR are shown in Supplementary Table1.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1470320311415738">
<title>Protein extraction and western blot</title>
<p>Western blot was performed as described previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1470320311415738">16</xref></sup> The frozen tissues (about 100 mg) were homogenized in a buffer containing 320 mM sucrose, 50 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), and protease inhibitors leupeptin (10 µg/ml), trypsin inhibitor (10 µg/ml), aprotinin (2 µg/ml), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF; 100 µg/ml) and phosphatase inhibitor β-glycerophosphate (50 mM). Protein-matched samples (Bradford assay) were electrophoresed (sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis), transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The nitrocellulose membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk in TBS (25 mM Tris base and 150 mM NaCl) at room temperature for 2 h, and then incubated with 3 µg/ml of ATP6AP2 primary antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) at 4°C overnight. Horseradish peroxidase conjugated secondary antibody at a 1:4000 dilution was used for 1 h at room temperature and then washed three times, 10 min each in Tris-Buffered Saline Tween-20 (TBST). The target proteins were detected with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) plus detection reagents (Amersham, Pittsburgh, PA, USA). The expression levels were quantified with optical densitometry using ImageJ software.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1470320311415738">
<title>DNA bisulfite modification and sequencing</title>
<p>DNA was purified by phenol–chloroform and ethanol precipitation. The isolated DNA was modified by sodium bisulfite as described previously with a minor modification.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1470320311415738">17</xref></sup> After bisulfite modification, PCR of the CpG island (−278 to +128) on the <italic>Atp6ap2</italic> gene was performed, and PCR products were inserted into T-easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Five independent clones containing the exact-sized insert for each amplified fragment were sequenced by an ABI3700 automated DNA sequencer in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. The primer set used in bisulfite modified PCR was shown in Supplementary Table1.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1470320311415738">
<title>Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay</title>
<p>Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocols with some modification using EZ ChIP (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY, USA). In brief, tissues were fixed with 1% formaldehyde, and washed with ice-cold PBS. After homogenization, the tissues were suspended in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) lysis solution and sonicated to shear genomic chromatin into the appropriate length of DNA fragments. The lysate was incubated with protein G agarose beads for 2 h and, after removal of the beads, were further incubated with anti-H3Ac, anti-H3K4, or anti-H3K9 (Upstate Biotechnology) antibodies at 4°C for overnight. After addition of protein G beads, the mixture was incubated while rotating for 1 h. The beads were washed serially with a low-salt solution, high-salt solution, LiCl solution, and Tris-EDTA (TE) solution twice. The antibody–chromatin complexes were eluted from the beads with an elution buffer (1% SDS and 0.1 mol/l NaHCO<sub>3</sub>). After the addition of NaCl (0.2 mol/l), they were incubated at 65°C for 5 h to dissociate DNA from protein. The proteins were eliminated by digestion with proteinase K at 45°C for 2 h, and the DNA was purified with a spin column. The (P)RR promoter regions were amplified by quantitative real-time PCR. All samples were amplified in triplicates in a 96-well plate and the cycling conditions were as follows: 2 min at 50°C, 10 min at 95°C, and 55 cycles at 95°C for 15 s followed by 1 min at 60°C. Quantitative real-time PCR values were normalized to input. The primer set used in PCR is shown in Supplementary Table1.</p>

In addition, the levels of H3K9me2 in the (P)RR promoter region were about 50-fold less in SHR than in WKY (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1470320311415738">Figure 4C</xref>). Therefore, the increased levels of (P)RR mRNA correlated with the histone code modifications between WKY and SHR.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present study demonstrates that the (pro)renin receptor promoter is enriched with activating histone codes in the kidney of SHR. ChIP analysis revealed that activating chromatin codes were highly enriched in the (P)RR promoter region of SHR more than that of WKY. On the other hand, a suppressive chromatin code was less in (P)RR promoter region of SHR than that of WKY. There was little difference in the methylation status of the promoter between the kidneys of SHR and WKY.</p>
<p>Epigenetic modifications are defined as the heritable changes in gene expression patterns which are caused by absence of changes in DNA sequence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1470320311415738">18</xref></sup> The epigenetic changes maintain a specific gene expression pattern that contributes to the identity of cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1470320311415738">19</xref></sup> Each of the specific epigenetic changes is affected by not only developmental but environmental factors in addition to its genotype.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1470320311415738">20</xref></sup> The three major epigenetic factors are as follows: promoter DNA methylation, histone code modifications, and microRNA-mediated mechanism. DNA methylation occurs on cytosines at CpG dinucleotides across the mammalian genome, resulting in gene silencing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1470320311415738">21</xref></sup> Histone code modifications are posttranslational modifications such as acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, ADP-ribosylation, and ubiquitination of histone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1470320311415738">22</xref></sup> These modifications affect DNA replication, chromatin assembly and gene transcription.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1470320311415738">18</xref></sup> H3Ac and H3K4me cause an open chromatin structure, and are associated with active gene expression, whereas H3K9me is associated with transcriptionally silent heterochromatin formation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1470320311415738">23</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>To elucidate the molecular mechanism of hypertension in SHR, we investigated whether there were epigenetic modifications at the (P)RR promoter region in the kidneys of WKY and SHR. First, we analyzed the histone modifications of the (P)RR promoter region because the (P)RR expression was upregulated in a hypertensive kidney (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1470320311415738">Figure 4C</xref>). ChIP analysis showed the enrichment of activating chromatin marks over the suppressive chromatin mark on the (P)RR promoter in SHR in accordance with upregulation of the (P)RR in SHR. These data suggest that the upregulation of (P)RR expression in SHR is associated with the histone code modifications of the (P)RR promoter region.</p>
<p>We examined the expression levels of chromatin remodeling-related genes. Histone acetylation is regulated oppositely by the activities of histone acetyltransferase (HAT) and histone deacetylase (HDAC).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1470320311415738">24</xref></sup> The expression level of <italic>Hdac1</italic> mRNA was lower in SHR than in WKY (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1470320311415738">Figure 5</xref>). The mRNA of <italic>Ash2l</italic>, a component of H3K4 methyltransferase, was increased whereas that of <italic>Ehmt1</italic>, a H3K9 methyltransferase, was decreased in the kidney of SHR. These results might support the possibility that (P)RR promoter of SHR kidney is composed of activating chromatin structures which are abundant in acetylation and methylation at lysine 4. On the other hand, promoter methylation hardly influenced the (P)RR expression since (P)RR promoter region was mostly unmethylated in both SHR and WKY (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1470320311415738">Figure 4B</xref>).</p>
<p>The expression levels of (P)RR mRNA were higher in the kidneys of SHR than in those of WKY. Secondary renal damage by high BP was investigated by histology, which was indistinguishable between the kidneys of WKY and SHR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1470320311415738">Figure 1B</xref>). The level of (P)RR protein coincided with the level of <italic>ATP6ap2</italic> ((P)RR) mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1470320311415738">Figure 2</xref>). Immunohistochemistry showed that the (P)RR was expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells, hearts and kidneys.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1470320311415738">25</xref></sup> The kidney is composed of diverse cells in contrast to the heart or the aorta. In the kidney, the (P)RR is present in the mesangium, macular densa, podocytes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1470320311415738">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1470320311415738">7</xref></sup> collecting ducts, and distal tubules.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1470320311415738">26</xref></sup> We did not find any difference in the (P)RR expression between the heart of WKY and that of SHR. However, the expression of the (P)RR mRNA was higher in the heart of SHRsp on a high salt diet than that of WKY. The difference between the previous results and our results suggest that diet may be an important modulator for epigenetic modifications.</p>
<p>In order to investigate the impact of (P)RR in the activation of RAS, we determined the expression levels of RAS components including <italic>Agt, Ren, Ace1</italic>, and <italic>At1a</italic>. The expression levels of <italic>Agt, Ren</italic>, and <italic>At1a</italic> mRNA in WKY were not different from those in SHR. However, only <italic>Ace1</italic> mRNA was markedly increased in SHR compared with WKY (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1470320311415738">Figure 3</xref>). ACE plays a major role in generating angiotensin II. When renin binds to (P)RR, the activity of renin increases about four times.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1470320311415738">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1470320311415738">6</xref></sup> When prorenin binds to (P)RR, prorenin is nonproteolytically activated via conformational change.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1470320311415738">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1470320311415738">27</xref></sup> Generation of Ang I formed by the incubation of cells with (pro)renin was proportional to the amount of (pro)renin bound to the receptor in human (P)RR overexpressing cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1470320311415738">28</xref></sup> Therefore, (P)RR may have essential roles in the first and rate-limiting step of the RAS.</p>
<p>The (P)RR not only promotes the generation of Ang II, but also initiates Ang II-independent intracellular signaling pathway which induces the hypertrophic and profibrotic inflammatory signaling pathway.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1470320311415738">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1470320311415738">29</xref></sup> Though there are some unresolved issues, (P)RR may be considered a potential therapeutic target in the management of hypertension and organ damage induced by hypertension because the decreased (P)RR is an efficient way for the inhibition of RAS-dependent and -independent reactions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1470320311415738">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1470320311415738">30</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>In summary, the present study indicates that (pro)renin receptor promoter is enriched with activating histone codes in the kidney of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Histone modification rather than promoter DNA methylation is the major epigenetic change which is capable of inducing expression of (P)RR in the kidney of SHR, providing novel insight into the transcriptional regulation of (P)RR.</p>
