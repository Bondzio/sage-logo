<abstract>
<p>In 1775, 135 wives and 35 husbands filed complaints against their spouses with the Parisian commissioners of police. Most of the wives charged their husbands with verbal and physical violence, and a few of them initiated lawsuits for separation of property and/or persons. In those cases, the depositions of witnesses document conventional expectations about gendered roles in the household as well as the dynamics of communication, representation, and justification in the neighborhood. Against the background of debates about the use and abuse of royal authority in the decades preceding the Revolution, the complaints and lawsuits show that the traditional family/state model not only downplayed accountability in principle but also sanctioned accountability in practice.</p>

<p>French subjects remembered the late Louis XV and his mistresses as the incarnation of despotism and debauchery and applauded the young Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette as the incarnation of benevolence and morality. The new king and queen, who represented themselves as model spouses and rulers, seemed to love each other and their subjects. On June 8, 1775, as they made their way to Reims for the coronation ceremony, Marie Pierrette Pogny, a Parisian fish vendor, lodged a complaint against her husband Georges Armand Godard, a disabled veteran.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0363199012443666">1</xref>
</sup> She claimed that she worked hard to support him and their child, but he squandered money on loose women. He also beat her, and, after seventeen years of marriage, she had endured more than enough. In the course of the eighteenth century, thousands of wives lodged such complaints with the forty-eight district police commissioners of the capital. Historians have used published judicial memoirs to analyze marital conflicts that ended up in court, but they have not used unpublished police reports to explore domestic violence throughout the city.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0363199012443666">2</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The papers of thirty-four commissioners from 1725 contain forty-eight complaints against husbands (and five against wives), the papers of forty-three commissioners from 1750 contain seventy-nine complaints against husbands (and twelve against wives), and the papers of forty-six commissioners from 1775 contain 135 complaints against husbands (and thirty-five against wives).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0363199012443666">3</xref>
</sup> Many of the patterns discussed in the following paragraphs were defined by 1725 and confirmed in 1750: the social profile of the women, the grievances about financial and sexual misconduct, the accusations about verbal and physical violence, the contrast between male vice and female virtue. But by 1775, against the background of ongoing political debates, more women decided to criticize their husbands (and vice versa) in a more public manner. The large number of complaints and the small number of lawsuits illustrate assumptions about gender and attitudes toward marriage as well as the prevalence of contestations about the use and abuse of authority in France during the last decades of the ancien régime.</p>
<sec id="section1-0363199012443666">
<title>Complaints</title>
<p>Some of the wives who lodged complaints identified themselves by stating their own occupations: nine workers involved in the production and four vendors involved in the marketing of various types of merchandise (from fish to fashions), two laundresses, one hairdresser, and one innkeeper. Most of the wives identified themselves by identifying their husbands, and most of the husbands belonged to the working classes. Many of them were men with some status and assets: twenty-seven shopkeepers, fourteen master craftsmen, five journeymen, two apprentices, twenty-four other tradesmen, one hairdresser, two innkeepers, three cooks, one coachman, two servants, one bill-poster, and three manual laborers. The cast of characters also includes two soldiers, a musician, a public letter writer, an interpreter, two teachers, six clerks, a solicitor, three doctors, and six nobles.</p>
<p>Women of all ranks described their husbands as difficult, quarrelsome, or violent by nature and prone to explode on the slightest pretext (if a meal was not ready) or for no reason at all. These men with defective characters and belligerent dispositions expressed indifference, aversion, or hatred for their wives. One told his spouse that he was tired of living with her, and another told his spouse that she was good for nothing. Men insulted their wives in crude language (whore and its numerous synonyms, as well as hussy, rogue, bitch, dog, and refuse), which one “decent” fruit vendor’s spouse could not endure without “suffering very noticeably.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0363199012443666">4</xref>
</sup> Ten husbands defamed their wives by accusing them of adultery. One introduced his spouse to his friends as his mistress, and another suggested that his spouse prostitute herself to make money.</p>
<p>At the same time, men neglected work, contracted debts, sold their furniture, and starved their families in order to indulge their passions for drinking and gambling, not to mention sexual pleasure. Some left home, in some cases with other women, and left their spouses without resources when they did so. Twenty-five wives reported that their husbands were involved with loose, debauched, or infamous women. Thirteen of these wives ended up or at least feared that they would end up with venereal disease. Six had to share their homes with concubines. One woman charged that her spouse had proposed “things against decency” (presumably oral or anal sex) the very first time they slept together. When she objected, he remarked that he would not have married her if he had not expected to find her as accommodating as a whore.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0363199012443666">5</xref>
</sup> Another claimed that her spouse wallowed in the “most filthy and infamous libertinage” and committed “horrors that make nature tremble” with members of both sexes.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0363199012443666">6</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Many husbands resorted to violence in order to coerce their wives (into handing over money or signing over assets) or punish them (for making comments about financial and sexual misconduct). Some threatened to have their spouses locked up or simply locked them up at home, unable to go anywhere or see anyone, deprived of necessities, and reduced to subservience. Others opted for exclusion rather than enclosure. One tried to throw his wife out the window, and more did throw their wives out the door. A drunken painter told his wife to get out or he would throw her down the stairs. Drunk or sober, men slapped, punched, and kicked their wives, even when they were pregnant (in twenty-two cases), at least sometimes with the intention of terminating the pregnancy. A solicitor told his pregnant wife that he did not “give a damn,” that he wanted to make the child in her belly “croak.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0363199012443666">7</xref>
</sup> Men attacked their wives with sticks, canes, knives, swords, chairs, and tables. They threatened to poison, burn, strangle, stab, or shoot them, despite the likely consequences for themselves. Several vowed to kill themselves after killing their wives, and two denied the existence of a God who punished such crimes.</p>
<p>Many women recounted their experience of domestic violence in graphic detail, sometimes day by day and blow by blow. Fifteen percent noted that they had been rescued on one or more occasions by servants or neighbors, who sometimes summoned the municipal guard, which sometimes arrested the husband.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0363199012443666">8</xref>
</sup> Eighteen percent mentioned that they had lodged previous complaints, as many as three in a row and as far back as five years ago. Twenty-seven percent reported that they had left their spouses and taken refuge with relatives because they were convinced that their lives were in danger. One and only one accepted some blame by admitting that she had done nothing to provoke her husband “most of the time.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0363199012443666">9</xref>
</sup> The majority of women represented themselves as model wives who loved devotedly, served attentively, worked diligently, listened carefully, suffered patiently, obeyed routinely, and objected meekly in an effort to bring their irresponsible and unreasonable spouses back to their senses. Most downplayed unseemly assertiveness by claiming that they were conscientious about their domestic duties and reluctant to complain because of disgrace or scandal.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0363199012443666">10</xref>
</sup> Many wives hoped or at least said they hoped that their spouses would change sooner or later. Some accepted apologies and promises or welcomed reconciliations negotiated by relatives or priests.</p>
<p>Some women made rhetorical generalizations (not a single day passed without additional evidence of her husband’s brutality, and everyone in the neighborhood knew as much), but few made general statement about marital relations. One recalled that she had hoped for the “comforts that a wife who loves her husband should expect,” but it did not take her long to realize that she could expect “nothing but brutality” from her spouse.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0363199012443666">11</xref>
</sup> Another declared that her husband, far from having the feelings “that she was entitled to expect from him,” did not even remain “considerate for long in the ways that propriety and humanity required.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0363199012443666">12</xref>
</sup> She did everything that she could to “bring him around and gain his affection,” but her “kindness and complaisance only made him more irritable.” An eighteen-year-old woman obeyed her parents by marrying a seventy-year-old man with expectations of amity, harmony, and decency, and “no other objective than to please him.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0363199012443666">13</xref>
</sup> After he defamed her by accusing her of giving him venereal disease, she left the home, but her parents sent her back.</p>
<p>The majority of wives concentrated exclusively on the abusive words and deeds of their own husbands, without using the word “ought.” They often implied but never explained in so many words what husbands in general should and should not say and do. And yet they articulated their complaints within the framework of conventional values, which prescribed duties and outlined dangers for both sexes and therefore sanctioned criticism of misconduct by both sexes. Without saying it in so many words, women suggested that abusive spouses had violated their obligations and compromised their authority as husbands and fathers. Instead of governing themselves and their households like rational and responsible males, these men surrendered themselves to destructive (and indeed self-destructive) passions that endangered their spouses and dishonored their families. Under such circumstances, abuse justified and custom authorized female initiative with the objective of addressing local domestic injustices, as opposed to promoting larger structural transformations.</p>
<p>In 1775, after decades of debates about the limits of royal authority, some women used contemporary political language in their complaints. Jeanne Delaplace, married to an apprentice, reported that she had endured “tyranny” for two years.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0363199012443666">14</xref>
</sup> One surgeon’s wife endured “tyranny” for sixteen or seventeen years.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0363199012443666">15</xref>
</sup> Another surgeon kept his wife “always” in “slavery.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0363199012443666">16</xref>
</sup> The mathematician Clerget treated his wife like a “slave” throughout eleven years of “servitude.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0363199012443666">17</xref>
</sup> The marquis de Montefontaine treated his wife like a “slave subjected to his wishes.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0363199012443666">18</xref>
</sup> And the gilder Bourdon treated his wife like a “slave, saying that he is the master and does not expect to be contradicted in the slightest way.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0363199012443666">19</xref>
</sup> The master saddler Millet reminded Catherine Toussaint that he was the “master in his home.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0363199012443666">20</xref>
</sup> The cotton vendor Quennement made the same remark to Marie Madeleine Jacob and warned her that it was “very bold” of her to “criticize his actions.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0363199012443666">21</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>A few husbands used political language when they lodged complaints against their wives. One wife repudiated the subordination that she owed the head of the household and treated him like a “slave.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0363199012443666">22</xref>
</sup> Another wanted to free herself from marital authority, which her spouse had never abused, in order to be the “mistress of her actions.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0363199012443666">23</xref>
</sup> A third wanted nothing but to live “in independence.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0363199012443666">24</xref>
</sup> But the majority of husbands, like wives, concentrated on the pattern of misconduct over months and years. Concerned and patient men reported that their spouses neglected their household duties, talked or spent or drank too much, and abandoned themselves to the “most shocking libertinage.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0363199012443666">25</xref>
</sup> A mirror maker’s wife allegedly did so because she read “bad books.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0363199012443666">26</xref>
</sup> Disputatious and domineering women ignored, defied, reviled, slandered, menaced, or even attacked their spouses. Men complained about sexual promiscuity more consistently than women did, but bad wives behaved like bad husbands in many regards. Parisians of both sexes, not just one or the other, expected responsibility (in work and expenditures) and respectability (in comportment and sexuality) from their spouses. Most of the men wanted to have their wives locked up, in some cases for the second or third time, to punish them for offenses that disordered the household and dishonored the family. But at least some husbands lodged complaints because they thought or knew that their spouses intended to initiate lawsuits for marital separation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0363199012443666">27</xref>
</sup> They made preemptive strikes by accusing their wives of spreading lies about verbal or physical violence, deserting the household, or committing adultery.</p>

<title>Lawsuits</title>
<p>Women abused by their husbands could resign themselves to their fate and do their best to avoid further mistreatment, resist verbally or physically, involve neighbors or relatives, call the guard, leave the home, suggest or accept a de facto separation, lodge one or more complaints, ask the lieutenant general of police to intervene, or seek separation of property or persons. In complaints lodged from January through December 1775, thirty-three women, including a seamstress and a lace worker, stated that they intended to initiate lawsuits. Two-thirds were married to tradesmen, but the list of husbands also includes three nobles, a solicitor, three clerks, an innkeeper, a cook, a hairdresser, a coachman, and a manual laborer. Almost every one of the wives mentioned ongoing physical abuse. A disproportionate number of them also mentioned verbal abuse, accusations of adultery, prostitutes or concubines, venereal disease, enclosure or exclusion, violence during pregnancy, threatened or attempted murder, and, of course, previous complaints. One reported insults, beatings, and more on January 21 and 31 and again, after intervention by her mother, on March 2. Another lodged four complaints about misconduct and mistreatment. She noted on March 13 that her husband had threatened to commit suicide, on March 27 that he had threatened to sell their possessions if she left him, on April 3 that he had promised not to abuse her anymore if she dropped plans to seek a separation, and on  August 28, after she had walked out and come back, that he had continued to insult and assault her. That evening he tracked her down in the company of persons he had instructed her to avoid because they encouraged her to claim “complete liberty.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0363199012443666">28</xref>
</sup> When she refused to leave, he called the guard, who conducted them to the commissioner, who conducted them to the lieutenant general, who did not send the wife home with her husband.</p>
<p>Most of the women who indicated that they intended to initiate lawsuits, including a cobbler’s wife who mentioned consultation with a lawyer, did not proceed in 1775, or if they did, the cases did not reach the investigation stage by the end of the year. A wine vendor’s wife lodged a complaint on October 19, 1775, and a petition for separation a week later, but the witnesses did not give their depositions until August 1776, and the court did not make its decision until April 1777. For whatever combination of personal and procedural reasons, lawsuits often took years to conduct and complete. The investigations concluded in 1775 took place as soon as two and as much as ten months after the wives lodged their (initial) complaints. The judgments followed anywhere from four to thirty months later. The papers of the commissioners from 1776 and 1777 undoubtedly contain investigations triggered by petitions filed by some of the other thirty-three women, but the majority of them probably did not take the next step. After enduring mistreatment since her marriage, securing a separation of property, and lodging several complaints, a butcher’s wife acknowledged that she could not afford a lawsuit. Other women with limited resources undoubtedly came to the same decision.</p>
<p>The papers from 1775 contain documentation about five lawsuits, involving a shopkeeper, two master craftsmen, a surgeon, and a noble. Nothing about the circumstances or accusations distinguishes these few cases from many others that did not end up in court. But we know more about them thanks to the witnesses, usually five to ten of them but sixty-nine in one case. Wives named servants, neighbors, and friends, whom they obviously expected to support the charges stated in their complaints and listed in their petitions. They always included members of their own sex, who were likely to be more knowledgeable about domestic matters and perhaps more sympathetic as well. Witnesses provided a great deal of information, sometimes conflicting information, about the spouses and the conflicts. They could not always remember exactly when incidents took place, but they commonly remembered hearing, seeing, or hearing about shouting and screaming, verbal and physical violence, bruises and laments.</p>
<p>After five years of “slavery,” the patient and hopeful Marie Hyacinthe Malle insisted that she could not live any longer with the vulgar and brutal surgeon Antoine Gissort because her life was in danger.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0363199012443666">29</xref>
</sup> All eight witnesses, including one of her husband’s students, supported her charges about verbal and physical violence. Marie Jacqueline Lefebvre reported that Jean Lecomte, a fruit vendor, abused her and threatened to kill her, so she left him.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0363199012443666">30</xref>
</sup> She acknowledged that she did not have witnesses for all the incidents she recounted because her husband pretended to treat her kindly when others were around. None of the witnesses saw him offend or attack her, and they were divided about the “divorce” in the household.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0363199012443666">31</xref>
</sup> One testified that Lecomte referred to his wife as a harlot and hussy, and another testified that Lefebvre referred to her husband as a beggar and scoundrel, which illustrates the typical difference in insults directed at the two sexes. A male acquaintance thought that Lecomte did not really care about her, and a female servant thought that Lefebvre had only married him for money. Malle, with united witnesses, won her case, but Lefebvre, with divided witnesses, lost hers.<sup>

<title>Bourgot vs. Brancha</title>
<p>There are no published judicial memoirs about any of the five lawsuits investigated in 1775, which are documented only in the depositions recorded by the commissioners.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0363199012443666">33</xref>
</sup> The exemplary case of <italic>Bourgot v. Brancha</italic> shows how a wife articulated and her witnesses corroborated her charges about domestic violence in order to inform and persuade the magistrates. When Anne Françoise Sophie Bourgot, jewelry worker, married René Jean Brancha, master tinsmith, in February 1771, she expected that he would treat her well because of the resources she brought him and the affection she showed him. After two happy years, she realized that he had lied about his own assets and asked him about it, evidently without reproaching him for it, in the course of a quarrel that was evidently not provoked by that issue. Bourgot did not identify property and financial problems as an ongoing source of conflict, but she did imply that this quarrel constituted a turning point in their relations. From this time on, in spite of her efforts to placate him, Brancha, influenced by his father and unnamed others, subjected her to verbal and physical abuse. He did not want her to talk to anyone else, called her a whore when she returned from business and household errands, and punished her for disobeying him by beating her.</p>
<p>After two years of “slavery,” Bourgot lodged a complaint with commissioner Jean Baptiste Dorival.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0363199012443666">34</xref>
</sup> She concentrated on incidents that occurred in August and December 1774. In August, enraged for some reason by her mention of their (presumably pet) birds, Brancha dragged her to the window and threatened to throw her (after throwing her bonnets) into the river. When neighbors showed up, he chased them out, locked the door, and continued to punch and kick her. Bourgot did not explain why she did not lodge a complaint against Brancha at the time. On December 16, he chastised and attacked her for visiting one Cleret’s wife, whom she must have known before she served as godmother at her child’s recent baptism. That night he vowed that she would die only by his hand and told her that he would have shot her then and there if his pistol had been loaded. Two days later, he found her with her friend Voitout, dragged her away, and struck her repeatedly on the way home and once they got home. Since her husband was incorrigible and her life was in danger, Bourgot left. When she lodged her complaint, she condensed the narrative at the end, probably because she was anxious to find shelter for the night. She had no close relatives in Paris, so she took refuge with a confectioner and his wife of her acquaintance until she could withdraw to a convent.</p>
<p>In this case, the single complaint is less instructive than the seventeen depositions, which document a variety of reactions to domestic violence.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0363199012443666">35</xref>
</sup> Others had known for at least a year that Brancha beat Bourgot, since the day she sent for a doctor and told him, before neighbors, that her husband was responsible for her injuries. Six neighbors, including two couples, remembered the incident in August. Both couples heard the screams. The lapidary (witness #10) and his wife (#7) heard Bourgot call her by name. The wife and another woman (one Nicoine’s wife) went to investigate. Brancha told them there was nothing wrong, showed them out, and locked the door. The shoemaker (#11) saw him show them out. His wife (#9) and others gathered at the door, knocked, told Brancha that “it was very bad to mistreat his wife in this way,” and eventually went away. As for the others who mentioned the incident, a craftsman (#13) heard about it from neighbors the next day, and a servant (#15) heard about it from Bourgot herself. She knew that the doctor had treated Brancha but did not notice any bruises herself. Bourgot also talked to her husband’s journeyman, who had protected her and criticized him before. He noticed Bourgot’s bruises on this occasion and others and reported that her husband attributed them to horseplay.</p>
<p>Three witnesses noted that Brancha threatened to shoot Bourgot during the night of December 16. The servant asserted that she heard about it (like the incident in August) from Bourgot, but her mistress asserted that she heard about it from neighbors. The servant was probably right, since her version of the threat (if his pistol was loaded, he would blow out her brains) resembles Bourgot’s version more closely than the mistress’s version (I should blow your brains out with my pistol). The craftsman heard about the threat from the lapidary’s wife, who did not mention it in her own deposition, and Nicoine’s son, who, like his parents, did not testify.</p>
<p>Three groups of witnesses corroborated Bourgot’s account of the events of December 18 and provided additional information: her friend Voitout and one of Voitout’s neighbors, her own neighbors, and the couple who took her in. Voitout (#5) remembered that Brancha had insulted her, Voitout, by implying that her residence was a “bad place,” and that he had told his wife that he would show her that he was her master. The friend followed them into the street, and so did her neighbor (#16). She mentioned him, but he did not mention her, and neither mentioned the presence of his servant (#12). They saw Brancha strike Bourgot and told him that he was wrong to mistreat his wife in this way. He replied disingenuously that he hadn’t done anything to her. He threatened to call the guard, but she did not want to go with him because she was sure that he would “mistreat” her at home. In spite of what they had observed, the friend and her neighbor, who shrugged his shoulders to express pity, urged her to go home, and she did so, with predictable results.</p>
<p>In her truncated complaint, Bourgot did not mention the confrontation in the street or the involvement of neighbors later that night. Seven heard her screams. Three of them got up, looked out, and saw the husband and wife arguing outside their apartment. According to the furbisher’s wife (#6), the lapidary’s wife, and the craftsman, Brancha told them “that he had only slapped her once,” “that he had only slapped his wife once and because she had been in a place where he had forbidden her to go,” and “see how she shrieks because I slapped her once because she goes to a place where I do not want her to go. They evidently heard the same remark, but the craftsman added that Bougot asked her husband why he did not want her to go there. He replied because he did not want her to go there, without any explanation. The other four witnesses who heard the screams got up but did not see and hear what happened with their own eyes and ears. The shoemaker’s wife learned from the furbisher’s wife, who did not say so in her own deposition, that Brancha had slapped and kicked his wife. The shoemaker’s wife evidently did not tell her husband what she had learned, since he heard from neighbors the next day that Brancha had beaten his wife. The servant asked unnamed neighbors what was going on. The lapidary stated that his wife told him that Brancha told her “that I can’t get the better of my wife and I just slapped her once.” Either Brancha justified himself in different terms to different witnesses, the wife misquoted his remark, or the lapidary restated it in more husbandly language.</p>
<p>No matter what they knew and how they knew it, the neighbors agreed that Bourgot resisted her husband’s efforts to drag her into their apartment and found shelter, temporarily, with the shoemaker Nicoine, who lived across the landing. The last set of witnesses, the confectioner Desbois (#3) and his wife (#4), conflated the events of the 16th and the 18th, or perhaps Bourgot did so when she asked them to take her in. She had met the couple only days before, when Desbois served as godfather to Cleret’s child. She did not tell them, or Dorival, why she sought refuge with them rather than Cleret and his wife, who had introduced them, or Voitout and her husband, whom she had known for four years. Perhaps because they lived farther away from her husband and he did not know them? In any case, Desbois and his wife told much the same story, in much the same language, about Bourgot’s grievances and injuries. The wife was surprised by her appearance on their doorstep, but she was also genuinely sympathetic. She specifically mentioned Brancha’s threats as well as Burgot’s conviction that she could not remain with him any longer and her intention, not noted by anyone else, of seeking a marital separation. By doing so, the confectioner’s wife made the tinsmith’s wife sound both justified and purposeful. Bourgot spent a month with her new friends, during which time her old friend Voitout visited her and learned more about the verbal and physical abuse on December 18.</p>
<p>The depositions contain raw material for reconstruction of events and confirmation of details as well as speculation about silences and absences. They provide evidence about communication, representation, and justification. Bourgot talked to others, including a jeweler whom she evidently knew only casually, and they talked about her and her husband. None of the witnesses expressed any reservations about her conduct, and several characterized his behavior as irrational. The journeyman testified that he slapped his wife because she did not operate the bellows “according to his whim,” and the craftsman testified that the neighbors thought that he was both crafty and deranged. Other witnesses mentioned his anger and fury. But the depositions also illustrate the limits of what neighbors could or would do.</p>
<p>On December 18, after the servant heard Bourgot scream and someone knocked on her door, the mistress thought it must be Bourgot (why would Bourgot seek refuge with her?), but she did not open the door, allegedly because the person who knocked would not identify himself or herself (Bourgot would have had good reason to do so). The neighbors, on the whole, intervened less actively in December than they did in August. After their previous experience, few went up/downstairs to investigate, and none challenged Brancha’s right to forbid his wife to go somewhere and to slap her if she did. Voitout and her neighbor criticized him for beating her but “nevertheless” advised her to go home with him. Why? Because they did not question his authority or simply assumed that she had no other option? The furbisher, whose wife testified about December 18, told Dorival that he knew nothing about the incident. Why? Because he was reluctant to say anything negative about Bourgot or positive about her husband? The Nicoines did not testify because Bourgot did not list them as witnesses, even though the wife entered her apartment in August and the husband welcomed her into his apartment in December. What happened to make Bourgot think that they would not support her charges? Why did she leave them so quickly, lodge her complaint, and knock on the confectioner’s door after midnight, instead of waiting until the next day? In this case, like so many others, the papers of the commissioners leave more than a few questions unanswered. We do know that Bourgot won her case, but not until August 1778.<sup>

<p>In late eighteenth-century Paris, as in other times and places, most incidents of domestic violence were never recorded. The cases that are documented in complaints and lawsuits remind us not only that women were subordinate to their husbands and vulnerable to verbal as well as physical mistreatment by their husbands but also that jurisprudence did not assign and communities did not allow men unlimited power over their wives. The limits were not spelled out in so many words, in statutory or customary law or in legal precedents, so wives and husbands, friends, neighbors, and relatives, police and judges engaged in ongoing discussions about the genuine but slippery distinctions between the use and abuse of marital authority, against the background of debates about the use and abuse of royal authority. Women willing to take the risks and able to pay the costs had informal and official options available to them. Some of them found support and relief by talking not only to the people who lived around them but also to the commissioners who maintained public order in the capital and the magistrates who administered justice in the sovereign’s name.<sup>

</p>
<p>By the time Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette traveled to Reims, where they accepted the joyful and tearful adulation of their subjects, it was fashionable to embrace and display family values, including conjugal affection and parental devotion. Whether or not they actually shared those values, which were widely represented in novels, dramas, and paintings, men and women of all ranks invoked them to inculpate their spouses and exculpate themselves. Husbands, of course, could use the repertoire of traditional stereotypes about the female sex, recycled and updated by Rousseau, to denounce bad wives who abandoned virtue and neglected children. But wives, at the same time, could use traditional expectations about male rationality and responsibilities, along with the political rhetoric and sentimental imagery in circulation in the second half of the century, to denounce bad husbands who subjected them to tyranny and cruelty. Accusations against abusive husbands, like remonstrances about abusive ministers, intendants, and other officials, worked within the framework of the traditional family/state model, which downplayed accountability in principle but sanctioned accountability in practice.</p>

<p>Assuming that the missing papers would have contained the same proportion of complaints against husbands as the surviving ones, the extrapolated figures for 1725, 1750, and 1775 are 68, 88, and 141. The population of Paris increased during these fifty years, to be sure, but the volume of complaints against husbands (and wives as well) increased more quickly than the population did, especially during the third quarter of the century. For more about 1725 and 1750, as well as 1770, and about complaints and lawsuits more generally, see Jeffrey Merrick, “Marital Conflict in Eighteenth-Century France,” in <italic>Order and Disorder under the Ancien Régime </italic>(Cambridge: Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2007), chap. 9; and “Gender in Pre-Revolutionary Political Culture,” in <italic>Deficit to Deluge: Essays on the Origins of the French Revolution</italic>, 198-219 (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2011), 189–219.</p>
