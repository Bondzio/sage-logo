<abstract>
<p>This article examines antecedents and consequences of employees’ threat appraisal during organizational change. Positive change orientation and change-related fairness are examined as antecedents of threat appraisal and multiple forms of employee withdrawal as outcomes (intentions to quit, voluntary turnover, and absenteeism). Structural equation results show negative relationships between threat appraisals and positive change orientation (change self-efficacy, positive attitudes toward change, and perceived control of changes) and change-related fairness (distributive, procedural, and interactive). Threat appraisals are positively related to absenteeism and intentions to quit, which predict voluntary turnover. Threat appraisals have differential intervening effects on relationships between the antecedents and outcomes.</p>

<p>Globalization and economic instability have increased both the frequency and the magnitude of organizational change worldwide. Downsizing, restructuring, and relocating domestic jobs to international locations are now ever-present means of improving financial performance and competitiveness. For instance, a survey of corporate executives predicted a 37% increase in layoffs in 2008, on top of the significant increase in 2007 over 2006 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0149206309352881">Fox, 2008</xref>). We now know that in fact 5.7 million U.S. jobs were lost between December 2007 and April 2009 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0149206309352881">U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2009</xref>). Research has also shown that 61% of Americans are concerned that they, a friend, or a relative is in danger of losing a job because of outsourcing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0149206309352881">Jacobe, 2004</xref>). Recent European Union projections are similarly ominous; that region’s economy is expected to contract by 4% in 2009, on top of the 2.8% decline in 2008 and the worst since World War II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0149206309352881">Walker &amp; Perry, 2009</xref>). These projections undoubtedly portend a cascade of additional, substantial, and pervasive changes. Such changes, both past and potential, precipitate tremendous stress for employees and result in an array of negative outcomes for employers (e.g., absenteeism and voluntary turnover).</p>
<p>While change is a strategic imperative for employers, it also is vital to note that (remaining) employees determine the ultimate success of such changes. Put another way, negative employee reactions are potentially highly consequential as they can severely impede the realization of the intended benefits of change. It therefore is essential for organizations implementing change to better understand employees’ negative reactions to change in order to manage outcomes more effectively. The primary focus of this article thus is to study a key psychological mechanism underlying employee negative reactions to change: an individual’s <italic>threat appraisal</italic> of organizational change. To this end, we investigate the effects of key person (e.g., positive change orientation) and contextual (e.g., change-related fairness) predictors of employees’ threat appraisal and in turn their relationship with three forms of employee withdrawal (i.e., intentions to quit, voluntary turnover, and absenteeism) during organizational change (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0149206309352881">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Review of Threat Appraisal Literature and Outline of Study Contributions</title>
<p>Threat appraisals represent concerns over potential future losses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0149206309352881">Lazarus &amp; Folkman, 1984</xref>) and therefore reflect employees’ forward-looking concerns. Threat appraisal is rooted in the transactional approach to stress and reflects “the unique and changing relationship taking place between a person with certain distinctive characteristics . . . and an environment whose characteristics must be predicted and interpreted” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0149206309352881">Lazarus &amp; Folkman, 1984</xref>, p. 24). As such, threat appraisals give meaning to employees’ experience of change by capturing an individual’s perception of what is at stake in a specific situation. It is this “meaning ascribing” function of threat appraisal that is so valuable in the context of organizational change, as it allows researchers and practitioners to understand why some employees perceive a change event as threatening and others do not. It also serves to predict subsequent reactions to changes and helps explain the variability found among employee reactions (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0149206309352881">Bareil, Savoie, &amp; Meunier, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0149206309352881">Fugate, Kinicki, &amp; Prussia, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The prospective or anticipatory nature of threat appraisal has both practical and theoretical significance not found in existing organizational change research. For instance, knowledge of employees’ future change-related concerns affords managers of change the opportunity to intervene and proactively influence employee reactions. Existing research, in contrast, typically presumes managers’ activities are purely reactionary or guided by “best guesses” (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0149206309352881">Fugate &amp; Kinicki, 2008</xref>). Theoretically, studying threat appraisal helps researchers explain how cognitions today might influence behaviors tomorrow (e.g., withdrawal). The contributions of this study are further enhanced by our selection of threat appraisal predictors.</p>
<p>We examine predictors of threat appraisal that are amenable to manager influence and thereby provide managers of change specific means for affecting employee reactions (e.g., threat appraisals). In so doing, the current study helps fill a notable void in existing organizational change research, which is pervaded by examinations of stable individual traits (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0149206309352881">Oreg, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0149206309352881">Wanberg &amp; Banas, 2000</xref>) and contextual factors that often are beyond a manager’s sphere of influence or control (for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0149206309352881">Armenakis &amp; Bedeian, 1999</xref>). While this past research is insightful, the trait-based, fixed, and largely uncontrollable nature of predictors studied limits the practical utility for those charged with managing change. The current study also differs from past research and examines mutable contextual organizational change-related procedures and practices (i.e., change-related fairness) that are more controllable by management. Therefore, rather than studying predictors that are beyond managerial control, our selection of malleable predictors provides practical levers with which managers can actively influence employee reactions and change outcomes.</p>
<p>Another contribution pertains to examining the relationship between employees’ threat appraisals and their subsequent withdrawal cognitions and behaviors. Although existing organizational change research typically has studied either withdrawal cognitions (e.g., intentions to quit; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0149206309352881">Brennan &amp; Skarlicki, 2004</xref>) or behaviors (e.g., turnover and absenteeism; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0149206309352881">Martin, Jones, &amp; Callan, 2005</xref>), we include both withdrawal cognitions and the withdrawal behaviors of turnover and absenteeism. This contribution is especially important, as both absenteeism and voluntary turnover are very costly consequences of change, and the loss of key personnel can handicap an organization’s competitiveness, which is exactly what many changes are intended to enhance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0149206309352881">Fugate et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Our final contribution pertains to a fundamental tenet of the transactional approach to appraisal, that is, that both person and contextual factors influence a person’s appraisal of a specific event (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0149206309352881">Lazarus &amp; Folkman, 1984</xref>). Examining both simultaneously thus provides a more comprehensive account of individuals’ experience and reactions to change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0149206309352881">Beehr, 1998</xref>) and allows researchers to see change through the eyes of the employee. Including both also answers the call of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0149206309352881">Herold, Fedor, and Caldwell (2007)</xref>, who assert that the frequent exclusion of either person or contextual factors may account for the often disappointing results found in past organizational change research and practice (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0149206309352881">Oreg, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>To summarize, this article applies the transactional approach to threat appraisal, which we argue is an underlying cognitive mechanism that mediates the relationship between person and contextual factors and employee withdrawal during organizational change. By means of this approach, we provide a rich view of employees’ experience of change and a more precise perspective on the role of threat appraisal. The following sections provide the theoretical foundation of the relationships depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0149206309352881">Figure 1</xref>, as well as a description of plausible alternative causal structures.</p>

<sec id="section2-0149206309352881">
<title>Antecedents of Employees’ Change-Related Threat Appraisals</title>
<p>We acknowledge that many factors potentially influence employees’ threat appraisals and reactions to change. That said, we based our selection on two critical elements. First, the antecedents needed to explicitly capture how employees interact with and experience the change environment. Second, the antecedents needed to be amenable to change by the individual employee experiencing the change and/or by the managers charged with implementing change. Accordingly, we selected <italic>positive change orientation</italic> and <italic>change-related fairness</italic> as latent antecedents of employees’ threat appraisals of change. Both have clear and important implications for how employees’ experience organizational change as both represent important aspects of how employees relate to and meet demands of the environment (i.e., experience change). Both also are amenable to change and provide considerable practical potential not found in existing research (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0149206309352881">Avey, Wernsing, &amp; Luthans, 2008</xref>). Our selection also builds on recent trends in positive organizational behavior (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0149206309352881">Luthans, Avolio, Avey, &amp; Norman, 2007</xref>) and investigates statelike predictors of threat appraisal that are “positively oriented human resource strengths and psychological capacities that can be measured, developed, and effectively managed” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0149206309352881">Luthans, 2002</xref>, p. 698).</p>
<sec id="section3-0149206309352881">
<title>Positive Change Orientation</title>
<p>Surprisingly little (organizational) research addresses positive change orientation directly. In a rare instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0149206309352881">Fay and Frese (2001)</xref> examined positive change orientation as an indicator of personal initiative but did not articulate the conceptual foundation of the construct or describe how they measured it. They did, however, clearly note that positive change orientation and orientations more generally are changeable and situation-specific individual characteristics (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0149206309352881">Frese, Garst, &amp; Fay, 2007</xref>). We thus build on Fay and Frese and define positive change orientation as a constellation of malleable individual characteristics that affect how individuals perceive and respond to change. Those who possess a high level of positive change orientation view changes positively, are confident in their abilities to meet the demands presented by changes, and take a more positive and active approach toward changes (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0149206309352881">Jones, Jimmieson, &amp; Griffiths, 2005</xref>). Defined this way, positive change orientation is a statelike construct, which contrasts with traditional notions of person-centered constructs as either traits or states. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0149206309352881">Chen, Gully, Whiteman, and Kilcullen (2000)</xref> distinguished the two and explained that traits are not specific to a particular task or situation and are stable over time (e.g., general cognitive ability and personality), whereas state characteristics are situation specific and more flexible over time (e.g., specific self-efficacy and state anxiety). More recent research regarding positive organizational behavior (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0149206309352881">Luthans et al., 2007</xref>) arranges individual differences on a state–trait continuum, such that <italic>states</italic> are momentary and very changeable (e.g., emotions); <italic>statelike</italic> signifies relatively malleable and open to development (e.g., efficacy, hope, and well-being); <italic>traitlike</italic> signifies relatively stable and difficult to change (e.g., personality, negative affect, and core self-evaluations), while <italic>traits</italic> are very stable, fixed, and difficult to change (e.g., intelligence and heritable characteristics). This framework was used for qualifying and labeling the positive change orientation construct and its component indicators as statelike.</p>
<p>
<italic>Uncertainty management theory</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0149206309352881">Van den Bos, 2001</xref>) serves as the theoretical foundation for positive change orientation. Reductions in uncertainty are associated with more positive employee perceptions and behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0149206309352881">Lind &amp; Van den Bos, 2002</xref>) and improve employee reactions and change-related outcomes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0149206309352881">Rafferty &amp; Griffin, 2006</xref>). We selected three key characteristics to use as indicators of the latent positive change orientation construct—<italic>change self-efficacy</italic> (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0149206309352881">Jimmieson, Terry, &amp; Callan, 2004</xref>), <italic>positive attitudes toward changes</italic>, and <italic>perceived control of the changes</italic> (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0149206309352881">Wanberg &amp; Banas, 2000</xref>)—based on two fundamental considerations. First, past organizational change research supported the importance of these characteristics, and second, each is changeable and situation specific. These criteria are important to our goal of using indicators that can be influenced by managers as they attempt to implement organizational change. We acknowledge that these are not the only potential variables to influence positive change orientation. However, we believe these are particularly relevant as they are largely attitudinal and potentially both more insightful and of greater practical utility than change-related behaviors (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0149206309352881">Stock &amp; Hoyer, 2005</xref>). Let us now consider the logic for selecting change self-efficacy, positive attitudes toward changes, and perceived control of changes as indicators of positive change orientation in more detail.</p>
<sec id="section4-0149206309352881">
<title>Change self-efficacy</title>
<p>Employees with high levels of change-related self-efficacy believe they have the ability to deal with change-related demands and that they can function effectively during the change process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0149206309352881">Jimmieson et al., 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0149206309352881">Ozer and Bandura (1990)</xref> explicate a specific relationship between self-efficacy and threat appraisal when noting that “threat is not a fixed property of situation events. . . . Rather, threat is a relational property concerning the match between perceived coping capabilities and potentially hurtful aspects of the environment. People who believe they can exercise control over potential threats do not conjure up apprehensive cognitions, and, hence, are not perturbed by them” (p. 473). Organizational change research showed that employees’ coping efficacy was positively related to the appraisal of changes associated with an organizational merger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0149206309352881">Scheck &amp; Kinicki, 2000</xref>). All told, change self-efficacy is an important indicator of positive change orientation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0149206309352881">
<title>Positive attitudes toward change</title>
<p>Employees with positive attitudes toward change are willing to support changes and have positive expectations for change outcomes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0149206309352881">Svensen, Neset, &amp; Eriksen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0149206309352881">Wanberg &amp; Banas, 2000</xref>). These attitudes facilitate adaptation to the demands of organizational change, thereby alleviating appraisals of threat. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0149206309352881">Wanberg and Banas’s (2000)</xref> results showed that positive attitudes toward change was associated with increased job satisfaction and decreased intentions to quit and actual turnover. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0149206309352881">Lazarus and Folkman (1984)</xref> asserted that an individual’s beliefs (e.g., attitudes) shape the meaning of experiences and thereby influence the individual’s evaluations or appraisals of events. Conceived in this manner, positive attitudes toward changes shape the meaning of change events at work and are reflective of positive change orientation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0149206309352881">
<title>Perceived control</title>
<p>Perceived control over the changes reflects employees’ beliefs that they have the ability to influence the processes and outcomes associated with change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0149206309352881">Ashford, 1988</xref>). Actions that increase the predictability of change outcomes can enhance employee perceptions of control during the process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0149206309352881">Neves &amp; Caetano, 2006</xref>). As such, perceptions of control alleviate the inherent uncertainty associated with organizational change and mitigate perceptions of threat. This position is further supported by volumes of other research that showed perceptions of control of changes facilitated numerous positive employee change-related reactions, such as effective coping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0149206309352881">Bowman &amp; Stern, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0149206309352881">Terry, Callan, &amp; Sartori, 1996</xref>), openness to change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0149206309352881">Wanberg &amp; Banas, 2000</xref>), and employee adjustment over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0149206309352881">Paulsen et al., 2005</xref>). Perceived control thus is likely to have important implications for one’s orientation toward changes.</p>
<p>As conceptualized in this article, positive change orientation differs from other individual characteristics relevant to organizational change. For instance, openness to change is most often defined as attitudes toward change, such as willingness to support and positive feelings about changes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0149206309352881">Wanberg &amp; Banas, 2000</xref>). Positive change orientation both subsumes and expands beyond positive change attitudes (openness) by also including uncertainty-reducing characteristics of perceived control and change efficacy. Resistance to change is another often studied person-centered variable that frequently is conceptualized and measured as “behavior that seeks to challenge, disrupt, or invert prevailing assumptions, discourse, and power relationships” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0149206309352881">Folger &amp; Skarlicki, 1999</xref>, p. 36). While positive change orientation likely predicts various forms of resistance, it differs in that it does not have a behavioral component but instead combines change-related cognitive and attitudinal elements.</p>
<p>Based on the above discussion, we predict the following:</p>
<list id="list1-0149206309352881" list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p><italic>Hypothesis 1</italic>: Positive change orientation will be negatively related to threat appraisals.</p>

<sec id="section7-0149206309352881">
<title>Change-Related Fairness</title>
<p>Fairness is well established as a central aspect of productive employee–employer relationships (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0149206309352881">Lind, Kulik, &amp; Ambrose, 1993</xref>), and a growing body of research indicates that fairness is especially important during organizational change (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0149206309352881">Kernan &amp; Hanges, 2002</xref>). Change-related fairness provides employees with a sense that management is trustworthy, which helps reduce uncertainty surrounding current changes and lends a measure of predictability to potential future actions (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0149206309352881">Colquitt, Scott, Judge, &amp; Shaw, 2006</xref>). Conceived in this way, fairness is an important antecedent of employees’ threat appraisals during organizational change.</p>
<p>People often judge fairness heuristically, based on observations of change-related outcomes, procedures, and interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0149206309352881">Colquitt et al., 2006</xref>). Using fairness heuristic theory, Van de Bos (2001) further argued that these judgments act as proxies (or substitutes) for management trustworthiness, “and that once an individual has established a fairness judgment—whether it is based on procedure or outcome fairness—perceived fairness serves as a heuristic that guides the interpretation of subsequent events” (p. 932). This conclusion is bolstered by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0149206309352881">Konovsky (2000)</xref>, who in her review of the justice literature claimed, “Fairness judgments are salient during times of significant organizational change. Fairness heuristic theory predicts that when an organizational relationship is in flux, fairness-relevant experiences become especially potent factors in shaping attitudes and behavior” (p. 498). We thus draw on fairness heuristic theory to propose that employees are more likely to appraise organizational change as less threatening (i.e., more favorably) when they believe that it was handled fairly. Individuals build their heuristic judgments on observable elements of fairness (e.g., distributive, procedural, and interactional), and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0149206309352881">Folger and Skarlicki (1999)</xref> argued that all three influence employees’ perceptions of threat related to organizational change. We thus used each form of fairness as an indicator of a latent change-related fairness construct.</p>
<p>The latent construct approach is appropriate as it matches the level of focus for fairness heuristic theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0149206309352881">Colquitt &amp; Shaw, 2005</xref>) to the level of focus of the current study and is supported by existing research. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0149206309352881">Tornblom and Vermunt (1999)</xref> stated that “people conceive of fairness as a Gestalt,” such that components are “meaningful only in relation to the overall fairness of the situation” (p. 51). The same argument applies to the current study. Meta-analytic results further support this perspective. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0149206309352881">Hauenstein, McGonigle, and Flinder (2001)</xref> concluded that justice components share considerable common variance with each other (i.e., they are highly correlated) and thus should capture considerable common variance in outcomes they are hypothesized to predict; “as such, the interpretation of the contribution of one form of justice, independent from the others, likely overestimates its relationship with the criterion” (p. 48). We therefore included participants’ assessments of three forms of change-related fairness as indicators of a latent fairness construct and developed hypotheses at the construct level.</p>
<p>Various forms of fairness have been linked to organizational change. For the purposes of the current study, <italic>distributive fairness</italic> pertains to the outcomes of changes, and employees’ perceptions of how fairly the “pains and gains” of the changes are shared likely influence appraisals of threat. <italic>Procedural fairness</italic> relates to the procedures and processes used for planning and implementing change and signals management’s respect and value for employees. When change-related decisions are perceived as fair, employees’ threat appraisals are likely to abate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0149206309352881">Spreitzer &amp; Mishra, 2002</xref>), and they are more likely to engage or commit to the change. For example, employees involved in a reengineering disengaged (i.e., reduced commitment, loyalty, and hard work) when planning was perceived as unfair (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0149206309352881">Korsgaard, Sapienza, &amp; Schweiger, 2002</xref>). <italic>Interactional fairness</italic> reflects employees’ perceptions of the quality of interpersonal treatment related to the implementation of change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0149206309352881">Folger &amp; Skarlicki, 1999</xref>). Appropriate communications and treating employees with respect and dignity reduce appraisals of threat as they are evidence that management considers employee well-being. In support of this assertion, research found interactional fairness to be an important determinant of downsizing survivors’ trust in management following a downsizing (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0149206309352881">Kernan &amp; Hanges, 2002</xref>), and it also is central to employees’ attachment to the organization and support for change (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0149206309352881">Spreitzer &amp; Mishra, 2002</xref>).</p>

<title>Threat Appraisal and Employee Withdrawal</title>
<p>Although sparse, existing organizational threat appraisal research reveals that threat appraisals are related to both affective and behavioral employee reactions. For instance, appraisals of a corporate merger predicted negative emotions and problem-focused coping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0149206309352881">Scheck &amp; Kinicki, 2000</xref>), and threat appraisals were associated with perceptions of superiority or inferiority between coworkers and subsequent aggressive or submissive behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0149206309352881">Fournier, Moskowitz, &amp; Zuroff, 2002</xref>). Although these findings are useful, research still is needed that examines other organizationally relevant outcomes. To fill this void, we sought to determine the relationship between threat appraisal and various forms of employee withdrawal—<italic>intentions to quit, voluntary turnover</italic>, and <italic>absenteeism</italic>. Intentions to quit represent cognitive withdrawal, and voluntary turnover and absenteeism are behavioral (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0149206309352881">Hanisch &amp; Hulin, 1991</xref>). Each represents costly negative consequences of change for employers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0149206309352881">Spreitzer &amp; Mishra, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The relationships between threat appraisal, turnover, and absenteeism can be explained via the <italic>theory of reasoned action</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0149206309352881">Ajzen &amp; Fishbein, 1980</xref>), wherein behavior is a function of one’s intentions, which are determined by individual differences and contextual factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0149206309352881">Miller &amp; Grush, 1988</xref>). In the context of organizational change, individuals are expected to avoid or mitigate threats at work, including the job itself, and these motivations often manifest as intentions and actual behaviors. Behavioral avoidance/withdrawal is a matter of degree, with voluntary turnover the most extreme and absenteeism less dramatic or complete, but both serve the same purpose—mitigation of perceived threats (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0149206309352881">Sagie, Birati, &amp; Tziner, 2002</xref>). This supposition is supported by protection motivation research, which shows that perceived threats predict intentions to withdraw from a situation and to avoid the source of threats (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0149206309352881">Eppright, Hunt, Tanner, &amp; Franke, 2002</xref>. Accordingly, we expect employee threat appraisals to precipitate intentions to quit and absenteeism, which represent both cognitive and behavioral signals of a desire to avoid, remove, or mitigate the threatening job situation. The above discussion results in the following hypotheses (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0149206309352881">Figure 1</xref>):</p>

<title>Alternative Causal Relationships</title>
<p>Hypotheses 1 through 5 propose fully mediated relationships between the antecedents and outcomes of employees’ threat appraisals. To increase the confidence in our hypotheses and validate the underlying theory, we also considered and tested a number of alternative conceptually plausible causal structures—partial mediation and moderation. Examining these alternatives is especially valuable given that this is the first study to examine this particular constellation of constructs. One such alternative pertains to the nature of threat appraisal’s mediated effects (i.e., fully or partially) on employee withdrawal, which requires direct effects between its antecedents (positive change orientation and change-related fairness) and outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0149206309352881">James, Mulaik, &amp; Brett, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0149206309352881">Matheiu &amp; Taylor, 2006</xref>). Previous research shows that both positive change orientation and fairness influence employee withdrawal. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0149206309352881">Cunningham et al. (2002)</xref> found that employees with high perceptions of control and change efficacy were more likely to engage in rather than withdraw from reengineering initiatives. Similarly, research related to fairness generally shows negative relationships between various forms of fairness and withdrawal. Procedural fairness was negatively related to intentions to quit during a reorganization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0149206309352881">Kernan &amp; Hanges, 2002</xref>), and both procedural and distributive fairness were negatively associated with intentions to quit for relocated employees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0149206309352881">Daly &amp; Geyer, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>It also is possible that the focal constructs of this study moderate their respective relationships. Moderators are typically stable dispositional or environmental factors that are <italic>brought to</italic> the person–situation transaction and buffer the stressor–strain relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0149206309352881">Cooper et al., 2001</xref>). Accordingly, it is possible that (a lack of) fairness is a stressor that directly influences threat appraisal (a strain), and that positive change orientation (a disposition) moderates the fairness → threat appraisal relationship. To validate this assertion, we first need to establish that fairness is directly related to employees’ threat appraisals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0149206309352881">Matheiu &amp; Taylor, 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0149206309352881">Mishra and Spreitzer (1998)</xref> provide such evidence and argue that all three forms of fairness directly affect surviving employees’ threat appraisals of downsizings. Their principal argument is that fairness mitigates uncertainty and thus reduces employees’ concerns of future consequences, which aligns with the prospective or future-oriented perspective of threat appraisal. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0149206309352881">Shapiro and Kirkman (1999)</xref> provide further support and articulate numerous perceived employee threats—job insecurity, coworker conflicts, undesirable job assignments—when changing to self-managed work teams. Fairness was found to mitigate these threats and beneficially affect commitment, change resistance, and intentions to quit. We tested the veracity of these alternative relationships in this study.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section11-0149206309352881">
<title>Sample and Procedure</title>
<p>Survey data were obtained from 153 employees (an 80% response rate) of a department in a public services organization that was experiencing a major organizational restructuring. Changes included creating new positions, realigning reporting relationships, mapping and modifying processes and work flows, updating and expanding technology, and reconfiguring physical workspaces. Surveys measuring positive change orientation, change-related fairness, threat appraisals of the changes, and intentions to quit were administered to department employees at the time of the initial management changes, and subsequent data regarding voluntary turnover and absenteeism were collected 18 months later from company records. The 18-month lag was chosen for two reasons: (a) It coincided with the completion of the major change initiatives, and (b) the interval is consistent with the expected relationships between the constructs measured within this context. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0149206309352881">de Lange, Taris, Kompier, Houtman, and Bongers (2003)</xref>, which time lag is right “depends on various factors, such as the type of outcome being measured and whether changes in work characteristics or job changes have taken place” (p. 302).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0149206309352881">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>We used multiple observed indicators to assess most latent model constructs, but single items were used to represent quit intentions, voluntary turnover, and absenteeism. We followed the procedure recommended by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0149206309352881">Williams and Hazer (1986)</xref> and used reliability information to correct for measurement error because of the use of a single indicator (see Quit Intention in the Measures section). Coefficient alpha was estimated for indicators derived from multiple items.</p>
<sec id="section13-0149206309352881">
<title>Positive change orientation</title>
<p>This construct was measured with three manifest indicators: change-related self-efficacy, positive attitudes toward change, and perceived control of changes. Importantly, instructions for all three indicators used the recent changes at the focal organization as their referent; that is, each measure explicitly referred to the actual changes that occurred rather than employees’ reactions to changes in general. For example, instructions for change self-efficacy were, “We are interested in your perceptions of your ability to deal with the changes that have occurred. Please indicate the extent to which you agree with the following.” Instructions for the positive attitudes toward change scale were, “We are interested in your attitudes toward the changes that have occurred at work. Please indicate the degree to which you agree with the following.” And finally, items for perceived control of the changes were preceded by “Please indicate to what extent you agree with the following as they relate to the changes that have occurred.” Focusing the instructions in this manner facilitated operationalization of the statelike nature of the positive change orientation construct.</p>
<p>Each of the three indicators was measured using a score that represents the average of the items in that particular scale. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0149206309352881">Wanberg and Banas’s (2000)</xref> three-item change self-efficacy scale was used to assess efficacy for dealing with organizational changes. An example item is, “Wherever the changes take me, I am sure I can handle it.” Next, positive attitudes toward changes were assessed using six items derived from the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0149206309352881">Miller, Johnson, and Grau (1994)</xref> openness toward change scale. A sample item is, “I feel that the changes generally have positive implications.” Item responses for these two scales ranged from 1 (<italic>strongly disagree</italic>) to 5 (<italic>strongly agree</italic>), and alpha reliabilities were .77 and .86, respectively. Finally, a three-item scale was created to measure perceived control of the changes for this study. These items were similar to those used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0149206309352881">Terry et al. (1996)</xref> to measure perceived controllability of changes. Participants were asked, “How much control do you feel over the following: (a) How the changes are developed; (b) the outcomes of the changes, and (c) the changes that influence your job?” Responses ranged from 1 (<italic>none at all</italic>) to 5 (<italic>a great deal</italic>). The alpha reliability for this scale was .95.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0149206309352881">
<title>Change-related fairness</title>
<p>This latent construct also was measured with three manifest indicators: distributive, procedural, and interactional fairness. Items used were derived from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0149206309352881">Colquitt (2001)</xref>, modified to fit the organizational change context of this study, and averaged to create a single-item scale score for each indicator. Distributive fairness was measured with five items, such as “Have the changes in your job responsibilities been fair to you?” Similarly, procedural fairness was operationalized with five items, including “Have the procedures that produced the change been free of bias?” Interactional fairness was assessed with four items, each referring to the authority figure most closely associated with the changes. A sample item is, “Has he/she treated you with dignity?” All responses ranged from 1 (<italic>to a small extent</italic>) to 5 (<italic>to a great extent</italic>), and alpha reliabilities for these three scales were .73, .84, and .86, respectively.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0149206309352881">
<title>Threat appraisal</title>
<p>This construct was measured with seven items from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0149206309352881">Fugate et al. (2008)</xref>. Their scale tapped assessments of threat pertaining to a broad array of work elements often affected by organizational changes: job stability, relationships with supervisors and coworkers, desirability of one’s job, personal job opportunities at current employer, pay and benefits, and general working conditions. Respondents were asked, “Due to the changes, to what extent do you feel that each of the following is <italic>THREATENED—a possibility that it will get worse in the future</italic>?” Instructions of this type are common in other threat appraisal research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0149206309352881">Chandler, Kennedy, &amp; Sandhu, 2007</xref>). Respondents indicated their perceived threat along a continuum from 1 (<italic>not at all threatened</italic>) to 5 (<italic>threatened to a great extent</italic>). Coefficient alpha for the seven-item scale was .85.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0149206309352881">
<title>Quit intention</title>
<p>This outcome was assessed with a single item, as found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0149206309352881">Mitchell, Holtom, Lee, Sablynski, and Erez (2001)</xref>. Employees were asked, “What are the chances that you will quit your job during the next 12 months?” Responses ranged from 1 (<italic>no chance</italic>) to 5 (<italic>100% chance</italic>). Because the construct was assessed using a single indicator, we fixed the measurement path to the square root of the estimated scale reliability (.80) in order to correct for measurement error (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0149206309352881">Williams &amp; Hazer, 1986</xref>). Some criticism exists regarding use of single-item measures, but researchers have found that the psychometric qualities of single-item measures compare favorably to those of multi-item measures and can demonstrate good reliability as well as face and predictive validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0149206309352881">Bergkvist &amp; Rossiter, 2007</xref>). Nevertheless, and since the literature is equivocal on appropriate estimates for intentions to quit, voluntary turnover, and absenteeism, we ran several alternative models, changing one estimate for each of these measures. Estimates of .70, .80, and .90 were used, and results indicated no reductions in model chi-square or omnibus fit indices. Moreover, all path estimates remained significant and did not materially change.</p>

<sec id="section17-0149206309352881">
<title>Voluntary turnover</title>
<p>This behavioral withdrawal outcome was evaluated with an indicator of voluntary turnover that was obtained 18 months after the administration of the survey. Organizational records were used to indicate whether employees were still with the organization (0) or had left voluntarily (1). This assessment of turnover represented a single indicator of the voluntary turnover construct and was assumed to be objective and without measurement error.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0149206309352881">
<title>Absenteeism</title>
<p>Absenteeism, a behavioral withdrawal outcome, was measured with a single item based on data from the focal organization’s records. It was measured in “sick time hours used” since administration of the survey and coincided with the time interval used for voluntary turnover. The measure was assumed to be perfectly reliable and without error.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0149206309352881">
<title>Analytic Procedures</title>
<p>Overall model fit was evaluated with four fit indices: the nonnormed fit index (NNFI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0149206309352881">Bentler &amp; Bonett, 1980</xref>), the comparative fit index (CFI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0149206309352881">Bentler, 1990</xref>), the incremental fit index (IFI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0149206309352881">Bollen, 1989</xref>), and the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0149206309352881">Browne &amp; Cudeck, 1992</xref>). Nested-model comparisons were examined by the sequential chi-square difference test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0149206309352881">James, Mulaik, &amp; Brett, 1982</xref>) as well as model CFI difference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0149206309352881">Widaman, 1985</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0149206309352881">Mathieu and Taylor’s (2006)</xref> protocol was used to examine the extent to which threat appraisal acts as a mediator within an organizational change context. The commonly used Sobel test was used to evaluate indirect effects.</p>
<p>To evaluate the extent to which positive change orientation moderates the relationship of change-related fairness to threat appraisal, we used moderated regression and the multisample procedure within the EQS program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0149206309352881">Bentler, 1995</xref>). The first step in the moderated regression was to create aggregated measures of positive change orientation, change-related fairness, and threat appraisal. For each of these three variables, a single measure was created by averaging the scores of their relevant construct indicators. After creating the three new variables, we derived an interaction term by multiplying positive change orientation by change-related fairness. Finally, a hierarchical multiple regression analysis was conducted in which threat appraisal was regressed on the two antecedents as well as the interaction term. For the multisample procedure we divided the data set on the median positive change orientation score (3.10), creating high (<italic>n</italic> = 78) and low (<italic>n</italic> = 75) positive change orientation subgroups. A model in which structural paths were free across the subgroups was then compared with one in which the path from change-related fairness to threat appraisal was constrained to be equivalent. Moderation is indicated if the constrained model chi-square differs significantly from the freely estimated model.</p>

<p>The baseline measurement model was then contrasted to alternative models to assess discriminant validity of the constructs. We contrasted the baseline model to a null latent confirmatory factor analysis model (which constrains the correlations among the latent variables to zero) and then to a single-factor model (which constrains latent variable correlations to be equal). Neither of the two constrained models improved on the baseline measurement model (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0149206309352881">Table 2</xref>). These tests provide important evidence of construct independence and allay concerns regarding latent construct intercorrelations (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0149206309352881">Table 3</xref>). Finally, we contrasted the baseline model to a model that constrained the change orientation and change-related fairness constructs to be equal. The chi-square difference test demonstrated that the constrained model, χ<sup>2</sup>(97, <italic>N</italic> = 153) = 167.89, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, NNFI = .87, CFI = .94, IFI = .94, RMSEA = .07, was a significantly worse fit relative to the baseline model, Δχ<sup>2</sup>(5, <italic>N</italic> = 153) = 20.38, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05. Overall, these results provide support for the convergent and discriminant validity of our measures.</p>

<p>Given that much of our data are self-reported, our results could in part be attributed to common method variance. Recent literature suggests method effects may be overstated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0149206309352881">Spector, 2006</xref>); nevertheless, we examined common method variance using a procedure recommended by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0149206309352881">Williams, Cote, and Buckley (1989)</xref>. To this end, we expanded the baseline measurement model by adding method factor paths onto all model variables that comprised multiple latent indicators. This combined model resulted in a good fit, χ<sup>2</sup>(79, <italic>N</italic> = 153) = 113.00, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05; NNFI = .95; CFI = .97; IFI = .97; RMSEA = .05, and the sequential chi-square difference test provided evidence of a significantly improved fit relative to the baseline measurement model: χ<sup>2</sup>(13, <italic>N</italic> = 153) = 37.51, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05. These results attest to the existence of method effects, but the amount of variance accounted for by method effects was very small—it averaged only 9%, and the median was 4%. This degree of variance accounted for is quite low compared with other studies that reported such statistics: 25% by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0149206309352881">Williams et al. (1989)</xref> and 11% by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0149206309352881">Carlson and Kacmar (2000)</xref>. The combination of these results with our use of data derived from alternative sources (company records) suggests that common method variance is not a material problem in this study.</p>

<title>Baseline Structural Model</title>
<p>An initial baseline structural model (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0149206309352881">Figure 3</xref>) was specified in order to test Hypotheses 1 through 5. Overall model fit, χ<sup>2</sup>(101, <italic>N</italic> = 153) = 168.83, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05; NNFI = .93; CFI = .95; IFI = .95; RMSEA = .06, together with resulting significant path coefficients, provided support for Hypotheses 1 through 5 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0149206309352881">Table 2</xref>). Specifically, both positive change orientation (−.42, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) and change-related fairness (−.44, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) were negatively related to threat appraisal. Threat appraisal also was associated with absenteeism (.24, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) and quit intentions (.43, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), which in turn predicted subsequent voluntary turnover (.20, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). This model served as a foundation for testing intervening effects.</p>

<title>Alternative Models</title>
<p>The baseline structural model was the starting point for investigating alternative structural models. Our first mediation test examined whether threat appraisal (<italic>m</italic>) would fully mediate the effect of positive change orientation (<italic>x</italic>) on quit intentions (<italic>y</italic>). The latent construct correlation between positive change orientation and quit intentions was significant (−.38, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0149206309352881">Table 3</xref>), thereby satisfying the condition of the existence of a total effect. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0149206309352881">Table 2</xref> shows that a revised model that included an added path from positive change orientation to quit intentions fit the data well but was not a significant improvement over the baseline model, Δχ<sup>2</sup>(1, <italic>N</italic> = 153) = .54, <italic>ns</italic>. Moreover, the added direct path from positive change orientation to quit intentions was not significant (.12, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05), although the indirect effect was significant (Sobel = 2.46, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). Together these results demonstrate that threat appraisal fully mediates the relationship between positive change orientation and quit intentions. We then assessed the extent to which threat appraisal mediates the effect of positive change orientation on absenteeism. The total effect was nonsignificant (−.14, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0149206309352881">Table 3</xref>), a revised model with an added path from positive change orientation to absenteeism was not an improvement on the baseline model (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0149206309352881">Table 2</xref>), and the indirect effect was nonsignificant (Sobel = 1.73, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05). These results suggest that threat appraisal does not operate as mediator between positive change orientation and absenteeism.</p>
<p>The next analysis examined whether threat appraisal mediated the relationship between perceptions of change-related fairness and intention to quit. First, the total effect between change-related fairness and quit intentions was significant (−.41, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0149206309352881">Table 3</xref>). Next, results demonstrate that a revised model that included an added path from change-related fairness to quit intentions did not improve on the baseline model (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0149206309352881">Table 2</xref>), the added direct path was not significant (−.09, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05), and the indirect effect was significant (Sobel = 2.67, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). These results reveal that threat appraisal fully mediates the relationship between change-related fairness and intentions to quit. Finally we assessed the extent to which threat appraisal mediated the relationship between fairness and absenteeism. Results indicate that (a) there was a nonsignificant total effect between the two constructs fairness and absenteeism (−.06, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0149206309352881">Table 3</xref>), (b) a model including a direct path from fairness to absenteeism did not improve on the baseline model fit (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0149206309352881">Table 2</xref>), and (c) the added path was nonsignificant (.13, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05). However, in this instance the indirect effect of change-related fairness on absenteeism was significant (Sobel = 2.29, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05); thus the relationship between change-related fairness and absenteeism is indirect only, operating through threat appraisal.</p>
<p>Results from the moderated regression indicated that both positive change orientation and change-related fairness were significant predictors of threat appraisal, but the interaction term was nonsignificant (<italic>t</italic> = 1.02, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05). Similarly, the multisampling procedure revealed a nonsignificant chi-square difference, χ<sup>2</sup>(2, <italic>N</italic> = 153) = 2.54, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05, between the constrained model, χ<sup>2</sup>(128, <italic>N</italic> = 153) = 171.47, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, and the freely estimated model, χ<sup>2</sup>(126, <italic>N</italic> = 153) = 168.93, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05. Together these findings suggest that positive change orientation does not moderate the relationship between change-related fairness and threat appraisal.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The primary goal of this research was to investigate the effects of key person and contextual predictors of employees’ threat appraisal and in turn their relationship with three forms of employee withdrawal. Results overwhelmingly support our conceptual framework and provide significant insights into how managers might more effectively implement organizational change. Specifically, our findings uncover one set of malleable predictors of threat appraisal (i.e., positive change orientation and change-related fairness) that can be used to help ameliorate the negative effects of organizational change on employee withdrawal, thereby improving employee retention and reducing the direct and indirect costs of employee withdrawal. At the same time, our results also have theoretical implications for research on organizational change and employee withdrawal. We now consider the implications of these findings for theory and practice.</p>
<sec id="section25-0149206309352881">
<title>Implications for Theory and Practice</title>
<p>This study informs the transactional approach to threat appraisal in a field setting, which demonstrates the utility of a theory that is rarely used in this context. It also helps answer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0149206309352881">Lazarus and Folkman’s (1984)</xref> call to determine relevant antecedents of appraisal in order to develop its theoretical and practical potential. For instance, findings confirm the prediction that a positive change orientation is an important antecedent that captures how employees relate and react to organizational change. This finding also lends theoretical and empirical evidence for the value of statelike individual characteristics and supports recent research in positive organizational behavior and positive psychological capital (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0149206309352881">Luthans et al., 2007</xref>). Constructs in this vein of research are capacities that can be measured, developed, and managed. As such, the malleability or statelike nature of positive organizational behavior constructs (e.g., positive change orientation) show promise for both explaining why and managing how individuals respond to organizational change. One potential implication is that neither individual employees nor their employers are “limited” by the inherent stability of more commonly studied individual dispositions.</p>
<p>Because the facets of positive change orientation are statelike (i.e., amenable to change), they provide managers with a mechanism to more effectively manage employees’ resistance to change. For example, managers can draw from the vast literatures and practices that outline ways to modify individual self-efficacy (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0149206309352881">Bandura, 1977</xref>), change-related attitudes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0149206309352881">Vakola, Tsaousis, &amp; Nikolaou, 2004</xref>), and perceived control (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0149206309352881">Neves &amp; Caetano, 2006</xref>), to enhance employees’ positive change orientation. Doing so provides managers with a vehicle to capitalize on the existing strengths of employees and to devise ways of enhancing positive change orientation when it is lacking. Change self-efficacy, for instance, can be fostered by clarifying roles in the new, restructured environment and by creating wins for employees in the process (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0149206309352881">Bandura, 1977</xref>). Managers also might provide employees a voice in planning change (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0149206309352881">Korsgaard et al., 2002</xref>) and allow them to participate in the change process itself (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0149206309352881">Wanberg &amp; Banas, 2000</xref>), both of which have been shown to increase perceptions of control and to foster more positive employee reactions and attitudes toward change. Communication can shape attitudes, as well as change efficacy and perceived control. We thus encourage managers to provide justification for implementing change, to clarify individual roles during and after the change process, to explain how changes will occur, and to discuss the consequences for supporting or not supporting change initiatives (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0149206309352881">Jimmieson et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Results support the prediction that change-related fairness is an important determinant of employees’ reactions to organizational change, thereby confirming the generalizability of fairness research within the context of organizational change (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0149206309352881">Folger &amp; Skarlicki, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0149206309352881">Kernan &amp; Hanges, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0149206309352881">Korsgaard et al., 2002</xref>). Results also empirically support fairness heuristic theory and fill a void noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0149206309352881">Van den Bos and Lind (2004)</xref>. They concluded that their conceptualization of fairness heuristic theory was largely motivated by the absence of research related to the cognitive and contextual components of fairness that may explain why and how fairness affects relevant outcomes. This study informs this issue as it shows that fairness is associated with employees’ threat appraisals, which in turn mediate the effects of fairness on employee withdrawal. In so doing, this study addresses both the why and the how by illuminating the intervening process between fairness and change-related outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0149206309352881">Konovsky, 2000</xref>). Furthermore, the organizational change context of this study supports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0149206309352881">Van den Bos and Lind’s (2004)</xref> contention that “fairness and justice are especially important in times of turmoil” (p. 266). As such, these results also have implications for the management of change.</p>
<p>Organizations implementing change can monitor employee threat appraisals to determine which aspects of the changes are problematic or threatening. This knowledge then can guide the allocation of resources to proactively avert unwanted consequences (e.g., voluntary turnover). Moreover, because both antecedents asserted comparable influence on employees’ threat appraisals of change—their respective path coefficients were very similar—change management initiatives can fruitfully focus on either or both. While this is a simple recommendation, the implication is powerful, as it is more positive and contrasts with past organizational change research. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0149206309352881">Wanberg and Banas (2000)</xref> claimed that situation factors are especially important elements for managing organizational change as they are more malleable than are personal dispositional characteristics. Although this may be true of the dispositions typically studied in previous research (e.g., personality; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0149206309352881">Judge, Thoresen, Pucik, &amp; Welbourne, 1999</xref>), positive change orientation is statelike and more malleable. As such, it too is amenable to development and is consistent with the facets of change-related fairness that provide management additional means with which to influence employees’ reactions to change. For instance, involving employees in the change process and treating employees with respect and consideration all can enhance employees’ perceptions of fairness and thus reduce threat appraisals and withdrawal. Therefore, proactively focusing on employees’ perceptions of fairness and their positive change orientation are complementary tools that managers can use to increase the probability of effectively implementing change.</p>
<p>Turning our attention to the outcome side of threat appraisal, results reveal that employee threat appraisals are a valuable predictor of undesirable organizational change outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0149206309352881">Spreitzer &amp; Mishra, 2002</xref>). For instance, threat appraisal transfers the effect (i.e., fully mediates) of both positive change orientation and change-related fairness to intentions to quit and voluntary turnover. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0149206309352881">Lee and Mitchell (1994)</xref> provide conceptual support for these findings in their unfolding model of turnover. Central to their model is the concept of shocks (i.e., disruptions to the status quo) that are the starting point of an unfolding decision-making cascade that culminates in voluntary turnover. We argue that perhaps threat appraisals are an unexamined cognitive component of the unfolding model, wherein certain shocks precipitate threat appraisals that are consequential to subsequent turnover intentions and behaviors. Therefore, our findings are consistent with and expand existing turnover theory, as threat appraisals are a key predictor of these outcomes in this context. We encourage future researchers to examine these assertions, for such research can serve to integrate the appraisal and turnover literatures.</p>
<p>Results also reveal differential intervening effects for threat appraisal on absenteeism. Positive change orientation exhibited no relationship with absenteeism, but change-related fairness showed an indirect effect transferred through threat appraisal. The implication is that threat appraisal is critical to these relationships, as in the former it accounts for all of the variance in absenteeism and in the latter it accounts for part of the variance. These results imply that management would be best served by addressing issues of fairness to abate absenteeism, rather than enhancing employees’ positive change orientation as described above for mitigating intentions to quit and turnover. This contribution notwithstanding, it still is necessary to explain the lack of relationship between positive change orientation and absenteeism. In other words, why were the effects for the two antecedents different? <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0149206309352881">Mathieu and Taylor (2006)</xref>, citing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0149206309352881">MacKinnon, Lockwood, Hoffman, West, and Sheets (2002)</xref>, offer a plausible explanation. The argument is that other variables, possibly the mediator (threat appraisal), contaminate or suppress the relationship. This can be the result of opposite sign relationships between variables in the causal chain: The antecedents are negatively related to threat appraisal, which is positively related to the withdrawal outcomes. We tested for this possibility and evaluated partial correlations between positive change orientation and absenteeism, controlling for threat appraisal. Results revealed virtually no change (<italic>r</italic> = .05, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .10) and, when combined with our previous analyses of direct effects, led us to conclude that a suppressor effect of threat appraisal was not the underlying reason for the differential effects on absenteeism. We thus encourage future researchers to validate our findings using different samples and appropriate analytical techniques. In any event, results of the current study highlight the importance of applying more detailed and rigorous tests of intervening effects, as called for by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0149206309352881">Mathieu and Taylor (2006)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0149206309352881">James et al. (2006)</xref>.</p>

<title>Limitations and Future Research</title>
<p>Several limitations of this study should be considered despite the numerous contributions to research and practice previously discussed. First, we investigated only two antecedent constructs. Undoubtedly, other variables contribute to threat appraisals during organizational restructurings. We encourage future researchers to choose and explore not only other contextually relevant antecedents but those that also are malleable or statelike. Second, we examined one particular type of restructuring; thus our findings have limited generalizability across other change contexts. We suggest that future research examine the relative strength of person and contextual factors in other forms of organizational change. Third, we studied only threat appraisals. Research and practice would benefit from the investigation of other types of appraisal (e.g., harm and challenge). Fourth, both research and practice would benefit from the identification of additional outcomes of threat appraisal besides withdrawal (e.g., performance). Finally, future researchers are encouraged to use results of this study as a foundation to investigate the effects of more granular predictors (e.g., individual differences and forms of justice) on more specific employee appraisals. For example, <italic>negative affectivity</italic> is a stable individual difference characteristic that could potentially influence employees’ reactions to change (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0149206309352881">Mak &amp; Mueller, 2001</xref>). We conducted post hoc regression analyses as a preliminary investigation of this possibility and found that both positive change orientation and change-related fairness contributed significant variance above and beyond negative affectivity.</p>

<title>Contributions and Conclusions</title>
<p>This study makes several contributions to theory. Results show that employee threat appraisal is an important explanatory factor of employee behavior in the context of change, and it also helps explain variation in individuals’ experience and reaction to the same change event. Threat appraisal helps answer the question, Why do some employees quit because of change and others don’t? The current results reveal that employee’s threat appraisal is part of the answer. In so doing, this study lays the foundation for the integration of the health and psychology literatures with those of industrial psychology and management, as it demonstrates the applicability of appraisal theory to adults in organizational settings (vs. students in labs). The current study also provides important and new insights for turnover theory and research. One implication is that appraisal is an important proximal precursor to conventional withdrawal cognitions included in Hom’s seminal theory of turnover (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0149206309352881">Hom &amp; Griffeth, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0149206309352881">Hom &amp; Kinicki, 2001</xref>). Specifically, we suspect threat appraisal mediates the relationships between various antecedents (e.g., interrole conflict and job avoidance) and intentions and behaviors in Hom’s work.</p>
