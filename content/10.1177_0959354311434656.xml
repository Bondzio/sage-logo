<abstract>
<p><italic>The inference from order to quantity</italic> is fundamental to psychometrics because the sorts of attributes that psychometricians aspire to measure are experienced directly only as ordered and, yet, it is concluded that such attributes are measurable on interval scales (i.e., that they are quantitative). This inference has been a feature of psychometrics since early last century, before which it permeated scientific thought and played a role in the development of psychophysics. Despite this, its cogency has been analysed only rarely. Elsewhere, I have argued that it is not deductively valid, a point that might be considered obvious except that attempts have been made to show otherwise. Its invalidity displayed, it is easily shown that it is not inductively reasonable either. However, it might still be urged that the inference from order to quantity is an inference to the best explanation: that is, that quantitative structure is reasonably abduced from order. I argue that the opposite is true: the most plausible hypothesis is that the sorts of attributes psychometricians aspire to measure are merely ordinal attributes with impure differences of degree, a feature logically incompatible with quantitative structure. If so, psychometrics is built upon a myth.</p>

<p>Psychometrics is based upon the presupposition that it is reasonable to think that psychological attributes (abilities, traits, attitudes, etc.) are measurable. In turn, this presupposition is supported by props such as Stevens’ definition of measurement as “the assignment of numerals to objects or events according to rules” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0959354311434656">Stevens, 1951</xref>, p.1), which is still accepted within the discipline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0959354311434656">Michell, 1990</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0959354311434656">Michell, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0959354311434656">2007b</xref>). This definition only became orthodoxy during the 1950s. Before then, other props were used, such as the tenet that it is reasonable to infer that an attribute must be quantitative from the premise that it is ordinal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0959354311434656">Michell, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0959354311434656">2007a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0959354311434656">2009a</xref>). This is <italic>the inference from order to quantity</italic>.</p>
<p>Psychometrics began with the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0959354311434656">Spearman (1904)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0959354311434656">Binet and Simon (1905/1916)</xref> on mental testing. The rhetoric of measurement infused its discourse, shaping central concepts such as <italic>reliability</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0959354311434656">Spearman, 1910</xref>) and <italic>validity</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0959354311434656">Courtis, 1921</xref>). While a minority questioned the identification of testing with measurement (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959354311434656">Boring, 1920</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0959354311434656">Brown, 1934</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0959354311434656">Johnson, 1936</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0959354311434656">Smith, 1938</xref>), the mainstream was convinced that “mental tests measure something” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0959354311434656">Kelley, 1929</xref>, p. 86). “The level of measurement most often specified in mental test theory is <italic>interval measurement</italic>, which yields an <italic>interval scale</italic>” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0959354311434656">Lord &amp; Novick, 1968</xref>, p. 21), and it is often claimed that “the vast majority of psychological tests measuring intelligence, ability, personality and motivation … are interval scales” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0959354311434656">Kline, 2000</xref>, p. 18). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0959354311434656">Stevens (1946)</xref> coined the term <italic>interval scale</italic>, but the concept existed from the 19th century, when a consensus formed that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0959354311434656">Fechner’s (1860/1966)</xref> methods measured <italic>intervals</italic> between sensation intensities rather than these intensities themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0959354311434656">Titchener, 1905</xref>). After <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0959354311434656">Spearman (1904)</xref>, the view that psychological measurement is interval scaling dominated (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0959354311434656">Kelley, 1923</xref>), although the term <italic>interval scale</italic> was not used until mid-century.</p>
<p>This view is not trivial. An interval scale has a fixed unit, but an arbitrarily located zero. The paradigm examples are the Celsius and Fahrenheit scales. <italic>0º C</italic> is the same temperature as <italic>32º F</italic>. Each scale has its own unit, a difference of <italic>1º C</italic> equalling one of <italic>1.8º F</italic>. Furthermore, a temperature difference of <italic>1º C</italic> is the same magnitude everywhere on the scale, and the same is true for a difference of <italic>1º F</italic>. Within each scale, any temperature <italic>difference</italic> is <italic>r</italic> times any other, where <italic>r</italic> is a positive real number. This is true because with any interval scale, intervals between degrees are measured on a ratio scale. (Throughout this paper, the term <italic>degree</italic> is used to refer to any specific level on an attribute; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0959354311434656">Engel, 1989</xref>.) An attribute can only be measured on an interval scale if differences between its degrees stand in ratios to one another. This indicates a definite kind of structure, one aptly called <italic>quantitative</italic>.</p>
<p>In that respect, interval and ordinal scales differ. Degrees of the latter are ordered, but discrete differences between degrees are neither ordered nor measured. The paradigm example is Mohs’ hardness scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0959354311434656">Jerrard &amp; McNeill, 1992</xref>), where a scratch test establishes whether one mineral is harder than another, but nothing is known about whether the difference in hardness between any two minerals with adjacent scale values, say, talc (1 on Mohs’ scale) and gypsum (2), is greater than, equal to, or less than that between any other adjacent pair, say, feldspar (6) and quartz (7). It may be that hardness actually is quantitative, but we are ignorant of quantitative relations between differences; or it may be that hardness is a merely ordinal attribute, one in which discrete differences really are unordered.</p>
<p>This distinction is important because it is clear that the kinds of attributes psychologists claim to be able to measure, such as the various intellectual abilities, are only experienced as ordered. For example, an unequivocal order relation is only ever observed when one person gets correct all items that another person passes and more besides, and what is then observed is simply that the first person <italic>performs more ably than</italic> the other. That is, order relations between degrees of ability are all that can be directly observed in optimal circumstances. Quantitative relations between ability differences are never observed. Ratios between differences may be inferred via psychometric theories, but such inferences are only sound <italic>if</italic> the theory used is true.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there is no hard evidence that psychological attributes are quantitative, only an unswerving tendency to see attributes experienced as ordinal as if latently quantitative. This way of looking at ordinal attributes existed before testing emerged. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959354311434656">De Morgan (1836)</xref> considered that any attribute that could be “made <italic>more</italic> or <italic>less</italic>” (p. 2) is quantitative, or, as he later put it, “we know that whenever we can attach a distinct conception of more and less to different instances, so as to say this has more than that, we are talking of comparable magnitudes” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959354311434656">De Morgan, 1847</xref>, p. 174). Opinion leaders in other disciplines concurred (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0959354311434656">Jevons, 1871</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0959354311434656">von Helmholtz, 1887/1971</xref>), as did <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0959354311434656">Fechner (1860/1966)</xref>, who reasoned that because we can discern ordinal differences in the intensity of mental processes, such intensities must be quantitative. Fechner’s claims to have measured the intensity of sensation were contested, but few went as far as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0959354311434656">von Kries’s (1882)</xref> <italic>quantity objection</italic>, which was that sensation intensities are not quantitative. Instead, a consensus emerged, sustained by “the <italic>constantly recurring argument</italic> [emphasis added] that <italic>S</italic> [stimulus intensity] must be measurable … because we can speak intelligently and intelligibly of ‘more’ and ‘less’ of it” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0959354311434656">Titchener, 1905</xref>, p. lxiii).</p>
<p>Early psychometricians, such as Spearman, moved into psychometrics from psychophysics, bringing this inference pattern, which was also sustained by dogmas such as Thorndike’s <italic>credo</italic> that “[w]hatever exists at all exists in some amount. To know it thoroughly involves knowing its quantity as well as its quality” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0959354311434656">Thorndike, 1918</xref>, p. 16). Thorndike’s students, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0959354311434656">McCall (1922)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0959354311434656">Kelley (1923)</xref>, also did their best to ensure that the inference from order to quantity constantly recurred. Similarly, when inaugurating attitude measurement, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0959354311434656">Thurstone (1928/1959)</xref> wrote,</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>We may say about a man, for example, that he is more in favor of prohibition than some other, and the judgment conveys its meaning very well with the implication of a linear scale along which people or opinions might be allocated … . (p. 219)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This echoed the chorus that an ordinal relation implies an underlying interval scale. Later, overt endorsement of the inference from order to quantity became the exception, but only because by then it was so widely taken for granted.</p>
<p>Perhaps because they are loath to emphasize that their observational base is merely a set of order relations, psychometricians rarely acknowledged that an inference is involved in moving from this ordinal base to quantity. The ordinal database of psychometrics is typically seen as a degraded manifestation of latent quantities, and theorizing begins from that premise. Consequently, psychometrics emphasizes quantitative, as opposed to merely ordinal, theories. Such an approach only makes sense if we assume that inferences from order to quantity are implicit. However, while this inference underpins their theories, practices, and rhetoric, psychometricians have made no attempt to investigate its reasonableness. This is my aim, and I begin with general observations on the sorts of inferences that are said by logicians to be reasonable.</p>
<sec id="section1-0959354311434656">
<title>Reasonable inference: Deduction, induction, and abduction</title>
<p>An inference occurs whenever something is taken to be true (the <italic>conclusion</italic>) merely on the basis of believing something else (the <italic>premise</italic>). Deductive inference is an obvious case, for then the premise entails the conclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0959354311434656">Marcus, 1995</xref>). For example, <italic>all</italic> of the apples in the barrel being rotten, when I select one, <italic>its</italic> rottenness is logically entailed. Deductive inference preserves truth: if the premise is true, then the conclusion <italic>must be</italic> as well. This provides a clear-cut test: if in any inference there is room for the possibility that the conclusion is false when the premise is true, then the inference is not deductive.</p>
<p>Clearly, not every inference is deductive. Leaping to conclusions unreasonably is often the stuff of tragedy. However, it is thought that even when an inference is not deductive, it may still be <italic>reasonable</italic> in the sense that the premise provides good, but inconclusive, support for the conclusion. This is a controversial topic, and it is enough here to note that some logicians and philosophers hold that two other forms of inference are sometimes reasonable, namely, <italic>inductive</italic> and <italic>abductive</italic>.</p>
<p>While terminology is not standardized, in this paper, <italic>inductive inference</italic> means one in which the premise is of the form <italic>some Xs are Y</italic> (e.g., <italic>all Xs so far observed are Y</italic>), and the conclusion of the form <italic>all X are Y</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0959354311434656">Cohen, 1995</xref>). In inductive inference, the truth of the premise does not ensure that of the conclusion. Even though all of the apples so far observed in the barrel are rotten, it could still happen that some of the apples in the barrel are not. All the apples so far observed might be rotten because they all also contain worms. Then, the premise would actually be that <italic>some worm-infested apples are rotten</italic> (because <italic>all worm-infested apples so far observed in the barrel are rotten</italic>), in which case concluding that <italic>all apples in the barrel are rotten</italic> would be unreasonable. When making inductive inferences, we need to look out for other features common to all of the <italic>X</italic>s so far observed, because if any are present, an unqualified inductive inference is unreasonable.</p>
<p>Abductive inferences are not easily characterized formally, but a clue to their character is given by the fact that they are called <italic>inferences to the best explanation</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0959354311434656">Hookway, 1995</xref>). This is the sort of inference that detectives make when all available evidence points to just one suspect; the sort used in solving crossword puzzles when clues point to just one word; and it is said by philosophers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0959354311434656">Haack, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0959354311434656">McMullin, 1992</xref>) to be the kind used in science when a theory is adjudged true because it provides the <italic>best</italic> explanation of relevant phenomena. Such a view is beset by unresolved issues, not the least of which is the ambiguity of <italic>best</italic>. However, were the inference from order to quantity to count as a reasonable abduction, a necessary condition would be that the hypothesis that all ordered attributes are quantitative must be a more plausible explanation of an attribute’s ordinal structure than any alternative.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0959354311434656">
<title>Is the inference from order to quantity deductively valid?</title>
<p>This is a question answered in detail elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0959354311434656">Michell, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0959354311434656">2007a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0959354311434656">2009b</xref>) and thus only sketched here. At least two philosophers have argued that the inference is deductively valid: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0959354311434656">Bergson (1913)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0959354311434656">Bradley (1895)</xref>. The way in which each argued from order to quantity is remarkably similar and may reflect the existence of an earlier argument (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0959354311434656">Michell, 2007a</xref>). Their common thread is as follows: Let <italic>x, y</italic>, and <italic>z</italic> be any three degrees of an ordered attribute, <italic>A</italic>, such that <italic>x &gt; y &gt; z</italic> (where <italic>&gt;</italic> means <italic>greater than</italic> in the relevant sense); since <italic>x &gt; y</italic>, the difference between <italic>x</italic> and <italic>y</italic> must exist; calling this difference <italic>x – y</italic>, it is clear that <italic>x</italic> must be entirely composed of two discrete parts, <italic>y</italic> and <italic>x – y</italic>: that is, <italic>x = y + (x – y)</italic>; thus, <italic>x</italic> is an additive sum of parts and, likewise, each degree of <italic>A</italic> is an additive sum of parts (e.g., <italic>y = z + (y – z)</italic> and so on); therefore, the ordered attribute, <italic>A</italic>, is quantitative. Hence, order entails quantity. But this argument is not deductive, only highly seductive.</p>
<p>Its allure increases if we think, as Bergson said we must, by analogy with length. If we think of the degrees of attribute <italic>A</italic> as corresponding to points on a straight line, then we seem to see that <italic>x = y + (x – y)</italic> and so on. Such geometric analogies have been second nature to scientists for centuries (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0959354311434656">Clagett, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0959354311434656">Franklin, 2000</xref>), lubricating the inference from order to quantity. However, its invalidity is apparent when analysed more closely.</p>
<p>The argument assumes that differences between degrees are like intervals between points on a straight line and conclusions are then drawn about the relationships between these differences. However, relationships between these differences are actually of two kinds. Consider differences between <italic>x</italic> and <italic>y</italic> and between <italic>x</italic> and <italic>z</italic>, when <italic>x &gt; y &gt; z</italic>. The difference between <italic>x</italic> and <italic>y</italic> is <italic>nested within</italic> that between <italic>x</italic> and <italic>z</italic>, in the sense that the latter contains the former as a part. Conversely, the difference between <italic>x</italic> and <italic>y</italic> is not nested within the difference between <italic>y</italic> and <italic>z</italic>. These are discrete differences. It follows that with any ordered attribute, some pairs of differences between degrees are <italic>nested pairs</italic> and some pairs of differences between degrees are <italic>non-nested pairs</italic>. The latter kind includes not only discrete pairs, but also overlapping pairs, such as the differences between <italic>w</italic> and <italic>y</italic> and between <italic>x</italic> and <italic>z</italic>, when <italic>w &gt; x &gt; y &gt; z</italic>.</p>
<p>An attribute is quantitative if and only if the set of relations between these pairs of differences satisfies certain conditions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0959354311434656">Hölder (1901)</xref> characterized quantitative structure and displayed its equivalence to a structure based upon relations between pairs of differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0959354311434656">Michell &amp; Ernst, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0959354311434656">1997</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0959354311434656">Krantz, Luce, Suppes, and Tversky (1971)</xref> expressed the matter in terms of order relations between differences. Condensing their conclusion and putting it informally, an attribute is quantitative (i.e., measurable on an interval scale at least) if and only if (a) all pairs of differences between degrees are ordered (i.e., within each pair of differences, one difference is always greater than, less than, or equal to the other) and (b) this order on pairs of differences is analogous to an ordering upon intervals between points on a straight line.</p>
<p>Condition (b) means that not just any ordering on pairs of differences will do; it must be like that between intervals on a straight line. For example, if the degrees, <italic>u, v, w, x, y</italic>, and <italic>z</italic> are such that <italic>u &gt; v &gt; w</italic> and <italic>x &gt; y &gt; z</italic>, then if the difference between <italic>u</italic> and <italic>v</italic> is greater than that between <italic>x</italic> and <italic>y</italic>, and the difference between <italic>v</italic> and <italic>w</italic> is greater than that between <italic>y</italic> and <italic>z</italic>, the difference between <italic>u</italic> and <italic>w</italic> must be greater than that between <italic>x</italic> and <italic>z</italic> because that is how analogous intervals between points on a straight line would interrelate. Otherwise, the attribute is not quantitative.</p>
<p>Now, if the degrees of an attribute are ordered, then for all nested pairs of differences between degrees, order relations between those differences are entailed. For example, if <italic>x &gt; y &gt; z</italic>, then the difference between <italic>x</italic> and <italic>z</italic> must be greater than that between <italic>x</italic> and <italic>y</italic>. However, from the fact that the degrees are ordered, nothing follows regarding the order relations between non-nested pairs of differences. For example, nothing follows about the order relation between the difference between <italic>x</italic> and <italic>y</italic> and that between <italic>y</italic> and <italic>z</italic>. Indeed, it does not even follow that such pairs of differences must be ordered at all. If nothing follows about the order relations between non-nested pairs of differences, then it is possible that these relations could be unlike those between intervals on a straight line. Then the attribute could not be quantitative. Thus, the fact that the degrees of an attribute are ordered does not entail that the attribute is quantitative. The inference from order to quantity is not a valid deduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0959354311434656">Michell, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0959354311434656">2009b</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0959354311434656">
<title>Is the inference from order to quantity inductively reasonable?</title>
<p>Given this analysis, it also follows that the inference from order to quantity is not inductively reasonable. If the degrees of an attribute are ordered, then it follows that order relations between nested pairs of differences are like order relations between nested pairs of intervals on a straight line. Since, in the case of an ordinal attribute, the order relations between nested pairs of differences are the only relations between pairs of differences that we know about, is it reasonable to conclude, by induction, that <italic>all</italic> order relations between pairs of differences between degrees are like order relations between intervals on a straight line? The answer is <italic>no</italic>, simply because all of the order relations that we know about share a common feature (namely, they involve nested pairs of differences), one not shared by all other relations between pairs of differences between degrees. Thus, the inference from order to quantity is not inductively reasonable.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0959354311434656">
<title>Is the inference from order to quantity abductively reasonable?</title>
<p>The hypothesis that an attribute is quantitative explains its being ordered, so it seems possible that some form of abduction may sustain the inference from order to quantity. Furthermore, if an attribute is quantitative, further advantages ensue, for “number is, of all conceptions, the easiest to operate with” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0959354311434656">Russell, 1983</xref>, p. 301). Number occurs in two natural contexts: first, with discrete quantities, which are numerically ascertained by counting; and, second, with continuous quantities, which are numerically estimated by measurement. So in proposing to explain an observed order by postulating a latent quantitative attribute (which, by analogy with the measurable attributes of physics, is typically supposed to be continuous), the prospect is raised of applications of theorems concerning real numbers and associated techniques. Of course, an observed order could also be coded numerically (giving rise to an ordinal scale), but numerically coding ordinal relationships cannot contribute further structure to the attribute involved and, so, in such cases, the range of valid applications of arithmetic is severely limited and does not represent much of an advantage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0959354311434656">Michell, 1986</xref>). In terms of the arithmetical rewards to be accrued, quantity beats mere order hands down every time.</p>
<p>These advantages, however, are a consequence of something deeper, namely, the homogeneity of quantitative attributes. This was indicated earlier in noting that a temperature difference of 1º C is the same magnitude everywhere along the range of the attribute. Homogeneity was recognized by Euclid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0959354311434656">Mueller, 1981</xref>) and, properly understood, it means not just that a difference equal to the unit exists in relation to each degree of the attribute, but that a difference of any specified magnitude exists in relation to each degree. Furthermore, it is more general, in the sense that not just differences but other structural relations obtaining in relation to any degree of the attribute exist in relation to all degrees. For example, if, starting at any arbitrary degree, it is found that one difference plus another equals a third, then that same relationship between differences holds in relation to each degree of the attribute.</p>
<p>The qualitative homogeneity of quantitative attributes also raises the possibility that relationships between different quantitative attributes can be captured in quantitative equations. In quantitative physics, a network of equations (such as density equals the ratio of mass to volume) binds the set of measurable attributes together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0959354311434656">Krantz et al., 1971</xref>). Some of these reflect causal relations, raising the possibility of uniform explanations across the entire range of the attribute. If length is taken as an example, the point can be illustrated quite simply in that an increase in length of, say, one metre is exactly the same increase whatever length it supplements and, so, if the aim is to explain an increase of just one metre in length, then it is the same effect that is to be explained in every case.</p>
<p>This shows that attempting to explain an observed order by postulating an underlying quantitative attribute has the potential for explanatory advantages. However, is it reasonable to treat the concept of a quantitative attribute as a self-contained package that can be imposed upon any observed order? Scientific investigation aims to <italic>find</italic> hidden structures, not to <italic>impose</italic> upon nature structures that we desire. Advantages supposedly deriving from the hypothesis of quantitative structure will be illusory if quantitative structure is not present in the relevant attribute. Such advantages can only be reasonably expected in cases where the observed order derives from a real, but possibly hidden, quantitative structure.</p>
<p>Many attributes admit degrees, not just those known to be quantitative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0959354311434656">Engel, 1989</xref>), and degree words are a pervasive feature of everyday discourse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0959354311434656">Bolinger, 1972</xref>). For example, arguments may be <italic>more or less rigorous</italic>, and in considering a set of arguments, we might find them ordered, at least partly, according to degree of rigour. Or, operating procedures may be <italic>more or less efficient</italic> ways of doing something; pencil sketches may be <italic>more or less life-like</italic>; songs, <italic>more or less romantic</italic>; prisons, <italic>more or less secure</italic>; legal determinations, <italic>more or less just</italic>; and so on. There are indefinitely many concepts to which degree words apply. Is it plausible to suggest that in each case the ordering involved would be explained best by proposing a latent quantitative attribute?</p>
<p>Just because concepts like temperature, which were first experienced only as matters of degree, were later shown to be quantitative, it does not follow that all concepts admitting degrees are quantitative. Thinking so would be neither a reasonable induction, because most concepts admitting degrees have not yet been found to be quantitative, nor would it be a reasonable abduction if it is possible that some ordered attributes are not quantitative. However, could we ever know that an ordered attribute is not quantitative?</p>
<p>This is the same as asking whether an ordered attribute could possess discernible features incompatible with quantitative structure. Some scholars have thought that “the nonmeasurability of something that observably admits of more and less is never known to us to be an intrinsic character of it” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0959354311434656">Ducasse, 1941</xref>, p. 42), but others have disagreed, claiming that some ordered attributes are such that the character of their structure <italic>rules out the possibility</italic> of being quantitative. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0959354311434656">Keynes (1921)</xref> said, “Objects can be arranged in an order, which we can reasonably call one of degree … without its being possible to conceive a system of measurement of the differences between the individuals” (p. 21). What character could an ordered attribute possess that would make it <italic>not possible to conceive</italic> of its being quantitative?</p>
<p>The context of Keynes’s comment was an exposition of what has become known as the <italic>logical relation concept of probability</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0959354311434656">Mackie, 1973</xref>). Keynes asked whether probabilities in this sense are measurable quantities, and concluded that</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>[a] degree of probability is not composed of some homogeneous material, and is not apparently divisible into parts of like character with one another. An assertion, that the magnitude of a given probability is in a numerical ratio to the magnitude of every other, seems, therefore … to be altogether devoid of the kind of support, which can be usually supplied in the case of quantities of which the mensurability is not open to denial. (pp. 30–31)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>He thought that if degrees of some attribute are not “composed of some homogeneous material” and not “divisible into parts of like character with one another,” then there are no “measurable relations of distance” (p. 37) between the degrees and, so, the attribute cannot be quantitative. He was not alone in thinking that it was possible for ordinal structure to be incompatible with quantitative structure, for in this he was influenced by von Kries’s writings on probability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0959354311434656">Fioretti, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0959354311434656">Heidelberger, 2004</xref>), which reapplied an idea von Kries had used to criticize psychophysical measurement. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0959354311434656">Von Kries (1882)</xref> argued that within any increasing series of sensations of the same sort, “one increment is something quite different from the other; … they admit of no comparison” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0959354311434656">Niall, 1995</xref>, p. 291). His objection to Fechner’s psychophysics was that within any modality, the differences between degrees of sensation intensity are heterogeneous, which entails that they do not differ quantitatively, but only qualitatively, and, so, cannot be measured.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0959354311434656">R.G. Collingwood (1933)</xref> illustrated this point as follows:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>As I move my hand nearer to the fire, I feel it grow hotter; but every increase in the heat I feel is also a change in the kind of feeling I experience; from a faint warmth through a decided warmth it passes to a definite heat, first pleasant, then dully painful, then sharply painful; the heat at one degree soothes me, at another excites me, at another torments me. I can detect as many differences in kind as I can detect differences in degree; and these are not two sets of differences but one single set. I can call them differences in degree if I like, but I am using the word in a special sense, a sense in which differences of degree not merely entail, but actually are, differences of kind. (pp. 72-73)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Observing that differences between these various sensations “are differences of a peculiar type, which are differences at once in degree and kind” (p. 73), Collingwood concluded, “This is why they cannot be measured, for measurement applies only to pure differences of degree” (p. 73). By “pure differences of degree,” he meant those that are not also differences in kind. In other words, he noted that a necessary condition for an ordinal attribute to be quantitative is that <italic>the differences between its degrees be completely mutually homogeneous</italic>. That is, heterogeneity of differences between degrees (giving what we might call, following Collingwood’s lead, “impure differences of degree”) of some ordinal attribute constitutes intrinsic non-quantitativeness and, thus, intrinsic non-measurability. Impure differences of degree, because they differ in kind, are not intrinsically ordered. As noted above, quantitative structure requires not only that degrees of the relevant attribute be ordered, but also that differences between its degrees also be ordered. If the differences between degrees are not orderable, it follows that the attribute cannot be quantitative.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0959354311434656">Ducasse (1941)</xref>, disputed the cogency of Collingwood’s example, remarking that the fact</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>[t]hat the feeling of warmth at certain intensities is accompanied, e.g., by pleasure, and at other intensities by pain, shows that other feelings, connected with the feeling of warmth, change at certain intensities of the feeling of warmth, but it does not in the least show that the feeling of warmth itself, at any intensity becomes qualitatively different from itself. (p. 43)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>However, even if Ducasse is right and the feelings involved are decomposable, his objection misses Collingwood’s logical point, which applies to the series of feelings as such and not necessarily to any parts into which they might be analysed. The sensations that Collingwood describes are, indeed, complex, but as such they also constitute an ordered series in which differences, because of that very complexity, are heterogeneous and, so, constitute a non-quantitative attribute.</p>
<p>Hierarchies of concepts, in which each succeeding concept is more general than the preceding one, provide a clearer illustration. For example, because all humans are primates, all primates are mammals, all mammals are vertebrates, and all vertebrates are animals, the series of concepts <italic>human, primate, mammal, vertebrate, animal</italic>, is ordered. However, the features that distinguish humans from the general class of primates are qualitatively different to the features distinguishing primates from the general class of mammals, and so on. That is, the class of differences between items in the above series is heterogeneous and, therefore, unordered. While the series itself is ordered (and, incidentally, homogeneous—each item in the series being a class of animals), the differences between items are not ordered and, hence, the ordered structure itself is non-quantitative. This is no new discovery, for Kant also noted this kind of intrinsic non-measurability in such hierarchies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0959354311434656">Sutherland, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>An example more pertinent to testing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0959354311434656">Michell, 2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0959354311434656">2010</xref>) is a scale for assessing levels of functional independence in the elderly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0959354311434656">Embretson, 2006</xref>). The items are as follows: (1) climbing stairs, (2) transferring to bathtub, (3) bathing, (4) walking, (5) dressing upper body, (6) independent toileting, (7) transferring to bed, (8) dressing lower body, (9) mobility without a wheelchair, (10) bladder control, (11) performing personal grooming, and (12) bowel control. It appears that the elderly generally lose the ability to climb stairs unaided before losing the ability to transfer unaided to a bathtub and that ability, in turn, is generally lost before the ability to bathe independently, and so on. These sorts of facts order the items, and although it is not exactly the same for every individual, the approximation to the above order is sufficient for Embretson to report that relevant data fit (statistically) a widely used item response model for interval scaling, the so-called Rasch model (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959354311434656">Bond &amp; Fox, 2007</xref>). A person’s pattern of physical capacities and incapacities as assessed via this scale indicates a degree of functional independence. A person able to complete all of the activities that another person can plus at least one further activity on the list is the more independent of the two. Different degrees of functional independence are, consequently, mutually homogeneous.</p>
<p>However, <italic>differences between degrees</italic> of this attribute are mutually heterogeneous. For example, the difference between being able, on the one hand, and being unable, on the other, to climb stairs, and the difference between being able and being unable to transfer to a tub are differences of qualitatively diverse kinds, and each of these in turn is of another kind to that between being able and being unable to bathe independently, and so on for the other differences between degrees of this attribute. Because of this, <italic>the differences between degrees</italic> of functional independence do not stand in intrinsic relations of <italic>greater than, less than</italic>, or <italic>equality</italic> to one another. (Order relations on these differences can be “constructed” by applying the Rasch model only because that model presumes the point at issue here, namely, that these differences are quantitatively related and, so, stand in intrinsic order relations. The Rasch model constructs quantitative relations on differences using discrepancies between people in the way the items are ordered: that is, via what is generally called “error” in the data. This means that the order relations between differences constructed via this model are extrinsic to the differences themselves and in cases like the present one are incompatible with the heterogeneity of these differences. Therefore, it is inappropriate to apply the Rasch model, or any quantitative model for that matter, to such data.)</p>
<p>Trying to think of differences between degrees of functional independence as thoroughly homogeneous raises the question, what could a decrease in functional independence be other than an inability to do some kind of specific daily activity that one was previously able to do independently? There is no homogeneous stuff, <italic>independence</italic>, adhering in various amounts to each person; there is only the set of distinct capacities to do the range of different daily activities constituting total functional independence, and which, in being lost, successively mark decreasing degrees of that attribute. Thus, functional independence is a merely ordinal attribute.</p>
<p>It is clear that Kant, von Kries, Keynes, and Collingwood identified a genuine possibility, namely, that an ordered attribute may be such that differences between its degrees are mutually heterogeneous even though the degrees themselves are mutually homogeneous. Of course, any set of distinct objects will be both homogeneous and heterogeneous: homogeneous, at least, in that they are all objects; and heterogeneous, in that they are all mutually distinct, and thus different in certain respects. However, the relevant issue with respect to the kinds of ordinal structures under discussion here is, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0959354311434656">Collingwood (1933)</xref> noted, the contrast with quantitative attributes, for the latter manifest what he termed “pure differences of degree” (p. 73). What Collingwood meant by this can be seen by considering the difference between any one pair of lengths and that between another. These differences do not differ qualitatively, only quantitatively. They are not just magnitudes of the same attribute (namely, length differences); there is no sense in which they differ other than that they are different magnitudes of that same attribute.</p>
<p>Conversely, consider the difference between any one pair of degrees of functional independence and the difference between any other pair, which does not overlap the first. They are homogeneous in the sense that both are differences between degrees of functional independence, but they also differ qualitatively, and it is this heterogeneity that makes them non-comparable with respect to magnitude and, thus, makes the attribute intrinsically non-quantitative. Hence, from a logical point of view, if presented with any attribute experienced only as ordinal, there are at least two possible explanations of its structure: first, it might be quantitative and, second, it might be intrinsically non-quantitative because it has impure differences of degree. Furthermore, if the attribute as directly experienced manifests impure differences of degree, as, say, functional independence does, the second of the above-mentioned two possibilities provides the better explanation. That is, in such a case, the best explanation is that the attribute just is as it is experienced to be.</p>
<p>This conclusion is important. In the first place, it corrects a conclusion inferred in an earlier paper in which I argued that differences between degrees of an ordered attribute must always be not only mutually homogeneous, but therefore also ordered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0959354311434656">Michell, 2006</xref>). Reading <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0959354311434656">Collingwood (1933)</xref> enabled me to see afresh the importance of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0959354311434656">von Kries’s (1882)</xref> quantity objection and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0959354311434656">Keynes’s (1921)</xref> view about non-quantitative probabilities. What my earlier argument overlooked is that while all differences between degrees of any ordered attribute must be mutually homogeneous in some general sense, it is also true, if they involve impure differences of degree, that they will be mutually heterogeneous as well. This heterogeneity, because it involves qualitative differences, rules out the possibility of intrinsic order relations upon such differences between degrees.</p>
<p>In the second place, it seems plausible that abilities, traits, attitudes, and so on, involve impure difference of degree and are, therefore, intrinsically non-quantitative structures. The sorts of tests used to assess psychological attributes typically consist of a series of items differing from one another in difficulty (or whatever the analogue of difficulty is in the personality or attitude domains). Confining attention to abilities for argument’s sake, each item of an ability test corresponds to a degree of the relevant ability, namely, that required to pass the item. Were the cognitive resources (knowledge, skills, strategies, etc.) involved in getting any such item correct specified, it would be apparent that as the items increase in difficulty, differences between the required cognitive resources will not necessarily be completely homogeneous. Indeed, typically, they will be heterogeneous. For example, the differences between cognitive resources needed to solve easy and moderately difficult mathematics items will not be the same as the differences between resources needed to solve moderately difficult and very difficult mathematics items. This observation suggests that abilities are attributes composed of ordered hierarchies of cognitive resources, the differences between which are heterogeneous.</p>
<p>The case for this conclusion is strengthened by the fact that those favouring the hypothesis that abilities are quantitative attributes have not as yet specified the homogeneous character of any ability, such as mathematical ability, which that hypothesis entails. In the case of the ordinal hypothesis, it is in principle possible to give a detailed characterization of each degree of the ability in terms of the cognitive resources sufficient to solve items at each degree. The equivalent in the case of the quantitative hypothesis would involve specifying the character of the proposed quantitative attribute in such a way that it is evident why increasing magnitudes of this homogeneous quantity increases the quality of performance. Typically, abilities, as latent quantitative attributes, are defined by reference to their alleged effects. What distinguishes mathematical from verbal ability, for example, is just that mathematical ability sustains performance on mathematical tasks, whereas verbal ability does the same for verbal tasks, but the intrinsic, distinguishing characteristics of these different abilities remains unspecified. Mathematical tasks of increasing difficulty differ from one another in heterogeneous ways, and increasing degrees of mathematical ability, if quantitative, are just increasing amounts of some homogeneous stuff. In the light of this contrast, it is not clear how dispositional definitions of ability can help to characterize the quantitative character of abilities, or how the required homogeneous character of such quantitative attributes can help to explain the heterogeneity of the differences between the mathematical achievements involved in solving mathematical tasks of different levels of difficulty.</p>
<p>There is another difficulty for quantitative theories of abilities. As noted already, each test item corresponds to a specific degree of the relevant ability. Therefore, if abilities are quantitative, then quantitative structure must be reflected in relationships between structural features of test items. It will not do to simply derive the conclusion, say, that one item’s difficulty level is 1.00 and another’s is -0.70 (implying a difficulty difference of 1.70; these figures are taken from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959354311434656">Bond &amp; Fox, 2007</xref>, p. 56). There must be some difference between the structural features of the items that determines precisely this quantitative difference between their respective difficulties and not some other. Despite attempts by some psychometricians to identify item features relevant to levels of item difficulty (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0959354311434656">Embretson &amp; Gorin, 2001</xref>), nothing this specific has been identified, and where relevant structural differences appear to be only qualitative, features that might sustain such precise quantitative differences in difficulty are not evident. At present, the hypothesis that abilities are quantitative is utterly opaque, while the hypothesis that abilities are ordinal with impure differences of degree is a model of clarity. That is, not only is it possible that abilities could be ordinal structures possessing heterogeneous differences between degrees, but also this hypothesis is the only one the details of which can be understood at present. (A parallel argument could be mounted for the personality and attitude domains.) In psychometrics, the inference from order to quantity is not a reasonable abduction.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0959354311434656">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Elsewhere, I have argued that there is something amiss with psychometrics, namely, an almost complete failure to seriously investigate the issue of whether relevant psychological attributes are actually quantitative (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0959354311434656">Michell, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0959354311434656">2007b</xref>). This failure, I claim, is pathological when viewed from the perspective of the values of science, for it is sustained by a number of illogical ways of thinking, such as Stevens’ vacuous definition of measurement and the psychometricians’ fallacy. While it is relatively easy to show that the psychometricians’ fallacy (i.e., the inference from order to quantity) is deductively invalid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0959354311434656">Michell, 2009b</xref>), some psychometricians still may think it is reasonable in a wider sense. The above analysis shows this is not so: not only is it deductively invalid; it is, also, neither inductively nor abductively reasonable. This conclusion strengthens the claim that psychometrics is pathological science (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0959354311434656">Michell, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0959354311434656">2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0959354311434656">2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The distinction between quantitative and merely ordered attributes resides in the internal structure of the attributes involved. It concerns differences between degrees of the attribute: specifically, whether order relations between these differences are analogous to those relating intervals between points on a straight line; and, in particular, it involves order relations between what I have called non-nested pairs of differences. These and other relevant matters were highlighted by research into the foundations of measurement by Luce, Suppes, Krantz, and Tversky (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0959354311434656">Krantz et al., 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0959354311434656">Luce, Krantz, Suppes, &amp; Tversky, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0959354311434656">Suppes, Krantz, Luce, &amp; Tversky, 1990</xref>). Since it is not reasonable to infer quantity from mere order, and given the values of science, acceptance of the hypothesis that any attribute is quantitative depends upon the weight of empirical evidence.</p>
<p>Despite this, historically, psychometricians have steadfastly stood by their presupposition that quantity follows from mere order, rarely analysing it, rarely mentioning it, mostly simply taking it that their ordinal attributes must be latently quantitative. Furthermore, the quantitative theories that they have devised and that they use as scaling devices, such as item response theories, because they presume that the relevant attributes are quantitative, are ill suited to the task of testing that presupposition. If abilities, attitudes, and traits are ordered, but non-quantitative, attributes, it is entirely possible that subsets of items can be found that will give good statistical fit to such theories. For example, as noted earlier, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0959354311434656">Embretson (2006)</xref> reported fit to the Rasch model for the functional independence scale. This is not a criticism of the Rasch model. Whatever its merits, it is only safe to apply it to test data for the purposes of constructing a measurement scale in circumstances where independent evidence exists that the relevant attribute is quantitative. Such evidence depends upon investigations that are specifically diagnostic of additive, as opposed to merely ordinal, structure in the relevant attribute.</p>
<p>Psychometricians have generally sidestepped the task of looking specifically for additive structure in psychological attributes. However, this task can be undertaken by partitioning data into components caused by ordinal versus additive features of the relevant attribute. If, in some attribute, additive structure is really present, it should make a difference to features of response data, and in certain circumstances it may be possible to disentangle the effects of additive structure from those dependent upon merely ordinal structure. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0959354311434656">Michell (1994)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0959354311434656">Kyngdon (2006)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0959354311434656">Kyngdon and Richards (2007)</xref> have demonstrated that such a disentangling of effects is possible when using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0959354311434656">Coombs’ (1964)</xref> theory of unidimensional unfolding, and there is no good reason why a similar approach cannot be applied elsewhere.</p>
<p>At present, the claim that psychometricians are able to measure psychological attributes on interval scales is a myth, and it will remain so until it is recognized that the possibility of attributes, such as abilities, being merely ordinal is one that must be seriously considered. Merely ordinal attributes are able to stand alone as real structures without the crutch of quantity. In ignoring this fact, psychometricians are guilty perhaps of projecting their deep horror of qualitative research (for an expression of which, see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0959354311434656">Meehl, 2006</xref>) onto psychological attributes, as if it were reality that excluded the possibility of merely ordinal attributes. Merely ordinal attributes are not just entirely possible, it seems that in the area of psychological testing, reality may actually embrace them, for in that context they remain a plausible option.</p>
<p>If psychological attributes are merely ordinal, quantitative psychometric theories misconstrue the phenomena involved. If psychological attributes possess impure differences of degree, then the heterogeneity between different degrees may rule out the possibility of smooth, homogeneous laws between attributes. Each different degree of the attribute may stand in its own relationships to other attributes. Factors affecting any particular degree of an ability (or trait or attitude) will not necessarily be the same as factors affecting other degrees of the same attribute. Interrelationships between merely ordinal attributes, where they exist, cannot be approximated by superimposing quantitative models, for such models ignore the causal complexity possible with impure differences of degree and blind researcher and practitioner alike to the richness of the phenomena with which they attempt to deal. Scientists wanting to uncover nature’s hidden ways of working adopt a pathological strategy when they ask nature to fit itself to their myths. Those prepared to adapt their minds to nature’s sometimes discomforting complexity always follow a surer, but more difficult path.</p>
<p>Finally, it is worth noting that psychology is not the only modern discipline embracing the psychometricians’ fallacy. It is now ubiquitous. It figures in philosophy (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0959354311434656">Trout, 2000</xref>), economics (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0959354311434656">Boumans, 2007</xref>), sociology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0959354311434656">Turner, 2008</xref>), and it underwrites the modern managerialist mania for “measuring” every facet of human performance (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0959354311434656">Porter, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0959354311434656">Spigelman, 2002</xref>). While psychology is its primary locus, the example of applied psychometrics made this fallacy appear legitimate to a much wider audience of uncritical minds and encouraged its dissemination and acceptance within a society that still makes a fetish of the idea of measurement.</p>
