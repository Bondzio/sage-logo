<p>Labor activists have long pushed the living wage—the ability for wage earners to maintain a basic standard of living, variously defined—as the primary objective in setting wages. In his book, <italic>Fair Wages</italic>, Daniel Vaughan-Whitehead, an ILO economist, argues that a more robust framework is necessary. Vaughan-Whitehead contends that corporate social responsibility (CSR) best practices on wages should include a host of other factors. A narrow emphasis on the living wage obscures whether employers are respecting mandated overtime requirements, whether workers can achieve wages in standard hours, or whether wages remain adequate in the wake of rising prices, for example. The author argues that the current financial crisis makes the inclusion of such wage dimensions particularly important in evaluating employer practices.</p>
<p>The book develops this argument across four sections. In the first, Vaughan-Whitehead presents an analysis of the current state of wages globally, submitting that wage inequality is on the rise and that governmental policies have been unable to address such wage problems adequately. This sets up the heart of the book, in which Vaughan-Whitehead develops his fair wage approach to evaluating employer behavior. A third part applies this auditing procedure to Asian suppliers in the garment sector and considers the impact of the economic crisis on wage policy. And a short final section offers policy recommendations based on such wage assessments. Though written in somewhat technical language for specialists, Vaughan-Whitehead’s basic arguments will be useful to all who wish to move beyond the sometimes moralistic and inflexible parameters of the living wage debate.</p>
<p>The bulk of <italic>Fair Wages</italic>—and the part that represents a departure from previous work on CSR wage policy—is devoted to the development and implementation of an auditing apparatus to evaluate a diverse array of factors in considering the fairness of the wages paid by employers to their employees. In addition to the living wage dimension, Vaughan-Whitehead’s rubric includes: the payment of wages (including reporting and delays), compliance with minimum wage standards, comparison to prevailing wages, working hours (including overtime), pay systems (including skill distinctions, piece rates, discipline through wages, compliance with government regulations, and bonuses), communication and social dialogue (including contracts, bargaining, and explanation of wages), wage disparity (including discrimination and pay differentials), real wages, wage share (in relation to profits and sales), and wage costs (in relation to production and employment). Vaughan-Whitehead is able to measure each of these dimensions over time through analysis of financial records supplied by employers and questionnaires administered to both managers and workers. He converts this information into a numerical score and commentary within each category, considers worker and employer ratings in each category, and offers a final assessment of the wage dimensions in which employers need to make progress and the areas in which they are doing well.</p>
<p>Vaughan-Whitehead offers a radically new way of evaluating wage fairness—at least for garment industry suppliers in Asia, particularly China. At the same time, the policy implications of his approach remain woefully underdeveloped. In the final fifteen pages of <italic>Fair Wages</italic>, the author argues that international brands need to make a new commitment to wages as a measure of CSR, to eliminate the squeezing of suppliers who implement wage policies. Vaughan-Whitehead suggests that this might be achieved through a formalized network of corporate, governmental, nongovernmental organizations, and labor actors working toward the institutionalization of the fair wage assessment detailed in the book. The author also proposes a fair wage campaign involving consumers and unions, leading to the creation of a fair wage label to certify compliance with fair wage processes. No doubt Vaughan-Whitehead is right that such action ought to be taken. But without a roadmap of the sort the author exhaustively develops for the assessment itself, it remains unclear how fair wage policy can become a practical reality.</p>
