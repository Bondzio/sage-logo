<abstract>
<p>This study examined cross-cultural differences in the moderating function of authoritarian, authoritative, and permissive parenting styles for Jewish and Arab Israeli children exposed to political violence. Respondents were parents and children aged 10–11 from 94 families (42 Arab, 52 Jewish). Parents completed the Parenting Styles and Dimensions Questionnaire and a demographic questionnaire, and children completed the Brief Symptom Inventory, Political Life Events Scale, and Negative Life Events Scale. Political violence exposure and parenting style influenced children’s psychological distress. Mothers’ and fathers’ parenting style moderated effects of political-violence exposure differently for Jewish and Arab children. These findings highlight the need to examine both mothers’ and fathers’ parenting style and ways in which parenting style effects are culturally dependent.</p>

<p>Parental practices play a central role in helping children cope with environments of trauma and stress. Children living in conditions of war and national conflict are exposed to dangerous experiences that compromise normative age-related transitions. Nonetheless, children show wide variation in their adjustment to these stressful conditions, possibly due to different vulnerability and resilience factors. Many factors have been examined as possible protective features, ranging from children’s personality and temperament to family and environmental characteristics. Despite the probable important role of parenting styles as determinants of children’s psychological outcomes, this aspect has not been given much attention in conditions of political violence and conflict. The current study examined parenting style as a moderator of the effects of children’s exposure to political violence on mental health across two cultural groups. Specifically, this study was conducted in Israel and examined cross-cultural differences in the moderating function of authoritarian, authoritative, and permissive parenting styles for Jewish and Arab Israeli children in coping with political violence.</p>
<sec id="section1-0165025411406856">
<title>Parenting characteristics and styles</title>
<p>Parental love, family intimacy, and wise disciplining have been shown to enhance children’s coping such that family atmosphere shapes ways in which children mobilize their competencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0165025411406856">Punamaki, Qouta, &amp; El-Sarraj, 2001</xref>). Family cohesion and provision of a sense of security (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0165025411406856">Laor et al, 1997</xref>) and good parenting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0165025411406856">Punamaki, Qouta, &amp; El-Sarraj, 1997</xref>) increase children’s resilience against political violence. Families frequently survive periods of political upheaval with no general decline in children’s perception of parental supportiveness or supervision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0165025411406856">Barber, 1999b</xref>). This evidence affirms the pivotal role of familial interrelations, mutual responses, and the ability to face political violence as a collaborative unit.</p>
<p>The role of different parenting styles has not been systematically investigated in contexts of chronic political-violence exposure. This is relevant beyond this specific domain since it could have implications for wider understanding of the source of resilience for children in conflict conditions.</p>
<p>Parenting styles provide an important source of variability in the lives of children exposed to political violence, thus examining its role as a source of resilience is warranted. Findings could provide important information about patterns of parenting styles in populations not previously reported. Additionally, the current study aims to examine the moderating role of parenting style between extreme violence exposure and child distress, thus going beyond a simple correlational description and beginning to investigate questions of mechanism.</p>
<p>The seminal definition of parenting style refers to ways in which parents support and exercise control over their children and is conceptualized as varying along two orthogonal dimensions of responsiveness and control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0165025411406856">Baumrind, 1991</xref>). In combination, these two dimensions yield three styles. Authoritarian parenting, defined as low in responsiveness and highly demanding, is characterized by strong control and limited emotional support. Authoritarian style is reflected in stringent evaluation of the child’s behavior and attitudes, in accordance with a set standard of conduct formulated by higher authority. Functionally, child autonomy is restricted, obedience is valued as a virtue and forceful measures to curb self-will are implemented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0165025411406856">Baumrind, 1966</xref>,
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0165025411406856"> 1968</xref>). The authoritative parenting style is defined as equally responsive and demanding but is characterized by emotional supportiveness, limit setting, and firm yet responsive disciplinary strategies. This style includes firm control at points of divergence together with child guidance in a rational and issue-oriented manner, negotiation, consideration for nonconformity, encouragement of autonomy, and reinforcement of the child’s individuality. Third, the permissive style, defined as highly responsive and low demanding, manifests in emotional support, promotion of independent decision-making and self-regulation of feelings, with avoidance of confrontational encounters and discipline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0165025411406856">Baumrind, 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>Research based on this conceptualization of parenting styles has produced a relatively consistent picture of the superiority of the authoritative style in inducing successful socialization and adjustment of children in Western culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0165025411406856">Baumrind, 1989</xref>; 
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0165025411406856">Chao, 2001</xref>;
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0165025411406856">Park &amp; Bauer, 2002</xref>). Conversely, authoritarian and permissive parenting styles are considered to be linked with poorer child outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0165025411406856">Baumrind, 1989</xref>; 
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0165025411406856">Chao, 2001</xref>; Park &amp; Bauer, 2002). Authoritarian styles have been associated with intimate relationship problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0165025411406856">Sharabany, Eshel, &amp; Hakim, 2008</xref>), depression, low self-esteem, and difficulties in decision-making through to adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0165025411406856">Wenar &amp; Kerig, 2000</xref>). Permissive styles have been associated with poor social skills and low self-esteem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0165025411406856">Baumrind, 1991</xref>), irresponsibility, lack of empathy, and antisocial behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0165025411406856">Wenar &amp; Kerig, 2000</xref>). However, this evidence is far from conclusive.</p>
<p>A significant issue of research in this domain has been a predominance of attention to maternal parenting style with recent calls for the systematic inclusion of fathers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0165025411406856">Cabrera, Tamis-LeMonda, Bradley, Hofferth, &amp; Lamb, 2000</xref>). The effect of fathers’ parenting style on children’s development is of particular concern given recent trends of increased father involvement in children’s lives among two-parent families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0165025411406856">Cabrera et al, 2000</xref>). Although currently little information exists about fathers’ parenting styles and parental differences, there is some indication that mothers tend toward an authoritative style, while fathers demonstrate practices more consistent with an authoritarian style, particularly in relation to disciplinary strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0165025411406856">Russell, Hart, Robinson, &amp; Olsen, 2003</xref>). Although both maternal and paternal parenting styles play a significant role in the development of aggressive behavior in their children, fathers’ warmth is associated with less aggressive attributions in peer provocation conditions for both boys and girls and less emotional distress in boys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0165025411406856">Nelson &amp; Coyne, 2009</xref>). Rigid paternal control reflects a form of aversive parenting that can uniquely account for negative child outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0165025411406856">Nelson &amp; Coyne, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>A second issue regarding parenting style relates to their universality or culture-specific beneficial nature. With expansion of research beyond samples of Western, predominantly middle-class families, it has become increasingly clear that the influence of authoritativeness, as well as other styles of parenting, will vary depending on the social milieu in which the family is embedded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0165025411406856">Darling &amp; Steinberg, 1993</xref>). The beneficial effects of authoritative parenting have been so well established for European American youth that this style has become the prototype for appropriate parenting. However, a growing debate questions such an assumption across different ethnic groups and cultures. Studies on the cross-cultural effects of authoritative parenting on child and adolescent outcomes have shown the authoritative style to be strongly associated with academic achievement among European American adolescents but least effective in influencing academic achievement of Asian and African American youth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0165025411406856">Dornbusch, Ritter, Leiderman, Roberts, &amp; Fraleigh, 1987</xref>; 
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0165025411406856">Steinberg, Lamborn, Dornbusch, &amp; Darling, 1992</xref>). In a study of Chinese families in Hong Kong and the People’s Republic of China, it was found that the authoritarian style positively affected the achievement of children, while the authoritative style had no effect on achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0165025411406856">Leung, Lau, &amp; Lam, 1998</xref>). Authoritative parenting has consistently more positive effects on school performance and school effort for European American children than for Chinese American children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0165025411406856">Chao, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>In collectivist cultures, strong value is frequently placed on deference to authority (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0165025411406856">Hofstede, 1983</xref>). Authoritarian parenting, requiring as it does obedience from children without expression of their own point of view, may promote the development of qualities necessary in collectivist cultures, such as inhibition of individual desires and attention to group needs. Thus, in collectivist groups, the authoritarian style may be appropriate for the outcomes valued by the group. Parenting in collectivist cultures such as Egypt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0165025411406856">Rudy &amp; Grusec, 2001</xref>), Iran (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0165025411406856">Kermani &amp; Brenner, 2001</xref>), and India (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0165025411406856">Siddique, 1983</xref>) tends to be more controlling than for children from individualist Western backgrounds. Parenting of Arab and Middle Eastern families has generally been described as hierarchical and strict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0165025411406856">Abudabbeh, 1996</xref>; 
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0165025411406856">Sharifzadeh, 1992</xref>). This cross-cultural diversity in the effects of parenting style may be based on different perceptions and meaning attributed to parenting practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0165025411406856">Chao, 2001</xref>) and does not necessarily indicate low levels of parental concern and love (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0165025411406856">Rudy &amp; Grusec, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The present study extends research on the effects of parenting styles in three ways. First, the study examined the different parental styles as a possible source of resilience for children living in the dangerous environment of political violence and conflict. Second, the study examined this moderating effect for both mothers’ and fathers’ parenting styles. Third, the study investigated possible cross-cultural differences in this moderating effect for Jewish and Arab Israeli children growing up amid conflict. Although the theoretical background favoring authoritative parenting style is strong, the evidence is equivocal. In addition, there are only sparse studies of the effects of fathers’ parenting styles and none examining this issue cross-culturally. This is the first study to examine the correlates of parenting style in the Middle East.</p>

<title>The conflict environment in Israel</title>
<p>The Israeli population is constituted by a multiethnic, multicultural, and multireligious mosaic, of which the two main groups are the Jewish majority and the Arab minority. The Israeli Arabs are the largest minority group in Israel comprising 20.3% of the total population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0165025411406856">Central Bureau of Statistics, 2010</xref>). Division of the Israeli Arabs from the Palestinians occurred during the War of Independence when much of the Arab population inhabiting former Palestine fled and settled in refugee camps in neighboring Arab countries. Those Arabs who decided not to flee accepted citizenship in the Israeli state and were granted formal civic and legal equality.</p>
<p>Conflicted relations between the Israelis and Palestinians deteriorated severely following the Six Day War in 1967 during which Israel conquered Gaza from Egypt and the West Bank from Jordan. This conquered land was inhabited by Palestinians who came to live under Israeli occupation, leading to a struggle for independent nationhood. Armed force to retrieve the land (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0165025411406856">Smith, 1996</xref>) produced two violent Palestinian uprisings, termed the first and second intifadas. The second intifada that erupted in September 2000 was characterized by escalating violence and extremely high numbers of casualties on both sides. The Palestinians suffered reoccupation by the Israeli army, destruction of homes and property, losses, and economic hardship. For Israelis, the intifada created a period of terrorist attacks throughout Israel, unprecedented in quantity and intensity, that destroyed every sense of personal and social security (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0165025411406856">Slone &amp; Shechner, 2009</xref>). This environment affected young and old alike. Youth were exposed to explosions and terrorist attacks in public areas, loss and injury of kin and friends, and massive media exposure to violent events. On 26 November 2006 a truce was implemented between Israel and the Palestinian Authority. However, this has been disrupted by continuous rocket and missile attacks from Gaza into Southern Israel, violent incidents on both sides, and several military operations of varying intensity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0165025411406856">
<title>Growing up amid political violence and conflict</title>
<p>Indisputably, war and conflict are not satisfactory environments for healthy development. However, evidence of consequences of political-violence exposure to youth has been inconclusive and includes adjustment reactions (
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0165025411406856">Zeidner, 2005</xref>), distress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0165025411406856">Hallis &amp; Slone, 1999</xref>), and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0165025411406856">Solomon &amp; Lavi, 2005</xref>). Further, demonstrable pathology is not the sole and inevitable consequence of exposure to conflict and political violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0165025411406856">Barber, 1999a</xref>). While some children may be considerably affected, others show strength and retain good functioning. These children seem to have a self-righting capacity or resilience and an ability to respond with resourcefulness and tenacity when confronted with untoward challenges. Models for the study of resilience examine the role of different risk and protective factors as moderators that affect the outcomes of stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0165025411406856">Kirby &amp; Fraser, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>In view of this, the aim of the present study was to examine the role of the three parenting styles, authoritarian, authoritative, and permissive, as a source of resilience for children exposed to political violence. The methodology included assessment of severity of political-violence exposure measured as political life events, assessment of relations between political violence and psychological outcome, and examination of the moderating function of the three parenting styles, both maternal and paternal, in relations between exposure and outcome. In addition, the study examined the possible differential role of the parenting styles as a source of coping for Jewish and Arab children.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0165025411406856">
<title>Hypotheses</title>
<p>The first hypothesis predicted a main effect of level of political life events exposure on psychological distress, such that children exposed to higher levels of political life events would report higher levels of distress.</p>
<p>The second hypothesis predicted differences in children’s psychological distress for different parenting styles, assessed separately for mothers’ and for fathers’ parenting styles.</p>
<p>The third hypothesis predicted that under differing levels of political life events exposure, the moderating effect of parenting style on children’s psychological distress would be different for Jewish and Arab children.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section6-0165025411406856">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Respondents were children and both parents from 94 families (42 Arab and 52 Jewish families) from a mixed city in Northern Israel. The sample was comprised of families living in the same city in Israel and did not include participants from rural areas. Local psychology students helped in recruitment by inviting neighbors and acquaintances to participate in the study. Families were requested to participate in a study investigating family characteristics and child-rearing practices and attitudes. Children’s age ranged between 10 and 11 years (<italic>M</italic> = 10.70, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.76). Families resided in Haifa, which is an Israeli city consisting of a mixed Arab and Jewish population. The Jewish families comprised a mix of Eastern and European descent Jews. The Arabs residing in this area live an urban life style. In the current sample, 60% of the Arab families were Christians and 40% were Moslems. Demographic data of children and parents by ethnic group are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0165025411406856">Table 1</xref>
. As demonstrated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0165025411406856">Table 1</xref>, Jewish parents were significantly older than Arab parents. This is not surprising considering that the average age of marriage for Arab Israelis is 21 while the average age of marriage for the Jewish Israelis is 24 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0165025411406856">Dwairy, 1997</xref>). No significant differences emerged between the two ethnic groups on socioeconomic status, children’s age, and the mean number of hours per day that parents spend with their children.</p>

<title>Parenting Styles and Dimensions Questionnaire</title>
<p>The parenting style measure used was the Parenting Styles and Dimensions Questionnaire (PSDQ; 
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0165025411406856">Robinson, Mandleco, Frost Olsen, &amp; Hart, 2001</xref>) that was designed to tap into theoretically meaningful parenting dimensions that are associated with child behavioral outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0165025411406856">Hart, Newell, &amp; Olsen, 2003</xref>). The PSDQ, originally called the Parenting Practices Questionnaire (PPQ;
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0165025411406856"> Robinson, Mandleco, Olsen, &amp; Hart, 1995</xref>), is a 62-item measure of self- and spouse-reported parenting practices for parents of preadolescent children. Items use a 5-point Likert scale (1 = never; 5 = always). The PSDQ was designed and confirmed by factor analysis to tap three styles of parenting based on 
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0165025411406856">Baumrind’s (1991)</xref> well-known typology—authoritative, authoritarian, and permissive. The measure yields a separate score for each dimension of parenting with larger numbers indicating increased use of parenting practices associated with a particular style. The authoritative scale (27 items) includes subscales for warmth and involvement (11 items), reasoning/induction (7 items), democratic participation (5 items), and good natured/easy going (4 items). The authoritarian scale (20 items) yields subscales for verbal hostility (4 items), corporal punishment (6 items), nonreasoning/punitive strategies (6 items), and directiveness (4 items). The permissive scale (15 items) yields subscales for lack of follow-through (6 items), ignoring misbehavior (4 items), and self-confidence (5 items). The PSDQ has been commended in a review of instruments assessing parenting practices (
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0165025411406856">Locke &amp; Prinz, 2002</xref>) as one of the few instruments available for measurement of parental nurturance and discipline with psychometrically defensible scales. The measure has been adapted for effective use in multiple cultural settings including Russia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0165025411406856">Hart, Nelson, Robinson, Olsen, &amp; McNeilly-Choque, 1998</xref>), China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0165025411406856">Wu et al, 2002</xref>), and African American Head Start communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0165025411406856">Coolahan, McWayne, Fantuzzo, &amp; Grim, 2002</xref>).

<title>Political Life Events Scale</title>
<p>Exposure to political violence was measured with the Political Life Events Scale (PLE; 
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0165025411406856">Slone, Adiri, &amp; Arian, 1998</xref>) containing 20 items that participants marked for exposure over the past year. Items marked positive for exposure were scored according to preset weightings. Item calibration that reflected item severity had been previously calculated in a series of pretests as part of the development of the PLE scale. Calibration was set according to valuations of event severity by children, independent of the present study and representative of the different child demographic compositions in the country, on the basis of their personal and vicarious experiences. In this pretest, 140 Israeli youth evaluated items on a scale of 1 to 3, as mild, moderate, or severe according to their perception of the severity of the experience, irrespective of actual exposure to events. Averages of these evaluations were calculated to produce weightings according to the formula: mild items (e.g., exposure to war through the media) were multiplied by 1, items categorized as moderate (e.g., staying in a bomb shelter for a prolonged period) were multiplied by 2, and items categorized as severe (e.g., injury to a close family member in a war or terrorist attack) were multiplied by 3. Generalized weighting on the basis of personal or vicarious experience is an acceptable scoring system for life events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0165025411406856">Slone &amp; Shechner, 2009</xref>). In the pilot studies, test-retest reliability for a period of 6 weeks was calculated for groups of participants living in the same geographical areas in order to control for additional events that could occur between the two measurements. Test-retest scores ranged from <italic>r</italic> = .86 to <italic>r</italic> = .94, indicating good reliability for measurement of political life events. There is no theoretical rationale to expect consistency in exposure to discrete political life events.</p>

<title>Negative Life Events Scale</title>
<p>The present study utilized an abbreviated version of the Negative Life Events Scale, consisting of 25 items including family, school, residential, and social negative events exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0165025411406856">Coddington, 1972</xref>). The nature of general life events accrued over life contains a range with a majority of long-standing events with chronic consequences such as “serious tension and conflict in the family,” “unemployment of the primary caretaker,” and “personal illness.” Respondents mark all events to which they have been exposed in the course of their lifetime and assign the impact of exposure to that event on a 1–5 Likert scale to yield a summed impact score. Test-retest reliability of the questionnaire has been reported to fall between 0.56 and 0.71 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0165025411406856">Garrison, Schoenbach, Schluchter, &amp; Kaplan, 1987</xref>).</p>

<title>Procedure</title>
<p>After receiving authorization from the Tel Aviv University Ethics Committee and written informed consent from both parents, questionnaires were administered in the family’s home by predetermined appointment. Questionnaires were administered by two experimenters, graduate students in Child Clinical Psychology in respondents’ home language, Hebrew or Arabic. All questionnaires had been countertranslated into Hebrew and Arabic and have been successfully used with both populations in Israel. An Arab experimenter conducted the questionnaire administration with Arab families and a Jewish experimenter with Jewish families. The PSDQ was completed by mothers and fathers independently. Thereafter, after a brief acquaintance chat, the experimenter explained to the child that this study aimed to examine the type of experiences children have and how they feel and think. The child test battery was administrated individually to each child by the experimenter in a quiet private room in the home and included the PLE, LE, and BSI questionnaires. Families were assured of anonymity and confidentiality and were told they could terminate their participation at any time.</p>

<title>Data treatment</title>
<p>The independent variables in this study were children’s level of exposure to political life events (PLE severity), mothers’ and fathers’ self-report of parenting style (authoritative, authoritarian, and permissive), and family ethnic group (Jewish or Arab). In order to partial out other negative life events that were not politically violent, general life events was used a covariate in the analyses; the dependent variable was children’s psychological distress as measured by the General Severity Index.</p>
<p>For analysis purposes, political life events’ severity was divided above and below the median into high and low exposure (PLE severity <italic>Mdn</italic> = 4.5). Parenting style was determined by the dominant parenting practice according to the highest <italic>z</italic>-score each parent obtained on the PSDQ questionnaire subscales. No differences were found among Jewish children (<italic>M</italic> = 3.91, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.56) and Arab children (<italic>M</italic> = 2.63, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.53) on exposure to PLE, <italic>t</italic>(85) = .66, <italic>ns</italic>. No differences emerged for mothers’ parenting style between Jewish mothers (22 authoritative mothers, 15 authoritarian mothers, and 15 permissive mothers) and Arab mothers (14 authoritative mothers, 14 authoritarian mothers, and 14 permissive mothers), χ(2)<sup>2</sup>= 0.792, <italic>ns</italic>. Similarly, no differences emerged for fathers’ parenting style between Jewish fathers (20 authoritative fathers, 18 authoritarian fathers, and 14 permissive fathers) and Arab fathers (17 authoritative fathers, 14 authoritarian fathers, and 11 permissive fathers), χ(2)<sup>2</sup>= 0.40, <italic>ns</italic>.</p>

Least significant difference (LSD) post hoc comparisons revealed that children of authoritarian mothers reported higher levels on the GSI (<italic>M</italic> = 0.98, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.57) than children of both authoritative mothers (<italic>M</italic> = 0.55, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.37), <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, and children of permissive mothers (<italic>M</italic> = 0.74, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.58), <italic>p</italic> = .049. GSI differences between children of permissive and authoritative mothers were not statistically significant.</p>
<p>In line with the third hypothesis, the moderating effect of parenting style on children’s psychological distress was different for Jewish and Arab children.

For the Arab sample, GSI levels were lower for children of authoritative mothers compared to those with authoritarian (<italic>p</italic> = .001) and permissive mothers (<italic>p</italic> = .001), but also children of permissive mothers reported lower levels on the GSI compared with children of authoritarian mothers (<italic>p</italic> = .001). For Jewish children, no significant two-way interaction was obtained between PLE × Mothers’ Parenting Style.

LSD post hoc examination revealed that the source of these differences stemmed primarily from the differences between mothers’ authoritative and authoritarian parenting styles (<italic>p</italic> = 0.001), and also between authoritarian and permissive parenting styles (<italic>p</italic> = 0.001). Specifically, Arab children with authoritative and permissive mothers showed less psychological distress, as measured by the GSI, in comparison to Arab children with authoritarian mothers.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study examined the moderating role of parenting styles on children’s psychological distress under conditions of exposure to political violence. A distinctive aspect of this study was examination of the effect of both mothers’ and fathers’ parenting styles for children from two different ethnic groups living in the same country in conflict.</p>
<p>Similar to previous studies, both Jewish and Arab children exhibited higher levels of psychological distress with more severe exposure to the conflicted and politically violent environment in which they live (
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0165025411406856">Slone &amp; Shechner, 2009</xref>). This adds some weight to the debate regarding the toll that children pay when they grow up in such an environment, and reinforces the need to study factors that could enhance their psychological adjustment. In view of the pivotal role played by parental practices on children’s development, this study examined parenting styles as a possible source of children’s vulnerability or resilience in these circumstances.</p>
<p>Mothers’ parenting styles did affect children’s psychological distress. In line with 
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0165025411406856">Baumrind’s theory (1991)</xref>, children of authoritative mothers demonstrated lower levels of psychological distress than children with authoritarian mothers. Contrary to the classical theory, children with permissive mothers did not differ from children with authoritative mothers. Certainly in Israel, irrespective of children’s ethnic group and level of exposure to the violence, authoritarian motherhood is detrimental for children’s well-being. Mothers’ authoritarian parenting style, characterized as it is by low emotional responsiveness to the child and stern control, may not afford children the warmth and comfort necessary to escape the harsh environment.</p>
<p>On the other hand, taken as a group, paternal parenting style was not associated with children’s level of psychological distress. Together with the findings for mothers’ parenting style, this appears to indicate the dominant influence of mothers in the family climate, particularly in terms of emotional well-being. This is reinforced by the descriptive statistics indicating that in both groups mothers spent more time with their children than fathers.</p>
<p>The third hypothesis predicted cross-cultural differences in the moderating role of mothers’ and fathers’ parenting styles on children’s psychological distress according to level of exposure to political violence. Findings indicated different effects of mothers’ parenting style on children’s psychological distress across the two ethnic groups. Authoritarian parenting style was more detrimental to children in both groups. However, for Jewish children, authoritarian and permissive maternal parenting styles were equally harmful, in line with the classical theory for children in Western societies. Surprisingly, for Arab children exposed to high levels of political life events, both the authoritative and permissive maternal parenting styles were beneficial. This finding is difficult to interpret and necessitates further study. It is possible that it reflects Arab children’s needs for high levels of warmth and support in the specific high-stress conditions of the particular sociopolitical context in Israel.</p>
<p>Among the Jewish group, fathers’ parenting style was not related to children’s psychological distress, irrespective of level of exposure to political violence. However, for the Arab group, at low levels of political-violence exposure, fathers’ parenting style had no effect, whereas at high levels of exposure, authoritarian parenting style had more negative effects than the authoritative style.</p>
<p>These findings may be interpreted in several ways, relating both to family process and to cross-cultural differences. In general, mothers’ parenting style had a more dominant effect on Israeli children’s psychological outcome than did fathers’. From a cross-cultural perspective, fathers’ parenting style had a differential influence across ethnic groups and, in cases of a moderating influence in the Arab group, this was in line with the classic theory. Arab society honors the dominance of the father figure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0165025411406856">Sharabany et al, 2008</xref>). This could explain the sole finding of fathers’ parenting style effect in the Arab group. Given the authoritarian, patriarchal, and collectivistic nature of Arab society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0165025411406856">Dwairy, Achoui, Abouserie, &amp; Farah, 2006</xref>), one could have assumed that fathers’ authoritarian parenting style could be beneficial to children. Authoritarianism within the Arab society is not necessarily associated with children feeling oppressed. In a study of Arab youth, the majority of children reported that they abide by their parents’ directions in all areas of life, such as social behavior, interpersonal relationships, marriage, occupational preferences, and political attitudes. Interestingly, they reported acceptance of this authoritarian style (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0165025411406856">Dwairy et al, 2006</xref>). However, in the present study, fathers’ authoritarian style was not advantageous. This may align with recent views that Arab society in Israel is undergoing a process of increasing Westernization and urbanization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0165025411406856">Haj-Yahia, 1994</xref>). In addition, the participants in this study all lived urban lifestyles, whereas findings might be very different for Israeli Arab rural families.</p>

<title>In summary</title>
<p>The relatively small sample size and low statistical power obtained for the father’s analysis necessitates caution in drawing implications from these findings. This type of study that examines cross-cultural differences in the role of parenting style in moderating children’s exposure to stressful environments should be replicated and extended. Even within Israel, the Jewish and Arab populations are composed of many strata and variations that were not reflected in this study, including degree of religious adherence and separated places of residence. Additionally, since parenting style is a general family dimension that affects children’s development across broad domains, outcome measures should include behavioral, social, academic, and emotional aspects.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the differential moderating effect of parents’ parenting styles for Jewish and Arab children growing up in a stressful environment has not been studied before. Some findings of this study delineate effects common to both groups. Growing up in a stressful environment of conflict, war, and political violence is harmful to children’s psychological development. Parents hold a pivotal position in moderating these effects. However, closer inspection of parental roles in specific cultural and ethnic groups reveals variance in ways in which both mothers’ and fathers’ parenting styles moderate children’s psychological outcomes. Clinical implications relate to raising awareness in family therapists and other professionals of cultural differences in the influence of different parenting styles on children’s coping with different stressful environments, and encouraging culturally sensitive intervention.</p>
