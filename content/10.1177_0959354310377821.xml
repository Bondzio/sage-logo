<abstract>
<p>This work examines the historical conceptualization of schizophrenia through definition from 1908–1987. Rather than reveal an essentialist definition of schizophrenia in North America, it reveals a history of varying and competing professional definitions. It demonstrates and historically contextualizes how widespread conceptual instability and disagreement over the nature of the concept gave rise to a new, but still contested, theoretical emphasis on operational definitions. As made manifest through definition, schizophrenia has not been a stable transhistorical object. Rather, the characteristic feature in schizophrenia definition appears to be instability and variance rather than stability or long historical periods of agreement. This analysis nevertheless cautions against overstating the importance of fluctuating definition in assessing the ontological status of contemporary interpretations of schizophrenia.</p>

<p>Historically, the ontological status of schizophrenia has been subject to much debate. More recent critics of schizophrenia have characterized it as a concept which must be moved beyond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0959354310377821">Poland, 2007</xref>), or as a scientific delusion and social construction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959354310377821">Boyle, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0959354310377821">Sarbin, 1990</xref>). Others have concluded that polydiagnostic studies do not indicate a clear superiority of any particular interpretation of schizophrenia, and that what is lacking is a serious and systematic reflection on the conceptual validity of schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0959354310377821">Jansson &amp; Parnas, 2006</xref>). This paper seeks to further such debates through a historical analysis of schizophrenia definitions. It improves our theoretical understanding of the conditions that made possible an epistemological shift towards operational definitions, and of the contemporary North American conceptualization of schizophrenia.</p>
<p>No definition will capture the variety of meaning schizophrenia has possessed at a given time. Nevertheless, when we examine what an author has chosen to include in a given definition and collate these with other definitions in a chronological manner, we improve our theoretical understanding of changes in schizophrenia conceptualization, its ontogenesis towards operational definitions, and its complex ontological nature. Moreover, in charting what Foucault would perhaps call the “ceremonial space” of definition, this analysis helps lay foundations for a broader understanding of the representation of scientific concepts, how they are maintained, and the transhistorical manner in which they are subject to change.</p>
<p>Early schizophrenia researchers by and large saw the process of definition as a valid method of representation. Rather than analyzing this form of representation itself, they limited themselves principally to debates and to concerns over the content of definition. That psychiatrists did not recognize the limitations of definition is unsurprising. It was only in 1950 that a major analysis of this form of representation was carried out by Richard Robinson in <italic>Definition</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0959354310377821">Robinson, 1950</xref>). In that work, which used as examples 18 definitions of “definition,” the author identifies several species of definition. In doing so he revealed that it has been variously argued that a definition need not necessarily be brief; that an intellectual or scientific endeavor might equally work towards a definition, as opposed to commence with one; and that many definitions of the same term are better than one alone.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the author observes that it has been maintained that some things are indefinable, that the whole procedure is worthless or vice versa, and that a definition cannot be either true or false, because it is not a statement but rather a command, not a proposition but a proposal. Finally, in this list of charted controversy, he reminded readers of the sticky question, as to whether definitions apply to things, words, or concepts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0959354310377821">Robinson, 1950</xref>).</p>

<title>Bleuler</title>
<p>In 1908, Swiss psychiatrist Eugen Bleuler, of the Burghölzli clinic, Zurich, introduced the term schizophrenia. In doing so, he presented the following working definition or proposal, which comes as close as he ever came to explaining the derivation of <italic>schiz</italic> (to split) and <italic>phrene</italic> (mind):</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I believe that the tearing up or the splitting of the psychic functions is the outstanding symptom of this whole group [Ich glaube namliche das die Zerreißung oder Spaltung der psychischen Funktionen ein hervorragendes Symptom der ganzen Gruppe sei ]. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0959354310377821">Bleuler, 1908</xref>, p. 436, my translation)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In the same paper, Bleuler went on to present information on the recovery rates of his patients. He believed these to be much superior to those previously estimated for dementia praecox. Instead of deteriorating, more patients than hitherto thought now showed indications of recovery. Bleuler’s proposal was, in the author’s own mind, not so much at this stage a definition of schizophrenia, as a <italic>redefinition</italic> or reformulation of dementia praecox, which Kraepelin had characterized before 1908 as:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The complete loss of mental activity, and of interest in particular, and the failure of every impulse to energy, are such characteristic and fundamental indications that they give a very definite stamp to the condition. . . . Together with the weakness of judgment, they are invariable and permanent fundamental features of dementia praecox, accompanying the whole evolution of the disease. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0959354310377821">Kraepelin, 1904/2002</xref>, p. 26)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In 1909, Bleuler’s assistant and later translator, A. A. Brill, again casting schizophrenia as a synonym to dementia praecox, would introduce the term in the <italic>American Journal of Insanity</italic>, with little elaboration, save to thank Bleuler for repudiating the meaningless term dementia praecox, which was neither, “a dementia nor a praecox” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0959354310377821">Brill, 1909</xref>, p. 69), in favour of the more optimistic schizophrenia. Elsewhere, in the <italic>American Journal of Psychiatry</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0959354310377821">E. E. Southard (1910)</xref> would in passing briefly parrot Bleuler’s definition: tearing up or splitting of the psychic functions [<italic>Zerreißung oder Spaltung der psychischen Funktionen</italic>]. And a year later, Stedman’s <italic>A Practical Medical Dictionary</italic> also equated it with dementia praecox: “schizo, I cause to curdle, + phren mind. Dementia praecox” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0959354310377821">Stedman, 1911</xref>, p. 777). At this stage, there was no substantive discussion of the merits of the term in the Anglophone literature (which this investigation is largely restricted to). And it is not until much later within North American and Anglophone literature that the definition, or indeed the very idea of producing one, would receive critical scrutiny.</p>
<p>Bleuler attempts his first stipulative definition of schizophrenia in his 1911 <italic>Dementia Praecox or the Group of Schizophrenias</italic>, in the subsection entitled “Definition of the disease”:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>By the term “dementia praecox” or “schizophrenia” we designate a group of psychoses whose course is at times chronic, at times marked by intermittent attacks, and which can stop or retrograde at any state, but does not permit a full <italic>restitution ad integrum</italic>. The disease is characterised by a specific type of alteration of thinking, feeling, and relation to the external world which appears nowhere else in this particular fashion. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0959354310377821">Bleuler, 1911/1952</xref>, p. 9)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The first thing to note here, is that though more optimistic than Kraepelin, Bleuler did not consider that a patient could make a full recovery. Secondly, the theorized “group of schizophrenias” was already contracted to schizophrenia for ease of usage. The subtlety of this last point in particular was lost on later generations of psychiatrists, many of whom, for example, would see schizophrenia as a singular disease, rather than a group of diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0959354310377821">Curran &amp; Guttman, 1946</xref>). Bleuler also now demotes the idea of the “tearing up” [<italic>Zerreißung</italic>] of the psychic functions, which he first expressed in 1908, and now states that he called dementia praecox schizophrenia because the “‘splitting’ of the different psychic functions is one of its most important characteristics” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0959354310377821">Bleuler, 1911/1952</xref>, p. 8).</p>
<p>And from this point on his emphasis is not on tearing <italic>and</italic> splitting, but on splitting alone. Furthermore, <italic>within the definition</italic>, he notes that if the disease is marked, “In every case we are confronted with a more or less clear-cut splitting of the psychic functions. The personality loses its unity; at times different psychic complexes seem to represent the personality” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0959354310377821">Bleuler, 1911/1952</xref>, p. 9). This point of definition is later reinforced with comments on the personality such as:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Naturally such patients must speak of themselves in one of their two versions or they may speak in the third person of the other two. This sort of reference is here not merely an unusual or awkward figure of speech . . . but is the expression of a real alteration in personality. But even when such a splitting cannot be demonstrated . . . (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0959354310377821">Bleuler, 1911/1952</xref>, p. 144)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Hence we see how a clear line of interpretation opens up, whereby the possibility of understanding schizophrenia moves from a tearing up, to splitting, to splitting of the psychic functions, to splitting of the personality. As we shall see shortly Isador Coriat appears to partially follow this line of reasoning as early as 1914 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0959354310377821">Coriat, 1914</xref>). With some, such as G. S. Hall, this line of interpretation even went as far as reaching Jekyll and Hyde (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0959354310377821">McNally, 2007</xref>). Many definitions follow a similar but different line of interpretation. Some, for example, appear to conceptualize the splitting of psychic functions as the splitting of mind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0959354310377821">Warren, 1934</xref>) or even the mind or heart as the seat of thought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0959354310377821">Baynes, 1940</xref>, p. 21). Bleuler’s assistant Jörger could even speak of “split being” [<italic>Gewaltsein</italic>] in an architect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0959354310377821">Jörger, 1918</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section2-0959354310377821">
<title>A broad concept</title>
<p>In addition to an emphasis on splitting, it now became evident for the first time that what Bleuler proposed was much broader than dementia praecox. Quite how broad the concept was, or indeed became, is open to interpretation. August Hoch, in his 1912 review of Bleuler’s work for the <italic>Psychological Bulletin</italic>, noted:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Bleuler comprises in his book a great many cases which others would not include in the group or groups of dementia praecox, so that his analysis refers in reality a great deal to the symptomatology of the functional psychoses [sic]. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0959354310377821">Hoch, 1912</xref>, p. 169)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Isador Coriat would take latent forms to include individuals with oddities of character, reticence, seclusiveness, and other abnormalities of mental make-up (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0959354310377821">Coriat, 1917</xref>). Harry Stack Sullivan drew attention to the fact that schizophrenia was broad enough to include, “the clinical entity hysteria” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0959354310377821">Sullivan, 1931</xref>, p. 525), which perhaps fits with earlier comments by Bleuler that a large number of women who he considered to be suffering from schizophrenia passed for hysterically insane in other places. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959354310377821">Silvano Arieti (1955)</xref> would approvingly detail the broader forms as not just latent schizophrenia, but, “Psychoses which arise in psychopathic personalities, alcoholic hallucinoses [sic], prison psychoses and cases of symptomatic manic-depressive psychoses” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959354310377821">Arieti, 1955</xref>, p. 14). Michel Foucault thought the essential difference was that Bleuler had extended dementia praecox to include certain forms of paranoia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0959354310377821">Foucault, 1954/1987</xref>). This fits a declaration by Bleuler that the term paranoid was more expansive than Kraepelin’s earlier conceptualization of “dementia paranoides” and that, “I am unable to narrow down my concept of paranoia until it corresponds with Kraepelin’s” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0959354310377821">Bleuler, 1911/1952</xref>, p. 280). Yet other researchers have thought that the distinguishing difference between dementia praecox and schizophrenia was dissociation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0959354310377821">May, 1931</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0959354310377821">Warren, 1934</xref>). Years later Joseph Zubin would complain:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>In no other field of medicine has anyone ever solved a problem by extending it. We took the old dementia praecox concept and broadened it through Bleuler’s efforts, and later through his followers’, to the kind of spectrum that makes it impossible to try to do anything specific with it as a disease entity. I can’t understand why that happened . . . (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0959354310377821">Zubin, 1961</xref>, p. 202)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Bleuler was not alone in being accused of expansion. In 1910, Adolf Meyer had similarly grumbled of expansion by Kraepelin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0959354310377821">Meyer, 1910</xref>, p. 276). Yet the literature as typified by F. L. Wells of the department of Hygiene at Harvard University in <italic>The Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology</italic> generally concedes to Kraepelin the tighter description:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Schizophrenia is only by courtesy a diagnostic entity since it denotes a symptom-complex which, comparably to aphasia or even fever, is observable over an indefinite nosologic area. The Kraepelinian nomenclature had from this standpoint a sounder descriptive basis. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0959354310377821">Wells, 1946</xref>, p. 199)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Recognizing Bleuler’s enlargement, Kraepelin himself would comment that it remains to be seen whether the term would gain widespread acceptance, and continued to use the term dementia praecox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0959354310377821">Kraepelin, 1913/1919</xref>). By 1914, Isador Coriat in the <italic>American Journal of Psychiatry</italic> picked up on the extension of dementia praecox, and noted that Bleuler’s term was, “much broader than in the usual Kraepelin sense” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0959354310377821">Coriat, 1914</xref>, p. 679). Despite Coriat’s indisputably true observation, the author nevertheless defers to Bleuler’s claim of conceptual synonymy with dementia praecox:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Dementia praecox or schizophrenia is defined as a group of chronic psychoses, with outbursts or remissions, each case showing a more or less clear splitting of the personality and disturbances of associations, but without primary disturbances of perception, orientation or memory. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0959354310377821">Coriat, 1914</xref>, p. 679)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0959354310377821">
<title>A Freudian reading</title>
<p>By 1914, Freud had noted of patients diagnosed with schizophrenia:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Patients of this kind . . . display two fundamental characteristics, megalomania and diversion of interest from the external world—from people and things. In consequence of the latter change, they become inaccessible to the influence of psychoanalysis and cannot be cured by our efforts. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0959354310377821">Freud, 1914/1981</xref>, p. 74)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Freud’s censure did not however prevent psychiatrists who were interested in both schizophrenia and psychoanalysis from promoting a Freudian approach to theorization. In 1915, in <italic>Appleton’s Medical Dictionary</italic>, for example, we find that schizophrenia is given a Freudian reading. The definition is of particular interest as it was part edited by Smith Ely Jelliffe, who had co-founded the <italic>Psychoanalytic Review</italic> in 1913. As with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0959354310377821">Coriat’s 1914</xref> interpretation, the definition reads schizophrenia as broader than dementia praecox. But in an effort at distinction, it interprets Bleuler’s term as dementia praecox (which the dictionary defines as a chronic psychosis of youth with characteristic and bizarre other signs), <italic>and</italic> other psychoses: “a term used by Bleuler including dementia praecox and other psychoses showing marked libido splitting” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0959354310377821">Jelliffe &amp; Latimer, 1915</xref>, p. 741).</p>
<p>However, although the definition purports to be Bleulerian, it does not stem from Bleuler, who had observed that the theory of the “failure of investing libido in the object,” while not without merit, “is as yet insufficiently developed” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0959354310377821">Bleuler, 1911/1952</xref>, p. 370). Both Bleuler’s comment and Jelliffe’s definition in fact relate to a Freudian-inspired attempt by Abraham in 1908 to distinguish dementia praecox from hysteria (Abraham, 1908). A Freudian reading of course was not entirely contrary to Bleuler’s thinking in which, “An important aspect . . . is nothing less than the application of Freud’s ideas to dementia praecox” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0959354310377821">Bleuler, 1911/1952</xref>, p. 1). Nevertheless, the emphasis on libido splitting (a divergence of sexual impulses) takes liberty with Bleuler’s support for Freudian approaches, and promotes and extends Freudian thinking and ideas at the clear expense of Bleuler’s theorization and arguments. Twinning psychoanalysis with orthodox psychiatry was one way to spread the concepts of psychoanalysis, and gain Freudian thought respectability among psychiatrists. By emphasizing marked libido splitting in schizophrenia, this definition facilitated that agenda.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0959354310377821">
<title>Kraepelin’s viewpoint</title>
<p>Moves towards a Freudian conceptualization of dementia praecox or schizophrenia were still nascent, and psychoanalysis encountered resistance and competition from other theorists. Notably in North America, a 1919 translation of Emil Kraepelin’s 1913 thoughts on dementia praecox now appeared in which Kraepelin expressed regret over the confusion created by the misleading term dementia praecox. Kraepelin nevertheless now further separated from dementia praecox the paraphrenias and offered to psychiatrists a predominantly biological reading in which:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Dementia praecox consists of a series of states the common characteristic of which is a peculiar destruction of the internal connections of the psychic personality. The effects of this injury predominate in the emotional and volitional spheres of mental life. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0959354310377821">Kraepelin, 1913/1919</xref>, p. 3)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Kraepelin did not enthusiastically endorse Bleuler’s concept of dementia praecox (an impossibility since in the same edition he rejected Freudian theory as “castles in the air”), or its label, but took on board aspects of Bleuler’s thinking, noting that it remains to be seen if Bleuler’s term, or other competing ideas would be adopted. It should be said in passing, that conversely the “castles in the air” attack later repeated in 1920 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0959354310377821">Kraepelin, 1920/1992</xref>) made it equally hard for Freudians to embrace Kraepelin’s ideas. As such, Kraepelin retained his concept and found it quite natural to speak of, “those schizophrenic disorders which we meet with in dementia praecox” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0959354310377821">Kraepelin, 1913/1919</xref>, p. 76).</p>
<p>This seems to suggest that Kraepelin, like others, acknowledged the possible existence of schizophrenic disorders both inside and outside the rubric of dementia praecox. Indeed, later in 1920, Kraepelin would note that apparently unlike dementia praecox, “schizophrenic manifestations can doubtless occur without any brain damage” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0959354310377821">1920/1992</xref>, p. 523) and that it seemed possible that other, “curable disease may sometimes assume the guise of schizophrenic illnesses” (p. 523). In any case, by 1913 he now considered dementia praecox to exist in eight clinical groups as opposed to Bleuler’s four (excluding the latent schizophrenic). Kraepelin thus gave little succour to either Freud or Bleuler.</p>
<p>Kraepelin’s formulations continued to dissatisfy many. As Meyer Solomon noted in <italic>The Journal of Abnormal Psychology</italic>:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>No one, in the present state of our knowledge of this problem, can give a simple, short, clearly understood and generally accepted definition of what is meant by the term dementia precox. Why? For the simple reason that the problem has not been definitely solved . . . the term is retained for the present to refer to a heterogeneous group of syndromes of many sorts, and in the meantime efforts are being made to understand the conditions now being denominated “dementia precox.” What will eventually happen, let us hope soon? There will be a dismemberment of the so called dementia precox group. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0959354310377821">Solomon, 1917</xref>, p. 197)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Terms employed should, thought Solomon, have a definite meaning. They should stand for something specific, something which can be quickly and clearly defined. When terms cannot so be defined they are not clearly understood.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0959354310377821">
<title>Schizophrenia condensed and reinterpreted</title>
<p>Bleuler, in his 1916 <italic>Textbook of Psychiatry</italic>, ignored Kraepelin’s latest formulation, and continued to maintain his 1911 perspective. In a highly condensed sketch of the concept, he retains the claim of conceptual synonymy with dementia praecox, and now declares of schizophrenia:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It is characterized by a specific kind of alteration of thinking and feeling, and of the relations with the outer world that occur nowhere else. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0959354310377821">Bleuler, 1916/1924</xref>, p. 373)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Such a loose characterization extends and foreshadows a confusion, which was now growing, as to what precisely usage of the term schizophrenia implied.</p>
<p>In that same year, 1924, however, <italic>Lang’s German-English Dictionary of Medical Terms</italic> would once more lend support to Bleuler defining <italic>Schizophrenie</italic> as, “f. dementia praecox, schizophrenia” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0959354310377821">Meyers, 1924</xref>, p. 477). This followed earlier official support for the claim to synonymy by the classification board of the American Medico-Psychological Association. Hence, in the psychiatric domain, schizophrenia was already making firm inroads in its claim to being synonymous with dementia praecox, even if strictly speaking this was inaccurate, and even though a precise understanding of what schizophrenia meant eluded consensus.</p>
<p>Despite official support in North America, Bleuler’s reformulation of dementia praecox and his equating of the term with schizophrenia, in hindsight, now ran into obvious difficulties. In a still largely <italic>laissez-faire</italic> field of science with multiple taxonomic schemas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0959354310377821">APA, 1952</xref>), many authors would put forward their own interpretations, gravitate towards the ideas of other thinkers, or indeed lay undue emphasis on certain tenets of Bleuler’s theory.</p>
<p>For example, though it has been widely noted that Bleuler considered disease processes to underlie the group of schizophrenias, “the group includes several diseases” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0959354310377821">Bleuler, 1911/1952</xref>, p. 8), he also speculated that an outside possibility existed that schizophrenia may have pure psychological origins. Thus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0959354310377821">Travis (1924)</xref>, who used the terms dementia praecox and schizophrenia interchangeably in the <italic>Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology</italic>, may not have alarmed everyone with his formulation:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Nearly all writers are agreed that dementia praecox is characterised by negativism, detachment of interest from the outer world, auto-eroticism, expelling from the ego the impulses that have become unpleasant, shrinking of the ego, projection, and resistance to environmental factors. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0959354310377821">Travis, 1924</xref>, p. 292)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Yet this distinctly Freudian, and profoundly psychological reading of the disorder, once again overextends the particulars in respect to theories of psychogenesis and the self-acknowledged influence of Freudian theory in Bleuler’s work. Indeed, it carries it to its logical end: characterising the disorder solely in psychoanalytic terms. Schizophrenia was rapidly becoming much more psychological than Bleuler had ever intended.</p>
<p>Moreover, not everyone would accept Bleuler’s nascent concept in sum or in part. Biologists to name but one group were slow to renounce the term dementia praecox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0959354310377821">Hoskins, 1946</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0959354310377821">Kopeloff, Kopeloff, Hinsie, &amp; Etchells, 1935</xref>). Therefore, for a time at least, the concepts of dementia praecox and schizophrenia ran in parallel.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0959354310377821">
<title>Definition in flux</title>
<p>By 1929, thanks to idiosyncratic interpretations of the term, a preference for dementia praecox or a confused blending of both meant that the definition of schizophrenia remained in flux. As psychiatrist Charles Macfie Campbell of the Boston Psychopathic Hospital noted, “the term schizophrenia as used in one clinic may bear with it assumptions and suggestions which it may not have in another clinic” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0959354310377821">Campbell, 1929/1934</xref>, p. 51).</p>
<p>Similarly, Jacob Kasanin and Moses Kaufman give four separate connotations:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Schizophrenia is a concept of many connotations. To a great group of psychiatrists the term still means the rigid definition of Kraepelin’s dementia praecox. To others the fundamental reaction is the splitting and dissociation of the personality. To still others it is essentially the reaction of a maladapted individual type (A. Meyer). The psychoanalysts consider this syndrome a narcissistic regression psychosis. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0959354310377821">Kasanin &amp; Kaufman, 1929</xref>, p. 310)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Later researchers would further observe that not all workers even <italic>within</italic> the same clinic agreed on definitions of schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0959354310377821">Zubin, 1961</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0959354310377821">
<title>Disentangling the confusion</title>
<p>Given the ongoing flux, it is no surprise that in 1934 Howard C. Warren of Princeton University in his <italic>Dictionary of Psychology</italic> would attempt to disentangle the two ideas:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Schizophenia = syn. For dementia praecox (Bleuler). (Literally “splitting of the mind.” Schizophrenia has largely replaced dementia praecox in scientific usage. . . . Somewhat broader than dementia praecox, since it includes, on the basis of dissociative symptoms, cases that would scarcely have received the earlier designation). (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0959354310377821">Warren, 1934</xref>, p. 241)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Warren’s exaggerated, but soon to be true, declaration that dementia praecox has largely been replaced marks the beginning of the end of dementia praecox. Nevertheless, schizophrenia continued to change. Hence, Isabella Wilson in <italic>The Lancet</italic> can be found informing readers that,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>schizophrenia, which included the form of illness known to some as dementia praecox, might present some of the following features . . . a physique slender and “asthenic” or dysplastic. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0959354310377821">Wilson, 1935</xref>, p. 327)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In doing so, Wilson references Ernst Kretschmer’s hypothesised physiognomic theory of schizophrenic body types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0959354310377821">Kretschmer, 1921</xref>). This theory linked body type (asthenic, athletic, pyknic), with disorder. It was deemed to have some diagnostic utility and held sway over many psychiatrists until critiqued in 1938 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0959354310377821">Farber, 1938</xref>). Wilson’s account as such, deters the modern observer from naively viewing a chronological series of psychiatric definitions, as a process of adjustment and refinement.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0959354310377821">
<title>Further variations</title>
<p>Further variants in definitions continued to emerge. In 1938, J. Louise Despert working from material presented the previous year at the First International Conference in Child Psychiatry in Paris, observed that schizophrenia was a disease process accompanied by specific phenomena of dissociation and regression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0959354310377821">Despert, 1938</xref>, p. 366). Bradley, in <italic>Childhood Schizophrenia</italic>, would observe rather over inclusively that, of Despert’s definition, “many workers would find no fault” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0959354310377821">Bradley, 1941</xref>, p. 7). Bleuler himself did not give any prominence to regression in his 1911 work, and as such this reading once again indicates the continued growth and competing influence of psychoanalytic thinking, which itself was splitting into various strains by the mid-20th century.</p>
<p>If Bleuler’s influence was waning, Kraepelin’s concept—though still in use—was having even less success. Attempts to differentiate dementia praecox and schizophrenia had become increasingly futile and the confusion ineluctable. By 1940 in their <italic>Psychiatric Dictionary</italic> psychiatrists Hinsey and Shatzky would note that schizophrenia was, “commonly synonymous with dementia praecox” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0959354310377821">Hinsie &amp; Shatzky, 1940</xref>, p. 475). Not that these authors were about to help reduce confusion by their elevation of the importance of “cosmic identity” as a symptom. Cosmic identity—a fundamental reality to which all our reason must conform—can be traced to the philosophical writings of Constance Naden (1858–1889). It is presented by the authors in their description of dementia praecox as something akin to a behavioral state: “The outstanding symptom of the simple form is withdrawal from reality; of the hebephrenic is cosmic identity; of the paranoid is persecution; of the catatonic is physical expression of negativism or positivism” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0959354310377821">Hinsie &amp; Shatzky, 1940</xref>, p. 151). Notably they also draw attention to “morbid concepts” such as homosexuality, which, “form the framework for the new and phantastic [sic] universe to which the patient adjusts himself” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0959354310377821">Hinsie &amp; Shatzky, 1940</xref>, p. 150) and “characteristics of primitive mentality,” such as bisexuality.</p>
<p>Definitions giving more emphasis to the various subtypes of the disorder now emerged, but these served only to complicate matters. Richard Hutchings, Professor of Clinical Psychiatry at Syracuse University gave schizophrenia as dementia praecox and noted:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>dementia praecox (precox) (pree’koks). A psychosis usually appearing before middle life and characterized by introversion, repressed affect and interest. See hebephrenia; heboidophrenia; catatonia; paranoid dementia praecox. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0959354310377821">Hutchings, 1945</xref>, p. 68)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Heboidophrenia [sic], a term rejected by Bleuler, was characterised as the simple type of dementia praecox. By this definition, Kraepelin’s dementia praecox now served as rubric for a compromise mishmash of Bleulerian and Kraepelinian subtypes.</p>
<p>Further facilitating both eclecticism and confusion in some quarters was the continued belief, as expressed by Curran and Guttman (with a passing admission to their readers that a dialogue of definitions was ongoing), that schizophrenia was not to be considered a unitary disease:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The discussion on the definition and delimitation of the schizophrenias is not yet closed. Difficulties arose because some writers used the term schizophrenia as the name of a disease . . . It is now more usually applied to a clinical syndrome. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0959354310377821">Curran &amp; Guttman, 1946</xref>, p. 136)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In doing so, Curran and Guttman sought to explain the disagreement over what exactly constitutes schizophrenia by arguing that problems had arisen by some psychiatrists neglecting to consider the disorder a syndrome, which was now declared independent of cause course and pathology.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0959354310377821">
<title>A semantic convention?</title>
<p>Perhaps inevitably something more radical had to be considered. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0959354310377821">R. G. Hoskins (1946)</xref> of Harvard Medical School in <italic>The Biology of Schizophrenia</italic> now ventured into such space and posed the rhetorical question, “what is ‘schizophrenia’? Is it an entity or, mayhap, merely a semantic convention?” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0959354310377821">Hoskins, 1946</xref>, p. 70). Hoskins states:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>From the general biological point of view, however, it seems to me that the possibility must still be faced that “schizophrenia” may be an entity by fiat only, as are disorders in general that are delimited merely on a basis of symptoms. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0959354310377821">Hoskins, 1946</xref>, p. 72)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The possibility that the role played by semantics in the definition and concept of schizophrenia might deserve greater consideration had now been put in circulation. Notably this suggestion predates the later doubts of “anti-psychiatry” critics, and their concerns over standards of patient care. One possible source underlying the doubts of the author was the fact that his schizophrenia research group had in fact found it useful, for descriptive purposes, to use the classification of Kraepelin rather than the classification of Bleuler. Deep down the biologist retained an allegiance to Kraepelin.</p>

<sec id="section10-0959354310377821">
<title>Dementia praecox as obsolete</title>
<p>In 1947, Philip Lawrence Harriman of Bucknell University in his <italic>Dictionary of Psychology</italic> notes under dementia praecox that schizophrenia had by now largely, though still not completely, replaced the term. Schizophrenia as a label was now triumphant. Perhaps in part because of this, the dictionary <italic>rejected</italic> any suggestion of synonymy and gave different definitions for both schizophrenia and dementia praecox. Of Bleuler’s schizophrenia, Harriman includes a short history of the victorious concept, in which schizophrenia was, among other things, “quickly adopted,” over dementia praecox:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Schizophrenia: Bleuler’s term (1911) to describe a mental disorder characterised by autistic thinking. The term was quickly adopted in America as being more appropriate than dementia praecox (Kraepelin, 1883). . . . Freud (1911) stated that it is the result of the unconscious homosexual trends; Boisen (1936) said that it is based upon conflicts pertaining to an intolerable loss of self-respect; many writers object to the psychogenic theories and uphold the view that it has an organic pathology. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0959354310377821">Harriman, 1947</xref>, p. 297)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Of course, elements of Kraepelin’s thought could still be found in some corners of psychiatry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0959354310377821">Bellak, 1947/1952</xref>). Nevertheless, by mid-century, in professional domains the <italic>obsolescence</italic> of dementia praecox was being definitively declared. R. MacDonald Ladell, in his <italic>Dictionary of Psychological Terms</italic> declared:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Schizophrenia: A synonym for dementia praecox which has made the former term obsolete, and which has broader application . . . It is a mental disorder often commencing in early youth characterised by an ever increasing fantasy life and a corresponding withdrawal of interest from the world of reality. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0959354310377821">Ladell, 1951</xref>, p. 42)</p>

<p>This declaration of obsolescence was published by <italic>The Psychologist Magazine</italic>. Under the definition of dementia praecox, we find simply “Obsolete see Schizophrenia” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0959354310377821">Ladell, 1951</xref>, p. 11).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0959354310377821">
<title>Post 1950s definitions</title>
<p>By the 1950s, schizophrenia continued to be defined with psychological parameters. 1952, for example, saw the release of <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders</italic>, otherwise known today as <italic>DSM-1.</italic> It characterized the schizophrenic reaction as falling under disorders of, “psychogenic origin, or without clearly defined tangible cause or structural change” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0959354310377821">APA, 1952</xref>, p. 5). As such, the conceptualization of schizophrenia had moved a long way from the concepts of both Kraepelin and Bleuler—which emphasized and assumed a disease process. Nevertheless, it asserted the familiar claim to epistemological lineage; that schizophrenia was synonymous with the term dementia praecox. This shibboleth, or the contradictory alternative that dementia praecox was entirely obsolete, were established readings of psychiatric history, and attempts to disentangle the two concepts from this point enter a period of stasis.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0959354310377821">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Silvano Arieti in <italic>Interpretation of Schizophrenia</italic> pressed the psychogenic theory further, and located the origin of the psychogenic reaction to childhood:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>At this point, we may again attempt a definition of schizophrenia, which takes into consideration regression. Schizophrenia is a specific reaction to an extreme state of anxiety, originating in childhood, and reactivated later in life by psychological factors. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959354310377821">Arieti, 1955</xref>, p. 384)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In the same text Arieti offered a remarkable “re-reading” of Bleuler’s <italic>Dementia Praecox or the Group of Schizophrenias</italic> (finally translated mid-century), in which Bleuler, “delivered a blow to the Kraepelinian concept of Dementia Praecox as a disease entity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959354310377821">Arieti, 1955</xref>, p. 14). Arieti was aware of the fact that Bleuler had spoken of a disease process, but charged that Bleuler was unable to dismiss the possibility of an underlying organic process because he could not explain everything with Freudian mechanisms. For Arieti, schizophrenia as a disease was now firmly rejected in favor of a process whereby “psychogenic factors may unchain a sequence of altered functionality of brain processes, involving even structures” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959354310377821">Arieti, 1955</xref>, p. 432). This was the high water mark of psychoanalysis, and most department chairs of psychiatry in the 1960s were held by psychoanalysts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0959354310377821">Decker, 2007</xref>). However, despite this hegemony, there appeared to be little agreement over <italic>which</italic> psychological characteristics were the most important.

<title>The panchreston</title>
<p>It was, among other things, in this climate of inexactness, interpretability, and loose definition that Thomas Szasz M.D., published his 1957 critique: “The Problem of Psychiatric Nosology” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0959354310377821">Szasz, 1957</xref>). Szasz argued, for a number of reasons, chiefly concerning nosology, that schizophrenia had become an explain-all, a <italic>panchreston</italic>, filling a scientific void. Just like humors and protoplasm, schizophrenia explained little, and worse obscured fundamental problems of psychiatry. As such Szasz called for, “a conceptual clarification of the manifold meanings of the word” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0959354310377821">Szasz, 1957</xref>, p. 409).</p>

<title>Hempel’s contribution</title>
<p>In February 1959, the American Psychopathological Association held a conference in New York on “Problems in Field Studies in the Mental Disorders.” Problems of definition and taxonomy were moving to centre stage; Carl G. Hempel, a Princeton philosopher of science, had been asked to open the meeting.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0959354310377821">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Hempel remarked that for a science to be objective it required that, “the terms used in formulating scientific statements have clearly specified meanings and be understood in the same sense by all those who use them” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0959354310377821">Zubin, 1961</xref>, p. 5). He argued that to avoid deficiencies then prevalent in testing psychodynamic theories, <italic>operational definitions</italic> for scientific terms should be used. In championing operational definitions for schizophrenia, Hempel paralleled earlier comments by psychologist J. S. Beck, “behaviours are our definitions. Schizophrenia is as schizophrenia does. It is out and out operational” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0959354310377821">Beck, 1954</xref>, p. 202). More specifically, Hempel was following P. W. Bridgeman’s operationalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0959354310377821">Bridgeman, 1927</xref>), which had earlier been heavily debated in the <italic>Psychological Review</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959354310377821">Boring, 1945</xref>). Operational definitions allowed for objective criteria to be used in deciding whether a term should be used for a particular case. The then used “praecox feeling,” Hempel chastised, whereby many psychiatrists simply <italic>felt</italic> their patient was suffering from schizophrenia, did not constitute a worthy constituent of an operational definition, because of its lack of objectivity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0959354310377821">3</xref></sup></p>

<title>Searching for a definition</title>
<p>Following Hempel’s presentation, discussions about the meaning, use, and definition of schizophrenia abounded. In the process, the lack of agreement and clarity over the concept of schizophrenia was exposed in full. E. Stengel, Professor of Psychiatry at The University of Sheffield would laud Hempel, and remind psychiatrists that, “A term should be employed in the same way by various observers. Here psychiatry leaves much to be desired. Take . . . schizophrenia. This term is used far from uniformly” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0959354310377821">Zubin, 1961</xref>, p. 25).</p>
<p>Leslie B. Hohman, Professor of Psychiatry at Duke University Medical Centre, similarly complained: “its meanings are so enormously different . . . although we have the same word for it” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0959354310377821">Zubin, 1961</xref>, p. 31). In an afternoon session Erik Strömgren, Professor of Psychiatry at Aarhus University in Denmark, declared, “When, for example the word schizophrenia is used, everybody knows that the word is practically meaningless unless a detailed description is given of the sense in which the author wants to use the word” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0959354310377821">Zubin, 1961</xref>, p. 173).</p>
<p>In yet another discussion, DSM committee member Moses M. Frohlich (Professor of Psychiatry, University of Michigan Medical School), with thoughts partially echoed by E. Eduardo Krapf (Professor of Psychiatry, University of Buenos Aires), revealed an uncertainty very much hidden in the DSM classification and definition:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The clarification of definitions . . . is tremendously important. . . . When schizophrenia is mentioned, it seems to evoke a different concept in everyone. . . . This much difference in the concept of schizophrenia is incompatible with any kind of a common language, with any kind of common understanding, or any kind of camparable [sic] data. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0959354310377821">Zubin, 1961</xref>, p. 87)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Because of this difference, Frohlich later proposed to those in attendance that:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>we each define what we would put in the area of schizophrenia . . . define the limits of these areas and circulate it among ourselves to see whether we agree at least on the definitions to start with. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0959354310377821">Zubin, 1961</xref>, p. 393)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Similar problems with differences in diagnosing schizophrenia, in teaching hospitals and elsewhere, were echoed by programme committee members: Benjamin Pasamanick (Professor of Psychiatry, Ohio State University) and Paul H. Hoch (Professor of Psychiatry, Columbia University).</p>
<p>Dr Brian MacMahon (Harvard School of Public Health), presented an alternative way of understanding the role of definition in schizophrenia by noting, “We are very intent on defining the case before we begin the investigation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0959354310377821">Zubin, 1961</xref>, p. 191). For MacMahon, definition would be the outcome and endpoint of investigation. In contrast, Frederick C. Redlich, Professor of Psychiatry, Yale University, argued that:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>we should try to start out with simple definitions and go to work, and in the case of schizophrenia it is very clear that we should stick to nuclear schizophrenias, the real schizophrenias, and leave out all the fringe enterprises of American psychiatry for the time being. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0959354310377821">Zubin, 1961</xref>, p. 203)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The idea of nuclear schizophrenia referenced by the Yale Professor, first appears in the work of Jacob Kasanin and Moses Kaufman in 1929 as a synonym for “typical schizophrenia” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0959354310377821">Kasanin &amp; Kaufman, 1929</xref>). However, it was quickly critiqued. E. von Domarus (also of Yale) in the presence of Kasanin had asked:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Dr. Kasanin speaks of nuclear cases; but here, so it seems to me, lies the central clinical difficulty. What are the central nuclear groups? Is there any symptom in schizophrenia that would be-all by itself pathognostic? Or is there no such symptom, and does the diagnosis depend on a syndrome of symptoms? (as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0959354310377821">Kasanin, 1933</xref>, p. 126)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>By 1961, with such a critique unresolved, nuclear schizophrenia continued to be somewhat aspirational in nature. Ørnulv Ødegaard, Professor of Psychiatry at the University of Oslo, argued that in psychiatry, “all definitions are more or less pragmatic. This means they should be judged on their usefulness . . . they should make communication and collaboration as easy as possible” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0959354310377821">Zubin, 1961</xref>, p. 295).</p>
<p>The limitation of pragmatic definitions was soon revealed. In words that would appear to have been seized upon by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0959354310377821">R. D. Laing (1967)</xref>, Brian MacMahon noted:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Dr. Gruenberg, in private conversation I believe—not in the formal meeting—gave an operational definition of a schizophrenic as “a person whom, after I have talked with him for 15 minutes I consider to be a schizophrenic.” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0959354310377821">Zubin, 1961</xref>, p. 334)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>With uncertainty gaining the upper hand, Lothar B. Kalinowsky, Associate Professor of the New York School of Psychiatry, staged a defence of the concept and argued:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>If there are differences as, for instance, in the incidence—supposed incidence—of schizophrenia . . . It is only that people unfortunately do not apply the definition properly, so that the differences in diagnosis seem enormous, and we confuse the statisticians completely. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0959354310377821">Zubin, 1961</xref>, p. 351)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another defence was proposed by associate research scientist, E. I. Burdock of New York State Psychiatric Institute, who argued against over valuing definition and reminded the conference that it was wrong to let lexicographers legislate meaning. In doing so, Burdock had touched on something important; perhaps definition <italic>was</italic> overvalued as a tool of psychiatric practice. This echoed the earlier thoughts of Hempel who stressed that while operational definitions may improve diagnosis they could not be, “generally considered as affording a definition of the concept in question” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0959354310377821">Zubin, 1961</xref>, p. 42). DSM disorders, argued Hempel <italic>confused</italic> definition and diagnosis. In other words, the assumption that definition (irrespective of consensus) was necessary for diagnosis was misplaced. The repercussions of this international meeting, though slow to spread, were immense and operational definitions would ultimately be introduced into psychiatry. Definition would become unnecessary for the classification and diagnosis of schizophrenia.</p>
<p>While these ideas filtered slowly through psychiatry, debates over the definition of schizophrenia remained unexhausted and sometimes covered familiar ground. Moreover, not everyone would be happy with operational definitions. Epidemiologist and psychiatrist Ernest M. Gruenberg later warned that, “some operational definitions are circular, imprison our thinking, and obscure issues” (as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0959354310377821">Gottesman &amp; Shields, 1972</xref>, p. 12). Others could complain of “measurement by fiat” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0959354310377821">Ingleby, 1981</xref>, p. 31).</p>

<title>Anti-psychiatry</title>
<p>While this process of reorientation and reconfiguration of definition continued, historically loose definitions of schizophrenia in conjunction with appalling patient treatment remained under sustained attack. Psychiatrist R. D. Laing openly declared, “Schizophrenia is the name for a condition that most psychiatrists ascribe to patients they call schizophrenic” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0959354310377821">Laing, 1967</xref>, p. 139).</p>
<p>Support for Laing’s perspective on the social contexts involved in acquiring a diagnosis of schizophrenia, came from self-proclaimed “anti-psychiatrist” David Cooper in <italic>Psychiatry and Anti-Psychiatry</italic>. He defined schizophrenia as:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>a micro-social crisis situation in which the acts and experience of a certain person are invalidated by others . . . then confirmed (by a specifiable but highly arbitrary labelling process) in the identity “schizophrenic patient” by medical or quasi-medical agents. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0959354310377821">Cooper, 1970</xref>, p. 16)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>By micro-social Cooper refers to a finite group of persons in face-to-face interaction—persons who look at, and are looked at by each other. Laing and Cooper, each in their own way, and together, simultaneously proposed solutions to dealing with the social problems of individuals labelled with schizophrenia. In doing so, they contributed to an atmosphere of renewed scrutiny over what exactly constituted schizophrenia.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0959354310377821">
<title>Improving definition</title>
<p>One approach to growing self-doubt over definition, which remains as popular today as it is unsuccessful, was to search for biological markers to define schizophrenia with the techniques of molecular biology. “We have presented briefly some molecular biological concepts to help define schizophrenia because this would appear to be the pathway for the future” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0959354310377821">Teller &amp; Denber, 1968</xref>, p. 110).</p>
<p>A second approach was simply to offer only a historical definition. Leland E. Hinsie and Robert Jean Campbell, in their <italic>Psychiatric Dictionary</italic>, now observed, “The concern about mental health issues that gripped the nation in the 1960’s forced new perspectives in psychiatry” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0959354310377821">Hinsie &amp; Campbell, 1970</xref>, p. v). As such, they now provided eight pages of historical definitions concerning “the schizophrenias,” which allowed the discerning psychiatrist to choose, in a schizophrenia à la carte fashion, just what was and was not to be defined as schizophrenia.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0959354310377821">
<title>Thought disorder</title>
<p>By <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0959354310377821">1968</xref>, the American Psychiatric Association’s DSM-II still studiously avoided the term disease, but characterised schizophrenia, among other things as, “a group of disorders manifested by characteristic thinking, mood, and behaviour” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0959354310377821">APA, 1968</xref>, p. 33). Notably it declared of the “schizophrenias” that, “mental status is attributable primarily to a thought disorder” (p. 33). This promotion of thought disorder to the pantheon of core schizophrenic symptoms has a long history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0959354310377821">Berrios, 1996</xref>). It predates schizophrenia and was in a weak sense reconceptualized by psychiatrists such as Bleuler into loosening of associations. After the decline in associationistic thinking, a 1927 paper by von Domarus (influenced by Vygotsky) marked its re-emergence in the schizophrenia literature. Psychiatrist John K. Wing would later argue it was not synonymous with schizophrenia. Thought disorder occurred in many other disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0959354310377821">Wing, 1978</xref>). Perhaps in part because of the ambiguity over thought disorder (in conjunction with a somewhat eclectic and elastic taxonomic schema) new definitions continued to be formulated.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0959354310377821">
<title>The need for a heuristic device</title>
<p>By the early 1970s the problem of the definition of schizophrenia remained extant. Robert E. Kendell, again complained, “Unfortunately, although we all use the term schizophrenia there is no clear consensus about precisely what is implied” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0959354310377821">Kendell, 1972/1975</xref>, p. 11). Kendell outlined a series of intra-national and international discrepancies in diagnosis rates and argued in the spirit of Hempel:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The only solution to these problems is to provide an operational definition of the term schizophrenia. . . . It must provide precise rules of application enabling a firm decision to be made in every case on whether or not the criteria for the diagnosis are satisfied. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0959354310377821">Kendell, 1972/1975</xref>, p. 13)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Even by now, not everyone at this stage agreed on the necessity for operational definitions. This could be seen even in seemingly “harder” areas of core genetic research. Irving I. Gottesman and James Shields in <italic>Schizophrenia and Genetics</italic>, clearly believing their own investigations were not hindered by a lack of definition, argued that that “the syndrome of schizophrenia enjoys the status of an ‘open concept’ . . . and need not be strictly defined operationally in order to retain its legitimacy as a concept” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0959354310377821">Gottesman &amp; Shields, 1972</xref>, p. 12).</p>
<p>But Gottesman and Shields were in the minority. Though the distinction between operational definitions and definition was not always clear to many authors, the need for improving diagnosis was now a firm conviction, and that, “the general lack of precision in definition . . . contributes substantially to the failings of diagnosis” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0959354310377821">Salzinger, 1973</xref>, p. 9). However, precision still depended on what you considered you ought to be measuring. Many, like Loren and Jean Chapman (1973) in <italic>Disordered Thought in Schizophrenia</italic>, reasserted this to be thought disorder, which was not without definition problems of its own:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Most writers agree that the central defining symptom of schizophrenia is thought disorder. . . . If one could describe the thought disorder and measure it, he might be better able to establish objective criteria for diagnosing schizophrenia. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0959354310377821">Chapman &amp; Chapman, 1973</xref>, pp. 11–12)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Nevertheless, the idea of thought disorder was gaining credibility. Theodore Lidz similarly noted:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Schizophrenic patients suffer from serious disturbances of thought and communication. This is a matter of definition, for the presence of a thought disorder is the critical, though far from the sole, attribute of that category of psychiatric disorders we term “Schizophrenic” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0959354310377821">Lidz, 1978</xref>, p. 70).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Behind this thin veneer of consensus lay a grimmer truth. The debate over the semantics of schizophrenia had still not ended, and attacks by Szasz and others meant that the concept was still being vigorously reconceptualised. All this could lead, for Shershow at least, to a detached but revealing bemusement:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I often think these days, as I used to in studying syphilis in medical school, that I could learn a lot from schizophrenia—if only I could find a case of it! The point, of course, is that the definition of “schizophrenia” has varied tremendously throughout modern psychiatric history, not to mention the period prior to the modern era. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0959354310377821">Shershow, 1978</xref>, p. 4)</p>

<sec id="section19-0959354310377821">
<title>Refinement through consensus?</title>
<p>By 1980, critics such as Theodore R. Sarbin and James C. Mancuso were refusing to accept schizophrenia as a known or knowable entity. Instead, schizophrenia was a moral verdict masquerading as a medical diagnosis on norm-violating behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0959354310377821">Sarbin &amp; Mancuso, 1980</xref>). For others, in contrast, some gloss had to be put on the instability of the definition. Herbert Weiner in the <italic>Comprehensive Textbook of Psychiatry</italic>, while criticising the idea of a schizophrenia spectrum as too broad, viewed the 1970’s as a period of refinement through consensus, “. . . a time when many investigators are trying to refine its definition by developing a consensus along more restricted lines” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0959354310377821">Weiner, 1980</xref>, p. 1121).</p>
<p>Though the achieving of social consensus appears to play an important role in ensuring the stability of concepts in science, the idea of refinement through <italic>consensus</italic> by 1980 appears inherently fragile in this case. In the very <italic>same</italic> volume, Otto Allen Will Jr., would complain: The term “schizophrenia” is not easy to define; it has an elusive quality, and whatever is said about it is in some ways unsatisfactory . . . schizophrenia as medically defined can properly be called the grave psychosis” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0959354310377821">Will, 1980</xref>, p. 1217).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-0959354310377821">
<title>DSM-III</title>
<p>By 1980, DSM-III arrived with its long gestating operational procedure for diagnosing schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959354310377821">APA, 1980</xref>). In doing so, it introduced the “schizophrenic disorders” and embraced a neo-Kraepelinian agenda (citing Schneider and influenced by growing genetic evidence), which once more asserted the primacy of schizophrenia as a disease. However, dissenting viewpoints had not gone away. In a 1984 definition of schizophrenia given by Howell and Osborn, which largely corresponds to that of Bleuler, not DSM-III, the authors revealed that, “Such disorders have been described with varying accuracy for over twenty centuries, but disagreements on aetiology, diagnosis, and classification are still widespread” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0959354310377821">Howells &amp; Osborn, 1984</xref>, p. 833). One continuing source of dissent was that even now not everyone favoured the idea of schizophrenia as a disease. Frank J. Bruno, in his <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0959354310377821"><italic>Dictionary of Key Words in Psychology</italic> (1986)</xref>, declared that schizophrenia was a functional disorder (i.e., no obvious pathology at the biological level). And yet other definitions continued the old tradition of attempting to integrate, standardize, or popularise new theoretical dispositions or ideas. Mike Cardwell’s definition of schizophrenia in his <italic>Dictionary of Psychology</italic>, for example, introduced positive and negative symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0959354310377821">Cardwell, 1986</xref>, pp. 204–205).</p>
<p>Pondering on how to choose between definitions, psychiatrist Ian Brockington would state that there was a “Babel” of discordant definitions and that, “There is no use appealing to authority, since the leading authorities (Kraepelin, Bleuler, Schneider) disagree; <italic>that would make schizophrenia a social rather than scientific concept</italic> [emphasis added]. It is not easy to find suitable criteria for choosing between definitions” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0959354310377821">Brockington, 1985</xref>, p. 173). Hence, for this author, refinement of concepts and improvement of methods were necessary.</p>

<title>Different meanings in different places</title>
<p>By 1987, Richard E. Kendell, Professor of Psychiatry at Edinburgh University, in the <italic>Oxford Companion to the Mind</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0959354310377821">Gregory, 1987</xref>) summed up, as he saw it, the problem of definition persisting among some progress in diagnosis:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>In the last decade, the adoption of unambiguous operational definitions, at least for research purposes, has reduced the confusion; though the coexistence of several alternative ways of defining the term still means that a diagnosis of schizophrenia may have a somewhat different meaning in different centres. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0959354310377821">Gregory, 1987</xref>, p. 698)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Thus as 20th century psychiatry drew to a close, the much recognized problem of definition escaped resolution. The observation by Kendell echoes that of the earlier mentioned Campbell as far back as 1929 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0959354310377821">Campbell, 1929/1934</xref>, p. 51).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Taken individually, definitions present an effective façade of knowledge and an illusion of certainty in Anglophonic schizophrenia research. However, to see definition as simply objective scientific facts, the reflection of natural kinds, or the sum of a progressive accumulation of knowledge is an act of self-deception. In fact, when viewed chronologically, we have seen how changing definitions served as social interfaces to the negotiation of the meaning of schizophrenia, and among other things, as tools of pedagogy and theoretical expression.</p>
<p>This examination shows the historical eclipsing of the label dementia praecox. This was not so much by Bleuler’s concept of schizophrenia, but by the rise of the label schizophrenia. This, in its own right, also created a superficial illusion of progress. However, other than serving as a vehicle for theoretical conjecture, progress as manifested through definition was slight. Instability in definition was the norm. Only when consensus over the nature of schizophrenia eluded them, did some investigators belatedly begin to look more closely at their terminology, assumptions, and modes of expression. And eventually, 20th-century conceptualization of schizophrenia in North America witnessed an epistemological shift from competing individual definitions to group sanctioned operational definitions. In doing so, it abandoned an implicit reliance on definition (historically modeled on concept formation in geometry) as a way of representing or conceptualizing schizophrenia, for a more explicit operationalism mixed with a convenient pragmatism.</p>
<p>Clearly, at least through <italic>definition</italic>, schizophrenia has not been a stable transhistorical object. This supports and extends similar conclusions elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0959354310377821">Berrios, Luque, &amp; Villagrán, 2003</xref>). Therefore, in all likelihood, schizophrenia definition historically <italic>concealed</italic> natural kinds. Schizophrenia was frequently not, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0959354310377821">Hacking (1999)</xref> might say, determined by the nature of things; it was not inevitable; we could easily still be debating dementia praecox. Of course, scientific concepts can in principle function effectively without explicit definition, and some schizophrenia researchers now talk qua pragmatism of open concepts. Yet against a background of historically specious schizophrenia treatment, such variance is unsettling.</p>
<p>This analysis must caution however against overstating the importance of fluctuating definition in assessing the ontological status of contemporary interpretations of schizophrenia. While the schizophrenia of Bleuler may be attacked for failing to meet necessary and sufficient conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959354310377821">Boyle, 2001</xref>), an open concept model of schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0959354310377821">Gottesman &amp; Shields, 1972</xref>), or a DSM operational approach, often seem to sidestep this criticism. Each interpretation of schizophrenia is historically constituted in a subtly different manner. Therefore, it is important any assessment recognize the historical assumptions and limitations each embraces. In particular, an historical and ongoing mutation in the epistemological standards of the behavioral sciences ensures that our understanding and assessment of the ontological status of each manifestation of “schizophrenia” will continue to be predicated on, and complicated by, changing and heterogeneous beliefs concerning what <italic>constitutes</italic> and what <italic>constituted</italic> conceptual validity.</p>
