<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>We appreciate the comments and welcome the opportunity to address them in a response. As indicated in the original article,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0890334412448643">1</xref></sup> the study was conducted during the years 2005 and 2006. Because of that, comparison of our results to national statistics obtained during a similar period seems more appropriate. As referenced in our article, in Peru 53% of children 4-5 months of age were exclusively breastfed at the time of the 2004–2006 national survey;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0890334412448643">2</xref></sup> however, and although not mentioned in our article, this prevalence dropped to 13% in children who were 6-7 months of age.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0890334412448643">2</xref></sup> In our 6-month-old group, 35% were being breastfed exclusively. Thus, is the prevalence we reported lower than that at the national level? That is hard to know given the data available to the public.</p>
<p>If the concern raised refers to comparability to breastfeeding practices in Lima specifically, unfortunately, the final report of the national survey does not describe exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) prevalence by departments, but EBF median duration in Lima was reported (2.9 months), and it was lower than that observed at the national level (3.6 months),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0890334412448643">2</xref></sup> which suggests that EBF rates in Lima were lower than in the nation as a whole.</p>
<p>An important methodological difference that the commenter does not mention is that our assessment of EBF status was done when all children were 6 months of age, and therefore did not include younger children. Infant feeding practices are age specific, with EBF decreasing as age increases; therefore, it is expected that rates for infants ranging in age from 0 to 6 months would be higher than for infants at 6 months of age. Thus, we were puzzled by the high EBF expectations mentioned in the letter.</p>
<p>It was also mentioned that selection of women who planned to breastfeed exclusively is another reason to expect a higher EBF prevalence. However, intention to breastfeed exclusively was almost universal in this setting (Baby-Friendly hospital related?), which is why only 4 women were excluded because of that criterion. We do agree with the comment about the potential relation between compliance with the 10 steps in a Baby-Friendly hospital and breastfeeding outcomes, but it was beyond the scope of this particular study to assess the hospital’s level of compliance with its Baby Friendly status. That, itself, would warrant another study.</p>
<p>We did not intend our results to be taken as a landmark for public health decisions. As stated in our article, our results have limited generalizability. However, we do believe that our results can assist EBF promotion efforts in similar settings.</p>
