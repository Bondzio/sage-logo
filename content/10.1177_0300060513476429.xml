Men and women aged 25–74 years and who had had sexual intercourse at least once within the previous 12 months were eligible for inclusion.</p><p>Local authorities in the participating countries determined that independent review board approval was not required for this study.

In Israel, respondents were sampled using a door-to-door method and completed online or paper self-administered questionnaires. In Turkey, respondents were sampled using street intercepts and completed a paper self-administered questionnaire. The questionnaire was completed in the local language of the country in which the respondent was surveyed. The questionnaire was developed by Harris Interactive Inc., in close collaboration with Pfizer Inc. and in consultation with experts in the field. The questionnaire comprised closed-ended questions only, with one validated question (Erection Hardness Scale; EHS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0300060513476429">14</xref></sup>). The questionnaire was designed to evaluate: (i) overall health and wellness; (ii) importance of and satisfaction with various aspects of life, intimate relationship, sexual experience and sexual performance; (iii) general attitudes about sex; (iv) attitudes about men’s sexual health; (v) frequency of and satisfaction with sexual intercourse; (vi) attitudes and perceptions of suboptimal erection; (vii) level of interest in improving sexual experience; (viii) usage of and satisfaction with treatments for improving erectile function; (ix) physician–patient dialogue concerning erectile function. The wording of the questions was appropriately adjusted, based on gender. The questionnaires were translated into local languages by at least two independent, native speaking, professional translators. A variety of rating scales was employed during the course of the survey as follows: (i) importance scale; (ii) satisfaction scale; (iii) agreement scale; (iv) personal relevance scale.</p><p>Where relevant, respondents were placed into one of four groups based on the hardness of their or their partner’s erection during sexual intercourse, using the EHS:<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0300060513476429">14</xref></sup> grade 1 defined the penis as larger but not hard; grade 2 defined the penis as hard but not hard enough for penetration; grade 3 defined the penis as hard enough for penetration but not completely hard; grade 4 defined the penis as completely hard and fully rigid. Respondents who reported having ‘EHS grade 3’ (EHS 3) were referred to as having ‘suboptimal erection hardness’, while respondents reporting ‘EHS grade 4’ (EHS 4) were referred to as having ‘optimal erection hardness’.

This suggests that improving erectile function may be an important factor in the sexual experience and an individual’s overall satisfaction in their personal life. Yet, while highly effective oral drugs for improving erection hardness have been available for many years,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0300060513476429">15</xref></sup> in this study only a small proportion of men (8%) were found to be using such drugs to improve their erection, sexual experience, sexual satisfaction and overall happiness in life.</p><p>Interestingly, although as expected, sexual intercourse becomes less frequent with increasing age, the proportion of women satisfied with the frequency of sexual intercourse (or ‘having the right amount’ of sex) appears to increase with age. It has previously been reported that satisfaction with sex is a vital aspect of life satisfaction for women of all ages.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0300060513476429">13</xref></sup> Thus, the greater satisfaction experienced by older women may purely reflect the lack of any age limits when it comes to the sexual needs of women; alternatively, it may also suggest that as women age they take greater satisfaction from their existing sexual encounters, even though such encounters may be less frequent in nature.</p><p>As seen in the GBSS,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0300060513476429">2</xref></sup> another key finding of this present study was the importance that both men and women attribute to sex. Sex was seen to be ‘very important’ or ‘absolutely essential’ in the lives of the majority of men and women surveyed. However, compared with other life priorities, sex ranked only eighth in the list of priorities for women (compared with third for men). More than two-thirds of the women surveyed reported that they found family life, overall physical health, being a parent, love and romance to be ‘absolutely essential’ or ‘very important’, but only 55% gave the same importance rating to sex. This finding suggests that men clearly attribute more importance to sex than women, who consider many other aspects of life to be more important than sex. Similar differences in expectations are frequently encountered in couples receiving marital or sexual therapy. This present study also observed a difference in behaviour between males and females when seeking advice from their physician. During consultations, significantly more men than women reported having discussed their or their partner’s sexual health. In this present study, and in line with previous studies, very few individuals sought medical help for such disorders.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0300060513476429">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0300060513476429"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0300060513476429"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0300060513476429"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0300060513476429">20</xref></sup></p><p>The findings of this current survey also suggest that less than 10% of men have used a treatment to improve their sexual experience, whether it is a herbal or complementary remedy, a nutritional food supplement, or a pharmaceutical agent. However, caution is required when interpreting these findings: many men are often too embarrassed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0300060513476429">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0300060513476429">22</xref></sup> to speak with their local general practitioner and may use unregulated sources to obtain such agents. As a result of illicit trade,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0300060513476429">23</xref></sup> the true number of medications being used may never be fully known. In this current study, only a small percentage of men surveyed used treatments to improve their sexual experience; thus, increasing patient awareness of the different treatment options is seen as an important step to improving sexual experience.</p><p>It was also interesting to note that respondents who reported optimal erection hardness (EHS 4) appeared to be in ‘excellent’ or ‘very good’ health compared with those reporting suboptimal erection hardness. This may reflect the common atherosclerotic aetiology of ED, and may serve as an indicator of the patient’s overall vascular health.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0300060513476429">24</xref></sup></p><p>There were several limitations in the present study. As all of the questionnaires were self-administered, they may have been subject to a reporting bias. Respondents could not ask questions if they were unsure of anything being asked and there was the potential for misinterpretation of responses. Furthermore, the terminology used in the questionnaire may mean different things to different people in different cultures. For example, ‘a loving relationship’ may mean one thing to one person and something different to another. Finally, the impact of differences in cultural attitudes to sex on the values reported was not evaluated.</p><p>In conclusion, for both men and women questioned in this present study, satisfaction with sex appeared to be strongly associated with satisfaction with other important aspects of life, including physical health, family life and financial wellbeing. Satisfaction with sex also appeared to be associated with a positive outlook on life, while having good sex was an important aspect of a good loving/intimate relationship. The findings from this large survey, undertaken across Europe and the Middle East, further highlight the importance of all aspects of the sexual experience to both men and women, and the importance of delivering medical treatment to people who experience sexual dysfunction.</p></sec></body><back><sec id="sec8-0300060513476429"><title>Declaration of conflicting interest</title><p>Drs John Dean, Arik Shechter, Arkadiy Vertkin, Petr Weiss and Onder Yaman have all received payment as consultants to Pfizer (Emerging Markets and Established Products), but wish to declare no potential conflicts of interest relating to the work described herein.
