<p>We are delighted to be able to present this extension to the special issue on the musculoskeletal modelling of the lower limb that was published earlier this year in the Journal of Engineering in Medicine (2012, volume 226, issue 2). Two of the articles collected here were submitted in response to the call for articles for the special issue and one was submitted to the journal latterly; all are clearly related to this theme. It is exciting that we work in such a vibrant field that just a few months after the release of one special issue we have enough high-quality material for this addendum.</p>
<p>Almost half of the articles in the previous issue addressed questions relating to the description of musculoskeletal geometry and how this affects the results of a model. The first article in this collection continues in a similar vein with Southgate and colleagues showing that the results of a musculoskeletal model are sensitive to kinematics, subject specific geometry and the parameters of the muscle model employed. Next, there is a review from Escamilla and colleagues which demonstrates the types of clinical insight that can be derived from in silico musculoskeletal modelling. In particular, they suggest guidelines for exercise selection during rehabilitation from cruciate ligament injuries that are derived principally from modelling studies. Finally, an article by Konstantinidis and colleagues should remind us that musculoskeletal models need not only be in silico. Their study explores the necessity of including equivalent muscle forces in proximal femur fracture models, using experimental technologies and artificial bones.</p>
<p>The recent expansion of this field truly brings the prospect of new scientific discoveries about the physics and physiology of locomotion as well as real clinical impact in the areas of surgical planning, rehabilitation, training, and performance. Perhaps the next special issue on musculoskeletal models will demonstrate the clinical results of their use.</p>
<p>We would like to reiterate our thanks to our colleagues, both authors and reviewers, for their continued efforts in bringing these additional articles to publication. We are hopeful that this dedication might lead to more addendums!</p>
