<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In Japan, there are more than 2.2 million foreign residents. Approximately 80% of the elderly foreign population in Japan is of South or North Korean origin. Many Korean residents, specifically those among the first and second generations born in Japan, have lived there long enough to have reached old age. Many first-generation Korean-born Koreans are 80 years old, with growing health and long-term care needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1043659612441027">Ministry of Justice, Japan Immigration Association, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Korean immigration to Japan first came about around the time Japan annexed Korea in 1910 and can be assumed to have started in earnest by 1914, when World War I began. Three thousand Koreans were living in Japan at the beginning of the annexation period, and the numbers increased to 30,000 by 1924 and 300,000 by 1930. When Japanese colonization policies ended after World War II, the majority of the 2,400,000 Koreans living in Japan at that time returned to their homes in the postwar divided country (1950-1953), whereas around 540,000 stayed back. Thus, most elderly Korean living in Japan now were presented with the opportunity to return home after the end of the war. After 30 to 40 years of living in Japan and the division of the Korean Peninsula, some of them did not have a home to return in their birthplace and so they decided to stay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1043659612441027">Kang, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Koreans have immigrated to different parts of the world since the 1920s. The most frequent destination is China, followed by the United States and Japan (The Overseas Koreans Foundation, 2005). The United States has the second-largest Korean-born population, and the health care of elderly people of Korean origin living there has been extensively studied. Research has focused on issues such as elderly Korean immigrants’ lack of awareness about the availability of health care services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1043659612441027">Moon, Lubben, &amp;Villa, 1998</xref>), their low health standards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1043659612441027">Sohn, 2004</xref>), the educational level of Korean immigrants, the duration of their stay in the United States, and their family composition and assimilation to daily life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1043659612441027">Kiefer et al., 1985</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite Japan’s status as the third most frequent destination for Korean immigrants (The Overseas Koreans Foundation, 2005), research on elderly Korean immigrants living there only started in the 1990s. This relative delay suggests the low profile of aging immigrants in Japanese society. Previous studies about elderly Korean immigrants have focused on pensions, social security, the legal system, and social welfare. Little research has been conducted on elderly Korean immigrants’ needs for medical care from a transcultural viewpoint. Some nongovernmental organizations and nonprofit organizations (NPOs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1043659612441027">Hirata, 2005</xref>) have investigated the provision of care for second- and third-generation Koreans, but these studies do not offer sufficient analysis.</p>
<p>To prepare the social foundations that will contribute to meeting the growing requirements of home medical care, a long-term, public care insurance system policy was launched in April 2000. Any elderly foreigner residing in Japan for more than 1 year can benefit from this system. Despite this entitlement, elderly Korean immigrants, like those of many other ethnic minorities, still encounter linguistic, sociocultural, and economic barriers that prevent them from regularly using available care services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1043659612441027">Kakita, 2005</xref>). In response to this situation and following the provisions of an NPO law enacted in 1998, an NPO run by local Koreans opened a center in midwestern Japan in an area well known for its high concentration of Korean residents. The center delivers insurance-based long-term care services adapted to the Korean culture and lifestyle. More than 80% of the users are first-generation Korean women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1043659612441027">Lee, Lee, &amp; Nakamura, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The present study investigated the experiences of first-generation Korean women who use this Korean-oriented, insurance-based, long-term care service. By exploring the decision-making process immigrants follow in choosing to immigrate and the events related to their arrival in Japan, we elucidate how elderly Korean immigrants live in Japanese society from their unique viewpoint.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1043659612441027">
<title>Purpose of the Study</title>
<p>The study was designed to examine and analyze the process by which elderly Korean immigrant women who need day care adjust to their local Japanese community. The analysis is based on their subjective life experiences. At the core, the study addressed two questions: (a) What are the life experiences of elderly female Korean residents who receive day care in Japan? (b) Despite having lived in Japan for a long time, why do elderly female Korean immigrants prefer to use a Korean-oriented day service center in their old age?</p>
<p>The main topic of analysis was “the process of selecting of a Korean-oriented day service center.” We focused on elderly first-generation female Korean residents who had received approval to use insurance-based, long-term care services.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1043659612441027">
<title>Theoretical Framework</title>
<p>We selected the modified grounded theory approach (M-GTA) proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1043659612441027">Kinoshita (2003)</xref>. M-GTA analysis has the following main characteristics: (a) the “researcher’s point of view” is important, (b) phenomena are explained not considering “people” as individual units to be compared but rather by using “topic analysis” and “people-centered analysis,” (c) validity of the analysis of interview data, (d) multiple concurrency of interpretations, and (e) elaboration of concepts from the context rather than building codes from the sections of data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1043659612441027">Kinoshita, 2003</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section5-1043659612441027">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>For the purposes of this study, an “elderly Korean immigrant” is a North or South Korean national aged 65 years or older who immigrated during the period of Japanese colonialism and permanently resides in Japan.</p>
<p>Participants were selected from among elderly Korean immigrants living at home in a single prefecture in Japan. Approval for the study was obtained after explaining the purpose of the study and gaining the cooperation of the manager and chief director of an insurance-based day service center run by an NPO. The chief director introduced the authors to about 20 of the center’s clients who consented to be study subjects.</p>
<p>Selection criteria included mental competence and sufficient Korean or Japanese language ability for daily living. To improve the appropriateness of the interview content, we consulted the center chief director, nurses, and care worker coordinator, all of whom were well acquainted with the clients, and were interviewed in advance concerning the participants’ health conditions. In addition, the authors’ participatory observation field notes and the participants’ care diaries and records were used as reference material.</p>
<p>Although all interviews were conducted following an interview guide (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1043659612441027">Table 1</xref>), the participants were nevertheless encouraged to speak freely. Participant interviews were in either Korean or Japanese, whichever was easier for the participant. Each participant was interviewed once for 120 minutes. With the participant’s permission, we recorded the interviews using an IC recorder. Data were collected between August and October 2009.</p>

<title>Setting</title>
<p>Senior day care facilities offer services ranging from help in bathing and eating, therapy to increase verbal performance, and facilities to improve clients’ diets for those who have cancer or other serious diseases under the supervision of medical specialists. A day care facility managed by Korean residents in Japan, which was set up as an incorporated nonprofit organization and introduces Korean ethnicity in elder care, was selected to conduct the study. To ensure confidentiality an interview room was set up in the center.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1043659612441027">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Participant interviews were transcribed word-for-word and translated into Japanese by a Japanese–Korean bilingual researcher and then back-translated into English by the author and a Japanese–English bilingual collaborator. The transcriptions were read repeatedly to extract data related to the study topic.</p>
<p>Particular attention was given to one case that included abundant information related to the topic. Passages of interest were indexed. They were not broken into sentences or paragraphs but rather used to elaborate concepts, which were then used to form a database.</p>
<p>Concepts were elaborated using an analysis worksheet by which individual concepts were named and defined, and a concrete example of variation was recorded. Discussion notes were also detailed. Whenever a concept was formed during the analysis, a new analysis worksheet was designed for the new concept.</p>
<p>When an example of a different class was identified, it was noted in the “variation” column of the worksheet. If no similar examples of the same class occurred, the concept was considered invalid. Examples were listed and contrasted; when there were several similar concrete examples, they were combined into a concept. Each concept was carefully examined to see if it actually explained the data.</p>
<p>A database was constructed containing the information. In this process, comparative analysis and addition and combination of concepts continued, and care was taken to ensure that the source of data was identified and retained. Groups of several related concepts were formed into categories, with mutually related concepts forming core categories. We then summarized the data into sentences.</p>

<sec id="section8-1043659612441027">
<title>Ethical Considerations</title>
<p>The study received approval from a university-based research ethics committee in August 2009. The study was approved by the manager of the Korean senior care center and was conducted after obtaining signed consent from each participant. To guarantee confidentiality, the names and addresses of participants were not disclosed.</p>

<title>Participant Characteristics</title>
<p>Because three participants had health problems and three withdrew from the study, the final sample consisted of 14 participants.</p>
<p>The mean participant age was 83.9 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 3.7). Twelve of the 14 participants were widows who lived alone.

<title>Categories and Concepts</title>
<p>During analysis of the data using the analysis worksheets (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1043659612441027">Table 3</xref>), Case 1 provided the basis for 10 of the concepts included in the database. The other 13 cases were analyzed by comparing them with those in the database. We arrived at theoretical saturation in the identification of one final core category, related to self-awareness, and five other subcategories. Thirteen concepts related to specific background factors were extracted. We designated the core category to be “conservation of ethnic identity.” The subcategories were (a) loneliness, (b) returning to one’s homeland culture, (c) physical decline as a result of aging, (d) family ties, and (e) a place to which one belongs. Each of the subcategories is explained by specific background factors extracted from the concepts. Below are some story lines that illustrate the association of the subcategories with the core category (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1043659612441027">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Story Lines</title>
<p>We used story lines, brief written narratives that illustrate generated concepts and categories, to validate the outcomes of the M-GTA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1043659612441027">Kinoshita, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Elderly Korean immigrant women experience loneliness and physical decline as a result of aging. The Korean-oriented day service center provides them with support through what were identified as “family ties” and a “place where one belongs.” A place where one belongs is a place where returning to one’s homeland culture is possible. The foundations for such awareness were found in the conservation of ethnic identity. The process of adjustment to life in Japanese society was described as the process of searching for “a place where one belongs,” or “a place where hearts and minds can find peace and support.” Thus, conservation of ethnic identity is strongly affected by exchange among fellow countrymen and geographical closeness.</p>
<p>An explanation of the categories we identified based on interviews with the participant follows.</p>
<sec id="section13-1043659612441027">
<title>Conservation of ethnic identity</title>
<p>The concepts of “exchange among fellow countrymen” and “geographical closeness” revealed that the conservation of ethnic identity for North and South Koreans meant the conservation of language, culture, religion, or any other strong expression of basic awareness about nativeness and origin:
<disp-quote>
<p>I have worked for the organization (ethnic group) forever because this is like my hometown. It has not been easy, but I have always lived proudly. My husband and I do not usually speak Japanese, and since our children are going to a vernacular (Korean) school, all of us speak Korean. (Case C)</p>
<p>I crossed the sea with my small child long ago, when we could travel back and forth between Japan and the Korean Peninsula. When the war was over, I wanted to go back, but I could not because I did not have money. I got separated from my parents and brothers. Since becoming old, I have traveled to Korea around five times. My brothers live there. (Case D)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1043659612441027">
<title>Returning to one’s homeland culture</title>
<p>This is a subcategory that originated from three concepts: “adaptation to life culture,” “exchange among fellow countrymen,” and “maladapted experiences.” “Returning to one’s homeland culture” expresses a situation in which aging was associated with a strong desire to return to the values and lifestyle with which one was raised in one’s country of origin; it demonstrates a longing for “a place to exchange among fellow countrymen” and to be where one experiences “adaptation to life culture.” The “maladapted experiences” encountered when using Japanese long-term services may also affect one’s feelings about returning:
<disp-quote>
<p>Once I went to a nearby (Japanese) day service center, but I did not like the food, and I can’t make friends with the Japanese. So I stopped going. I am happy I can speak Korean here. (Case G)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1043659612441027">
<title>Loneliness</title>
<p>“Loneliness” in elderly Korean immigrants was derived from the concepts of “poor social and personal relationships” and “restraint.” Their loss of relationships with neighborhoods and Korean communities may have resulted from the fact that when becoming part of a family, one has to repress one’s own expectations. “Loneliness” in elderly Korean immigrants was derived from the loss of former ties with neighbors and the Korean community and from lack of frequent contact with family members to reduce the burden of caregiving on them:
<disp-quote>
<p>When I come here, all users and staff are very kind. This is a very lively place, and it makes me happy. When I return to my house, nobody is there. It makes me really sad. When I come here, I am sure one of my acquaintances is going to be here. (Case G)</p>
<p>I feel lonely, but If I lived with my son, my daughter-in-law will not only have to take care of my meals and laundry but she will also have to be attentive to my likes and dislikes; I do not want them to be concerned about me. So, I chose to live alone. (Case J)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1043659612441027">
<title>Family ties</title>
<p>Regardless of whether they live together with their children or not, elderly Korean women rely on them. Most children live nearby and provide them with their daily needs as well as giving them psychological, physical, and economic support. This could be interpreted as indicating strong ties with their family members. We observed that relationships and exchange among parents, siblings, and relatives have always existed. This notion originated from the concepts of “support from one’s children” and “separated families.” “Family ties” is one of elderly Korean immigrants’ support pillars:

<p>My eldest son returned to North Korea when he was 17. Many students were returning to our home country then. My uncle returned to Korea. I have many relatives in Seoul too. I came (to Japan) with the intention of returning in three years, but the war ended and I could not meet them anymore. I wanted to return to Korea. I have been to South Korea five times, because my son lives there. (Case N)</p>

<title>Physical decline as a result of aging</title>
<p>With aging comes a remarkable loss of physical functions and the abilities required for daily life and other activities. We found that most elderly people in need of supportive care have experienced past illnesses and are usually suffering from chronic diseases. The main disorders causing the participants of this study to require care were bone and joint diseases. Since these conditions limit activity, they are factors that interfere with autonomy and independence in daily life. Moreover, elderly Korean immigrants presented with a perception that old age leads to interference with daily life and experienced a marked decline in physical strength as they aged:

<title>Ethnic Identity and Returning to One’s Home Culture</title>
<p>A large number of Koreans immigrated to Japan during the forced annexation of Korea by Japan about 100 years ago. Korean migration (voluntary and forced) continued until the end of World War II in 1945. Most Korean residents, including the interviewees of this study, who are now elderly, arrived in Japan after spending the most formative years of the development of their personality and character, from birth to adolescence, in Korea. These Koreans have established a community in Japan, where fellow compatriots can live, sharing culture and history.</p>
<p>Identity is not something one can build by oneself; rather, it is “the acquisition of values and individual lifestyles.” The word “self” here does not mean the subjective selfness that can be discovered through introspection but rather the communality in which an individual finds self-awareness, or the social self that is valued (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1043659612441027">Erikson, Erikson, &amp; Kivnick, 1986</xref>).</p>
<p>It is said that cultural identity develops between the ages of 10 and 14 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1043659612441027">Minoura, 1990</xref>). Thus, first-generation Koreans immigrated to Japan after their cultural and ethnic identities were formed and their homeland memories were recorded in their minds. The collective and individual status of Koreans in Japan has been socially and legally framed by colonial policies and the Korean and Civil Wars. Koreans have borne the hardships of history. They united to establish an ethnic community that started a movement that led to their being granted legal permanent and special permanent residence status to assure their civil rights are respected. The firm relationships created by North and South Koreans living in Japan are also believed to account for their fervent maintenance of their ethnic Korean identity. Many of the participants in this research have been active members of such ethnic organizations, reflecting the importance of such associations.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the passing of generations, changes in social situations, and a legal status that guarantees almost unrestricted activities have helped many members of the Korean community who have resided in Japan for more than 60 years to integrate into Japanese society, build foundations for their lives, and adapt. The preservation of characteristic expressions of ethnic culture such as language, culture, and ceremonies occurred simultaneously with external assimilation into Japanese society. Many Korean nationals have assimilated into Japanese society, but many others have preserved their language, culture, customs, and ethnic bonds.</p>
<p>In addition, many Korean residents have siblings and other relatives in North and South Korea. Since the 1965 Treaty on Basic Relations between Japan and the Republic of Korea restored diplomatic relations, some elderly Korean residents now frequently visit their relatives. Living close to their country of origin provides them with an environment that allows them to maintain cultural and familial ties. From the description above, it could be said that close contact with their community of origin and geographical proximity have had a positive effect on preserving their ethnic identity.</p>
<p>The results of this study showed that although elderly Korean women may have lived in Japan for a long period of time, speak Japanese, and have adapted well to Japanese culture and life, they are strongly influenced in their advanced years by memories of their hometowns and wish to return to their cultural homeland.</p>
<p>Previous research conducted in the United States found similar willingness to preserve identity among elderly Japanese immigrants who had been living in San Francisco for many years and regularly visited a senior Japanese facility. Although they had adapted themselves to living in an English-speaking environment, they often experienced a will to communicate in Japanese, their mother tongue, as they aged. Elderly Japanese speakers felt comfortable when they visited a Japanese facility because they can speak Japanese and taste Japanese food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1043659612441027">Ohno, 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1043659612441027">Kanemoto (2008)</xref> found the same characteristics among elderly Japanese descendents in Brazil.</p>
<p>The desire to return to one’s cultural homeland is a characteristic shared by all aging immigrants independent of the country from which they immigrated. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1043659612441027">Kanemoto (2008)</xref>, the process of adaptation to a different culture in long-stay elderly Japanese people is not a one-sided assimilation process but rather a process compatible with one’s own culture and includes a will to return to the homeland culture as one ages.</p>
<p>A response to the second research question—“Why do elderly Korean immigrant women wish to use a Korean-oriented day service center in their old age, despite having lived in Japan for a long time?”—is that it fulfills, at least in part, their desire to return to the culture of their homeland as they age. It is a place where they share the same language and culture. Their ethnic identity helps them to preserve a strong connection to their country of origin and to their ethnic roots. As they age, they wish to return to the culture of their homeland in a reaffirmation of their ethnic identity.</p>

<title>A Place for Korean Elderly Immigrants in Japanese Society</title>
<p>The process by which elderly Korean women immigrants who need supportive care adjust to Japanese society involves the search for a place where it is possible for one’s heart and soul to share a cultural life with one’s fellow countrymen. The essence of such a place lies in the deep ties that one has with the place of one’s birth and upbringing, and the place in which one is now living; a place where one can accumulate emotional experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1043659612441027">Relph, 1976</xref>).</p>
<p>For elderly Korean immigrant women, the “Korean-oriented day service center” is such a place. Here, they can experience the security and unity they had in the hometowns in which they were born and raised. This is a place that helps them cope either with their reluctance to burden their family members or with the loneliness they want to avoid. In other words, by regularly visiting the day service center, they reduce the burden they impose on their families (rehabilitation, bath, meals) due to their loss of independence and the daily life functions they experience with aging.</p>
<p>The tendency to live in nuclear families is growing in Japan. The percentage of the elderly (aged more than 65 years) who live alone is 22.5%, whereas 29.8% live as couples. Twenty-four percent of those who require help live alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1043659612441027">Cabinet Office, Government of Japan, 2009</xref>). Japanese government institutions have no data regarding elderly Korean immigrant households. According to data collected by the authors, among 112 elderly Korean immigrant day service center clients, 58% live by themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1043659612441027">Lee et al., 2009</xref>). Although family ties are remarkably valued and supporting and taking responsibility for aged parents remains a tradition for Koreans as well as for other Asian communities, the structure of extended families has been changing, and in recent years many elderly Korean immigrants have been living alone.</p>
<p>The majority of participants in this study were living by themselves. They were lonely and experiencing a decline in physical strength due to aging, but at the same time they were feeling anxious that they might be a burden on their families. They were adapting to a foreign culture by making use of the day service, but they also needed to be cared for individually at home.</p>
<p>The program delivered by the insurance-based day care NPO that served as the focal point for this research not only provides support for daily activities but also plays a valid role as a social resource where users find peace for their souls and a place of their own. In midwestern Japan, there are many districts that have large Korean communities, particularly Osaka. This may explain why these types of care activities are expanding in the midwestern area, although they are almost nonexistent in eastern Japan.</p>
<p>Since former Korean immigrant communities and those of related ethnic groups are weakening, extending this kind of program with help from Korean ethnic groups only would be difficult. The effective day care service examined here may serve as an example for local governments, Japanese society in general, groups that support foreigners, and other similar organizations to emulate. Active exchange of information and experience and development of networks to learn about the cultures of immigrants’ home countries will assist in expanding “places to be” as centers of reference.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Elderly Korean women from different ethnic backgrounds who need day care service in Japanese society experience loneliness and a decline in physical strength due to aging. The Korean-oriented day service center provides these women with support through what were identified as family ties and a place where the women belong, enabling them to “return” to their cultural homeland. The foundations for such awareness of belonging were found in the women’s preservation of their ethnic identity. The process of assimilation to life in Japanese society involves seeking out places where one belongs and where hearts and minds find peace and support.</p>
<p>This study suggests that a culturally based day service center supports the need to provide a place for these women to enjoy their mother culture. Furthermore, this study is expected to play an important role in the development of NPO support for improving ethnically conscious elderly care services.</p>

<title>Limitations and Future Challenges</title>
<p>As with all qualitative studies, the results presented here cannot be widely generalized because the study was limited to 14 participants who use a single day service facility. Failure to do back-translations of the interview contents originated in reliance on the Japanese–Korean bilingual researcher who conducted all the interviews. Moreover, lack of inclusion of participants who do not have family in Japan is a limitation. Because resident registry data for elderly foreign residents in Japan is limited, hampering the identification and enrollment of subjects, we had to depend on users of this facility. Random sampling would be inappropriate for this particular design. Future studies should recruit more participants from multiple facilities and include elderly men.</p>
