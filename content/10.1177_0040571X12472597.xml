<abstract>
<p>The method of interpretive phenomenology was used to investigate the responses of twelve young Australian Christian University students to selected writings by Richard Dawkins and Christopher Hitchens. In analysing the interview data, the following six themes emerged: the style is entertaining and humorous; the style is disrespectful and mocking; many of the arguments are perceived as lacking depth and philosophical sophistication; constructive engagement with ‘the other side’ was found to be lacking; the ‘religion poisons everything’ argument cannot be sustained (it’s a human rather than a specifically religious failing); and, finally, the arguments that cast doubt on the historicity and reliability of the biblical accounts are troubling. Though the capacity for critical analysis is variable in the cohort, all of the participants were able to point up serious flaws in the arguments. No one found her- or himself ‘falling under the spell’ of the authors.</p>

<p>My task is to bring a practical theological perspective to the assessment of the work of the new atheists. There are a number of ways in which practical theology is defined. For our purposes in this study, it is construed as the ‘hermeneutics of lived religion’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0040571X12472597">1</xref></sup> A particular segment of lived religion is investigated here – namely, the way in which young Australian Christian university students grapple with the writings of Christopher Hitchens and Richard Dawkins. Twelve students (F = 8, M = 4; av. age = 21) were recruited via a general invitation to my Belief and Unbelief course offered at the University of Queensland. In this introductory level course, influential arguments for and against belief in God are presented and evaluated critically. As part of their assessment for the course, the students who accepted the invitation were asked to read and reflect on portions of Hitchens’s book <italic>God Is Not Great</italic> (<italic>GNG</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0040571X12472597">2</xref></sup> and Dawkins’s book <italic>The God Delusion</italic> (<italic>GD</italic>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0040571X12472597">3</xref></sup> The selections from <italic>GNG</italic> covered the dark side of religion, arguments purporting to show that the metaphysical claims of religion are false, and what Hitchens calls the ‘nightmare’ of the Old and New Testaments. From <italic>GD</italic>, the students read sections on Dawkins’s attempted debunking of arguments for God’s existence, his arguments against God’s existence, and his reasons for his hostility to religion. I carried out semi-structured interviews with the participants to investigate their responses to the readings. I asked the following questions:
<list id="list1-0040571X12472597" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>What did you find interesting or challenging, and why?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What are some questions or thoughts that the reading stimulated?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What did you think were strong arguments?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What arguments did you consider to be weak?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Has reading the material affected your position on the question of God’s existence?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Has reading the material impacted on your understanding of the main beliefs and teachings of the Christian Church?</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>The methodology employed in the research is interpretive phenomenology.</p>
<sec id="sec1-0040571X12472597" sec-type="methods"><title>Methodology</title>
<p>Phenomenology is both a philosophical stance and a research methodology. The aim of its proponents, in broad compass, is to approach an entity on its own terms. Edmund Husserl held that by suspending our habitual or taken-for-granted beliefs about the world (bracketing), it is possible to grasp the fundamental structures in our world of experience. Some researchers who adopt the phenomenological paradigm regard employing an <italic>epoché</italic> or bracketing as a means of achieving objectivity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0040571X12472597">4</xref></sup> While they accept that there is no such thing as value-free research, they claim that an attempt to set aside personal biases, presuppositions and values as fully as possible is an essential requirement in an approach that aims to grasp the lived experience of the participants on their terms.</p>
<p>I, however, follow the approach of another group of phenomenologists that contends that aiming for objectivity through bracketing is misguided and ultimately illusionary.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0040571X12472597">5</xref></sup> This group of researchers takes its lead from Martin Heidegger’s existentialist phenomenology. Heidegger rejected Husserl’s Cartesian approach, according to which the human knower is an observing subject attempting to grasp the deep structure of an object from which she is separated. For Heidegger, the human person is being-in-the-world. That is, she is inextricably related to, lives in and constantly engages with the world that she seeks to know and use. The nature of human existence demands that we live hermeneutically; we have no choice but to find meaning and significance in the things which make up our world. Following in the general Heideggerian line, Gadamer posited that hermeneutic endeavour involves a fusion of horizons.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0040571X12472597">6</xref></sup> In the dialogue between the assumptions and perspectives of the author(s) of the text, on the one hand, and of the interpreter, on the other, understanding is generated.</p>
<p>Those of us who use interpretive phenomenology construe our research as a fusion of the perspectives of the researcher(s) and of the participants. On this view, interviewers and participants ‘co-create the data through interviewer-respondent interaction’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0040571X12472597">7</xref></sup> This process produces a deep understanding of the phenomena under investigation. The personal and cultural horizon of the researcher, far from contaminating the research process, has the potential to enrich data collection and analysis.</p>
<p>In terms of data analysis, each recorded interview was transcribed verbatim and a pseudonym assigned to each participant. Transcripts of initial interviews were reviewed, and missing or unclear pieces of data were identified.</p>
<p>The interpretive work developed through making short summaries. These summaries included excerpts expressive of particular issues and themes. The summaries were searched carefully for evidence of paradigms and exemplars.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0040571X12472597">8</xref></sup> A paradigm is a clear or vivid instance of a particular pattern of meaning. It serves as a ‘marker’ that helps the researcher identify less obvious cases of the same pattern. Exemplars also aid the recognition of other instances of a category of meaning. An exemplar is smaller than a paradigm, but like a paradigm it is also a clear instance of a particular constellation of meaning. It is a vignette or story relating to a constellation that leads the researcher to other constellations that share its essence while containing different external characteristics.</p>
<p>The final phase of the analysis of the data is ‘naming’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0040571X12472597">9</xref></sup> This is a process of coding in which the exemplars and paradigm cases are reviewed in order to identify the central themes that capture the core constellations of meaning articulated by the participants. I have used direct quotes from the participants to express the various themes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0040571X12472597"><title>Findings</title>
<p>I have identified six themes that I believe capture the constellations of meaning in the reports from the research participants. The first refers to the rhetorical skill of the authors.</p>
<sec id="sec3-0040571X12472597"><title>‘They’re rhetorically pleasing and well-written’</title>
<p>Quite a few of the participants used words such as ‘entertaining’ and ‘enjoyable’ to describe their overall reaction to the writings. Nancy (19 yrs old, Seventh Day Adventist) said of Hitchens’s work: ‘I really liked it. It was funny. It made me laugh.’ A number of the participants also indicated that the authors were skilful in the art of persuasion. A typical response is this: ‘Oh, <italic>The God Delusion</italic> was really … I actually enjoyed reading it. Which is a bit weird. But I think that a lot of it has to do with the fact that he is a really good writer … entertaining … He’s good at persuasive writing’ (Enid, 18 yrs old, Pentecostal).</p>
<p>It is important to note that rhetorical flair is identified by Scott Hahn and Benjamin Wiker as critical in relation to the impact of the new atheists. Hahn reports that a colleague of his was deeply troubled by the fact that a number of theology majors in their university were losing their faith after reading <italic>GD</italic>. He goes on to say that: ‘My colleague considered the book to be so poorly argued that it was entirely without danger. But what he didn’t count on … was the power of Dawkins’s rhetoric. As a result, they fell entirely under the spell of his words.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0040571X12472597">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Though there were certainly those in my research group who appreciated the rhetorical skill and wit of the authors, others reacted negatively. These participants expressed disappointment with what was viewed as a mocking, petulant and disrespectful style.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0040571X12472597"><title>‘I think he spoke like an angry teenager’</title>
<p>This comment was made by Maria (22 yrs old, Catholic). She adds this: ‘I’m always happy to have an intellectual discussion about religion. I just think it’s a bit silly if you’re going to yell about it and say, “Aw, it’s stupid. You’re stupid.” That’s what I think Dawkins is doing half the time.’</p>
<p>Betty (21 yrs old, Methodist) had a similar reaction. She considers that objectivity has been thrown out of the window and angry ranting has taken over: ‘They were opinionated, quite mocking a lot of the time, a little bit disrespectful. It’s like they didn’t even bother trying to sound objective. It’s like they know that they’re not really going to convince anyone that God doesn’t exist; they just want to rant.’</p>
<p>Lastly, Lachlan avers that the contempt that Dawkins feels for people of faith blinds him to the cogency of their arguments: ‘The way in which he engages with differing perspectives, the kind of contempt that he seems to feel … it seems to me that he is actually oblivious to them … His opponents, once they have their assumptions, build up a fairly rational system. But he seems to be blind to that.’</p>
<p>Uwe Justus Wenzel observes that the new atheists justify their aggressive, irreverent approach by contending that religion has been accorded too much deference in the past.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0040571X12472597">11</xref></sup> Wenzel goes on to suggest that believers would be well advised to be a little less touchy: if they were, Dawkins et al. might have time to write more intelligent books! This may or may not be the case. However, I didn’t get the impression that the students were being overly sensitive; it is simply that they would have preferred a more respectful and fair engagement with the other side.</p>
<p>Above, reference was made to the rhetorical flair of the authors. Some in the research group expressed the view that this is all Hitchens and Dawkins have to offer. They struggled to find any really good arguments.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0040571X12472597"><title>‘Both of them were more rhetorical than deep and philosophical and well-researched’</title>
<p>Though there was quite a bit of appreciation for the rhetorical flair of the authors, none of the participants were bowled over by the arguments. Three of the participants struggled to identify even one good argument. The majority, though, thought that one or two of the arguments, at least, had force. But they also found a number of holes. Tom (19 yrs old, identified himself as mainstream Protestant) was the least impressed. He reported that he didn’t ‘find any of the arguments very strong’. He was disappointed at the way Dawkins ‘strawmans’ Aquinas. He went on to say that, ‘for someone who knows what Aquinas is trying to do, he [Dawkins] looks a bit foolish’. Tom also expressed disappointment that Hitchens regularly picks quotes that serve his purposes and then sets them up as absolutely authoritative.</p>
<p>Lachlan (32 yrs old, identified himself as a mystic) was critical of what he judged to be excessive subjectivity in Dawkins’s work: ‘I felt that Dawkins was hypocritical in places. He at one point when he was discussing the Bayesian proof for the existence of God … he dismissed that in part because he said that he’s not interested in subjective opinions. But honestly, the entire book is littered with subjective opinions.’ Lachlan also refers to Hitchens building an emotive rather than a rational case.</p>
<p>Other perceived weaknesses were identified. A number of participants referred to an unwarranted ‘faith in science’ or a tendency to ‘worship science’. Chris (18 yrs old, Baptist) commented that ‘Dawkins and Hitchens are installing their faith in something else. They’re installing it in science just as much as I am in faith.’ Faith in science is sometimes referred to by scholars as scientism. For example, Taede Smedes refers to scientism as ‘a cultural mode of thinking’ that represents a ‘tacit faith or basic trust in science’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0040571X12472597">12</xref></sup> But this is a loose way of defining the term. Strictly speaking, it refers to two (highly questionable) assertions. First, an epistemological claim that the scientific method is the only one that is capable of generating knowledge. Second, the ontological claim that the fundamental reality in our universe is matter.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0040571X12472597">13</xref></sup> Paul (18 yrs old, Uniting Church Christian) picks up on the meaning of scientism in the strict sense when he challenges Hitchens’s use of the religion and the blind man in the night analogy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0040571X12472597">14</xref></sup> Paul says, ‘[B]ut I think about it differently. In the daytime, the person with sight sees certain things – you could juxtapose this to science – but he becomes ignorant to things that the blind man is still aware of.’ At this point, I seek a clarification. I ask: ‘Are you saying, Paul, that along with a scientific way of knowing, it’s important to also credit other ways of knowing – a religious way, a poetic way, etc.?’ To which Paul replies, ‘Yeah, well there are those who rely on science in approaching the world, but they can’t hear the birds, kind of thing.’</p>
<p>To give one last example, Enid noted that there is an inconsistency tied up in the authors’ dismissal of religion as irrational:<disp-quote>
<p>I think with the question of religion not being rational, if either of those authors fell in love, that’s not rational. And yet they are still a part of that. There are so many things in this world that are irrational. Everybody in this world is to some extent hypocritical. That can’t be avoided. But with these writers they argue against religion because it is irrational, but they believe in other irrational things.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The literary critic, Terry Eagleton, in his review of <italic>GD</italic> also compares faith and love, but rightly points out that while faith cannot be reduced to rationality there is nevertheless a rational dimension to it. Only the ‘positivists think that “rational” means “scientific”’, he says. Eagleton goes on to claim ‘that while faith, rather like love, must involve factual knowledge, it is not reducible to it. For my claim to love you to be coherent, I must be able to explain what it is about you that justifies it; but my bank manager might agree with my dewy-eyed description of you without being in love with you himself.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0040571X12472597">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Along with criticisms of specific arguments, the general objection of not being even-handed was lodged. It was stated that Hitchens and Dawkins seem almost entirely disinterested in fairly presenting opposing views.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0040571X12472597"><title>‘He doesn’t even give the other side a go’</title>
<p>Chris was concerned that some readers might be ‘unfairly influenced’ because only one side of the argument is provided. Tom considers that this is typical of the new atheist strategy, noting that they fail to introduce scholarly arguments that oppose their own favourite ones. He referred to the way in which Hitchens quotes Stephen Jay Gould on humans being a contingent part of evolution,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0040571X12472597">16</xref></sup> but doesn’t bother to engage with well-known works by writers such as Simon Conway Morris that challenge that view. The fact that Hitchens and Dawkins don’t ‘include some religious person’s standpoint’ and ‘religious experience’, but rather simply look at the issues ‘from their atheist standpoint … from their scientific viewpoint’, was troubling for Kerryn (17 yrs old, Pentecostal). Enid had a similar perspective: ‘They slanted the data to make the arguments. There are good and bad people in religion. But they said very little about the really good people who are religious.’ In his review of <italic>GNG</italic>, Richard Harries observes that even when Hitchens does mention ‘really good people who are religious’, he finds a way to ‘de-Christianize’ them. For example, the faith of Dietrich Bonhoeffer is described by Hitchens as ‘an admirable but nebulous humanism’, and Martin Luther King ‘is assessed primarily on the grounds that his religious rhetoric was a tool required to galvanise the Bible-reading South against racism’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0040571X12472597">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>Above I mentioned some of the approaches or arguments that the participants judged to be weak. There is one such argument that plays such a significant role in the approach of the new atheists, and that was mentioned in so many of the interviews, that I decided that it should be identified through a separate theme. Time and again when asked what presented as weak in the authors’ arguments, the ‘religion poisons everything’ complaint was identified. Typically, the rationale for this assessment was that the dark side of religion should be seen as a human rather than a peculiarly religious failing.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-0040571X12472597"><title>‘It’s a human problem, rather than a religious problem’</title>
<p>When I raised the issue of Hitchens’s idea that religion ‘poisons everything’, Maria responded in this way:<disp-quote>
<p>I’d already thought quite a bit about this before, because it comes up in conversations about religion all the time. I kinda think that it’s not so much a religious thing, a divine thing, it’s a very human thing. I think that if we got rid of religion something would emerge with the same effects. It’s not really to do with religion; religion just happens to be that thing which has enabled it.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>This is typical of what I heard from others. Betty commented that ‘the failure of Christians doesn’t mean the failure of Christianity’. Sounding a different but related note, Nancy stated: ‘I don’t look at those things that Christians did throughout history, or didn’t do, and think, Oh … because he is talking about religion. He doesn’t talk about Christ. I believe in Christ, not in religion.’</p>
<p>Theologians who debunk the New Atheists’ argument that religion is toxic and we would be better off without it, take the same general line as the young students I interviewed. For example, Alister McGrath and Joanna Collicutt McGrath put it this way: ‘All ideals – divine, transcendent, human or invented – are capable of being abused. That’s just what human nature is. And knowing this, we need to work out what to do about it, rather than lashing out uncritically at religion.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0040571X12472597">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>Though this particular argument was easily dismissed by most of the participants, there was one that seemed to really bother a number. Quite a few were struck by the commentary on the large interval of time between the reported events and the appearance of a written record (much less true in the case of the New Testament of course). They also were unsettled by references to historical inaccuracies and internal contradictions in the Bible.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-0040571X12472597"><title>‘Some of the things we take to be pretty fundamental were actually recent additions – that’s probably the most striking thing’</title>
<p>Hitchens calls for a discarding of the ‘Mosaic myths’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0040571X12472597">19</xref></sup> and dismisses the Old and New Testaments as works of ‘crude carpentry, hammered together long after [their] purported events, and full of improvised attempts to make things come out right’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0040571X12472597">20</xref></sup> His attack on the reliability and authority of the Bible was quite unsettling for a number of the participants. Some had never been previously exposed to any critical approach to the Scriptures. Others had been, and were still in the process of struggling to come to grips with what this means for their faith. Chris’s statement on this is typical: ‘If you’re relying on a book for its historical accuracy and it’s not, then it kinda shifts your view. But it’s not enough that I’m not willing to put faith in it.’</p>
<p>Academics are so imbued today with the spirit of historical-critical inquiry that we are in danger of thinking that this has always been the way of it. But of course this approach to the Bible is relatively recent. It began at the beginning of the nineteenth century, and was instigated largely by German scholars such as Gottfried Eichhorn, Ferdinand Christian Baur and Julius Wellhausen. Until the modern era, an allegorical reading of the Bible was a common method. In this approach, the sacred text is ‘treated as a mere symbol, or allegory, of spiritual truths. The literal, historical sense … plays a relatively minor role, and the aim of the exegete is to elicit the moral, theological or mystical meaning which each passage  … is presumed to contain’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0040571X12472597">21</xref></sup> In the end, the Christian historical exegetes may not be too far away from this allegorical approach. Though they do their historical-critical work, what they are primarily interested in is not the literal sense of the text, but rather the theological sense. James Barr puts it this way: ‘[T]he operation of the scholar is … closer to allegorical exegesis than to literal or historical. The literal sense, he knows, is not factually true. But the Bible remains a vehicle of profoundest truth.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0040571X12472597">22</xref></sup> It is an awareness of this reality that is behind the fact that many of us in the academy have long since stopped worrying about the historical inaccuracies and internal contradictions in the Scriptures. But this perspective is not ‘on the radar screen’ of most of the young students.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-0040571X12472597" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Though quite a few of the students are at the beginning of their university careers, they were nevertheless able to bring a critical perspective to the reading of these works by Hitchens and Dawkins. To be sure, the capacity for critical assessment varied. Some were very sharp in their assessments, and others clearly missed a number of fundamental flaws in logic that are very obvious to experienced students of theology and religious studies.</p>
<p>None were bowled over by the rhetoric and arguments. Quite a few reported that some of the arguments of the new atheists really got them thinking and questioning, but their faith was still as strong as ever. Kirsten’s (17 yrs old, Pentecostal) response to my question as to whether there were things in her reading that had shaken her faith captures this well: ‘I suppose there were, but what did impact me was trumped by what I believe.’</p>
<p>One of the things that I emphasize in the Belief and Unbelief class is that there are strong rational arguments for both belief and unbelief but, no matter what argument is mounted, there is always a cogent objection to it. I was therefore very pleased to hear a number of the students comment that though they didn’t have an adequate response to some of the arguments they encountered, they were sure they could find one somewhere. The exercise had spurred them to do some more research on the issues that were raised.</p>
<p>Since all the participants are university students and undertook this exercise as part of an introductory course in philosophy of religion, it is unsurprising that they were able to critique a number of the arguments presented by Dawkins and Hitchens. It is quite striking, however, that their encounter with an historical-critical approach to the Bible caused them so much consternation. It was obvious in listening to them that this was completely new information for them. Clearly, biblical criticism is not part of the conversation in their congregations. That their Christian education is deficient in this regard is most disappointing. Quite apart from anything else, it leaves them, and their fellow parishioners, vulnerable to the new atheists’ rhetoric.</p>
