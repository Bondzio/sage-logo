<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Community-based human rights advocacy practice is a unique approach to community organizing that combines theoretical and practice frameworks from law and community organizing, both of which are concerned with human relationships and their structuring. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0020872812448078">Torczyner (2001)</xref>, ‘human rights advocacy is concerned with the development of a framework and practice that safeguard the rights of all protagonists while promoting equity among claimants’ (p. 86). Social rights such as the right to housing, the right to health and education, the right to social benefits and the right to a decent income, are at the forefront of practice. Individual and community constituents are trained to advocate for entitlements and to maneuver within systems to access rights. In that the practice focuses on universal rights, it is employed in multicultural communities as a mechanism to promote cross-cultural relationships and coexistence.</p>
<p>Community-based human rights advocacy practice is theoretically aligned with the notion of ‘positive peace’, a fundamental concept in the field of peace studies and peace education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0020872812448078">Galtung, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0020872812448078">Moshe, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0020872812448078">Reardon, 1988</xref>). Peace studies scholars assert that ‘positive peace’ entails a process of disbanding structural conditions that foster systematic inequities and societal injustice. Positive peace supports an agenda for greater equity, greater social justice and increased political participation. The promotion of social rights is at the core of the concept (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0020872812448078">Bajaj and Chiu, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Components of community-based human rights advocacy practice and positive peace are reflected in peace education. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0020872812448078">Bajaj and Chiu (2009)</xref>, ‘peace education seeks to achieve human rights for all by transforming students into agents of change for greater equity and social justice’ (p. 443). To attain its goal, peace education interconnects with other ‘co-disciplines’ (p. 443) to educate for social responsibility and ‘consciousness’ (p. 443), both of which are critical to social change.</p>
<p>This article focuses on two objectives. The first is developing the conceptual link between community-based human rights advocacy practice and peace education. Establishing the connection between the two is important because it introduces the idea that community-based human rights advocacy and peace work are related. This is important for the social work profession, already aligned with concepts central to both (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0020872812448078">Baum, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0020872812448078">Ife, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0020872812448078">Moshe Grodofsky and Yudelevich, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0020872812448078">Pinkerton and Campbell, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0020872812448078">Reichert, 2001</xref>). Identifying the relationship between the two can furthermore help to circumvent obstacles that prevent social workers from working with ‘the other’ in regions of acute political conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0020872812448078">Baum, 2007</xref>) by expanding a conceptual framework steeped in the values and principles of the profession.</p>
<p>Second, the article describes how community-based human rights advocacy practitioners were trained in the Middle East to use their work to advance domestic conditions and peace education significant for positive peace in the region. The training program was developed and implemented by the author together with Palestinian and Jordanian colleagues between 2006 and 2008, in a period that followed the signing of peace agreements yet also followed the outbreak of the second Palestinian <italic>Intifada.</italic> Israeli social workers were exposed to the conceptual model during joint Israeli, Palestinian and Jordanian professional exchange visits that took place in Israel during the same period.</p>
<p>The article begins with a description of the context within which community-based human rights advocacy practice developed in the Middle East. The link between community-based human rights advocacy practice and peace education is delineated. Finally, the training program for social workers in the three societies is described.</p>
<sec id="section2-0020872812448078">
<title>The Middle East context</title>
<p>The history of the over 100-year-old Arab–Israeli conflict goes beyond the scope and purpose of this article. For the purpose of this article it is important to note that in spite of the over 100-year conflict, peace agreements between Israel and Jordan and Israel and the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) have been signed and that it is against this backdrop that community-based human rights advocacy practice in the Middle East developed.</p>
<p>In 1993 Israel and the Palestinian National Authority signed the Declaration of Principles on Interim Self Government Arrangements – The Oslo Accords. In 1994 the Treaty of Peace between the State of Israel and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan was signed. These agreements were a significant step for peace, given the inability of the sides of the conflict to reach agreements until this time. However, while Jordan and Israel remain committed to the Treaty of Peace, The Oslo Accords were not enough to ensure a long-term peace arrangement between Israel and the Palestinian National Authority. In September 2000 the second Palestinian uprising, the <italic>Al-Aqsa Intifada</italic> erupted, lasting for a period of approximately five years. Today, 19 years after the signing of the agreement, the two societies are yet to reach a sustainable peace.</p>
<p>Analysis of the conflict traditionally focuses on the relationships between the two societies, however <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0020872812448078">Shain and Sussman (1998)</xref> concentrate on domestic conditions critical for sustainable peace. They contend for example that the signing of peace agreements transforms national struggles to domestic reconstruction, and that these, left unattended, can be no less potent than cross-societal conflict. Newly emerging political entities contend with issues of identity, values, inclusion, and authority. These issues are contested as sub-national identity groups who heretofore subjugated particular needs to promote the greater national cause now jockey to formalize their status in the newly budding reality. Emerging political entities as well as existing governments are challenged by diverse political factions eager to gain power. They must form and stabilize viable political systems in the midst of internal societal fractions, lest domestic fragmentation lend to increasing violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0020872812448078">Cavanaugh, 2000</xref>) that can subsequently spill over from the domestic to the inter-societal domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0020872812448078">Gil, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>As post-agreement societal processes unfold, individuals and communities seek a sense of security to weather the uncertainties of change. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0020872812448078">Marris (1996)</xref> maintains that the quest to manage the often debilitating impact of uncertainty lends to the adoption of competitive self-preservation strategies that minimize commitment and responsibility towards others. Self-preservation strategies are illustrated at every level of society. For example, newly emerging governments in post-accord periods will oftentimes reduce social and economic benefits and revoke civil and political freedoms so as to consolidate power and resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0020872812448078">Shain and Sussman, 1998</xref>). These processes occur at the very same time that vulnerable populations in particular, have fewer means to cope with the uncertainties of post-peace accord reconstruction. Such strategies, far from reinforcing a sense of certainty, reinforce mistrust and social alienation among individuals and communities. Left unattended, these <italic>domestic challenges</italic> can uproot fragile peace agreements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0020872812448078">Gil, 1998</xref>). Alternatively, governments and societies that respond to human needs may be better positioned to command greater social solidarity and loyalty and hence are more apt to procure the demands that are necessary to forge sustainable peace <italic>between</italic> societies.</p>
<p>In the post-Oslo context of the Middle East, Israeli and Palestinian leaders keen on supporting the transition from a state of conflict to one of peace were obligated to simultaneous action vis-a-vis domestic social and economic conditions and civil and political freedoms. The signing of the Accords was after all accompanied by the promise of a ‘peace dividend’ and enhanced freedoms.</p>
<p>In fact analysis of standard social indicators in Israeli society between 1993 (following the signing of the Oslo Accords) and 1999 (one year prior to the outbreak of the Second Intifada) reveal the persistence of gaps in income, poverty and unemployment between different population groups and localities, as well as in higher education and household health expenditures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0020872812448078">Lior, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0020872812448078">Moshe 2002</xref>). Considering these trends, Shatil, Israel’s leading capacity-building center for social change organizations, noted in their working paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0020872812448078">2000</xref>) that such trends:
<disp-quote>
<p>create a void which hurts the disempowered communities primarily. As a result, these populations feel increasingly alienated from the government and its institutions, and from the Israeli democracy which are perceived as indifferent to their needs, their rights and their place in political, economic, social and cultural discourse. (p. 1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>While analysis of Palestinian society in the six-year period following the signing of the Oslo Accords also points to widening gaps in income by region and status (refugee/non-refugee), and persistent regional disparity in unemployment, poverty, and education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0020872812448078">Moshe 2002</xref>), it was in the realm of civil and political freedoms that Palestinians experienced the greatest disentitlements in the post-Oslo period. Human rights organizations, both Palestinian and international, suggest that the pursuit for peace compromised basic civil and political rights despite the commitment by the Palestinian National Authority to counter human rights abuses. Some maintain that the implementation of the peace agreements diametrically opposed human rights law. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0020872812448078">Amnesty International (1998a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0020872812448078">1998b)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0020872812448078">The Palestinian Independent Commission for Citizens Rights (2000)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0020872812448078">Human Rights Watch (1998)</xref> openly criticized the Wye Memorandum signed by Israel and the Palestinian National Authority in 1998 in that it subordinated human rights standards to national security concerns. In the aftermath of the signing of the Memorandum, and with the background of Palestinian protests against the memorandum, the PNA ordered the closure of Islamic welfare organizations and women’s groups, thus putting the clamp on much of the civil society activity that had characterized Palestinian society prior to the peace agreements. These actions led to growing divisiveness between the PNA and Palestinian society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0020872812448078">Jirbrawi, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Growing inequality, decreasing social and economic benefits and increased limitations on political participation and civil freedoms as experienced by members of the two societies are inversely related to the conditions that post-accord periods call for. In fact, it is these very conditions that – when pushed to the extreme – promote violence and instability that hamper peace efforts. Both Israelis and Palestinians were left to cope with domestic arenas where social, economic, political and civil rights were insufficient at the very same time that these could have enhanced a process of societal transformation, enabling the two populations to gain a sense that their leaders were deeply committed to them and, in turn, they to the peace process.</p>

<title>Community-based human rights advocacy practice in the Middle East</title>
<p>Within this context, on the one hand a context wherein peace agreements were signed calling for the cessation of conflict, and on the other hand a context mired in conflict, Jordanian, Palestinian and Israeli social workers developed – together with the McGill Middle East Program in Civil Society and Peace Building (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0020872812448078">Moshe Grodofsky, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0020872812448078">Torczyner, 2000</xref>), 11 academically affiliated, volunteer-driven community-based human rights advocacy practice centers in disadvantaged, multicultural neighborhoods in each of the societies. The centers:
<disp-quote>
<p>assist disadvantaged persons to advocate for their entitlements, to negotiate . . . complex bureaucracies and to organize to seek solutions to collective problems. Attention focuses on collective issues that affect diverse population groups . . . in order to promote the universality of rights based practice as well as to foster common cause . . . among people who had previously only seen issues and their solutions in terms of their own singular interests. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0020872812448078">Torczyner, 2001</xref>: 89–90)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>These centers focus on advocacy for universal social and economic rights as a mechanism to organize individuals and communities across diverse identity group allegiances. Within this process population groups are empowered to exercise civil and political freedoms. Focus on issues that emanate from domestic policy enables each center to begin to address the conditions that promote positive peace at home. At the same time, the common conceptual and practice framework advances cross-border activity among professionals and center constituencies from the three societies.</p>
<p>For example, the center in the Israeli city of Lod works with members of the Israeli Arab (Muslim) and Ethiopian (Jewish) communities who reside in the same neighborhood, to ensure the right to a clean and healthy environment. Together the communities who heretofore experienced only conflict between them, organized to conduct a neighborhood clean-up in their shared public spaces. They were successful in ensuring that City Hall repair broken cesspools, replace damaged sidewalks and provide garbage collection services, services previously inaccessible to the community despite laws protecting the rights of the neighborhood residents to these services.</p>
<p>The community-based human rights advocacy practice center in East Jerusalem that serves the Palestinian population worked together with the West Jerusalem center which serves a diverse Israeli population, including Jews and Arabs, Jews of Ashkenazi and Mizrachi origin and veteran citizens, as well as new immigrants, to change the Welfare-to-Work Program adopted by the Israeli Government; a program that led to disentitlements among the populations. In Jordan the center established micro-finance programs for Jordanian Muslim and Christian, Palestinian and Iraqi women ensuring the right to an adequate income.</p>
<p>The theoretical link between human rights advocacy practice and the concept of positive peace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0020872812448078">Bajaj and Chiu, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0020872812448078">Moshe, 2001</xref>) and the ability of the practice to successfully link between diverse populations party to the intractable Middle East conflict, invites inquiry as to the relationship between human rights advocacy practice and peace work as well as to how social workers can be trained to promote peace through community-based human rights advocacy practice.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0020872812448078">
<title>Community-based human rights advocacy practice as peace education in the context of intractable conflict</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0020872812448078">Bar-Tal and Rosen (2009)</xref> suggest that <italic>peace education</italic> can be a mechanism to advance peace-making and reconciliation in contexts of intractable conflict. They list an array of methods that can be useful in promoting peace education, such as the employment of mass media, communal intervention and community empowerment, and efforts by local and international NGOs. The authors advocate for societies engaged in intractable conflict to promote peace education, even when political–societal conditions are unfavorable. They define two models to advance peace education.</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0020872812448078">Bar-Tal and Rosen (2009)</xref> <italic>indirect peace education</italic> is pertinent when political–societal conditions ‘are unfavorable to the development of peace education and do not allow direct reference to the intractable conflict in which the society in question is involved’ (p. 563). Indirect peace education focuses on themes that are relevant to peace-making, ‘such as identity, ecological security, violence, empathy, human rights and conflict resolution skills’ (p. 563). Attention to these can lead to addressing structural conditions critical to peace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0020872812448078">Bajaj and Chiu, 2009</xref>), yet simultaneously build skills and values of nonviolence, a mindset and most importantly behaviors critical for peace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0020872812448078">Reimers and Chung, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>Direct peace education</italic> is appropriate when political–societal conditions ‘are favorable to the development of peace education and allow direct reference to all of the issues and themes that concern the societies involved in intractable conflict’ (p. 563). Direct peace education focuses on ‘all the themes of intractable conflict that contributed to the development and maintenance of the culture of conflict and served as barriers to its peaceful resolution’ (p. 563). Direct peace education addresses issues that are at the core of the conflict, such as the ethos of the conflict, the historical context of the conflict, and perceptions of the rival group. While the two models are not exclusive and can be combined, their appropriateness is determined by political–societal conditions.</p>
<p>Indirect peace education is particularly relevant to the current discussion, both in regard to community-based human rights advocacy practice and in regard to the Middle East reality. Indirect peace education addresses issues that are at the core of community-based human rights advocacy practice. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0020872812448078">Reimers and Chung (2010)</xref> capture the relationship between human rights and peace education, noting that both ‘teach people to work out differences in respectful, empathetic, tolerant and therefore non-violent ways’ (p. 505).</p>
<p>Moreover, while the sides to the conflict have known better times and worse times since the signing of the Oslo Accords in 1993, the political–societal context of all of the parties has remained overall unfavorable to the development of direct peace education and direct reference to the intractable conflict. Within this reality, community-based human rights advocacy practice plays a critical role in indirect peace education both by addressing the structural issues that are critical to peace and by assisting individuals and communities within the societies to develop skills and values of nonviolence and peaceful behavior. Community-based empowerment efforts thus link individual change with structural transformation efforts. Peace education has the potential to transform individuals into agents and ultimately this can lend to critical perspectives that question the status quo that oftentimes blocks peace processes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0020872812448078">
<title>Training community-based human rights advocacy practitioners to educate for peace</title>
<p>Training community-based human rights advocacy practitioners to educate for peace not only requires a framework for content. It also requires that the educator create a form of dialogue – a medium – that supports relationship building with the practitioners as well as among them, that encourages symmetry as opposed to hierarchy, inquiry as opposed to the imparting of facts, solidarity as opposed to competition and, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0020872812448078">Freire (1970</xref>, quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0020872812448078">Kester and Booth, 2010</xref>) recommends, ‘profound love, humility, faith, trust, hope and critical thinking’ (p. 500).</p>
<p>The training program developed for Jordanian, Palestinian and Israeli social workers engaged in community-based human rights advocacy practice was created on the basis of these ideas and principles. On the one hand, the program aimed to share ideas central to community-based human rights advocacy practice and their relation to peace. On the other hand, given that practice was implemented somewhat differently in each of the societies because of the varying social, economic, political and cultural contexts, the author also positioned herself as a learner and the social work practitioners as experts. Moreover, the author, an Israeli, had a profound desire to foster these relationships as a model of what was possible even in the midst of conflict.</p>
<p>In total, the training program was organized over a two-year period. Meetings with the Palestinian staff took place for two hours on a monthly basis. Meetings with the Jordanian staff were held approximately every three months over a two-day period. Meetings with Israeli staff were held three times over the two-year period during exchange visits, together with Jordanian and Palestinian professionals. Exchange visits included two visits of Jordanian professionals to Israeli and Palestinian centers, one bilateral visit of Palestinian professionals to an Israeli center and two visits of Israeli professionals to a Palestinian center.</p>
<p>The first year of the program focused on theory and entailed four components central to community-based human rights advocacy practice and peace; political exchange theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0020872812448078">Ilchmann and Uphoff, 1969</xref>), disentitlement theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0020872812448078">Torczyner, 2001</xref>), the community-based human rights advocacy model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0020872812448078">Torczyner, 2001</xref>) and concepts of positive peace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0020872812448078">Moshe, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0020872812448078">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0020872812448078">Moshe Grodofsky, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0020872812448078">Reardon, 1988</xref>). This first year challenged center staff to debate the applicability of theoretical concepts to their own particular social, political, economic and cultural contexts. The training was implemented primarily through lecture and group discussion format. In the second year, the training program functioned as a facilitated peer group supervision process.</p>
<sec id="section6-0020872812448078">
<title>The training process: First year</title>
<p>The training encouraged professional staff to address questions such as: What characterizes individuals who are disentitled? How do processes of disentitlement affect the fabric of communities? How do government institutions erect obstacles that prevent individuals and communities from accessing their entitlements? What are the policies and laws that favor particular populations while discriminating against others? How does all of this relate to peace?</p>
<p>Key concepts and their applicability to the particular contexts were debated. This process was crucial to enhancing the ability of the social work professionals to internalize theoretical concepts and to identify how theoretical constructs play out within their societies. To a great extent this was a lively internal debate that lent to a critical perspective on one’s society and government.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0020872812448078">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>As the learning process unfolded, social work professionals began to grasp how marginalized individuals and communities are excluded from opportunities for exchange. A common response was anger and even outrage as the conceptual lens provided a framework to organize what the center staff knew intuitively and through personal and professional experience. Their anger often served as a trigger to advocate for change within their societies.</p>
<p>The first year of the training program paralleled what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0020872812448078">Kester and Booth (2010)</xref> identify as the roots of peace education in Paulo Freire’s work. Peace education is ‘rooted in Freire’s pedagogy for consciousness-raising and social change . . . It focuses on community emancipation and social justice . . .’ (p. 499). Geared to their work with marginalized communities, the first year of training enhanced the ability of the social workers to conceptualize their experience.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0020872812448078">
<title>Second year training: The application of community-based human rights advocacy practice</title>
<p>The second year of the training program focused primarily on skills development for the application of the five strategies of human rights advocacy practice, including individual rights services offered through a ‘rights storefront’, community outreach, community organization, participatory processes and policy analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0020872812448078">Torczyner, 2001</xref>). A peer supervision participatory approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0020872812448078">Freire, 1970</xref>) facilitated by the author served as the learning medium. The goal of this component of the training program was to assist social workers as they helped individuals and communities move from disentitlement to processes of empowerment through their own process of action and reflection and transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0020872812448078">Kester and Booth, 2010</xref>). Moreover, the author used the sessions to bring examples from the three societies to the discussions as a medium for mutual recognition of the realities of each of the societies and the parallel work of the centers to address disentitlement.</p>
<p>Each supervisory session centered on the work of one professional who was asked to bring an issue from his work to the supervisory process. For example, one of the professionals brought his deliberations concerning a recurring issue that was raised in the center storefront services. Palestinian constituents residing in East Jerusalem complained that they were unable to access social benefits that they were entitled to by Israeli law due to the policies and inaccessibility of the National Insurance Institution. He suggested that work should be done with the constituents so that they would become <italic>less</italic> dependent on these benefits and hence on the Israeli Government. His colleague responded:
<disp-quote>
<p>I am entitled to my rights, but that does not mean I am dependent. Israel may want to keep us dependent but we can empower people to advocate for rights instead of feeling like dependents. (R. Minutes from meeting, 5 June 2007)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another colleague continued:
<disp-quote>
<p>There’s not enough awareness among the people about simple things which they have the right to claim from the Israeli Government. For example, repairing damaged streets, garbage pick-up, etc. When we claim our rights, we challenge the [Israeli] system. This makes people less dependent on the government. It’s about how to use the rights claims process to empower the people. We have to help people and institutions to change. How do we make people aware of what we do and how the system works? (R. Minutes from meeting, 5 June 2007)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The discussion encouraged the staff to develop a two-pronged plan. On the one hand they decided to bring the community together to educate and organize them around social benefits. Concurrently they determined that they would need to create a coalition of like-minded organizations so as to promote change in National Insurance policies that made social entitlements inaccessible for the Palestinian population in East Jerusalem. Sentiments towards the Israeli Government that could easily have led to a sense of disempowerment, in this case and through this process, transformed the social workers into change agents with a plan for action. More importantly, they developed skills to empower their constituencies to combat structural inequality instituted by the rival government through non-violent means.</p>

<title>Summary and conclusion</title>
<p>Within the context of the protracted Middle East conflict these initiatives, spearheaded by professional social workers, have an effect on the three societies. How do we know?</p>
<p>First, relationships between the social work professionals in the three societies have lasted for more than a decade. This is no small feat in the context of the Middle East.</p>
<p>Second, annual reports indicate that the centers are reaching an expanded clientele and that efforts not only affect the individual lives of rights claimants, but those of a wider community of claimants as well due to changes in social policies initiated and lobbied for by the centers.</p>
<p>Third, the centers have been approached by community organizations to receive assistance in adopting the model as part of their work. The centers continue to relay a sense of hope, critical to the individuals and the communities that they serve and critical to social change processes.</p>
<p>Yet despite these successes and their contribution to each of the societies in and of themselves, the fact remains that peace in the Middle East is as elusive as ever, if not more than ever. Peace treaties alone are not enough to ensure sustainable peace. In conjunction with the signing of agreements, societies need to organize themselves domestically. At the same time, more than a decade of work as outlined in the article has proven that while creating necessary domestic conditions is critical for peace, these alone are not sufficient to ensure sustainable peace.</p>
<p>The impasse in the peace negotiations between the Israeli Government and the Palestinian Authority, an impasse that brought the Palestinians to the United Nations in September 2011 to seek international recognition of the Palestinian State, has concurrently brought to a halt for the first time in a decade bilateral and multilateral exchange between the community-based human rights advocacy practice centers. Despite all of its success to date, the approach, the centers and the training cannot circumvent political processes. They can, however, continue to assist in ensuring that when the hailed peace agreement is finally signed, the societies will be better positioned to do their part to uphold them.</p>
