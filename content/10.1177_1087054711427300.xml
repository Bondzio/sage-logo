<abstract>
<p>Increasing empirical attention has been focused on college students with ADHD in recent years. In this special series, five studies are included that address psychosocial issues, comorbidity, and treatment of college students with ADHD. The nature and results of each study are briefly described. This special series of articles significantly advances our knowledge of critical issues with respect to psychosocial functioning, alcohol/substance use, comorbidity, and treatment of ADHD in college students.</p>

<body>
<p>ADHD is characterized by developmentally inappropriate levels of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that lead to academic, social, and occupational impairments in children, adolescents, and adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1087054711427300">American Psychiatric Association, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1087054711427300">Barkley, 2006</xref>). College students with ADHD have been the focus of several recent investigations as increasing numbers of high school students with ADHD are pursuing higher education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1087054711427300">Wolf, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1087054711427300">Wolf, Simkowitz, &amp; Carlson, 2009</xref>). Although precise figures are not available, it has been estimated that ADHD affects 2% to 8% of the college student population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1087054711427300">DuPaul, Weyandt, O’Dell, &amp; Varejao, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1087054711427300">Weyandt, Linterman, &amp; Rice, 1995</xref>) and approximately 25% of college students who receive disabilities services are identified with ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1087054711427300">Wolf, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1087054711427300">Wolf et al., 2009</xref>). The prognosis for college students with ADHD appears tenuous as preliminary studies suggest that college students with ADHD are more likely to have transition difficulties, academic problems, and lower grade point averages, and are more likely to be placed on academic probation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1087054711427300">DuPaul et al., 2009</xref>). Recent findings also indicate that college students with ADHD are at greater risk for psychosocial problems, including depression, emotional instability, and possibly greater use of drugs and alcohol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1087054711427300">Blase et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1087054711427300">Murphy, Barkley, &amp; Bush, 2002</xref>). Unfortunately, there is an absence of empirical information concerning interventions for college students with ADHD, and additional studies are sorely warranted.</p>
<p>In this special series, five studies are included that address psychosocial issues, comorbidity, and treatment of college students with ADHD. Specifically, these studies address questions pertaining to (a) differences in reported levels of drug and alcohol use between college students with and without ADHD, (b) the positive illusory bias exhibited by college students with ADHD, (c) comorbidity issues among college students with ADHD, and (d) the effectiveness of a pharmacological intervention for college students with ADHD.</p>
<p>Numerous studies have substantiated that drug and alcohol issues are a common problem on college campuses, and as noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1087054711427300">McCabe, Teter, and Boyd (2006)</xref>, approximately 90% of college students report regular consumption of alcohol. In this issue, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1087054711427300">Baker, Prevatt, and Proctor (2012)</xref> studied 104 undergraduates with documented ADHD compared with students without the disorder and found that students with ADHD reported greater difficulty in stopping drinking once started as well as higher rates of “blackouts.” Differences between ADHD subtypes were also found, for example, in alcohol use, however, college students with ADHD did not report higher rates of use of illicit drugs. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1087054711427300">Rooney, Chronis-Tuscano, and Yoon (2012)</xref> compared 53 college students with ADHD with 38 students without the disorder and found higher rates of alcohol use among those with ADHD. With regard to illicit drug use, Rooney et al. found that those with ADHD were 3.3 times more likely to have used marijuana and 4.5 times more likely to have used other illicit drugs. The findings also revealed that college students with ADHD were more likely to have tried tobacco at an earlier age and to continue using the substance. Collectively, these findings indicate that college students with ADHD are at greater risk for drug and tobacco use, which has serious health and social implications.</p>
<p>Despite these psychosocial difficulties, as well as others such as difficulties at the workplace and driving-related problems, individuals with ADHD often make positive judgments about their own performance (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1087054711427300">Owens, Goldfine, Evangelista, Hoza, &amp; Kaiser, 2007</xref>). This disparity between self-reported and actual competence is known as the positive illusory bias. In this special series, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1087054711427300">Prevatt et al. (2012)</xref> sought to determine whether college students with ADHD show evidence of the positive illusory bias in the areas of driving and employment compared with students without the disorder. As hypothesized, college students with ADHD provided ratings that were consistent with the positive illusory bias. The authors hypothesized that this tendency may be related to impairments in executive functioning and provided suggestions for future research as well as implications for clinical practice.</p>
<p>ADHD rarely occurs in isolation as comorbidity rates of 50% or greater with learning and disruptive behavior disorders have been found in child, adolescent, and adult samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1087054711427300">Barkley, 2006</xref>). The possible impact of comorbid ADHD and learning disability (LD) on social-emotional and academic functioning is particularly critical for college students with ADHD. In this special series, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1087054711427300">Nelson and Gregg (2012)</xref> examined the degree to which college students with ADHD alone, dyslexia alone, and comorbid ADHD and dyslexia are likely to report significant symptoms of anxiety disorder or depression relative to college students without either disorder. Furthermore, they investigated whether adolescents with these disorders who were transitioning to college differed in self-reported anxiety and depression from students already attending college. Consistent with prior studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1087054711427300">Heiligenstein, Guenther, Levy, Savino, &amp; Fulwiler, 1999</xref>), Nelson and Gregg found no group differences with respect to symptoms of anxiety and depression, even when comparing students with comorbid ADHD and LD relative to control students without either disorder. Interestingly, college students with ADHD and/or LD reported higher levels of anxiety and depression than did adolescents with these disorders who were transitioning from high school to college. The latter suggests that the increased demands and concomitant reductions in support and structure associated with moving from high school to college may lead to more frequent or severe internalizing symptoms. Nelson and Gregg discussed the implications of these findings for transition programming as well as for intervention at the college level.</p>
<p>Very few studies of treatment for ADHD in college students have been conducted. In fact, the last article in this special series (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1087054711427300">DuPaul et al., 2012</xref>) reports the results of the first controlled study of psychopharmacological treatment of ADHD in college students. DuPaul and colleagues evaluated the effects of three dosages of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX) relative to placebo and nonmedication baseline on the functioning of 24 college students with ADHD in the context of a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design. Furthermore, the psychological and executive functioning of medicated students with ADHD was compared with that of 26 college students without disorder who were unmedicated (i.e., to examine the degree to which LDX “normalized” functioning). Findings indicated that LDX was associated with significantly lower ADHD symptoms, enhanced executive functioning, improved study and organizational skills, and lower levels of psychopathology relative to placebo and baseline conditions. The vast majority of students exhibited reliable improvement on one or more LDX dosages (i.e., were positive treatment responders), whereas adverse side effects were benign or absent for most individuals. Alternatively, LDX did not “normalize” any area of functioning as nonmedicated control students without ADHD were significantly superior on most measures relative to medicated students with ADHD. Thus, these findings suggest it is likely that adjunctive psychosocial and/or educational interventions will be necessary even for those students with ADHD who are positive responders to stimulant medication.</p>
<p>Until recently, comparatively little was known about the psychological, academic, and social functioning of college students with ADHD as well as the treatment of this disorder in the college population. This special series of articles significantly advances our knowledge of critical issues with respect to psychosocial functioning, alcohol/substance use, comorbidity, and treatment of ADHD in college students. The findings reported in these studies should promote additional research that may ultimately lead to successful outcomes for individuals with ADHD who pursue higher education.</p>
