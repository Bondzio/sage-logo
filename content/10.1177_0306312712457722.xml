      <abstract>
        <p>In recent years, personality disorders – psychiatric constructs understood as enduring
          dysfunctions of personality – have come into ever-greater focus for British policymakers,
          mental health professionals and service-users. Disputes have focussed largely on highly
          controversial attempts by the UK Department of Health to introduce mental health law and
          policy (now enshrined within the 2007 Mental Health Act of England and Wales). At the same
          time, clinical framings of personality disorder have dramatically shifted: once regarded
          as untreatable conditions, severe personality disorders are today thought of by many
          clinicians to be responsive to psychiatric and psychological intervention. In this
          article, I chart this transformation by means of a diachronic analysis of debates and
          institutional shifts pertaining to both attempts to change the law, and understandings of
          personality disorder. In so doing, I show how mental health policy and practice have
          mutually constituted one another, such that the aims of clinicians and policymakers have
          come to be closely aligned. I argue that it is precisely through these reciprocally
          constitutive processes that the profound reconfiguration of personality disorder from
          being an obdurate to a plastic condition has occurred; this demonstrates the significance
          of interactions between law and the health professions in shaping not only the State’s
          management of pathology, but also perceptions of its very nature.</p>

  <body>
    <p>In the UK, as well as many other nations, psychiatric disorders relating to antisocial and
      criminal behaviour are objects of public, political and medical concern. Particular interest
      has been focused upon the constructs of antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) and
      psychopathic personality disorder (psychopathy).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0306312712457722">1</xref></sup> Meditations on disordered personalities date
      back to at least the 19th century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0306312712457722">Berrios,
        1993</xref>), and the ethical and clinical basis of maintaining personality disorders as the
      concern of the mental health professions has long been debated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0306312712457722">Eastman and Starling, 2006</xref>). In part, this is a
      consequence of the fact that conditions such as ASPD and psychopathy are framed as global
      personality dysfunctions, rather than as discrete disorders (such as schizophrenia or
      depression). Individuals regarded as personality disordered – especially those who have
      committed criminal offences – transgress a range of boundaries: between normality and
      pathology, victim and perpetrator, and mental patient and criminal. These transgressions
      engender important questions about how the State can and should manage persons living under
      the label of personality disorder, questions that continue to resist easy answers.</p>
    <p>In the UK, the increasing prominence of personality disorders in general, and ASPD and
      psychopathy in particular, is both a consequence of the perceived costs to society resulting
      from the actions of personality disordered individuals, and a result of the drafting of
      controversial mental health legislation (debates about which often focused on personality
      disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0306312712457722">Pilgrim, 2007</xref>)). In
      1999, the Government began to formulate plans for rewriting the 1983 Mental Health Act (MHA)
      of England and Wales.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0306312712457722">2</xref></sup> These
      plans captured the attention of health professionals, who were keenly aware of the potential
      for new policy to reshape practice. However, the possible effects of new governance (and the
      clinical discourses that revolved around it) on framings of pathology were less widely
      appreciated. As debates over the MHA unfolded, personality disorder came to be regarded in new
      ways. Traditionally, ASPD and psychopathy have been thought to be resistant to clinical
      intervention; this was the dominant framing of these conditions even into the late 1990s. Yet,
      as debates on the MHA played out, framings of personality disorders came gradually, but
      profoundly, to position these disorders as plastic rather than obdurate constructs: in effect,
      they became treatable.</p>
    <p>In this article, I historicize these discourses; in particular, I seek to demonstrate the
      reciprocal shaping of clinical and legal debates that reconfigured understandings of
      personality disorders such that many clinicians came to regard them as being amenable to
      treatment interventions. Methodologically, my research examines personality disorder
      (particularly, ASPD) through an analysis of its framing within mental health policy debates
      and clinical discourse. I analysed all issues of the <italic>British Journal of
        Psychiatry</italic> (<italic>BJP</italic>) from 1950 to 2012 for articles, editorials and
      correspondence on personality disorder and mental health law, as well as other key papers,
      such as those that were frequently referenced in the <italic>BJP</italic> articles I analysed.
      I paid special attention to writings from the late 1990s onwards, which were often part of a
      wider conversation around proposals to introduce a new MHA. I also inspected policy documents
      from the Department of Health (DH), which pertained to the re-writing of the 1983 MHA and the
      instatement of new services for personality disorder, and I read a wide range of commentaries
      by lawyers on the legal changes taking place. I consulted these materials in order to gain
      access to the views of the range of experts who had a stake in the legal and clinical
      innovations taking place in forensic mental health. I also took the opportunity to attend
      conferences and seminars on personality disorder, and conducted interviews with psychologists,
      psychiatrists and neuroscientists working in forensic mental health.</p>
    <p>My analysis is inspired by the tradition of material-semiotic theory within STS, which
      foregrounds the relationships between discourse, practice and things in the production and
      stabilization of science and society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0306312712457722">Haraway, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0306312712457722">Jasanoff,
        2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0306312712457722">Latour, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0306312712457722">Pickering, 1995</xref>). Such scholarship
      refuses both (techno)scientific and social reductionism, and instead emphasizes how knowledge,
      artefacts and social processes mutually constitute and legitimate one another. In my analysis,
      I was concerned with how the texts in my sample framed (AS)PD. By employing the ‘frame’
      metaphor, I draw on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0306312712457722">Erving Goffman’s
        (1986)</xref> frame analysis, which concerns how experience is socially organized and
      meaning is ascribed to entities and events, as well as historian <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0306312712457722">Charles Rosenberg’s (1992)</xref> argument that, while there
      is a material and normative quality to disease, the recognition and naming of diseases are
      social processes. Rosenberg’s scholarship is less ‘programmatically charged’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0306312712457722">Rosenberg, 1992</xref>: xv) than other
      writings on the ‘social construction’ of health and disease, as he refuses to assume that
      medical institutions are necessarily oppressive. His historical project attempts to remain
      sensitive to the polysemy of disease across time and space; by doing so, Rosenberg seeks to
      analyse how particular frames come to be used, rather than appraising how well they fit their
      ‘object’. Following Goffman and Rosenberg, I am concerned with the framing of personality
      disorder, and not with the ontological status of the disorders, per se.</p>
    <p>With these conceptual and methodological issues in mind, we turn now to the analysis itself,
      which I introduce with an account of the legal and clinical configurations from which debates
      about the new MHA emerged. I then summarize some of the policy developments through the late
      1990s and early 2000s and discuss the associated perspectives of psychiatrists and
      psychologists. I follow this with an analysis of the clinical debates about personality
      disorder that were touched off by the proposed legislative changes, before describing how the
      policy machinery itself shifted gear in order to accommodate some of the concerns of mental
      health professionals. The rapprochement between political/policy and clinical goals came to be
      most visible in four new ‘Dangerous and Severe Personality Disorder (DSPD) Units’, which
      sought to treat patients with personality disorder, while at the same time managing the risks
      they presented to the public. Finally, I analyse the culmination of these various debates: the
      new 2007 MHA, and the growing (though still not universal) belief within the UK mental health
      professional community that personality disorders are treatable.</p>
    <p>By presenting my historical narrative in this way, I seek to demonstrate how debates around,
      first, mental health law and policy, and, second, clinical knowledge concerning a
      controversial diagnostic label, became (re)energized and shaped one another. Such an account
      underscores the great extent to which UK clinicians mobilized powerfully to contest and
      eventually influence the new MHA, eventually structuring the regimes within which they would
      have to practice. Accordingly, the making of new mental health law in England and Wales did
      not entail some kind of unidirectional ‘capture’ of clinical ‘interests’. Rather, as this
      paper will show, a more complex series of reciprocal interactions and mutually constitutive
      processes between clinical knowledge, law and policy occurred. While my focus is explicitly on
      the UK, and on personality disorder, the broad conceptual claim I make – that interactions
      between medicine and law reframe pathology in important ways – should not be regarded as
      necessarily restricted to this particular case. Many other nations have debated the moral and
      clinical issues associated with psychopathy and related conditions, and mental health law is
      frequently used and critiqued as a means of managing ‘dangerous’ and ‘risky’ individuals.
      Future comparative work may usefully reveal how different legal and clinical cultures (and the
      interactions between them) produce different understandings of pathology (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0306312712457722">Jasanoff, 2005</xref>: 15).</p>
    <sec id="section1-0306312712457722">
      <title>The 1983 MHA and the ‘patients psychiatrists dislike’</title>
      <p>In 1983, the first new MHA in more than 20 years was unveiled in England and Wales. This
        Act, refining and extending much of the content of a 1959 predecessor, was largely steered
        by the recommendations of an expert committee chaired by Lord Butler of Saffron Walden.
        These recommendations were widely perceived to be humane, liberal and progressive, and the
        Act they helped to constitute was favourably received.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0306312712457722">3</xref></sup> However, this is not to say that there was no
        contention associated with the new Act. The criminological valence that had long been
        attached to certain aspects of mental health law drew attention, particularly with regard to
        the administration of offenders who were considered to come within the remit of the Act. The
        new MHA continued a tradition of allowing courts to order the compulsory detention of
        offenders with ‘mental impairment’ or ‘psychopathic disorder’. However, it also implemented
        new restrictions on involuntary hospitalization of criminals (as well as non-offenders)
        diagnosed with psychopathy.</p>
      <p>Specifically, the 1983 Act introduced what came to be known as the ‘treatability test’.
        This mandated that an offender could only be held in National Health Service (NHS) settings
        if treatment was available, which was ‘likely to alleviate or prevent a deterioration of his
        condition’. This ‘test’ ensured that a diagnosis of psychopathy was not by itself sufficient
        for involuntary hospital detention. Rather, in order to justify legal detention, the
        disorder had to be defined as treatable. The new treatability test came to direct the
        attentions of mental health professionals working under the Act to the ontology of
        psychopathy. In particular it enjoined the question: could psychopaths be treated?</p>
      <p>In the UK, as well as in many other national contexts, the treatability of psychopathy had
        long been a matter of contention.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0306312712457722">4</xref></sup> A minority position, which maintained that therapy was both possible and
        potentially efficacious, has always been a part of clinical discourse; yet the majority of
        psychiatrists and psychologists were pessimistic about whether psychopathy could be treated.
        Following the new Act, forensic psychiatrist Adrian T. Grounds succinctly expressed this
        pessimism: <disp-quote>
          <p>The detention of offenders in the legal category ‘psychopathic disorder’ in special
            hospitals for treatment raises a number of critical issues. There are doubts about the
            nature of the disorder; what constitutes treatment; who is ‘treatable’; the
            effectiveness of treatment; and whether evidence of psychological change implies reduced
            risk of reoffending. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0306312712457722">Grounds,
              1987</xref>: 474)</p>
        </disp-quote>
      </p>
      <p>The treatability test in the MHA invited reflection on these issues, as did the influential
        third edition of the US nosology, the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
          Disorders</italic> (DSM-III), published in 1980. DSM-III devoted a major section to
        personality disorders, and the significance accorded to them was not lost on British
        psychiatrists. The new category of antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) was particularly
        interesting to forensic practitioners, due to its apparent overlap with the older category
        of psychopathy. Furthermore, it had a more specific definition than the opaque construct of
        psychopathic disorder in the 1983 MHA. Consequently, British practitioners increasingly
        favoured ASPD over psychopathy for categorizing antisocial individuals.</p>
      <p>Previously, psychiatrists had commonly believed that personality disordered individuals
        were a nuisance, who were far from being proper subjects of the ‘clinical gaze’. Rather,
        mental health professionals felt that dealing with personality disorder was an impediment to
        the ‘real work’ of treating people with discrete mental illnesses.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0306312712457722">5</xref></sup> Individuals living under the label of
        personality disorder were frequently excluded from health services and often were explicitly
        disliked by practitioners. This disdain was exemplified in an influential 1988 paper,
        ‘Personality disorder: The patients psychiatrists dislike’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0306312712457722">Lewis and Appleby, 1988</xref>). The authors reported
        results from a study that examined psychiatrists’ attitudes towards personality disorder,
        and noted that patients characterized with these disorders were described as ‘manipulative,
        attention-seeking, annoying’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0306312712457722">Lewis and
          Appleby, 1988</xref>: 45).</p>
      <p>Clinical pessimism was not universal, however: some psychiatrists conceptualized
        personality disorders as treatable conditions. An influential proponent of this view was
        Peter Tyrer, a frequent writer on personality disorder and, from 2003, editor of the
          <italic>BJP</italic>. In 1991, Tyrer and colleagues, uncomfortable with prejudices against
        personality disorder, argued that: <disp-quote>
          <p>One of the important consequences of better classification and awareness of personality
            problems is the recognition that people with personality disorders suffer considerably
            and merit help, even if it cannot always be given in a reliable and effective form. In
            the past, many therapeutic disciplines have tended to regard personality disorders as
            not really part of psychiatry’s province and that they should therefore be separated
            from ‘real’ mental illness. This view is often implicit and rarely finds its way into
            print but is unfortunately common in practice. Views of treatment are now changing.
            Psychotherapy in particular, which has always maintained that personality disorders are
            part of its territory, has persevered in attempts to understand and modify the harmful
            attitudes that dominate the personal lives and relationships of people with personality
            disorders, and has helped to transfer this awareness to others. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0306312712457722">Tyrer et al., 1991</xref>: 468)</p>
        </disp-quote>
      </p>
      <p>Tyrer attempted, in one move, to de-stigmatize personality disorders and advocate their
        treatment, emphasizing both the subjective distress suffered by patients and the extent to
        which they could be ameliorated though psychotherapy. Nevertheless, treatment could be
        ‘long, arduous and difficult to complete’ (p. 468). Others agreed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0306312712457722">6</xref></sup></p>
      <p>As inspiring as Tyrer’s comments might have been to some mental health professionals, many
        others were concerned about the evidence for such claims. In the 1990s, the concept of
        evidence-based medicine began to resonate powerfully throughout psychiatry, and ‘hard data’
        on treatments for personality disorder became more compelling than rhetoric. As a 1998
        editorial asserted, ‘[t]here is a need for claims of therapeutic success within the field of
        personality disorder to be rigorously appraised’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0306312712457722">Cawthra and Gibb, 1998</xref>: 8). Such comments echoed
        those made by psychologist Bridget Dolan and psychiatrist Jeremy Coid in an influential 1993
        review of treatments for personality disorders commissioned by the DH and the Home Office.
        While <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0306312712457722">Dolan and Coid (1993)</xref>
        expressed cautious optimism about treatability, they also emphasised the need for
        statistically robust trials to provide firm evidence for the effects of such treatment.
        These longstanding but relatively subdued tensions regarding the treatability of personality
        disorder were brought into sharp relief at the close of the 20th century when proposals were
        put forward to revise the 1983 MHA.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="section2-0306312712457722">
      <title>The making of dangerous and severe personality disorder</title>
      <p>In 1999, the DH and the Home Office began to develop the new mental health policy.
        Consequently, clinical attention shifted profoundly toward these government departments. On
        15 February 1999, Home Secretary Jack Straw introduced a new phrase to British health
        professionals: Dangerous and Severe Personality Disorder (DSPD).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0306312712457722">7</xref></sup> The concept of DSPD was widely regarded as
        having been animated, in part, by the July 1996 murder of Lin and Megan Russell by Michael
        Stone. A prior-offender diagnosed with a personality disorder, Stone had used a variety of
        services through the 1990s and was involuntarily admitted into De La Pole Hospital, Hull, in
        November 1994. He was subsequently discharged in January 1995, following a decision that he
        was no longer eligible for compulsory detention under the MHA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0306312712457722">South East Coast Strategic Health Authority, 2006</xref>).
        Media constructions of a dangerous individual abandoned by mental health professionals as a
        consequence of legal constraints sat alongside broader public fears about predatory
        paedophiles and serial killers, and policy-makers appeared pressed to respond to these
        concerns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0306312712457722">Freestone, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0306312712457722">Manning, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0306312712457722">Prins, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-0306312712457722">White, 2002</xref>). For Straw, it was clear that there
        was: <disp-quote>
          <p>a group of dangerous and severely personality disordered individuals from whom the
            public at present are not properly protected, and who are restrained effectively neither
            by the criminal law, nor by the provisions of the Mental Health Act … . [T]he government
            proposes that there should be new legislative powers for the indeterminate, but
            reviewable detention of dangerously personality disordered individuals. … The
            individuals concerned must have the best possible chance of becoming safe, so as to be
            returned to the community, whenever that is possible. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0306312712457722">Straw, 1999</xref>, quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0306312712457722">Gunn, 2000</xref>: 336)</p>

      </p>
      <p>Emerging from Whitehall rather than the Royal College of Psychiatrists, DSPD was not a
        medical diagnosis; rather, it was a new administrative category for risky individuals.
        Specifically, it included psychopaths and others meeting criteria for ASPD who were also
        believed to present a clear and enduring danger to the public. The law has long sought to
        control ‘risky’ or ‘dangerous’ individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0306312712457722">Bartlett, 2003</xref>), and not just in the UK. However, what
        is pertinent here is that the already rather broad mandate of the State for defining and
        managing dangerousness was considered too narrow by Straw; he felt that powers for
        indeterminate detention should be extended, regardless of whether the individual to be
        detained was currently before the courts. The DSPD proposals therefore represented a radical
        step by the Government to regulate the administration of mentally disordered offenders, and
        hence of the mental health professions.</p>
      <p>In July 1999, a consultation paper was released that advanced the possibility of a
        legislative change that would enable individuals categorized with DSPD to be subject to
        indeterminate confinement in a special unit within a prison or NHS hospital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0306312712457722">Home Office and the Department of Health,
          1999</xref>). As ethnographer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0306312712457722">Mark
          Freestone (2005</xref>: 450) put it, the DSPD Units were intended to be ‘a “third way”
        between the prison service and the special hospital and as such a unique environment’: a
        place to detain individuals who were considered to be threats to the public, while at the
        same time providing mental health care to reduce the risk they presented.</p>
      <p>As an instrument of governance, the DSPD proposals were closely related to the Dutch
          <italic>Ter Beschikking Stelling</italic> (TBS) System (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0306312712457722">de Boer et al., 2008</xref>), an institutional arrangement
        for the management of mentally disordered offenders, which aimed to reduce their risk to
        society. The proposed DSPD Units also echoed earlier suggestions made in 1975 by the Butler
        Committee (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0306312712457722">McCallum, 2001</xref>), and
        bore a striking resemblance to a recommendation advanced in the so-called Fallon Report
          (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0306312712457722">Fallon et al., 1999</xref>). Released
        in January 1999, the Fallon Report detailed the results of an inquiry into drug use,
        pornography and possible paedophile activity in Ashworth Special Hospital. The report
        proposed the establishment of special units for individuals with severe personality disorder
        within prisons and NHS facilities – similar, therefore, to Straw’s DSPD Units, and perhaps
        an inspiration for them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0306312712457722">Bartlett,
          2003</xref>).</p>
      <p>Straw’s plans were unveiled at a time when significant doubts remained about the
        treatability of personality disorder. With such doubts and the Stone case in mind, the DSPD
        Programme was an attempt to remedy the social and clinical problems surrounding individuals
        with severe personality disorders. However, the DSPD proposals were widely resented and
        resisted by clinicians, and a number of opinion-pieces in well-regarded journals attempted
        to rally mental health practitioners against them.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0306312712457722">8</xref></sup> In particular, these practitioners raised
        serious concerns about the possibility that psychiatry would move further from a therapeutic
        regime, and toward one of public protection.</p>
      <p>The strongly authoritarian aspects of the DSPD proposals thus ensured that they would be
        strongly contested by mental health practitioners, many of who were – following decades of
        criticisms by ‘anti-psychiatrists’ and others – keenly aware of and anxious about their
        potential to be agents of social control. However, the DSPD Programme was not the only
        change to mental health policy and practice that the government sought to introduce: as the
        20th century closed, plans were in place to create an entirely new MHA for England and
        Wales.</p>

    <sec id="section3-0306312712457722">
      <title>Changing the terrain of mental health</title>
      <p>Toward the end of the 1990s, it was increasingly felt by the Government that the 1983 MHA
        was in need of ‘updating’. Accordingly, in September 1998 they charged an expert committee
        (chaired by Genevra Richardson, Professor of Law at King’s College, London) to review the
        Act. The Richardson Committee’s proposals were considered humane and progressive, and were
        received favourably by clinicians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0306312712457722">Department of Health, 1999</xref>). For instance, the Richardson Report proposed to
        further what was widely understood to be the ‘clear therapeutic ethos’ of the 1983 MHA by
        extending the conditions of the treatability test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0306312712457722">Glover-Thomas, 2006</xref>: 23; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0306312712457722">Grounds, 2001</xref>).</p>
      <p>Four months after the release of the Richardson Report, in November 1999, a government
        Green Paper was published: <bold>‘</bold>Reform of the Mental Health Act 1983: Proposals for
        consultation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0306312712457722">Secretary of State for
          Health, 1999</xref>). Like the DSPD proposals, this detailing of the Government’s effort
        to reform the 1983 MHA was roundly disliked by clinicians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-0306312712457722">Zigmond, 2001</xref>). This reaction was exacerbated by the
        fact that, unlike the Richardson Report, the emphasis in the Green Paper was on compulsion –
        compulsory treatment and compulsory detention.</p>
      <p>Further resentment was engendered by the Green Paper’s rejection of many of the Richardson
        Committee proposals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0306312712457722">Bartlett,
          2003</xref>). For example, in marked contrast to the extension of the treatability test
        recommended by Richardson, the Green Paper advocated the removal of that test altogether.
        Furthermore, under its terms, personality disordered individuals could be detained
        involuntarily on the basis of risk, irrespective of whether the specific DSPD proposals came
        to fruition.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0306312712457722">9</xref></sup></p>
      <p>One point of agreement between the Green Paper, the Richardson Report, the DSPD
        consultation paper and the Fallon Report was that psychopathy should be removed from the MHA
        and replaced with the more general category of personality disorder. This was a move deemed
        by many to be ‘long overdue’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0306312712457722">Laing,
          2000</xref>: 223), given that, in practice, the legal definition of psychopathic disorder
        was applied to a range of sub-categories of personality disorder.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, the Green Paper was heavily criticized by clinicians, as well as by members
        of the Richardson Committee itself.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0306312712457722">10</xref></sup> As lawyer Nicola Glover-Thomas put it, in the Green Paper, ‘risk
        management has trumped therapeutic endeavour’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0306312712457722">Glover-Thomas, 2006</xref>: 32). Though the 1983 MHA
        referred to the risk presented by a patient, the Green Paper placed this theme in the
        foreground (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0306312712457722">Laing, 2000</xref>). The
        emphasis on risk – and the controversy that attracted – characterized the debate on the
        rewriting of the 1983 MHA over subsequent years.</p>

    <sec id="section4-0306312712457722">
      <title>The danger of dangerousness</title>
      <p>Notwithstanding the negative reaction to the 1999 Green Paper, the Government continued
        with its plans to revise the 1983 MHA and implement the DSPD Programme. In 2001, £126
        million had been committed to DSPD service development, and the programme was being piloted
        at specialized units at Rampton Hospital and Her Majesty’s Prison (HMP) Whitemoor.</p>
      <p>Rather than becoming the authoritarian and illiberal initiative initially feared by
        clinicians, once it was implemented, the DSPD Programme represented a ‘watered down’ version
        of the original proposals and worked within the ambit of existing legislation. The Units
        were extremely well resourced, with little expense spared in terms of both their
        construction and function.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0306312712457722">11</xref></sup> High costs were justified in the context of the government’s longer-term
        plans for mental health and crime control.</p>
      <p>DSPD also formed the explicit focus of a 2000 mental health White Paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0306312712457722">Department of Health, 2000a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0306312712457722">b</xref>). Underscoring the Government’s
        concerns with personality disorder and dangerousness, the White Paper was very poorly
        received. One <italic>BJP</italic> editorial argued it to be a ‘profoundly illiberal
        document’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0306312712457722">Grounds, 2001</xref>: 387),
        noting its inclusion of potentially broader criteria under which mentally disordered
        offenders could be indeterminately detained. Similarly, a <italic>British Medical
          Journal</italic> editorial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0306312712457722">Szmukler,
          2001</xref>) expressed the continuing concerns of clinicians with the Government’s
        proposals, and highlighted the difficult balance between care provision and risk
            control.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0306312712457722">12</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Critical voices emanated from across the UK, including professionals at the ‘coal face’ of
        practice – mental health lawyers, as well as clinicians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0306312712457722">Peay, 2003</xref>). Critics focused on the preoccupation
        with risk and ‘dangerousness’ that characterized the White Paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0306312712457722">Buchanan and Leese, 2001</xref>); further, they raised
        questions about the meaning of dangerousness: How would it be measured? How dangerous would
        an individual have to be to qualify for the DSPD programme? How did dangerousness relate to
        treatability and to risk? In 2002, a Draft Mental Health Bill was published, but these key
        questions remained largely unanswered.</p>
      <p>Surprisingly, given the Government’s previous focus on DSPD, the 2002 Draft Bill did not
        specifically address this category. However, mental health stakeholders found the Bill
        troubling for a variety of reasons, not least because its wording raised concern that highly
        antisocial individuals (i.e. individuals who might come under the rubric of DSPD) could
        nevertheless more easily be detained involuntarily within mental health services.
        Significant debate reigned over this point (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0306312712457722">Pilgrim, 2007</xref>). Yet, as lawyer Peter Bartlett pointed
        out, the concept of dangerousness was nothing new to English and Welsh mental health
        legislation (or, indeed, to that of other nations), and contemporary concerns about social
        control ignored the uncomfortable fact that psychiatry had always played a prominent role in
        the governance of deviance. Furthermore, it was ‘not obvious’ how far the new Bill extended
        existing powers for the detention of individuals who were perceived to be a threat to others
          (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0306312712457722">Bartlett, 2003</xref>: 328). In spite
        of these caveats to the profusion of clinical concerns, Bartlett nevertheless considered the
        Bill ‘badly flawed’ (p. 327) and observed that with it, ‘the government managed to achieve a
        consensus rarely seen in mental health politics. Sadly, the consensus was negative:
        virtually no one supported the draft bill’ (p. 326).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0306312712457722">13</xref></sup></p>

      <title>Towards treatability</title>
      <p>As debate about the MHA reigned, deliberations regarding the treatability of personality
        disorder became increasingly apparent. Promissory discourse about the potential to treat
        personality disorder in more efficient and efficacious ways was instantiated within new
        academic units, such as the Nottingham Personality Disorder Institute, and informal networks
        and formal associations, such as the British and Irish Group for the Study of Personality
        Disorder (BIGSPD; formed in 2000). These centres and fora arose from and further animated
        clinical interest in the aetiology, development and treatment of personality disorder.</p>
      <p>At the same time, public spending on personality disorder services and research from bodies
        such as the MRC, the DH and the DSPD Programme significantly increased. Established in April
        1999 (3 months before the release of the initial joint Home Office/DH proposals for DSPD),
        the National Forensic Mental Health R&amp;D Programme commissioned research on behalf of the
        DH; in doing so, it became a key funder of scientific and clinical research into personality
        disorder. The Programme also commissioned literature reviews into the aetiology of
        personality disorder and its management. Of course the proliferation of research and the
        promise of new treatments for personality disorder did not readily foster a unified front of
        clinical optimism; views remained mixed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0306312712457722">14</xref></sup> Yet, while some clinicians were pessimistic, a growing number of others
        wrote articles and gave commentaries that pointed towards effective interventions. The
        London-based ‘therapeutic communities’ at Cassel and Henderson Hospitals were highly
        regarded for their effective work with individuals with personality disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0306312712457722">Manning, 2002</xref>), and psychotherapeutic
        strategies more broadly were viewed with optimism, partly as a consequence of a new, growing
        evidence base.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0306312712457722">15</xref></sup></p>
      <p>In particular, faith in psychological techniques such as cognitive analytic therapy (CAT)
        and dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT, an approach based on cognitive behaviour therapy
        (CBT)) was increasing during the first few years of the 21st century, even as the number of
        randomized controlled trials (RCTs) remained low. Pharmaceuticals, such as antipsychotics
        and antidepressants, were also being used as ‘adjuncts’ to the more conventional
        psychotherapeutic management strategies for personality disorders, which brought into sharp
        relief the ontological plurality so often evident within psychiatry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0306312712457722">Helén, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0306312712457722">Pickersgill, 2010</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0306312712457722">16</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Optimism was exemplified in bold claims about treatability. For influential Broadmoor-based
        psychotherapist Gwen Adshead, there could be ‘no justification for global assertions that
        personality disorder is untreatable’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0306312712457722">Adshead, 2001</xref>: 412). Treatment strategies also became increasingly nuanced.
        Clinicians were urged to forego the notion of a ‘fix all’ for personality disorder, and to
        concentrate instead on the ‘functional assessment’ of the condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0306312712457722">Davidson, 2002</xref>). The functional approach produced an
        increasingly modularized view of personality; first, by cataloguing an individual patient’s
        specific ‘abnormal’ personality features and exploring the distress the patient experienced
        as a result of them, and, second, by using the catalogued features as the basis for a
        complex management plan. Such a plan would be ‘bespoke’, rather than ‘off the peg’;
        individualized, but nevertheless drawing on an eclectic array of standard
            interventions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0306312712457722">17</xref></sup> By
        the end of the 20th century, then, a number of key actors were beginning to treat
        personality (disorder) as potentially plastic – capable of responding to the appropriate and
        skilled application of psychiatric and psychological knowledge.</p>
      <p>However, despite the enthusiasm that many health professionals expressed toward the idea
        that personality disorder could be effectively treated, not everyone was so positive. For
        example, Rampton Hospital psychologist Kevin Howells and his colleagues suggested that
        different models of personality disorder lay beneath the assorted treatment strategies,
        raising questions about appropriateness and efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0306312712457722">Howells et al., 2007</xref>). There also were concerns that
        many of the treatments touted for a broad spectrum of personality disorder had shown
        evidence of effects only for borderline personality disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0306312712457722">Crawford, 2007</xref>) – like ASPD, this was one specific
        ‘variant’ of personality disorder. Furthermore, as Peter Bartlett wryly observed, the
        ‘predicted treatability of a given psychopath seems to a significant degree dependent on the
        psychiatrist engaged in diagnosis’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0306312712457722">Bartlett, 2003</xref>: 328). Thus, while the mental health professions undoubtedly were
        moving toward an understanding of personality disorder as treatable, there was by no means a
        consensus on the issue. Yet it was precisely because the tide of opinion on personality
        disorder was so clearly turning that some commentators felt compelled to advance such
        caveats.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="section6-0306312712457722">
      <title>A policy push</title>
      <p>While some clinicians at the coalface of practice wrote positively, yet cautiously, about
        the treatability of personality disorder, there was markedly less subtlety in some of the
        proclamations made by the DH. In an attempt to correct what was still the common attitude
        that individuals with personality disorder should not be the concern of mental health
        services, the newly formed National Institute for Mental Health in England (NIMHE) published
        a report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0306312712457722">National Institute for Mental
          Health in England, 2003a</xref>) that argued that these conditions were treatable; any
        remaining doubt about this was regarded as lamentable, and something that a new MHA might
        redress. Indeed, it was explicitly stated that the controversial removal of the 1983
        treatability test would ‘highlight the need for new community and in-patient services for
        people with personality disorder’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0306312712457722">National Institute for Mental Health in England, 2003a</xref>: 28). Clinicians were
        encouraged to be more open-minded to the potential of treatment in light of this.</p>
      <p>Ten months later, the NIMHE released the ‘Personality disorder capabilities framework’.
        This was part of a document provocatively titled ‘Breaking the cycle of rejection’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0306312712457722">National Institute for Mental Health in
          England, 2003b</xref>), and aimed ‘to challenge the discriminatory association between
        personality disorder and dangerousness by putting in place services aimed at reducing
        vulnerability and promoting more effective coping by individuals’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0306312712457722">National Institute for Mental Health in England,
          2003b</xref>: 10). The document further promoted a vision of treatability by painting a
        more sympathetic picture of personality disorder than many others (including the DH) had in
        the past: <disp-quote>
          <p>In recent years, the emphasis on risk and dangerousness associated with a very small
            number of people with personality disorder, has obscured the fact that very many people
            with this diagnosis are highly vulnerable to abuse and violence themselves – and to
            self-harm and suicide. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0306312712457722">National
              Institute for Mental Health in England, 2003b</xref>: 10)</p>
        </disp-quote>
      </p>
      <p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, although the NIMHE document alluded to the MHA in its section on
        ‘The broader policy context’, it refrained from more explicit articulation of the
        interconnections between the assumed clinical antipathy towards personality disorder and the
        proposed MHA (specifically, the provision that would remove the treatability test). The
        controversial category of DSPD – which was at the forefront of many clinicians’ attention at
        the time – was not even mentioned. The influence of both DSPD and the 2002 Draft Mental
        Health Bill was nevertheless evident in the list of competencies deemed necessary for
        clinicians working with individuals diagnosed with personality disorder: in particular,
        skills in ‘assessing and managing risk to self and others’. Risk, the leitmotif of the
        proposed reforms to the 1983 MHA, thus structured the NIMHE clinical guidelines, even as the
        same document made gestures to de-stigmatize the disorder.</p>
      <p>The assumed importance of a consensus that personality disorder was treatable to the
        acceptance of the removal of the treatability test was also instantiated through a 2003
        treatment review (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0306312712457722">Warren et al.,
          2003</xref>). The review, which was commissioned by the Home Office and DH through the
        DSPD Programme, aimed to provide an evidence base for ‘informing the decisions about the
        development of services for DSPD’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0306312712457722">Warren et al., 2003</xref>: 8). Building on the aforementioned review by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0306312712457722">Dolan and Coid (1993)</xref> (Bridget Dolan
        was one of the authors of the 2003 report), the 2003 ‘update’ came to similar conclusions:
        namely, that personality disorder was (potentially) treatable, especially through the
        application of therapies such as DBT and therapeutic community models. There was markedly
        less evidence for pharmacological management strategies, not least because of the allegedly
        poor methodological design of published studies – a limitation perceived to be
        characteristic of much of the existing research.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, Warren and colleagues could find no RCTs – the biomedical ‘gold standard’ –
        within the most secure NHS facilities. This deficiency was lamented by Warren et al.,
        although they nevertheless argued that their findings were substantiated by including less
        ‘reliable’ studies in their review (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0306312712457722">Warren et al., 2003</xref>: 5). By doing so, they could make the mass of evidence
        supporting the claim that personality disorder was treatable seem weightier than if they had
        employed rigorous statistical inclusion criteria. In short, the review contained a message
        that both policymakers and many clinicians were receptive to: personality disorder was
        treatable, but more research was needed.</p>
      <p>In sum, through 2002 and 2003, the development of policy and clinical discourse on
        personality disorder brought the treatability of these conditions sharply into focus. In
        recognition of the controversy it had generated and mindful of its aims to successfully
        implement DSPD policy, the DH sought to ally itself with mental health professionals. It did
        this, first, by evoking tropes similar to those that had become increasingly evident within
        clinical discourse – chiefly, those tropes that tended to de-stigmatize personality disorder
        and to emphasize its treatability. Second, it articulated these tropes within the pages of
        key documents, which aimed, in part, to foster a more favourable outlook towards the
        proposed new mental health legislation. In the process, the hopes of clinicians were brought
        more closely into alignment with the aims of policymakers.</p>

      <title>How to treat dangerousness</title>
      <p>The alignment of policy and clinical goals was most markedly apparent in the new DSPD
        Units. By autumn 2005, four high security pilot DSPD Units were running, which contained
        ‘some of the most difficult and challenging individuals in society’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0306312712457722">DSPD Programme, 2005</xref>: 27). Two Units were inside
        prisons (HMP Frankland and HMP Whitemoor), and two were within NHS hospitals (Broadmoor and
        Rampton). Generally speaking, the prison Units stressed the correctional aspects of the DSPD
        Programme, whereas the hospitals focussed more on the therapeutic components. However, even
        within DSPD Units, there were tensions between carceral and clinical approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0306312712457722">Freestone, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0306312712457722">Maltman et al., 2008</xref>)</p>
      <p>Treatment itself, at least in Broadmoor and Rampton Hospitals, was administered by
        multidisciplinary teams consisting of clinical and forensic psychologists, psychiatrists and
        mental health nurses, working together with occupational therapists and other health and
        social care professionals. These individuals acted simultaneously to implement the DSPD
        policy and to treat the psychological and social deviancy of patients diagnosed with
        personality disorder. Treatment aimed to reduce offending behaviour, though many clinicians
        were concerned to treat ‘the person in personality disorder’, rather than managing only
        those aspects that were (in the modularized vision of personality) assumed to be associated
        with (if not determinative of) offending behaviour.</p>
      <p>While medication was occasionally used as an adjunct, psychological therapies were the
        principal tools used by mental health professionals in the DSPD Units.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0306312712457722">18</xref></sup> In particular, CBT (of the
        sort used in the probation service) and related techniques predominated.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0306312712457722">19</xref></sup> As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0306312712457722">Armstrong (2002)</xref> has shown, CBT is well positioned to
        serve both punitive/criminological and therapeutic/clinical ends: it is retributive
        (individuals are held accountable for their antisocial behaviour) while also being
        rehabilitative (antisocial behaviour decreases following therapy). Accordingly, it is not
        surprising that CBT migrated from probation services to the criminological–medical hybrid
        that is the DSPD Programme.</p>
      <p>The role and nature of treatment in DSPD Units draws our attention to three central issues.
        First, DSPD Units are sites where the goals of policymakers and clinicians are closely
        aligned: policymakers can be satisfied that the risk that dangerous offenders represent is
        being reduced, while psychiatrists and psychologists are given the time and resources to
        obey a clinical imperative to treat individuals diagnosed with personality disorder. Second,
        the autonomy of clinicians within DSPD Units complicates the presumption of the unilateral
        political capture of clinical goals that might be inferred from the previous section. That
        some health professionals practising within the DSPD Programme frame their work as treating
        personality disorder rather than solely managing the risky behaviours associated with it
        reveals a more dynamic, though still asymmetric, relationship between the aspirations of the
        DH and clinical communities. Third, the activities of the DSPD Units have subtle but
        potentially profound implications for the understanding of personality disorder. With few
        established conventions regarding the ‘correct’ way to treat these conditions but with a
        remit to do so regardless, professionals in the DSPD Units experimented with different forms
        of psychotherapy and medication. The various treatments relied on diverse underlying models
        of personality disorder; by juxtaposing these therapies, heterogeneous models of the
        conditions were assembled and reconstructed. The DSPD Units therefore acted as laboratories
        within which framings of personality disorder could be experimented with, and they played a
        salient role in the constitution of the conception that personality disorder was
        treatable.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="section8-0306312712457722">
      <title>The social shaping of mental health law</title>
      <p>Though clinicians were busy experimenting with personality in the DSPD Units, they
        nevertheless found time to continue contesting the Government’s ever-evolving plans for
        mental health law. As we have seen, the 2002 Draft Mental Health Bill did not garner the
        support the DH had hoped. It was thus withdrawn and, in September 2004, a new Bill was
        released (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0306312712457722">Department of Health,
          2004a</xref>). Somewhat less controversial than its predecessor, the Bill marginally
        mollified detractors by reintroducing some treatability criteria for cases where involuntary
        compulsion was being considered. Despite this move, it was still criticized for its emphasis
        on risk. Furthermore, some of its detractors claimed that the Bill ignored, for the most
        part, the views of important mental health institutions such as the Royal College of
        Psychiatrists. This was interpreted as exemplifying the Government’s indifference both to
        the clinicians who would implement the new MHA and the patients who would be under its
        purview (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0306312712457722">Brown, 2006</xref>).</p>
      <p>The Government, however, considered that it had ‘taken seriously the concerns raised about
        the first version of the draft Bill’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0306312712457722">Department of Health, 2004b</xref>: 4), but it did not push forward the second Bill.
        Seemingly in response to the massive criticism levelled against it over the previous seven
        years, the DH instead made a different move; specifically, it announced in March 2006 that,
        rather than completely rewriting the 1983 MHA, it would instead amend it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0306312712457722">Brown, 2006</xref>). Accordingly, on 18
        November 2006 a (third) new Mental Health Bill was released (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0306312712457722">Department of Health, 2006a</xref>).</p>
      <p>The 2006 Bill was, of course, criticized. Like its predecessors, it forsook the
        treatability test; according to the DH, this was because the test had led ‘to a false
        presumption that some – particularly those with severe personality disorders – are
        untreatable. This means that detention is sometimes not used when it ought to be, even
        though people with severe personality disorders can be – and are – treated compulsorily
        under the Act’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0306312712457722">Department of Health,
          2006b</xref>: 3). By removing the treatability test, the legislation arising from the 2006
        Bill would ‘take away some unnecessary obstacles to practitioners’ ability to use the Act
        where it is warranted by the needs of the patient and the degree of risk’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0306312712457722">Department of Health, 2006b</xref>: 3).</p>
      <p>Yet, the treatability test was not altogether abandoned. In its place stood the new
        ‘appropriate treatment test’. Similar to the 1983 treatability test, this revised set of
        criteria for detention included the key qualification that treatment should be readily
        ‘available’ for patients, rather than merely being a theoretical possibility. Apparently,
        the appropriate treatment test would call for ‘an holistic assessment of whether appropriate
        treatment is available’ (p. 2); this was seen as a means of shifting clinical attention away
        from treatment outcomes alone – a perceived flaw of the 1983 treatability test.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, what, precisely, a ‘holistic assessment’ entailed was unclear, so too was the
        procedure for establishing (or formally contesting) whether a particular treatment was
        ‘appropriate’. Furthermore, many commentators were concerned that the Bill illegitimately
        conflated ‘appropriate’ with ‘effective’ treatment. In other words, they were concerned that
        individuals could be detained as a consequence of <italic>some</italic> kind of treatment
        being available, irrespective of whether it was the <italic>right</italic> kind. By removing
        the <italic>treatability test</italic> and replacing it with the <italic>appropriate
          treatment test</italic>, the DH sought to ensure that people who ‘had’ to be involuntarily
        detained could be held, but with appropriate safeguards in place: at least some kind of
        treatment needed to be available for the individual being detained. Accordingly, it was
        argued that the new legislation would not result in ‘any significant increase in people
        detained’ (p. 3).</p>
      <p>In spite of the concerns outlined above, eventually the Bill was passed with some
        modifications. Thus, after almost a decade of political wrangling, a new MHA for England and
        Wales was given Royal Assent on 19 July 2007. In marked contrast to the original plan for a
        radical reconstruction of the 1983 Act, the new MHA was an amended version of its
        predecessor. The chief detractors of the DH were, for the most part, mollified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0306312712457722">Mental Health Alliance, 2007</xref>); not
        surprisingly, though, some disapproval still was registered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0306312712457722">Prins, 2007</xref>).</p>

    <sec id="section9-0306312712457722">
      <title>Personality disorder is treatable (isn’t it?)</title>
      <p>On 22 June 2007, one month before the 2007 MHA received Royal Assent, the National Forensic
        Mental Health R&amp;D Programme officially closed. The DH, it seems, no longer felt the need
        to continue to invest so significantly in research concerning the treatability of
        personality disorder, since effective treatments were now widely considered
            available.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0306312712457722">20</xref></sup> As
        Frankie Pidd, of the DH National Personality Disorders Development Programme, commented in
        an article co-authored with psychologist Janet Feigenbaum: <disp-quote>
          <p>The evidence base has emerged over the past two decades to indicate that personality
            disorders are treatable. A range of psychological therapies has been shown to be the
            most effective treatment for personality disorders, though medication can have some
            additional effect in reducing the severity of symptoms. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0306312712457722">Pidd and Feigenbaum, 2007</xref>: 8)</p>
        </disp-quote>
      </p>
      <p>Though Pidd and Feigenbaum accepted that some clinicians might disagree, they asserted that
        such disagreement was based on a ‘false belief’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0306312712457722">Pidd and Feigenbaum, 2007</xref>: 7), and, worse, a belief
        that would increase the stigmatization of individuals diagnosed with personality disorder.
        Pidd and Feigenbaum therefore evoked a narrative of de-stigmatization, consistent with the
        trend in the mental health professions since at least the 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0306312712457722">Pilgrim and Rogers, 2005</xref>), which was especially
        apparent in recent years in the discourse concerned with personality disorder. In so doing,
        Pidd and Feigenbaum presented not only a therapeutic imperative to work with individuals
        with personality disorder, but an ethical duty as well.</p>
      <p>Further, journals such as <italic>Psychology, Crime and Law</italic> devoted entire issues
        to contributions on personality disorder, many of which newly emphasized the treatability of
        these conditions. As widely regarded clinical psychologist Peter Fonagy noted in one special
        issue’s introduction, clinicians should ‘celebrate the emergence of effective biological and
        psychosocial treatments’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0306312712457722">Fonagy,
          2007</xref>: 3). For personality disorder expert John Livesley, the literature was now
        ‘clear that personality disorder can be treated’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0306312712457722">Livesley, 2007</xref>: 28).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0306312712457722">21</xref></sup></p>
      <p>It can be seen, then, that claims in recent years to the effect that personality disorder
        is treatable have come to resound powerfully through clinical discourse: reported inside
        journal pages, argued through presentations in large conferences and small seminars, and
        attested to by practising psychologists and psychiatrists. Today, individuals with
        disordered personalities are still considered problematic, ‘one of the most difficult groups
        in psychiatric practice’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0306312712457722">Newton-Howes
          et al., 2006</xref>: 18). But many professionals now at least consider that treatment is
        possible, despite the continued scepticism.</p>

    <sec id="section10-0306312712457722">
      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>This article has shown how personality disorders came to be widely regarded as treatable in
        the clinical professions and the policy arena. In particular, I have highlighted the
        important role of mental health policy debates in helping to effect this shift. In
        significant ways, attempts to rewrite the 1983 Mental Health Act of England and Wales
        directed new attention to longstanding problems with personality disorder: How should
        offenders with this diagnosis be managed? Who should take responsibility? Are conditions
        like ASPD and psychopathy even treatable? While law is a powerful tool for ordering a
        society, debates over legislative changes cast into sharp relief the ambiguities law is
        designed to manage. By proposing to rewrite the MHA – in particular, by issuing forth highly
        controversial and contested proposals – the DH animated clinical discourse on personality
        disorder, creating new fora for clinicians to articulate their views on the treatability of
        these conditions. Such debate was also directly fostered by the DH; for instance, when it
        commissioned reviews on and research into treatments. In time, a new convention began to
        emerge: personality disorder was framed by many clinicians as treatable, and personality
        itself was regarded as plastic; an entity mouldable through the skilful application of
        clinical technique. Therapeutic technologies did not so much involve the use of novel
        pharmaceuticals; instead, they made use of more familiar psychological methods.</p>
      <p>Visions of treatability were instantiated within the new DSPD Units, which themselves
        straddled the boundaries between the mental health and criminal justice systems. The Units,
        which were set up by the State as part of plans to reform the management of mentally
        disordered offenders, achieved legitimacy through the emerging consensus among clinicians
        that personality disorders such as ASPD and psychopathy were now treatable. The very
        existence of the Units arguably helped to legitimate this novel accord, and, in turn, to
        justify the vast public expenditure on the contested and controversial category of the
        population held in those Units. Political intentions to remove the treatability test from
        the 1983 MHA seemed more palatable after individuals with personality disorder were widely
        understood to be patients who could – and should – benefit from clinical intervention; the
        dismay expressed by many mental health professionals about changes to the MHA were damped
        down. The ‘danger’ of DSPD was, to an extent, neutralized.</p>
      <p>While the DH profited from the new understanding of personality as a treatable entity, so
        too did clinicians who had long held that belief. The material and symbolic benefits for
        these psychologists and psychiatrists included acceptance by their peers, as well as
        increased funding, jobs, and support for treating patients with personality disorder,
        particularly through the DSPD Programme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0306312712457722">Manning, 2002</xref>). Clinicians used the resources of DSPD Units to treat their
        patients, while at the same time they critiqued the notion that DSPD was a legitimate
        medical category. In this way clinicians, in part, appropriated and subverted the very
        policy aimed at their regulation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0306312712457722">22</xref></sup></p>
      <p>More generally, we have seen how UK clinicians mobilized broadly and powerfully to contest
        and eventually influence the new MHA, and that they succeeded in shaping, if not
        determining, a law that would, in time, govern their practice. The recent history of British
        mental health is not, therefore, a simple story of the linear ‘capture’ of clinical goals by
        policymakers. Rather, it is a more complex narrative about the mutual constitution of policy
        and practice, of legal structures and clinical knowledge, and of the multiple acceptances
        and resistances that have enabled this.</p>
      <p>The DSPD Units became important sites for treatment and research, and therefore influential
        hubs, in the new medical-legal network that resulted from the dynamics outlined in this
        paper. Within these sites, clinicians conducted trials of diverse treatments that implied
        different developmental mechanisms for personality disorder, and thereby reconstituted ideas
        about what these conditions were and how they might be acted upon. In effect, psychiatrists
        and psychologists rebuilt the DSPD Units as laboratories for experimenting with all aspects
        of personality disorder, and thus with understandings of personality itself. This
        exemplifies the potential of local sociotechnical spaces – themselves synthesized through
        heterogeneous assemblages of institutions, discourse and practice – to play a central role
        in the generation of clinical knowledge (in this case, knowledge of the nature of
        personality disorder and how to manage it).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0306312712457722">23</xref></sup></p>
      <p>As we have seen, the mutual constitution of mental health policy and practice has
        profoundly altered understandings of personality disorder. Conditions such as ASPD and
        psychopathy are no longer largely considered obdurate, and are now often framed as
        potentially plastic, mouldable through clinical intervention. This reconceptualization on
        the part of a number of forensic mental health practitioners has not led to a panacea: not
        everyone believes that personality disorder can be treated, and doubts remain about the
        future of DSPD policies and practices, including the decommissioning of Units.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0306312712457722">24</xref></sup> But a significant shift has
        occurred, as a direct consequence of the reciprocal interaction between clinical and policy
        debates, and the mutual shaping of knowledge and law. And for many, psychopaths will never
        be the same again.</p>

          <p>The homogenization of the category ‘personality disorder’ has long been common in UK
            mental health, in spite of attempts by formal diagnostic handbooks (or, rather, those
            who produce them) to instantiate sub-categories. The Green Paper accepted this, and
            indeed explicitly rejected the definitional schemes of the US DSM-IV. Instead, it sought
            a unified definition of ‘mental disorder’. Accordingly, even though ASPD and psychopathy
            over-shadowed the other forms of personality disorder, so long as an individual was
            labelled as both severely personality disordered and dangerous, and their dangerousness
            was regarded as causally linked to their personality disorder, then that person could –
            in theory – be involuntarily detained. In this sense, the government seized on
            established convention within UK mental health (that is, to regularly speak of
            personality disorder broadly, rather than specific sub-types) in order to introduce
            proposals that were widely regarded as illegitimate.</p>
