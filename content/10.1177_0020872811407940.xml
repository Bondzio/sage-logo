<abstract>
<p>Survey results from 96 Asian Indians in the USA found that those having depressive symptoms were more likely to have experienced social, family or relationship issues. Logistic regression analysis indicated three significant predictors: 1) individuals with anxiety problems were 11.34 times more likely to have depressive symptoms; 2) each unit increase in the score for family or relationship issues increased the likelihood of depression by 3.74 times; and 3) individuals currently employed were 90.9 percent less likely to have depressive symptoms. Reframing mental health symptoms as reactions to family/social issues will help Asian Indians step forward to seek professional help.</p>

<body>
<p>According to the United States (US) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0020872811407940">Census Bureau (2010a)</xref>, Asian Indians make up the largest South Asian subgroup in the US and form the third largest Asian community in the country. The Indian population grew from 1,678,765 in 2000 to 2,482,141 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0020872811407940">2006</xref>, a 48 percent increase, the highest of all Asian communities. Despite the rapid growth of the Indian population in recent years, little is known about their mental health needs or help-seeking behaviors. This article discusses the results of a study investigating the prevalence of depression and the help-seeking behaviors for mental health issues among Asian Indian Americans. For the purposes of this article, the terms ‘Indians’ and ‘Asian Indians’ are used interchangeably with the term ‘Asian Indian Americans’.</p>
<p>In the US, the stereotype that Asian Indian immigrants are almost always successful has placed them as a model minority (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0020872811407940">Lee et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0020872811407940">Segal, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0020872811407940">Tewary, 2005</xref>). However, a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0020872811407940">Chuang (2005)</xref> revealed that depression was prevalent among three Asian ethnic groups in Texas and most prevalent in the Indian cohort. Another study of 23 multidisciplinary service providers’ recall of past service utilization history found that cultural factors contributed to the denial of depression and delay of treatment among Indians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0020872811407940">Conrad and Pacquiao, 2005</xref>). Recent studies of Indians’ depressive symptoms have examined the psychological well-being of senior immigrants and explained depression from the clients’ perspectives of religiosity, cultural adherence, and life stressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0020872811407940">Diwan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0020872811407940">Gupta, 2000</xref>). The findings from these studies indicated that Indian immigrants are not immune to psychological problems, but might feel uncomfortable discussing mental health issues with service providers. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0020872811407940">Tewary (2005)</xref> states that the model minority stereotype may have placed pressure on Asian Indians and given a false picture of their mental health, thus limiting prevention and treatment efforts for depression experienced by this ethnic group.</p>
<sec id="section1-0020872811407940">
<title>Linking mental health to health care needs</title>
<p>Among the relevant theories seeking to explain mental health issues, the theory of social constructivism is useful when explaining Asian Indians’ help-seeking behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0020872811407940">Tewary, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0020872811407940">Yamashiro and Matsuoka, 1997</xref>). Social constructivism holds that an individual’s view of reality is defined by their perceptions, beliefs, and values, all of which are influenced by their cultural norms. For Asian Indians, their unique cultural beliefs and values, such as those related to family roles and religious beliefs, are likely to shape their perceptions of mental health and their methods of coping with mental health problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0020872811407940">Tewary, 2005</xref>). For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0020872811407940">Hussain and Cochrane (2003)</xref> found that some South Asian women, including Indians, used self-harm to cope with depression while some would use social support, medication, and praying.</p>
<p>With a social constructivist perspective as a theoretical framework, three main themes can be found emerging from the exiting research relating to Asian Indian mental health. First, help seeking is connected to how the social system supports or interferes with the maintenance of optimal individual well-being within the Indian community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0020872811407940">Lee et al., 2009</xref>). Second, due to differences in migration experience, acculturation, ethnic identity, parental roles, and family structure among Indian immigrants, many of them prefer services that help them meet concrete needs and that are congruent with their cultural beliefs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0020872811407940">Mehta, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0020872811407940">Prathikanti, 1997</xref>). Third, Indians’ perceptions of mental health problems are linked to health concerns and coping strategies that promote good health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0020872811407940">Bean and Titus, 2009</xref>); they see ‘mental health’ as a ‘health care’ issue.</p>
<sec id="section2-0020872811407940">
<title>Social support factors</title>
<p>Recent literature on Asian Indians has focused on the impact of family and religion on individual psychological well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0020872811407940">Inman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0020872811407940">Prathikanti, 1997</xref>). Family support within the Asian Indian community is often based on a kinship network that enforces the values of individual responsibility and obligation to the family. In a study of Indian families, most adolescents reported an unshakable confidence that family ties were stable and permanent despite poor communications and the presence of strong parental controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0020872811407940">Segal, 1991</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0020872811407940">Prathikanti (1997)</xref> found that Indians adopted Western customs in the workplace, but maintained family values and the religious ideologies of native cultures at home and in religious gatherings. These values may enable Indians to show strength and resilience in times of difficulty, but may also lead to rejection of external assistance.</p>
<p>Within traditional Indian communities, mental illness is often considered an inherited idiosyncrasy, a family curse, or a life-long affliction with supernatural origins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0020872811407940">Mane and Gandevia, 1993</xref>). Since Indians regard psychiatric illnesses as a spiritual curse or punishment for sins in past lives, turning to priests or spiritual leaders for assistance in order to appease the wrath of God is culturally encouraged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0020872811407940">Mukalel and Jacobs, 2005</xref>). Belief in karma, or moral causation, and in supernatural forces also plays a role in the understanding of mental illness among Indians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0020872811407940">Prathikanti, 1997</xref>). An understanding of these belief systems can help service providers become more effective when working with clients.</p>
<p>As a result of beliefs in the spiritual origins of mental illness, Indian people often turn to religious or spiritual rituals as a means of treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0020872811407940">Mukalel and Jacobs, 2005</xref>). Knowledge of, and treatment of, mental illness is often kept within Indian families, due to fears that others will reject or look down upon the family. Keeping awareness of mental health challenges within the family is seen as necessary to avoid social stigma, maintain family honor and preserve the name of the family. For Asian Indians in America, fear of rejection by friends and neighbors poses great obstacles to getting appropriate medications. Research has not yet addressed the ways in which barriers to help-seeking behaviors among Asian Indians may affect recovery from depressive symptoms.</p>

<sec id="section3-0020872811407940">
<title>Service concreteness</title>
<p>In terms of services, Asian Indian Americans have indicated a strong preference for a family-based perspective. That is, these clients want services to be offered that meet the needs of the entire family. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0020872811407940">Wasan et al. (2009)</xref> compared psychiatrists who treated Indian patients in India with those who treated Indian patients in the US (<italic>n</italic> = 34 in New Delhi, India and <italic>n</italic> = 34 in Baltimore, Maryland) and found that ‘Delhi psychiatrists saw more patients daily (24.3 vs. 11, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001)’ (p. 109), and that families in India were significantly more involved in the treatment process than Indian families in the US. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0020872811407940">Bhattacharya (2008)</xref> focused on the social capital function of the family and found that Indians generally underutilize mental health services because they do not have active family involvement and their future employment prospects are low. Indians who seek help often describe their needs as relating to physical health care, which is viewed as more concrete than mental health care. Indians whose real concern is mental health, but who lack strong family support systems, may turn to healers who can provide them with herbs or other concrete remedies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0020872811407940">
<title>Mental health as health concerns</title>
<p>Most studies on Asian Indian mental health have been concerned with not just Asian Indian, but also other South Asian populations. The National Asian Women’s Health Organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0020872811407940">NAWHO, 1996</xref>) produced useful information from a study in three California counties on the mental health concerns of South Asian women, including Indians. Based on interviews with 84 South Asian women, guilt, pressure, isolation, and stress were some common terms used by the South Asian women to describe health concerns. However, the NAWHO study only examined a few health issues in South Asian women and did not provide specific information on the mental health needs of the Indian population.</p>
<p>A qualitative study of 35 South Asian women living in New York City indicated a strong link between marital/family problems and a wide range of health problems, both mental and physical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0020872811407940">Karasz, 2005</xref>). Depression in particular can be triggered by stress, loss, unemployment, loneliness, lifestyle changes or relationship problems, health problems, and is often associated with a family history of depression. In addition, studies show that unemployment and financial problems result in increased anxiety and depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0020872811407940">Creed et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0020872811407940">Trivedi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0020872811407940">Wong et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>When focusing on depression, the literature has documented findings in various communities, but the need to treat depression among Asian Indians has not been systematically examined. Because of the lack of empirical data and research on this specific population, little is known about their mental health needs or perceptions toward social services. The social constructionist perspective, in relation to mental health issues of Asian Indians described earlier, speaks to the fact that service preferences for this population are culturally based and health care connected. The unique culture of the Indian community warrants further exploration.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>This study examines the factors that contribute to the development of depressive symptoms among Indians in the US and identifies their help-seeking behaviors when facing mental health problems. The study focused on two questions: 1) What combination of variables would best predict depressive symptoms among Indians in the US? and 2) What services would Indians prefer when they encounter mental health problems?</p>
<p>In 2008, an exploratory survey was launched in Houston, Texas, which has one of the largest Asian Indian populations in the US. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0020872811407940">US Census 2000 (2010b</xref>), Asian Indians represented 1.03 percent (20,149 people) of the Houston population. The inclusion criteria for this study were: a) respondents who self-identified as Indians, b) respondents were aged 18 or older, and c) respondents resided in the greater Houston area. Several leaders in the Indian community endorsed the study and encouraged recruitment and participation during their community functions in order to enable reaching a convenience sample of 96 Indians, which represented approximately .05 percent of the Asian Indian population in Houston.</p>
<sec id="section6-0020872811407940">
<title>Data collection and instruments</title>
<p>Following approval of the study by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the University of Houston, four researchers and 10 trained volunteers collected data using paper surveys. The surveys were written in English, reflecting the expectation that most Indians in the Houston area speak and read English. No translated versions of the survey were available. The survey, which was administered anonymously, is entitled ‘Asian Survey’ and contains 14 demographic items and 114 questions on needs and concerns. The survey was tested to achieve good face and content validity in a needs assessment study conducted with six Asian-Americans ethnic groups by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0020872811407940">Leung and Cheung (2008)</xref>.</p>
<p>‘Depression symptoms’ were measured by the Hopkins Symptoms Checklist (HSCL-25) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0020872811407940">Parloff et al., 1954</xref>). HSCL-25 is composed of 25 questions (10 on anxiety and 15 on depression) with a 4-point Likert-type response scale (1 = ‘Not at all’ and 4 = ‘Extremely’ with an average of 1.75 or higher being symptomatic). HSCL-25 has been tested to be reliable when used with Asian populations, with a coefficient alpha of .89 in the Anxiety subscale and .92 in the Depression subscale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0020872811407940">Lhewa et al., 2007</xref>). In this study, anxiety and depression were regarded as two separate variables.</p>
<p>Predictive variables were operationalized with measures of seven different needs and issues. Respondents were asked to answer questions in the seven different areas by using a 4-point Likert-type scale to indicate the degree to which the stated need or issue is a concern (0 = none and 3 = serious):</p>

<sec id="section7-0020872811407940">
<title>Data analysis plan</title>
<p>Prior to conducting a logistic regression analysis, assumptions were checked and bivariate analyses were carried out to assess whether there were significant relationships between demographic characteristics and mental health issues and the participants’ self-reported depressive symptoms. Variables with significant associations were then included in the logistic regression to further investigate their relationships with and the contribution of each variable to the depressive symptoms.</p>

<title>Respondent characteristics</title>
<p>Among the 96 Indian respondents, about 58 percent (<italic>n</italic> = 56) were female, and 69 percent (n = 90) were married. The average respondent was 42 years old and lived in a three-member household. Most respondents (<italic>n</italic> = 76; 79 percent) were recent immigrants who had been residing in the US for 19 years, with a standard deviation of 11.76. Of the 96 respondents, more than one-third (34.4 percent) were residing in two-generation households, while 45.8 percent reported living with one person under age 18, and 19.8 percent lived with one person over the age of 60 in the same household. Approximately 36 percent had a Bachelor’s degree or higher level of education. With regard to income and employment, 14.6 percent of the respondents had an annual household income of less than US$20,000, and 30.2 percent were not currently employed. Nearly half (45.8 percent) of the respondents reported having an annual household income over US$80,000.</p>

<p>Independent sample t-tests were also conducted to evaluate whether Indians with depressive symptoms differed from those without depressive symptoms in terms of association with the continuous variables measured in the survey. The Levene’s test was significant, assuming unequal variances for health issues (<italic>F</italic> = 4.531, <italic>p</italic> = .037). Results showed that Indians having depressive symptoms (<italic>M</italic> = 1.524, SD = .974) were more likely than Indians without depressive symptoms (<italic>M</italic> = .572, SD = .753) to have health issues (<italic>t</italic> [22.241] = 3.705, <italic>p</italic> = .001, Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> = 1.094).

<title>Predicting depressive symptoms</title>
<p>As measured by HSCL-25 in this study, the prevalence of depression among the Indians in this study was 17.7 percent, which is 5 percent higher than the clinical population prevalence indicated in a study of Russian immigrants in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0020872811407940">Hoffmann et al., 2006</xref>), and 2 percent higher than in a study of the urban clients in Norway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0020872811407940">Svensson et al., 2009</xref>). Based on the statistical criterion <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, all significant independent variables resulted from bivariate analyses were included in a stepwise logistic regression for predicting depressive symptoms. Results from the stepwise logistic regression identified the relationship between participants’ characteristics and the HSCL depressive symptoms (χ<sup>2</sup> = 30.662; d.f. = 3, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001 with Negelkerke <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .594). It revealed that only employment status, anxiety, and family/relationship issues could statistically predict depressive symptoms among Indians, while hardship, social issues, and health issues did not show significant results. These family/relationship issues, as mentioned in the measure section, included communication problems with family members, fearing the loss of cultural roots, and abuse in the family.</p>
<p>After controlling for other variables (as listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0020872811407940">Table 1</xref>), the findings show that Indians who have anxiety problems are 11.344 times more likely to have depressive symptoms than those without anxiety problems. Each additional unit in family or relationship issues will increase the likelihood of having depressive symptoms by 3.747 times. Those who are currently employed are 90.9 percent less likely to have depressive symptoms compared to those who are not employed. This model indicates that these three statistically significant independent variables account for 59.4 percent of the sample variability in predicting depressive symptoms. In addition to significant variables suggested by the bivariate analyses above, sociodemographics relevant to depressive symptoms as indicated in related literature were included in the logistic regression for further statistical analysis. These variables included gender and socioeconomic status such as income, education, and marital status. After controlling for other variables, the results remained the same as the original model with employment status, anxiety, and family/relationship issues being significant variables in the manifestation of depressive symptoms among Indians in this study.</p>

<title>Reframing help-seeking</title>
<p>In this study, 30 percent of the Indian respondents did not indicate service preference, while one-fourth would prefer seeking advice from friends or relatives. Respectively, 18 percent and 17 percent preferred consulting physicians and religious leaders, but some assumed that the problem would take care of itself (5.2 percent). Rarely did they consult mental health professionals (3 percent) or herbal doctors (2 percent). Overall, Indians tended to seek advice from friends or relatives and were unlikely to seek professional consultation when facing family difficulties. These findings indicated that reframing problems as family problems or difficulties could help Indians talk about their challenges with mental health professionals. Accepting this reframed idea that they need professional advice to cope with their family difficulties, more Asian Indians may start utilizing mental health services to deal with their life challenges.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Anxiety, unemployment, and family/relationship issues are significantly related to depressive symptoms among the Asian Indian participants in this study. The finding that anxiety is closely associated with depression is supported by other research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0020872811407940">King et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0020872811407940">Ledley et al., 2007</xref>). Service providers should be aware that clients who indicate high levels of anxiety may also be suffering from depression, but may be more willing to discuss symptoms of anxiety than those of depression. Since many immigrants perceive anxiety to be a health concern, they may be more willing to seek help for issues identified as associated with anxiety.</p>
<p>The relationship between unemployment and depression can be understood given the expectation that Indian immigrants will be successful both academically and in terms of careers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0020872811407940">Dasgupta, 1989</xref>). Unemployment often results in problems for not only the job seeker, but other family members. Thus, unemployed Indians may feel a sense of failure not just individually, but in terms of their roles within their families, and this may result in decreased self-esteem. Similarly, the expectations regarding the importance and stability of families may mean that when problematic relationships and other issues exist within families, individuals may be more likely to experience depressive symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0020872811407940">Dhruvarajan, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>This study indicated a significant diversity in terms of socioeconomic characteristics among the Asian Indian participants. The only socioeconomic factor that was significantly associated with depressive symptoms, however, was unemployment. Income, educational level, and gender were not found to have a significant relationship with depressive symptoms. Previous studies have indicated that female Asian Indians are more likely to experience depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0020872811407940">Jonnalagadda and Diwan, 2005</xref>) and that being female in Asian Indian culture has been viewed as a curse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0020872811407940">Goyal et al., 2006</xref>). Other studies have shown that female Asian Indians in the United States are under great pressure to maintain the cultural role of caregiver within the family while also fulfilling an independent role with a job outside the family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0020872811407940">Dasgupta and Dasgupta, 1996</xref>). The present study, however, does not indicate that these gender roles and responsibilities result in significantly higher levels of depressive symptoms for women.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0020872811407940">
<title>Implications</title>
<p>Results from this study indicate that most Indian immigrants living in the United States do not seek help from mental health professionals or from professional counseling services. This finding is consistent with the understanding that the cultural norms of the population promote help seeking within the family or the local community rather than from strangers. Thus, it is important for service providers to understand that a low rate of utilization of professional mental health services does not necessarily mean that service needs are not being met; the needs may be met in a way that is compatible with the population’s preferences, but is invisible to professional helpers. This study is subject to a number of limitations. The participants were volunteers recruited at Houston area community organizations, and cannot be considered representative of all Asian Indians. The small, local sample does not capture the diversity of the Asian Indian population. In addition, surveys were available only in English, and thus the experiences of Asian Indians not familiar with English were not included in the results. The survey was self-administered, and some participants may have failed to understand some of the questions, or may have left items unanswered if they felt uncomfortable with responding. Thus, the results of this study cannot be generalized.</p>
<p>Despite these limitations, this study has a number of implications for practice. First, reframing mental health care services as services that help families cope with challenges and meet concrete needs may facilitate use of these services by more Asian Indians. Programs could integrate mental health issues with job hunting strategies and employment preparation, and could include training to raise awareness of the interconnectedness of mental health and problems associated with work and family.</p>
<p>Another implication of the results of the study is that physicians working with Americans of Asian Indian ethnicity need to be aware of the tendency of this population to describe psychiatric problems in terms of physical symptoms. Studies have shown that a significantly higher proportion of South Asians than Caucasians consulted general physicians for psychological problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0020872811407940">Commander et al., 2004</xref>). Collaborative care by physicians and mental health professionals could be an effective way to help Asian Indians become more accepting of receiving treatment for depressive symptoms.</p>
<p>Although the attitude of second and third generation Indians toward the use of mental health services is changing, sociocultural factors may continue to contribute to reluctance among this population in the use of mental health services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0020872811407940">Mukalel and Jacobs, 2005</xref>). Therefore, there is a need for understanding among service providers of the cultural practices, belief systems, and attitudes of Asian Indians. As noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0020872811407940">Nagai (2008)</xref>, cultural competence is part of the fabric of clinical competence. This study indicates that culturally sensitive practice must encompass assessment and evaluation as well as treatment.</p>
<p>Future research involving qualitative studies and quantitative studies with larger samples could provide more insight into the service preferences of Asian Indians. Further research involving mental health issues other than depression is also important for developing a more comprehensive picture of the service needs of Asian Indians. Research regarding the effectiveness with this population of various mental health interventions is also needed.</p>
