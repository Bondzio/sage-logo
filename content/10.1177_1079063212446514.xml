<abstract>
<p>This study contributes to the area of risk prediction by exploring whether the Static-99R is useful for predicting reoffense in community-based samples, and for noncontact offenders with and without identified victims. A total of 744 participants drawn from an outpatient sex offender treatment program in a large metropolitan area were followed for a period of up to 30 years. Multiple Cox Regressions were run; covariates included length of treatment, status in treatment, Static-99R items, and number of technical probation violations. Overall, reoffending was an infrequent occurrence in this sample regardless of how it was defined, with sexual reoffenses identified in 13% of the sample and any criminal reoffense identified in 20% of the sample. Consistent with previous research, the Static-99R was a better predictor of sex-related reoffenses than of nonsexual reoffenses. However, in no case were more than a couple of the items significantly related to reoffending and these items differed depending on reoffense definition.</p>

<p>Risk assessment tools for predicting recidivism among sexual offenders have played a vital role in the implementation of civil commitment procedures and contributed to community notification decisions in some jurisdictions in the United States. These tools have been developed using samples consisting predominantly of contact sexual offenders and most have been validated for recently incarcerated populations. Thus, there are few validated methods for recidivism prediction in community-based samples, which tend to have large numbers of noncontact offenders, many with offenses lacking identifiable victims. This study contributes to the area of risk prediction by exploring the possibility that one of these instruments, the Static-99R, can show validity when used with a community-based sample of both contact and noncontact sexual offenders, with and without specific victims, and extends the previous research with the Static-99R by exploring the ability of this instrument to predict future noncontact, as well as contact sexual offenses.</p>
<p>Although there have been other actuarial tools developed (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1079063212446514">Epperson et al., 2000</xref>, November; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1079063212446514">Quinsey, Harris, Rice, &amp; Cormier, 2006</xref>), the most widely used sex offender risk assessment instrument is the Static-99 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1079063212446514">Hanson &amp; Thornton, 1999</xref>), developed for use with adult male sex offenders at the time of their release from treatment or incarceration. The Static-99 is a 10-item measure based on static variables of high relevance in determining the likelihood of recidivism as determined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1079063212446514">Hanson and Bussière (1998)</xref>. The measure includes demographic, criminal lifestyle, and criminal sexual history variables. The Static-99 risk assessment instrument has been used for over a decade and continues to show validity for predicting recidivism among sexual offenders. In a recent Bayes analysis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1079063212446514">Beauregard and Mieczkowski (2009)</xref> found the Static-99 to “be an accurate and reasonably robust predictor of reoffense” (p. 196). In a meta-analysis of 118 prediction studies, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1079063212446514">Hanson and Morton-Bourgon (2009)</xref> found the Static-99 to be among the best supported measures for the prediction of sexual recidivism. In addition, the Static-99 has been found to be valid when used with samples from across North America (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1079063212446514">Barbaree, Langton, &amp; Peacock, 2006</xref>) and Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1079063212446514">de Vogel, de Ruiter, van Beek, &amp; Mead, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1079063212446514">Ducrol &amp; Pham, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1079063212446514">Rettenberger &amp; Eher, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1079063212446514">Sjöstedt &amp; Långström, 2001</xref>) for the prediction of sexual reoffense.</p>
<p>As studies have suggested that the Static-99 did not adequately account for the decrease in risk associated with increased age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1079063212446514">Barbaree, Langton, Blanchard, &amp; Cantor, 2009</xref>), the authors of the scale undertook a revision. After reviewing recidivism information on more than 8,000 individuals, a new age variable was developed for use in the Static-99R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1079063212446514">Helmus, Thornton, Hanson, &amp; Babchishin, 2011a</xref>). This new variable modified the Static-99 age weighting by rising the age through which one point was assigned from 25 to 35 years, and revising weighting for older individuals by subtracting points for those age 40 or above. No other variables were changed from the Static-99 to the Static-99R. Sexual reoffense rates predicted by the Static-99R are similar to those predicted by the Static-99 for those below 40, and significantly closer to the observed rates for those above 40 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1079063212446514">Helmus et al., 2011a</xref>). Although the Static-99R continues to overestimate rates of violent reoffense for older individuals, it does not do so consistently for sexual reoffenses.</p>
<p>While many investigations have demonstrated the effectiveness of the Static-99, the Static-99R, and other actuarial measures to identify high-risk sex offenders in postincarceration decisions, there has been less exploration of the usefulness of actuarial tools in community-based samples. In addition, none of the currently available risk assessment tools are appropriate for use with noncontact offenders other than those with specific intended victims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1079063212446514">Phenix, Helmus, &amp; Hanson, 2012</xref>). Community-based treatment providers are tasked with protecting the public and making decisions about the relative risk of offenders who have never been incarcerated, many of whom are on probation for noncontact sexual crimes. The lack of validated risk assessment tools for use with community-based sexual offenders and those with noncontact crimes makes this process problematic. The Dynamic Supervision Project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1079063212446514">Hanson, Harris, Scott, &amp; Helmus, 2007</xref>) has followed a large sample of sex offenders on community supervision, but that group differed significantly from the sample used in this study as nearly all of the offenders had been recently released from incarceration, and none had been in the community for a period of 6 months or longer prior to the start of the study. In addition, the follow-up period was approximately 40 months; significantly shorter than the period used in this study. In addition to a lengthy follow-up period, this study also extends the research by including a wider range of noncontact sexual offenders, including those whose offenses do not have identified victims, including those whose offenses are related to child pornography, prostitution, or consensual sexual behaviors in public.</p>
<p>This study uses data from a community-based program collected over the course of more than 30 years. The sample consists of sexual offenders who were assessed, but not necessarily treated, at an outpatient sex offender treatment program in a large metropolitan area. In 1985, a 5-year follow-up study was conducted with 55 participants from this treatment program, yielding no recidivism based on Minnesota criminal history records (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1079063212446514">Dwyer &amp; Amberson, 1985</xref>). Following the same group of men for 10 years using the same methods yielded a recidivism rate of 3.7% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1079063212446514">Dwyer &amp; Myers, 1990</xref>). In 1997, a study was undertaken of 180 men from the same treatment program. They were followed for 17 years using criminal records from Minnesota and surrounding states (i.e., Wisconsin, Iowa, North Dakota, and South Dakota) as well as Canada, which indicated a 9% recidivism rate. In 2002, a 23-year follow-up was conducted using a sample of 380 men. The overall reoffense rate in this study was 12.9%. Reoffending in these studies was defined as an arrest for a sexual crime, either with or without victim contact. The rate of reoffending in this sample was found to be consistent with that found in the most current meta-analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1079063212446514">Hanson &amp; Morton-Bourgon, 2009</xref>). Whereas those studies included only those individuals who had participated in treatment at the center, the current study includes all individuals who were assessed, regardless of whether they participated in treatment.</p>
<p>The current study uses data from a follow-up period of over 30 years. Its purpose is to explore the factors that predict reoffending in this sample of community-based sexual offenders, which includes substantial numbers of both hands on and hands off offenders. Controlling for treatment variables we explored the use of the Static-99R, both the complete instrument and individual items, for prediction of reoffense. The number of probation violations, a more direct measure of the ability of individuals to adhere to rules and expectations, was included in the analysis as well.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants were included in this study if they participated in an evaluation within the research site, an outpatient sex offender treatment program. The majority of the participant group was referred to the site by probations, and had participation in sex-offender specific treatment as a condition of probation. While they were free to select another treatment provider, for these participants, treatment was not truly voluntary. Exclusion criteria included lack of index sex offense, being under the age of 18 at time of leaving the program, and refusal to allow their clinic record to be used for research. As the treatment site is part of a large research university, all participants are asked if they are willing to allow their clinic record to be used in research at intake, and given the opportunity to refuse at that time. Only one individual identified for this study refused consent for research. While this program has at times, during its 30-year history, provided evaluations and treatment for adolescents and children, only those who were involved as adults were eligible for this study. Participants were grouped according to the amount of treatment they received at the program. Those who completed the evaluation, but did not enter treatment at our program (<italic>n</italic> = 170) made up the “evaluation only” group. These were not necessarily individuals who did not receive any treatment, as it is quite possible that they received treatment at another site. Other participants either dropped out of treatment before completing a full year (180), dropped out after completing a full year or more of treatment (148), were asked to leave treatment (35), were currently in treatment (24), or graduated from treatment (163). A total of 744 participants were included in the study. Of these, 718 were male, 14 were female, and the remainder were of unknown gender. Time at risk ranged from 8 months to 31 years, with a mean of 16.75 years. Because of the outpatient treatment setting, participants were considered at risk during treatment. Thus, participants were considered at risk for reoffending from the date of their initial appointment until the end of the follow-up, unless they were incarcerated or died during that period.</p>

<sec id="section3-1079063212446514">
<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>Data were drawn from treatment program files and Criminal History Record Information from the Minnesota Department of Public Safety, Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) files. Data were abstracted from the clinic file by trained research assistants using a detailed coding guide. Variables included the following: participants’ characteristics: age, gender, marital status, and DSM diagnosis; offense characteristics: victim age(s), gender(s), and relationship(s) to offender, and date of offense(s); treatment characteristics: dates of first and last appointment, and treatment status at date of last appointment; Static-99R items: age, having lived with an intimate partner, criminal history including violent and sexual offending, and victim characteristics. All variables were coded based on criminal records and chart information by the trained research assistants according to the <italic>Static-99: Coding Rules–Revised</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1079063212446514">Harris, Phenix, Hanson, &amp; Thornton, 2003</xref>) except for the age variable, which was coded according to “Improving the Predictive Accuracy of Static-99 and Static-2002 with Older Sex Offenders: Revised Age Weights” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1079063212446514">Helmus et al., 2011b</xref>). When questions arose, coders resolved them through discussion, referring to the coding guide, and when necessary, consultation with senior researchers. A complete list of variables coded is available on request.</p>
<p>The BCA files provided data regarding criminal history including dates of offense, arrest, and court appearances, charges and convictions. Information on dates of incarceration was also included in the BCA files. This information, when combined with the information from the charts allowed researchers to identify reoffenses when they occurred, code them as sexual or nonsexual, and determine whether a victim was involved.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1079063212446514">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>Multiple Cox Regressions were run using the time between first clinic appointment and first offense as the dependent variable. Cox Regression was chosen because it allows researchers to estimate survival rates across time, while taking into account differences in time at risk due to varying entry dates as well as periods of incarceration.</p>
<p>This analysis was run for sexual and nonsexual offenses, and for contact and noncontact offenses, as well as for any offense. Data were censored if, at the time of BCA record retrieval, no reoffense had occurred. Data were also censored at time of death, and for periods of incarceration, when applicable. Covariates in the model included length of treatment, status in treatment at date of most recent appointment, the Static-99R items, and number of technical violations of probation noted in BCA records.</p>
<p>Recidivism was defined as a new criminal offense occurring after the initial evaluation. In determining recidivism, the date of offense was used where available. When the date of offense was not available, the date of arrest was used. Offenses were categorized based on the statute number and statute description listed in the BCA records. Offenses fell into six categories: contact sexual, noncontact sexual, contact nonsexual, noncontact nonsexual, and unknown. Only those offenses that were missing both statute number and statute descriptions were categorized as unknown. An examination of the first criminal offense listed for each of the participants indicates that almost all of the contact sexual offenses were either criminal sexual conduct charges (78%), or charges for sexual contact with a minor (19%). The noncontact sexual offenses consisted primarily of exposure offenses (55%), in addition to those for voyeurism-type offenses (24%), and those related to child pornography (14%). The contact nonsexual offenses included assaults (65%), robbery (12%), and domestic abuse (18%). The majority of the Noncontact nonsexual offenses were motor vehicle offenses (23%), property offenses (51%), or drug offenses (17%).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Of the 744 participants in this study, 79% were not identified for any type of reoffenses during the follow-up period. The sexual reoffense rate was 13%. The rate of reoffending for contact sexual offenses and for any offenses was stable from below 25 years of age to 45 years of age. A significant decrease in reoffense of any type was seen for those offenders who were 45 or older at the beginning of their time at risk (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1079063212446514">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Reoffense rates for all types of reoffense varied based on time at risk. For those participants with times at risk of under 3 years, reoffense rates were consistently low. Not only did these participants have a limited period of time to reoffend, but because all participants were considered at risk at all times residing in the community, it is likely that many of these participants were in treatment and/or on probation for much of their risk period. For these reasons, it is not surprising that higher reoffense rates were seen for those at risk between 3 and 5 years, and again for those at risk 5 to 10 years. Reoffense rates leveled off at this point, and decreased for those at risk over 20 years, suggesting that after having survived 20 or more years in the community without reoffending, the chance of a new sexual or violent offense becomes less likely.</p>
<p>It is also apparent that those participants whose index offense was a contact offense were more likely than those with a noncontact offense to be rearrested for a new contact offense. In fact, as compared to 68 of the 542 contact offenders (12.5%), only 7 of the 168 noncontact offenders (4.2%) went on to be arrested for a contact sexual reoffense. Fifty-six participants died during the 30-year follow-up period after a time at risk of between 7 and 306 months. Of those who died before the end of the follow-up period, seven had arrests. Four were arrested for a sexual offense, including two with contact offenses, one with both a contact and a noncontact sexual offense, and one with a noncontact sexual offense. The remaining three were arrested for nonsexual offenses. All three were arrested for nonviolent offenses, while one was arrested for a violent, nonsexual offense as well. Although dates of offense were used to ensure that any reoffense truly occurred following their initial contact with the treatment program, in some cases date of offense was unavailable, and date of arrest was used instead. It is possible that some of these offenses occurred prior to contact with our treatment program, and thus are not truly reoffenses.</p>

The regression weights (Bs) in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1079063212446514">Table 2</xref> indicate the direction of the association between the predictor and the probability of reoffending. Positive values of B indicate an increased chance of reoffense, and the relative hazard rate provides an indication of the magnitude of that relationship. A relative hazard rate of 2 indicates a probability of reoffense double that observed in the reference group, for instance, those without a prior record of nonsexual violence.</p>

<p>Rates of either sexual or any reoffense were higher for those who had higher Static-99R scores (<italic>p</italic> = .001) and more technical violations (<italic>p</italic> = .001). Consistent across both definitions of reoffending, the effect of the Static-99R score was driven by two items. Those individuals with prior noncontact sexual offenses (<italic>p</italic> = .014 for sexual and <italic>p</italic> = .019 for any reoffense), as well as those with prior violent, nonsexual offenses (<italic>p</italic> = .036 for sexual and <italic>p</italic> = .017 for any reoffense) were significantly more likely to reoffend. Neither time in treatment, nor treatment completion was a significant predictor of either sexual reoffenses or any reoffenses.</p>
<p>To better understand the predictors of sexual reoffending, separate regressions were conducted to model contact and noncontact sexual reoffending. Of the 744 individuals included in this analysis, 74 (10%) had a contact sexual reoffense and 28 (4%) had a noncontact sexual reoffense. Only 7 of the contact sexual reoffenders presented with a noncontact index offense at intake.</p>
<p>The Static-99R was a significant predictor of both contact (<italic>p</italic> = .021) and noncontact (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) reoffending. However, the effect of the Static-99R score on prediction of contact sexual offending seemed to be driven by prior violent, nonsexual offenses (<italic>p</italic> = .012) and sexual offenses involving unrelated victims (<italic>p</italic> = .036), whereas the effect on prediction of noncontact sexual offenses seemed to be driven by prior contact sexual offenses (<italic>p</italic> = .017) and prior noncontact sexual offenses (<italic>p</italic> = .001). In addition to Static-99R items, each technical violation increased the likelihood of a contact sexual offense by 2.5 (<italic>p</italic> = .001) and, while treatment status at time of discharge was not a significant predictor of sexual reoffense (<italic>p</italic> = .087), those who left treatment due to being terminated by the treatment program were 2.7 times as likely to reoffend with a contact sexual offense as compared to those who were only assessed and not treated at the program (<italic>p</italic> = .029). No differences were seen between those who completed treatment, left on their own prior to completion, or never entered treatment in regards to contact or noncontact sexual reoffense (See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1079063212446514">Table 3</xref>).</p>

<title>Nonsexual Reoffenses</title>
<p>Nonsexual reoffenses were divided into violent and nonviolent categories, and each was modeled separately. Of the 744 individuals included in this analysis, 25 (3%) had a violent, nonsexual reoffense and 63 (9%) had a nonviolent, nonsexual reoffense during the follow-up period. The Static-99R was a significant predictor of both violent (<italic>p</italic> = .032) and nonviolent (<italic>p</italic> = .001) nonsexual reoffending. The effect of the Static-99R scores was driven by prior nonsexual violence for both violent (<italic>p</italic> = .005) and nonsexual, nonviolent (<italic>p</italic> = .034) reoffenses. In addition, the age item of the Static-99R was significantly related to nonviolent reoffending (<italic>p</italic> = .032). Those individuals with prior nonsexual, violent offenses were about 5.5 times more likely to commit a nonsexual, violent reoffense and almost 3 times more likely to commit a nonsexual, nonviolent reoffense. Younger age was associated with increased likelihood of nonviolent reoffending (See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1079063212446514">Table 4</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study reports on the prediction of reoffending in an outpatient sample of adult sexual offenders. There have been a number of actuarial risk assessment instruments developed since the mid-1990s; however, there is little evidence that any of them are useful in predicting whom, amongst those allowed to remain in the community, will reoffend (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1079063212446514">Rettenberger, Matthes, Boer, &amp; Eher, 2010</xref>). Overall, reoffending was an infrequent occurrence in this sample regardless of how it was defined, with contact sexual offenses identified in 10% of the sample and any criminal reoffense identified in 20% of the sample over a follow-up period of up to 30 years.</p>
<p>Consistent with previous research, the Static-99R was a better predictor of sex-related reoffenses (either contact or noncontact sexual offenses) than of nonsexual reoffenses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1079063212446514">Barbaree, Seto, Langton, &amp; Peacock, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1079063212446514">Rettenberger et al., 2010</xref>). However, in no case were more than a couple of the items significantly related to reoffending. Contact sexual offenses were related to Static-99R items: (a) prior nonsexual violence, (b) having at least one unrelated victim, (c) having been discharged from the treatment program, and (d) the number of technical probation violations. That is, community-based sexual offenders committing contact reoffenses were more antisocial, as indicated by prior nonsexual offenses, showed more of an inability to adhere to the conditions of probation, and failed to adhere to treatment expectations. Individuals reoffending with a noncontact sexual offense, however, were likely to be more sexually deviant, as indicated by the Static-99R items of prior contact sexual offenses and prior noncontact sexual offenses.</p>
<p>The above findings give some insight into the risks posed for contact and noncontact sexual offending. It appears that risk to commit contact sexual offenses is due to the presence of antisocial, criminal behavior, while in the absence of such antisocial behavior, sexually motivated behavior may reflect itself in noncontact activities like exhibitionism and voyeurism. It is important to note, however, that both contact and noncontact sexual reoffenses were infrequent in this sample.</p>
<p>Conversely, reoffending in nonsexual ways, either violent or nonviolent, was related to criminality, including the prior nonsexual violence item of the Static-99R, and the number of technical violations of probation. Thus, when evidence of sexual deviance is absent, then the presence of prior criminal behavior seems to lead to continued nonsexual criminal behavior, with a history of failure to adhere to conditional release rules conferring increased risk of violent rather than nonviolent, criminal behavior. Only nonsexual, nonviolent reoffending was related to the age item of the Static-99R</p>
<p>In contrast to prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1079063212446514">Barbaree et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1079063212446514">Craig, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1079063212446514">Hanson &amp; Bussière, 1998</xref>), no increase in reoffense was seen for those participants below the age of 25 at the beginning of their time at risk. In fact, we found a consistent level of reoffending from below 25 to 45 years of age, where there was a dramatic drop. The fact that our below-25 group had no more reoffense risk than those 25 to 45 may be related to our age variable. That is, we used age at intake into treatment or assessment, which differs from most studies, which define the age variable as time at release from incarceration or hospitalization. Thus, our youngest age cohort was generally under some type of supervised release and/or outpatient treatment during at least part of their follow-up period. This may account for our failure to find that this age group was at increased risk, because they were probably above 25 years old when they completed treatment and/or were released from probation.</p>
<p>This study is one of the first to explore the predictors of reoffending over a large sample of community-based sexual offenders with a long (maximum of just above 30 years) time at risk. Our study is limited by the data available on reoffending, which only reflected arrests and convictions in the State of Minnesota. It is possible that some of our sample reoffended in another state, which would not be reflected in our findings. This might have increased the reoffense rate, but it is not clear that it would have an impact on the associations. Our study is also limited by the fact that participants had different experiences with sex offender treatment, with some not receiving treatment, some completing treatment, and others not completing for various reasons after various lengths of time in treatment. Some of these treatment outcomes have been found to be associated with increased risk, such as being terminated by the program which was found to be associated with contact sexual reoffending in this study. While previous research has consistently found a detrimental effect of failure to complete treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1079063212446514">Craig, Browne, &amp; Stringer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1079063212446514">Hanson &amp; Bussière, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1079063212446514">Miner &amp; Dwyer, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1079063212446514">Minnesota Department of Corrections, 2000</xref>), this study did not. This may be because we separated treatment noncompletion into several categories. Rather than comparing reoffense rates between those who did not enter the specific program, those who completed the program, and those who did not complete, we included three separate categories of noncompleters: early dropouts, late dropouts, and those who were terminated from the program. The only significant difference seen was in the subset of noncompleters who had been terminated. Thus, it was not leaving treatment that conferred increased risk, but failure to comply with treatment expectations to such a degree that one was terminated by the program. It is possible that similar results would be seen in other studies if this group was separated from other noncompleters, as voluntary dropouts did not reoffend at higher rates than treatment completers. Finally, because this was a long-term follow-up study, the sexual offender treatment that participants experienced changed in both large and subtle ways. It is not clear from this study how those differences in treatment affected reoffending outcomes.</p>
<p>In spite of these limitations, this study provides guidance to those who provide services in outpatient settings. Although the currently available actuarial instruments are not validated on this sample, it does appear that reoffending is systematically related to variables measured in the Static-99R and other actuarial tools. Specifically, reoffense potential appears related to both measures of sexual deviance and measures of antisocial behavior. The presence or absence of each of these factors determines the risk for reoffense. Risk for contact sexual offending was related to antisocial behavior and sexual deviance as indicated by having unrelated victims. Noncontact sexual offending was related to sexual deviance in the absence of antisocial behavior, and nonsexual, violent reoffending was related to antisocial behavior in the absence of sexual deviance.</p>
<p>In addition, we found evidence that noncontact sexual offending does not lead to contact sexual offense. Only 4% of noncontact offenders in this sample were found to go on to commit a contact sexual reoffense during the follow-up period. In addition, we did not find an association between the Static-99R item, prior noncontact sexual offenses, and contact sexual reoffenses.</p>
<p>It has been recommended that baseline risk be determined using a static actuarial tool, with risk management being determined using more dynamic risk factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1079063212446514">Hanson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1079063212446514">Skeem &amp; Monahan, 2011</xref>). However, at present, there are no actuarial tools to set this baseline risk in community-based and noncontact offenders. Our results indicate that a baseline risk, at least in terms of identifying those at minimal risk, can be determined through historical variables, which may help to better target limited resources to those most in need of them. It is quite likely that those showing none of the indications of sexual deviance or antisocial behavior are in need of fewer treatment and supervisory services than those with indications of sexual deviance and/or antisocial behavior. Furthermore, our data indicate that life-time probation and registration requirements are unlikely to improve community safety. We found that after the age of 45, the risk for sexual reoffending drops precipitously. In addition, our data indicate that after 20 years in the community offense free, the risk of reoffending is extremely low.</p>
