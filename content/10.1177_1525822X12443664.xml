<p>This article formulates field relationships in terms of a “partial trust” dynamic. This is particularly relevant for conflict and postconflict settings in which respondents are secretive because they are embedded in uncertain and highly threatening social and political contexts. Reciprocal, delicate yet stable, partially trusting relationships open up opportunities for accessing hidden worlds of thought and behaviors. Based on field research on the grassroots genocide tribunals (<italic>gacaca</italic> courts) in Rwanda, this article posits three specific types of opportunities for insider access: the incremental, accidental, and the contrived. While the partial trust dynamic also constrains the extent to which the researcher can probe these openings, fieldwork under these conditions can nevertheless produce a rich and diverse array of insights.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>How does a researcher begin to collect data in settings where respondents are fearful, guarded, and actively engaged in hiding or deliberately distorting information to protect themselves? I encountered this dilemma as I conducted field research on the <italic>gacaca</italic> trials in Rwanda in 2004–2005. Ten years earlier, almost 800,000 Tutsi had been killed by Hutu militia, soldiers, friends, and neighbors. In the aftermath, ordinary courts struggled to process thousands of cases of genocide suspects from among the Hutu, the majority ethnic group. The new government was headed by the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), a party dominated by former Tutsi rebels. It established 12,000 local-level tribunals authorizing lay citizens, mostly peasants, to try the accused who belonged to their communities.</p>
<p>The trials generated considerable insecurity and fear for ordinary Hutu and Tutsi who continued, as they had done for hundreds of years, to live next to each other on the hills. Genocide survivors and Hutu witnesses were reported murdered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1525822X12443664">Human Rights Watch 2007</xref>). Thousands of Hutu languished in prison for years with no due process guarantees. When confession was rewarded with provisional release, the return of those prisoners only added to the anxiety about the prospect of living together again. Orchestrating this uncertain countrywide experiment was an ethnic minority–dominated government that had consolidated itself and become increasingly repressive. Critiques of the <italic>gacaca</italic> system were penalized and concerns that the tribunals did not address crimes against Hutu perpetrated by the RPF were silenced domestically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1525822X12443664">Human Rights Watch 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1525822X12443664">Morrill 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1525822X12443664">Reyntjens 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1525822X12443664">Waldorf 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>At the local level, it soon became apparent that those who had participated in genocide had an incentive to dissimulate because the truth would mean a prison sentence. Bribery or blackmail to suppress damaging information was not uncommon. Those who had preexisting conflicts with members of their community used information (real or fabricated) to implicate the latter in the genocide. Those who were really innocent but falsely implicated in the trials had an incentive to resort to secret maneuverings of their own to cobble together a coalition sufficiently willing to produce information in their defense. As <italic>gacaca</italic> law prohibited legal representation for either the plaintiff or the defendant, it was incumbent on both parties to collate information and forge alliances to back them in order to secure the desired outcome at the trial. Many judges were engaged in buying, selling, blocking, and passing on information, just like many plaintiffs and defendants were doing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1525822X12443664">Chakravarty 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1525822X12443664">Human Rights Watch 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1525822X12443664">Wolters 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Thus, building local coalitions, exposing “real” information, fabricating other information, and enabling or blocking access to those pieces of information turned into crucial means of survival for those participating in the trials in various roles. Since these maneuverings were prosecutable offenses, the <italic>gacaca</italic> context was enveloped in multiple layers of secrecy.</p>
<p>Clearly, trust would be crucial for successful field research. For an outsider like me, an Indian woman studying in America, this turned out to be a delicate but reciprocal relationship based on “partial trust.” I wanted to study how people responded to the process (e.g., evasion, collusion, compliance, and resistance) and to understand their attitudes toward the government that had initiated the trials.</p>
<p>This was a sensitive topic in this socially divided and politically repressive setting. My field relationships would open up specific kinds of (often unexpected and highly contingent) opportunities for data collection but obstructed me from probing any further than the partial trust dynamic allowed.</p>
<p>It is axiomatic among ethnographers that trust is a necessary foundation of successful data collection in the field. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1525822X12443664">Bosk (2004)</xref> notes, “the formula is simple: no trust, no access; no trust, no consent; no trust, no data” (p. 418). To what extent is trust actually established? A substantial literature suggests that the ethnographer is not faced with a binary choice in her field relationships. It is unlikely that she or he is either completely trusted or not trusted. Varying levels of trust can be achieved depending on the social roles adopted by the researcher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1525822X12443664">Agar 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1525822X12443664">Fetterman 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1525822X12443664">Johnson et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1525822X12443664">Magolda 2000</xref>). The literature warns of the dangers of too much rapport, and some scholars even suggest that rapport has been overrated as a fieldwork stratagem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1525822X12443664">Douglas 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1525822X12443664">Springwood and King 2001</xref>). This article aims to make explicit the partial trust dynamic and seeks to explore its operation in the Rwandan context.</p>
<p>The gray zone in which trust and distrust are simultaneously present can be a feature of field relationships in stable and familiar contexts (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1525822X12443664">Ergun and Erdemir 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1525822X12443664">Maginn 2007</xref>). However, it is in violent, socially divided, or politically repressive settings that the problems of data collection under a partial trust dynamic are acutely amplified. The proliferation of ethnographic literature on ethnic conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1525822X12443664">Argenti-Pillen 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1525822X12443664">Rowler 2001</xref>), state terror and armed groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1525822X12443664">Green 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1525822X12443664">Sluka 2000</xref>), and authoritarian settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1525822X12443664">Peritore 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1525822X12443664">Wedeen 1999</xref>) suggest that in these highly uncertain and fluid contexts it is not unusual to encounter silence, self-censorship, or dissimulation because people fear possible reprisals from their own people, from the social other, or from the state. Secrecy, suspicion of outsiders, and the problem of partial trust are arguably generic to such research settings, even though none of these works have framed methodological issues explicitly in this manner. Using the specificities of the Rwandan case, then, can help illuminate a general phenomenon. The examples in this article are specific to the Rwandan context but are potentially useful to fieldworkers in sensitive settings elsewhere.</p>
<p>Explicitly formulating the partial trust dynamic allows ethnographers to tap into the logic of the implicit understandings forged between researcher and the researched. It helps us understand when limited windows of opportunity open up and recognize when and why they shut down in an uncertain and highly contingent context. The article shows that opportunities for data collection are available even in contingent and unexpected turns of events in the field. Misleading cues from respondents or even the closing of a hitherto open window of opportunity can allow inferences about the operation of and local actors' responses to power. It makes explicit what we could not know. Putting the research process center stage emphasizes the intimate relationship between research process and product. Finally, it reminds us to respect the limits of field relationships so as to avoid backlash in the field. Recognizing the operation of partial trust can help reduce the risk of provoking local actors, or creating fear and anxiety among them. It can serve to identify threats to respondents, associates, and self that can arise from dangerous field settings (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1525822X12443664">Lee [1995</xref>:3] for a discussion of the difference between situational and ambient dangers).</p>
<p>This article contributes to the reflexive field methods literature in conflict and postconflict transitional settings that has been largely preoccupied with the ethics of research on vulnerable populations, managing risks to the researcher, and challenges of representation or writing ethnographies of violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1525822X12443664">Kovats-Bernat 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1525822X12443664">Robben and Sluka 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1525822X12443664">Sriram et al. 2009</xref>). It examines participant observation as a field method under conditions of partial trust. It thus contributes to the emerging literature on field methods and data collection among Rwanda scholars, which is mostly (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1525822X12443664">Thomson [2010]</xref> for an exception) focused on the challenges of conducting interviews and using data generated within the context of self-censorship and repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1525822X12443664">Fujii 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1525822X12443664">King 2009</xref>). This article shows that the participant observer is afforded limited but tantalizing glimpses into reality behind the “stage setting” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1525822X12443664">Ingelaere 2010</xref>:42), even where the researcher’s relationships are only partially trusting.</p>
<p>The article proceeds as follows: I survey some existing models of field relationships and discuss why participant observation under conditions of partial trust became the dominant mode of fieldwork. After a brief overview of the research site, I discuss how I negotiated entrée into the field. The article then examines how the partial trust dynamic mediated three specific types of data collection opportunities. I highlight some of the findings that were generated and explore the advantages of participant observation over interviews and surveys in these sensitive settings. In closing, I explain why partially trusting relationships were stable and produced rich insights when one might expect them to constrain or even jeopardize fieldwork.</p>

<title>Building “Trusting” Field Relationships</title>
<p>At least three different traditions of ethnography speak to the attempt to gain “insider affiliation” and access “insider knowledge” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1525822X12443664">Adler and Adler 1987</xref>).</p>
<p>In covert research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1525822X12443664">Humphreys 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1525822X12443664">Venkatesh 2008</xref>), the researcher hides his or her research role, engages in bonding behaviors, and participates in core group activities. This involves a flagrant use of deception. Still, it is rarely noted that some amount of secrecy is an integral part of robust fieldwork, even in overt ethnographic research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1525822X12443664">Calvey 2008</xref>). Another tradition is that of participatory action research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1525822X12443664">Brown and Kaplan 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1525822X12443664">Stoecker and Beckwith 1992</xref>). Respondents coproduce knowledge in a collaborative and equal partnership with the researcher. In conflict settings, local actors may not perceive the researcher as an ally, and collaboration with local actors preconceived as allies can be risky. Nevertheless, the point is well taken that our research relationships need to be as open and reciprocal as practically possible. Finally, in the phenomenological tradition of ethnographic work, the researcher adopts, sometimes fully, the worldview and behaviors of group members, thus minimizing the need for deception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1525822X12443664">Hayano 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1525822X12443664">Krieger 1983</xref>).</p>
<p>The question was: How could I access insider information without deceiving completely, trusting completely, or thinking of community members as allies in the field? As an outsider in Rwanda’s uncertain setting, I was limited to “peripheral member” status. In this role, the researcher interacts “closely, significantly and frequently enough” to be recognized by group members as a “regular” who enjoys “limited trust” (Adler and Adler 1987:36). I was enmeshed in mutual relationships of partial trust with elements of deception on both sides.</p>
<p>What opportunities for insider access opened up? How did the dynamic of partial trust block me from other data collection opportunities? I use personalized “tales of the field” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1525822X12443664">Van Maanen 1988</xref>) to explore these questions below.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1525822X12443664">
<title>Research Site</title>
<p>I draw on data from a sector (grassroots administrative zone) I will call Masaka in southern Rwanda. Names of people and places have been altered for the sake of anonymity. I lived with a local Hutu family with whom I had become acquainted during my first brief research visit. The husband sometimes served as <italic>gacaca</italic> judge, and their home was conveniently located in a central place. The sector office (where <italic>gacaca</italic> trials were held) was close, and a 30- to 40-minute walk would take me to outlying points in the sector. My interpreter was a Hutu male in his 30s who was familiar with this area.</p>
<p>It was common knowledge that I paid rent in return for accommodation and that my relationship with my hosts was contractual. From my earlier visit, I was aware that the husband was reputed to be an honest judge. I expected that this would give me some leverage with genocide survivors as well as with ordinary Hutu. Local realities were complex. There were Hutu widows of Tutsi men who had been killed in the genocide. There were also Hutu in whose homes Tutsi had been killed. These individuals were leading witnesses at most trials. There were Tutsi female survivors married to Hutu men. While social location was important, my residence with a Hutu family or my reliance on a Hutu interpreter was unlikely in itself to produce a negative perception of me among survivors or a positive perception among Hutu.</p>
<p>Impression management was also critical. My interpreter’s calm demeanor and varied experiences during the genocide made him an empathetic listener. We actively sought to connect with the entire range of actors involved in <italic>gacaca</italic>, even including nonparticipants (those who did not attend trial sessions or had not testified). It was evident that we were not interested in privileging one voice over another. We found that people wanted to talk for a variety of reasons: to be collegial, to complain, to present themselves in the best light, to share grief, to reminisce about life before genocide, and even to good naturedly educate the naive outsider. Still, this did not preclude the possibility of self-censorship, deliberate misinformation, or deception.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1525822X12443664">
<title>Entrée and the Dynamics of Rapport</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1525822X12443664">De Lame (2005)</xref> points out that the researcher is often labeled, talked about, observed carefully, and tested during initial field encounters. The <italic>conseiller</italic> (elected top sector official) invited me to share a drink at the bar. I was surprised to find about 15 other people present. They were introduced to me as various members of the sector administration along with a couple of wealthy traders from the hill. They called me the <italic>muzungu</italic> (foreign white person) among themselves, but I did not fall neatly into that preconceived category. They teased me about my poverty. A remark about my fraying shoe laces caused a round of hearty laughter; when my interpreter translated for me, I joined in the laughter.</p>
<p>There were some personal questions: Was I married? Where was my husband? I explained that he could not take time off from studies. This was met with some sympathy. What did I want to do after my degree? I said I wanted to teach. With murmurs of approval, they said that Rwandans respected the value of a good education; they wanted their children to go to school and find good jobs. Quite unexpectedly, someone said, as if speaking in the name of every Hutu, that they were ashamed of what the world might think of them. Unsure if this was a test to assess where my sympathies lay, I replied that everyone had not killed and reiterated that I was a student, so I would try to learn from them. This appeared to be a satisfactory response. I was cheerful but reserved, answered all their questions, and asked some small questions of my own.</p>
<p>I had an important breakthrough when I received some invitations to visit their homes. Since public references to ethnicity were taboo given the RPF’s program of ethnically blind nation building, it was primarily through meetings and conversations with their families that I was able to determine that the movers and shakers at the local level were Hutu. There were barely any Tutsi officials at the grassroots. The significance of this dawned on me later as I observed local reactions to interventions from above (primarily the mayor’s office at district headquarters) in the <italic>gacaca</italic> process. They associated upper levels of government with Tutsi rule and responded negatively to directives from above.</p>
<p>In a famous account of escaping from a police raid, Geertz has noted how complicity can become the basis of rapport in the field (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1525822X12443664">Marcus 1997</xref>). I describe below how my interpreter and I similarly became complicit in local affairs. A sentence of 26 years was announced at the first trial I attended. The defendant then casually walked out of the courthouse and disappeared. There were no police at the trial. People poured out, shouting excitedly. Many began to leave as dusk settled. As I waited uncertainly with my interpreter, two female survivors approached us trembling with fear. Some witnesses were lingering, also worried about their safety. They appeared willing to look after each other that night. I returned to my hosts feeling anxious and guilty for not doing more.</p>
<p>I was not a completely foreign presence after that day. Instead of glancing at me or looking past me, I was greeted with quick smiles and the customary Rwandan handshake. I had reacted calmly after witnessing a tense moment. I did not ask too many questions, go to the district police, or report anyone. It is possible that an account was presented to the mayor absolving sector officials or judges of responsibility for the escape. Insofar as I knew and I did not take this further than anyone in the community wanted, I was privy to a shared secret and therefore trusted. People carried on everyday conversations about fears and insecurities related to <italic>gacaca</italic> without any nervousness about my presence. Yet the fact that I had not revealed myself completely in terms of my sympathies, ideology, or political standpoint constrained the extent to which they, in turn, revealed themselves.</p>
<p>In the following section, I show how these partially trusting relationships worked to produce three distinct kinds of opportunity (incremental, accidental, and contrived) for accessing insider information.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1525822X12443664">
<title>The Potential of Limited Openings</title>
<sec id="section6-1525822X12443664">
<title>Incrementally Accessed Findings</title>
<p>The relationship with my host family shows that certain kinds of information can only be incrementally accessed. In the field, I was the “closest” to them in that we shared daily meals, shared common spaces in the house, and spent many evenings passing around a calabash of banana beer.</p>
<p>Initially, conversations revolved around safe topics: the weather, the cost of living, stories of family, and so on. I gradually became more involved in their lives. I stayed up with the mother, Marie, who worried when her son Fred returned home late from work. I began to tutor the young girl who worked in their home when she expressed an interest in learning English. Sometimes, Fred, my interpreter, and I would walk to the nearest trading center to spend a couple of hours at a popular bar that attracted young people in the area. Over time, I noticed a perceptible lowering of my host family’s guard around me.</p>
<p>Dinner conversations were now punctuated with references to the daily news on the radio. President Kagame had warned in Parliament that no one would evade the trials. The BBC had been threatened with closure because of their critical coverage of the <italic>gacaca</italic> process. My hosts' remarks never snowballed into a full-blown political discussion. I sensed their hesitation, so I would express some (but not too much) interest and ask them to explain. Their views suggested strong feelings about the ruling RPF that ranged from fear and resentment to resignation.</p>
<p>Marie talked about how they had expected to die in an RPF attack during the closing days of the genocide. Instead, the family felt lucky to be alive and still free because it was commonly believed that RPF leaders did not think there were any innocent Hutu. One night, Fred launched into a defiant and passionate monolog when I asked him why he never attended the weekly sessions. He argued that the <italic>gacaca</italic> courts were a dishonorable means to humiliate all Hutu by threatening them with incessant and arbitrary arrests. Marie kept very quiet while he spoke angrily and emotionally for a long time. She would look at him anxiously but could not ask him openly to censor what he said. The next morning, my interpreter took me aside to say that Fred had requested that I remember that he had spoken in confidence.</p>
<p>Though we were more comfortable with each other, I did not volunteer information about my daily activities nor did the family members ask what I thought about the <italic>gacaca</italic> or who I had met on a given day. I had no foolproof way to gauge how much to probe, but evasions or silences were signals that I needed to tread carefully. An unspoken understanding had emerged, as neither party would push for more details than we sensed the other was willing to divulge.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1525822X12443664">
<title>Accidentally Accessed Findings</title>
<p>Highly contingent turns of events can also be opportunities to garner useful insights. The examples below illustrate this.</p>
<p>Some genocide survivors were lobbying the mayor, alleging that the <italic>gacaca</italic> appeals court president had been bribed into authorizing the release of a prisoner. When the president refused to resign voluntarily, he was summoned to the mayor’s office. Word spread like wildfire that he had been threatened into writing a letter of resignation.</p>
<p>I lingered, after a <italic>gacaca</italic> session, to talk with the trial court judges. We drifted into a local bar and sat in a private room at the back. The <italic>conseiller</italic> joined us a little later. The conversation quickly moved to a collective reflection on the nature of judges' work. They spoke frankly about the social cost of alienating Hutu, of staving off constant pressure from survivors who sometimes launched fabricated claims, and the risks of confronting higher political authorities on decisions they had made. For the moment, my presence as an outsider did not seem to matter much. I had instructed my interpreter not to lean over and translate for me while these spontaneous discussions were unfolding. From prior experience, I knew that when that happened people would turn to me with a sudden awareness that perhaps I knew too much. That inevitably put an end to the natural flow of events. I sat there absorbing as much as I could based on my knowledge of salient words and phrases in Kinyarwanda. I would reconstruct the discussion later when alone with my interpreter.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the conversation turned to what Hutu owed Tutsi in this period of <italic>gacaca</italic> justice (everyone in the room was Hutu). They began to compare the burden of historical injustices perpetrated by Tutsi on Hutu against the obligation on Hutu to make amends for the injustice of genocide (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1525822X12443664">Newbury [1988]</xref> for Rwanda’s long and complicated nexus between power and ethnicity). The release of one innocent Hutu could cause such a furor! They felt that Hutu had become victims of the new political dispensation.</p>
<p>From here, the conversation turned to the nature of Tutsi rule. They began to draw similarities between the rule of the Tutsi king (in the precolonial and colonial past) vis-à-vis the RPF regime. This was decidedly risky talk. It ran completely counter to the RPF’s new interpretation of Rwandan history that it used to justify its political program. This conversation was beginning to revolve around ideas popularized by the Hutu republics of postindependent Rwanda. According to that narrative, Rwanda’s precolonial and colonial past had marked a long period of exploitation of the Hutu majority at the hands of a privileged Tutsi minority. RPF narrative, on the contrary, glorified the same historical period as a time of unity and mutual support between Hutu and Tutsi.</p>
<p>This dialog was dangerous for at least three reasons. First, a comparison of perceived historical injustices against Hutu with the genocide was skating on thin ice. A new draconian law on “genocide ideology” (much criticized by international human rights organizations) imposed prison sentences for speech that could be interpreted to have minimized the genocide. Second, it undermined the central moral premise of RPF rule, which was that Tutsi have been the real victims of a troubled national history that began with their persecution under the Hutu republics of independent Rwanda and ended with genocide. Finally, comparing RPF rule with that of the Tutsi king of the preindependence era suggested they were clearly skeptical of the idea that the RPF stood for an ethnically blind project of nation building and reconciliation as it claimed.</p>
<p>At this point, the <italic>conseiller</italic> slightly turned to look at me. Others did the same and the conversation petered out. The <italic>conseiller</italic> could not tell them openly to exercise caution, but he signaled discreetly that the talk had gone too far. I was trusted enough to be welcomed into a closed circle of friends and colleagues and to listen in on their critical assessment of <italic>gacaca</italic>-related problems. But when this began to take the shape of a private but direct challenge to the premise of RPF rule, I was an interloper in their midst. It was a brief but fascinating glimpse into the substantial chasm between government justifications of power and the perceptions of Hutu grassroots elites. Perhaps as a way to fill the awkward pause, the judges now spoke directly to me, urging me to write about their experiences.</p>
<p>I draw on this same controversy to give another example of a contingent revelation mediated by the partial trust dynamic. The regularly scheduled trial session had been delayed due to pouring rain. Along with the judges, I retired to a local bar that was empty at that hour. A sector official arrived hurriedly. I knew he was an important person, owner of a business at the trading center and president of a number of local cooperatives. He whispered into the ear of the president of the trial court and they walked off somewhere.</p>
<p>No one asked any questions. I scanned their faces but they continued to sip their drinks in silence. Finally, the trial court president returned with information that the mayor would visit the sector to meet with the appeals court judges, a signal that there would be pressure on the appeals court president to resign. The judges of the trial court would not be directly impacted by the outcome, yet it was apparent that something was afoot. Afraid of showing excessive curiosity, I sat there in a “bland and naive” way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1525822X12443664">Wood 2006</xref>), mimicking the mask they presented to me.</p>
<p>A judge pulled out a piece of paper from his pocket. It was a handwritten list of votes that the president had received at his election. The involvement of the sector official suggested a larger move to resist the toppling of the appeals court president. It appeared that they were preparing to use an argument about the popular vote behind the judge to challenge the mayor, a bold move considering that open mobilization could be costly, given RPF repression. A brief window into a local attempt to resist the mayor’s bidding, it shut down as quickly as it had opened up. The president hushed him, barely glanced in my direction, and the paper vanished into a pocket. A moment later, I made a remark about the heavy rain and feigned disinterest by asking if we should go back to our residence. It is not clear if they would have summoned the courage to mount the challenge. The matter ended when the president resigned under duress a couple of days later.</p>

<title>Contrived Revelations</title>
<p>Over time, I was able to discern general patterns of partially trusting behavior against which certain actions appeared strange or inconsistent. Ability to identify a discordant encounter when it occurs can prevent researchers from being duped or drawn into local struggles. To make sense of an encounter such as this, researchers may begin to intuit what they cannot see or do not know yet. It can guide them to the questions they should be asking. With delicate probing, it is possible to get a fuller view of local conflicts that belie surface appearances.</p>
<p>I was walking past a local bar when I heard someone call out to me from inside. A handful of trial court judges and local officials were present. After some small talk over a drink, they mentioned that one of the vice presidents of the <italic>gacaca</italic> trial court had been accused over a year ago of participation in genocide. That accusation had been dropped after a survivor testified in his defense. I was informed that fresh evidence had surfaced recently indicating that the accusations were true and the vice president needed to be replaced.</p>
<p>This experience felt strangely discordant. I was being invited into a private discussion and plied with information without having to ask or probe. This was not the typical sort of accidental revelation in which events would take an unexpected turn while I was with a group of people.</p>
<p>What was at stake? I turned to other sources to explore the relationship between these judges and the vice president. Court records showed that the testimony of a genocide survivor had indeed cleared him of the charges. As I was observing the weekly trials at that time, I realized that she (I will call her Helena) was a key witness against the defendant in the trial currently underway. A clue surfaced in an interview with another survivor. To illustrate her point that survivors struggled for justice, this female survivor quoted Helena, saying that judges were trying to suppress testimony against the defendant because he was related to the trial court president. Indeed, the conflict between Helena and the president turned out to be real. Two days later at the trial, the president rebuked Helena for spreading rumors that challenged his integrity.</p>
<p>I wondered if it was possible that Helena was pressuring the vice president to pick up the cudgels on her behalf. Surely she had leverage over him, having extricated him from accusations that would have deprived him of his post, stripped him of his aura of moral authority, and possibly sent him to prison. Had the vice president pushed the president into a corner by pressing for the defendant to be sentenced, thereby provoking backlash? I had often seen the president sharing a drink with the judges and other individuals who had invited me into the bar. It was clear that they were friendly and on good terms. Was my invitation into the bar part of an attempt to revive the accusation and spread it around to discredit an inflexible colleague?</p>
<p>There was some evidence that this interpretation was probably correct. In contrast to the easy camaraderie that I had observed since my arrival, the vice president now barely spoke to his colleagues. He began to show up late for trial sessions and sat looking harassed and withdrawn. He was finally ousted on the basis of renewed accusations. The case in which the defendant was the president’s relative was also shelved.</p>
<p>This episode showed how self-interest turned out to be a significant driver of <italic>gacaca</italic> dynamics. The judges in the most important positions on the bench (all Hutu) had no interest in reviving the accusation against their colleague, the vice president, until he proved to be an impediment in their attempt to acquit the defendant. Their loyalty to the president might be rewarded at some point, perhaps with the president’s support on cases in which they had an interest. One might mistake the Hutu vice president for an upright judge who supported a genocide survivor’s testimony that he believed to be true. However, this appeared to be an alliance forged in self-interest. For Helena, it showed the necessity of having to strategize. Compromising morally in one instance (by clearing the vice president of all charges) could help her secure justice in another case in which she had a stronger interest. From observing the weekly trials, it was my understanding that Hutu judges could be impartial arbiters even though they worried about the risks of alienating their coethnics. They would maneuver to produce a specific outcome only when one or more of the more powerful judges or perhaps a powerful local official had a vested interest in a particular case.</p>

<title>Insights from Participant Observation and Comparison to Other Fieldwork Methods</title>
<p>There is a scholarly consensus that vertical and centralized state structures allow elites at the center to control local affairs in Rwanda (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1525822X12443664">Straus 2006</xref>). My field research gave me a bottom-up view of the Rwandan state. I found there was a great deal of resentment about interventions from the top (most frequently from the mayor’s office at the district). From the perspective of local actors, Rwanda appeared to be an ethnically stratified state, in which local elites such as sector officials and <italic>gacaca</italic> judges were predominantly Hutu (this may not be true in eastern Rwanda, e.g., where there is a denser concentration of Tutsi who returned to Rwanda after the genocide) who associated higher levels of authority with the domination of Tutsi elites. They privately contested RPF narratives about a peaceful past under the Tutsi king and were not persuaded that the <italic>gacaca</italic> system was just.</p>
<p>Yet local elites complied with directives from above. Hutu judges, for example, worked without pay to process hundreds of cases. While they felt strongly about the need to make amends for the atrocities of genocide, they were also motivated by the fact that they could protect certain friends and relatives and wield power over the fates of many others. Noncompliance was not an option, given the coercive might of the RPF apparatus. However, foot dragging (shelving the case when unable to acquit the defendant), covert attempts at resistance (counting electoral votes of the appeals court president), and various behind-the-scenes maneuverings were certainly possible.</p>
<p>Local dynamics around the trials revealed a complex picture. On one hand, there were various in-group fractures. Friends incriminated friends when they confessed to secure provisional release. Neighbors accused other neighbors falsely to secure payback for preexisting grievances. Hutu judges tried to outmaneuver each other to obtain their desired goals. Across ethnic divides, on the other hand, the simultaneity of processes of polarization and collaboration was evident. Genocide survivors found genuine support in the testimonies of Hutu who had been attacked for protecting Tutsi. They also entered into alliances of mutual convenience with each other (as in Helena’s case above). Often, they were isolated, unable to find support, and forced to seek intervention from the mayor’s office at the district (e.g., seeking the dismissal of the appeals court president believing that he had accepted a bribe). This move generally backfired, prompting muted complaints among Hutu about the relentless accusations and the benefits that survivors allegedly received from a Tutsi-dominated government. These feelings were dangerous since they reinforced the idea of the Hutu–Tutsi binary as an unambiguous zero-sum game, this time presenting all Tutsi as beneficiaries and all Hutu as victims.</p>
<p>A rich and nuanced set of insights that penetrate the “stage setting” is thus possible under conditions of partial trust. Participant observation was an appropriate field method since this project involved assessment of unfolding local processes. There were advantages to participant observation over surveys or interviews. A survey instrument typically attempts to fit responses within a limited number of categories, making it difficult to capture the ambiguities of behaviors, emotions, and understandings in play. Without investing the time to build relationships (living in the community as participant observer may produce the highest payoffs in this regard), surveys in Rwanda tend to yield “suspiciously positive” answers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1525822X12443664">Rettig 2008</xref>:26). It is also risky to ask direct questions about the RPF, given the general climate of fear. In a one-shot interview, the researcher can probe gently but this is not likely in itself to be an effective strategy. Conducting repeat interviews is more effective because it gives the researcher the confidence to ask more pointed questions as trust levels may grow over time.</p>
<p>Where candid answers are not easily forthcoming, participant observation allows the close range detection of many overt and covert actions that speak volumes. Much can be learned from the observation of routine behaviors (e.g., attending the weekly trials), and tapping into windows of opportunity that open up incrementally, accidentally, or in contrived fashion. With growing awareness of new behaviors and events, the researcher is constantly confronted with new questions that appear salient. An interview questionnaire or survey schedule may be predesigned and unable to capture evolving ground-level contingencies. Finally, it is useful in sensitive microsettings to identify interview respondents or make sampling decisions after a period of time spent in participant observation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1525822X12443664">Cornelius 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1525822X12443664">Thomson 2010</xref>). Identifying individuals with local influence is not always possible right at the outset. It is both unsettling and risky to ask about ethnic identity. It is easy to arouse suspicions by asking personal questions (such as location of residence or if a family member is in prison) too soon. For the ethnographer working under partial trust conditions, participation observation may work best with repeated interviews held in a conversational and informal manner or surveys with open-ended questions built into them.</p>

<title>Fieldwork Strategies under a Partial Trust Dynamic</title>
<p>In sensitive contexts, “soaking and poking” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1525822X12443664">Fenno 1986</xref>) must be undertaken with caution. Gentle probing is more effective than pushing too hard or too soon as these may be perceived as threatening. Body language, poker faces, silences, and evasions can signal when to proceed or hold back. One has to guard against becoming an unwitting participant in advancing or hurting the reputation or interests of local actors. For instance, in the case of the renewed accusations against the vice president of the trial court, I refrained from bringing up the topic with anyone. I probed discreetly if the topic came up in the course of some discussion and pieced together information derived from various sources.</p>
<p>The partial trust context means that windows of opportunity that opened up will also inevitably shut down after a point. This does not signal fieldwork strategies gone awry. However, pushback such as negative rumors about the researcher, unwillingness to talk to her or him again, reporting her or him to the authorities, or violence against a key respondent raises serious concerns. The researcher’s actions may have created more anxiety and mistrust than is conducive for safe and effective fieldwork (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1525822X12443664">Howell 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>Fieldwork involved the use of (mild forms of) deception on the part of both researcher and respondents in this overt form of field research. I had the judges' informed consent to observe their work and monitor the trials. I had disclosed the purpose of my research, obtained all necessary permits, and openly transcribed testimonies during trial sessions. In informal interviews, I followed oral consent procedures and participation was entirely voluntary. Yet, in the encounters described in this article, I did not take notes and I explicitly instructed my interpreter not to translate for me in these situations. I observed while pretending not to observe and took copious notes in private after long discussions with my interpreter.</p>
<p>The contingent, uncertain, and highly fluid nature of fieldwork did not allow for informed consent procedures at every encounter. In a humorous vein, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1525822X12443664">Lofland and Lofland (1995)</xref> represent the problem thus:<disp-quote>
<p>During my research with the police… the patrol car was directed to a fight and the two constables jumped out and started wrestling with the combatants. Was I supposed to… shout “freeze!” and then, inserting my head between the entangled limbs, whip out my code and… chant out the rights of the participants?… In these circumstances, gaining consent is quite inappropriate, because activity is taking place that cannot be interrupted. (p. 36)</p>

<title>Sources of Stability in a Partially Trusting Relationship</title>
<p>The partial trust dynamic is delicate, inherently unstable, and open to mutual betrayal. Even if respondents know that the researcher is not a government spy, they could betray him or her to the authorities to signal loyalty to the regime and ensure their own safety. Despite the researcher’s assurances, there is no absolute reason for respondents to believe that he or she will not willingly or unwittingly betray their identities. Why a relationship premised in partial trust worked in a stable manner without endangering either the respondents or this researcher needs to be explained.</p>
<p>First, I enjoyed a genuine modicum of trust. My first visit had not brought anyone unwanted attention from the government. I was discreet; never displaying too much curiosity or thrusting myself into situations even though that meant foregoing potentially valuable data. There were also moments of “deep rapport” with respondents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1525822X12443664">Nilan 2002</xref>:375). Assuaging a survivor’s fears and listening to an accused woman’s despairing story during an interview were moments when extremely difficult experiences were shared. Despite the fact that I never discussed my opinions on <italic>gacaca</italic>, the RPF, or genocide, these moving encounters helped us connect with and understand each other.</p>
<p>Geertzian complicity based on shared secrets proved to be the second source of stability within the partial trust context. I knew, for instance, how easily the accused had escaped at the end of the trial but did not use that knowledge to the detriment of any of the local actors involved. I had proven myself reliable by my ability to keep a secret. Finally, stability was the product of mutual calculation. For respondents to betray me would mean they might have to explain why they agreed to speak with me and why they expressed the views they did. For me to betray the respondent would mean (aside from a violation of ethical obligations) an immediate end to any acceptance and goodwill that I enjoyed in the local community.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>An analysis of the partial trust dynamic is most pertinent for researchers who work in the fluid and uncertain environments of conflict or postconflict zones. This article identifies three windows of opportunity (incremental, accidental, and contrived openings) for the participant observer in partially trusting settings. Since these windows open briefly and invariably shut down after a while, it is necessary for fieldworkers to recognize these opportunities when they arise and tap into their potential to generate rich and nuanced insights. For instance, in accidental encounters and unexpected turns of events in the field, actors deviate from routine or politically safe scripts allowing the researcher a quick glimpse at what lies behind the self-censorship and “stage setting.” Even contrived encounters that are staged for the researcher can be a source of valuable information. It is an understanding of how partially trusting field relationships operate that helps the researcher identify a discordant encounter when it occurs and guides her or him toward an explanation in a careful, nonintrusive fashion.</p>
<p>Ultimately, partially trusting field relationships take time to build and demand patient and reflexive fieldwork. Explicitly capturing its operation helps the researcher understand how the dynamic constantly mediates what data collection opportunities become available. It is crucial to protect the researcher from serious missteps in the field and enables him or her to protect the community within which he or she lives and conducts this risky work. It makes ethical action possible by demanding continuous self-regulation.</p>
