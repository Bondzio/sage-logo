        <p>Recent policy documents have promoted partnership working between criminal justice
          agencies and third sector organizations (TSOs) as a means to tackle re-offending. However,
          the context in which such partnership working takes place has received little attention
          despite the fact that relationships between frontline criminal justice staff and TSOs are
          likely to be crucial to successful initiatives. This article draws on qualitative
          interviews with prison staff and representatives from TSOs in eight prisons to examine
          relations between the two groups and to consider whether TSOs are treated as partners,
          guests or competitors in prisons.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Third sector organizations (TSOs)<sup>
          <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0264550512458475">1</xref>
        </sup> have a long and rich history of working with the criminal justice system. In the late
        19th century Discharged Prisoners’ Aid Societies provided food, clothing and other practical
        assistance on release from prison, and the probation service itself was started by voluntary
        activity in the form of the police court missionaries. It is estimated that nearly 1800 TSOs
        work with offenders, ex-offenders and their families as their primary beneficiaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0264550512458475">Gojkovic et al., 2011a</xref>), providing a
        range of services, including drug and alcohol treatment, education and training, housing
        advice and advocacy, spiritual and faith guidance, mentoring and peer support schemes.</p>
      <p>The benefits of criminal justice agencies working in partnership with third sector
        organizations (TSOs) have long been recognized, and recent measures to encourage a mixed
        economy of criminal justice are likely to further increase the role of the third sector in
        work with offenders and ex-offenders. However, little consideration has been given to the
        context in which partnership working with TSOs takes place, to relationships between
        criminal justice and third sector workers, and to the particular challenges that TSO
        personnel working in a secure prison environment might face. This article will first
        contextualize the current position of TSOs in working with offenders with reference to
        recent policy developments before exploring the cultural context in which service provision
        by TSOs in criminal justice –  particularly prisons – occurs. Drawing upon a wider
        qualitative study of the role of the third sector in criminal justice in eight prisons, it
        will then examine relationships between frontline third sector and criminal justice staff,
        to consider whether TSOs are typically seen as partners, guests, or indeed competitors
        within the prison environment.</p>

      <title>Third sector organizations in criminal justice: The policy context</title>
      <p>A series of policy documents from the Ministry of Justice (MoJ), the National Offender
        Management Service (NOMS) and others, have recognized the benefits of working in partnership
        with the third sector in criminal justice, particularly to reduce re-offending (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0264550512458475">Home Office, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0264550512458475">MoJ, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0264550512458475">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0264550512458475">MoJ/NOMS, 2008a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0264550512458475">2008b</xref>), reflecting the realization that state
        correctional services cannot address this issue alone. For example, the third sector
        reducing re-offending action plan states:<disp-quote>
          <p>The third sector has a critical role to play as advocates of service users and
            communities, as partners in strategy and service development, and as service providers.
            We value their role as enablers of effective community engagement, volunteering and
            mentoring. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0264550512458475">MoJ/NOMS, 2008b</xref>:
            7)</p>
        </disp-quote>
      </p>
      <p>The strengths of TSOs and their consequent appeal as partners in service provision are
        well-rehearsed, and include their specialist expertise, and cost-effectiveness, but also
        their relative independence from the criminal justice system. This may allow for
        considerable innovation and diversity in their provision, and help service users to view
        them as trustworthy and approachable and allow them to act in an advocacy role, representing
        the views of service users to criminal justice and other agencies. In the case of
        organizations based in a particular locality, they may engage local people in their work
        through volunteering and mentoring, thus enhancing social cohesion and links with the local
        community and can assist in the provision of a seamless ‘through the gate’ service (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0264550512458475">Bryans et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0264550512458475">Mills et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
      <p>Recent developments in criminal justice policy have sought to open up the criminal justice
        market and expand the involvement of TSOs in work with offenders. Following the
        recommendations of the Carter review of correctional services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0264550512458475">Carter, 2003</xref>), the creation of NOMS in 2004 envisaged
        that work with offenders would be opened up to competitive tendering, with public, private
        and third sector organizations competing to provide commissioned services. The Offender
        Management Act 2007 removed the legal barriers to third and private sector providers taking
        over some of the responsibilities associated with probation and in 2009, following the
        recommendations of the Corston report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0264550512458475">Corston, 2007</xref>), £10 million was allocated to TSOs to provide community support for
        women offenders and women at risk of offending. Services to help reduce re-offending were
        initially expected to be commissioned from a range of providers by Regional Directors of
        Offender Management (DOMs), but these have now been replaced by a central commissioning team
          (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0264550512458475">NOMS, 2011</xref>). Several private
        sector companies have also recognized the benefits of working in partnership with the third
        sector and have formed consortia with TSOs to bid for prisons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0264550512458475">Neilson, 2009</xref>), and payment by results schemes. Serco
        has been successful in winning contracts to run a prison in London and to continue to run
        HMP Doncaster, with their third sector partners; Turning Point and Catch 22.</p>
      <p>The Coalition Government has sought to continue the expansion of criminal justice markets
        through the promotion of payment by results schemes to bring out ‘the diverse skills from
        all sectors’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0264550512458475">MoJ, 2010</xref>: 41),
        with the aim of moving to a model where every service will be competed unless there are
        compelling reasons why this should not happen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0264550512458475">MoJ, 2011</xref>). In July 2011, nine prisons were put out
        to tender, the largest single privatization programme in the history of the prison service,
        and TSOs are expected to be involved in bidding for them in partnership with both private
        and public providers. However, whilst larger organizations may be able to respond to payment
        by results, the involvement of small and medium-sized TSOs in such schemes may be more
        limited as they are unlikely to have the financial reserves or cash flow to be able to wait
        for payment following successful results, or they may end up as sub-contractors, paid little
        for their work, due to the fees deducted higher up the management chain. Concerns have also
        been expressed that organizations involved in payment by results may ‘cherry pick’ the
        easier cases, leaving the rest of the sector to pick up the more intransigent cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0264550512458475">Clinks, 2012</xref>).</p>

      <title>The cultural context</title>
      <p>Despite this enthusiasm for partnership working amongst policy makers and the rising
        profile of TSOs in this area, relationships between frontline staff in criminal justice and
        third sector partner organizations have received little attention in the literature, even
        though good working relations are likely to be crucial to the success of any partnership.
        Relationships between probation staff and volunteers have been discussed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0264550512458475">Gill and Mawby, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0264550512458475">Ward, 1984</xref>), with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0264550512458475">Gill and Mawby (1990)</xref> finding that
        although probation staff recognized the value of volunteers, they could also be hostile
        towards them, fearing that they were endangering current staffing levels and undertaking
        tasks that it was felt should be carried out by probation staff. Research on the
        relationships between third sector and prison staff and the potential challenges faced by
        TSO staff working in secure environment of a prison has, however, remained more elusive. The
        priorities and working practices of the prison service and TSOs are likely to differ, with
        prison service staff being traditionally more focused on punishment, controlling offenders
        and managing risk, whilst third sector organizations tend to favour more person-centred,
        rehabilitative approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0264550512458475">Mills et al.,
          2011</xref>). Charitable organizations and volunteers have traditionally been derided as
        naïve, ‘do-gooders’, within the prison system, and they may be viewed with considerable
        suspicion by criminal justice staff who fear that they will be used instead of paid labour
          (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0264550512458475">Neuberger, 2009</xref>), or will take
        away the more creative aspects of their work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0264550512458475">Bryans et al., 2002</xref>). Prison staff may also perceive
        TSO personnel to be ‘on the side of the prisoners’ and this can make it appear that they are
        opposed to the work of the prison, contributing to animosity between the two groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0264550512458475">Hucklesby and Worrall, 2007</xref>).
        Alternatively they may not be taken seriously, the effects and importance of their work
        doubted, or viewed as a free economic resource (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0264550512458475">Neuberger, 2009</xref>).</p>
      <p>The traditional prison officer culture can shape relationships with other groups, including
        civilian specialists, managers and prisoners, and includes notions of ‘them and us’ in
        relation to ‘outsiders’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0264550512458475">Crawley and
          Crawley, 2008</xref>) and a negative attitude towards prisoners, but such cultures can
        vary substantially between prisons. In an evaluation of the Safer Locals programme, Liebling
        (2008) found that in prisons where large proportion of staff strongly adhered to the
        traditional prison officer culture, showing care for prisoners was culturally unacceptable
        and integration of civilian services could be a significant battle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0264550512458475">Liebling et al., 2005</xref>). This could lead to hostility
        and affect prisoner access to specialists if officers did not perform basic procedures such
        as unlocking prisoners for group work. In prisons with a positive staff culture, officers
        worked more cooperatively with specialists, viewing them as a source of support rather than
        a threat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0264550512458475">Liebling, 2008</xref>).
        Liebling et al. therefore caution that the ‘consequences of traditional staff culture and
        the limitations it places on the effectiveness of specialist expertise must be taken
        seriously’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0264550512458475">Liebling et al.,
        2005</xref>: 177).</p>
      <p>A recent study of key stakeholders in criminal justice and TSOs also acknowledged how
        negative cultural attitudes could potentially affect offenders’ access to third sector
        services which are still largely dependant on referrals from prison staff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0264550512458475">Mills et al., 2011</xref>). However, it was
        suggested that unlike probation where levels of co-operation between staff and TSOs were
        seen as being at an all time low due to the threat posed by increased competition, a
        cultural shift had taken place within prisons where the third sector was more much accepted.
        TSOs working in prison were said to be no longer perceived to be a threat, either to the
        more creative aspects of the prison officer job or to the prison service’s main aim of
        managing risk to public safety.</p>

      <title>Methods</title>
      <p>In order to assess the validity of the suggestion that TSOs are now more accepted in
        prisons and further examine working relationships between criminal justice and third sector
        staff and the position of third sector staff in prisons more generally, qualitative
        interviews were conducted with third sector and criminal justice staff in eight prisons,<sup>
          <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0264550512458475">2</xref>
        </sup> as part of a wider study to examine the role of the third sector in criminal justice.
        The prisons were selected to ensure that the sample covered different prison populations
        (e.g. male/female, young offenders/adults/juveniles), different geographical locations, and
        different functions (e.g. local, open, training). Two of the prisons were run by private

      <p>In total, 74 members of prison staff and 78 TSO representatives were interviewed. The study
        adopted a purposive sampling method whereby interviewees were approached to ensure that a
        range of staff who work with TSOs were included in the sample, for example, resettlement
        officers, safety custody officers, diversity officers, offender managers/supervisors and
        landing officers. TSOs were selected for interview to ensure that a broad mix of
        organizations was covered, including smaller, local volunteer-led organizations, and larger,
        national/regional organizations which employed predominantly paid staff. The interviews
        lasted between 20 minutes and an hour and were carried out in person or over the telephone.
        A semi-structured interview schedule was used to ensure that key themes were covered in all
        interviews, enabling a degree of comparability between responses, but also to allow
        respondents the latitude to bring up matters of concern and importance to them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0264550512458475">May, 2001</xref>). A small number of third
        sector interviewees worked in more than one of the research prisons, and where this was the
        case, they were asked about both establishments. Most interviews were audio-recorded and
        then transcribed verbatim. Where this was not possible, notes of the interview were written
        up immediately. Transcripts and interview notes were then analysed using framework analysis
          (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0264550512458475">Ritchie and Spencer, 1994</xref>), a

        <title>Good relations</title>
        <p>Despite the potential for tension between TSOs and prison staff, the vast majority of
          both parties in almost all prisons felt that relations between them were good, and
          professional rivalries were rare:<disp-quote>
            <p>It’s certainly changed with time. I think if you went back 20 years when I started
              the job a lot of voluntary organizations were viewed with an awful lot of suspicion by
              prison staff… it’s unrecognizable from what it was. (Staff, Prison C)</p>
          </disp-quote>
          <disp-quote>
            <p>I feel really fairly well supported here. The Prison Officers are very helpful, we’ve
              got a very good relationship with them and with everybody really. (TSO, Prison X)</p>
          </disp-quote>
        </p>
        <p>Such good relations were largely explained by the expertise, knowledge and fresh
          perspectives that TSOs could bring to their work with prisoners and the recognition that
          they could take considerable pressure off prison staff:<disp-quote>
            <p>It’s their expertise, they have a breath of knowledge like, for example, SOVA who do
              a lot of job searching for women… we don’t have this sort of knowledge or resources to
              deal with these issues and they are invaluable. (Staff, Prison B)</p>
          </disp-quote>
          <disp-quote>
            <p>It’s good because it shows a lot of our lads as well that not everyone thinks that
              they’re all toe rags out there. (Staff, Prison E)</p>
          </disp-quote>
          <disp-quote>
            <p>The majority of staff see it [TSOs in prison] as a positive move. They understand the
              impact it has and the positives that come out of that… everyone can see that if a
              prisoner is dealing with someone that’s helping to keep them calm, then at the end of
              the day they’re much better to work with on the wings. (Staff, Prison C)</p>
          </disp-quote>
        </p>
        <p>Far from being seen as naïve, amateur ‘do-gooders’, TSOs, particularly those concerned
          with resettlement issues, were generally valued by prison staff as professionals who could
          give prisoners’ correct information about issues such as housing or debt when prison staff
          felt they could not due to their lack of expertise and time. For both parties, improved
          relations between criminal justice and third sector staff could be explained by the
          recognition that TSOs were necessary partners if prisons were to attempt to rehabilitate
          prisoners effectively rather than just contain them:<disp-quote>
            <p>What I like about working with prisons is that most prisons accept that they’re not
              really very good at it. They’re good at locking people up, they’re good at making sure
              they don’t escape, but they know they’re not very good at rehabilitation… Lots of them
              [officers] call us care bears and all the rest of it, but they know they can’t do it,
              they really know that. (TSO, Prisons A and D)</p>
          </disp-quote>
          <disp-quote>
            <p>I think that the penny dropped actually quite a long time ago that partnerships were
              important, were vital… It’s gone way up the agenda the realization that so much now
              has got to be done in partnership with outside agencies that they have got to be given
              time and consideration (Staff, Prison C).</p>

        <title>Security and managing risk</title>
        <p>However, concerns about the presence of TSOs in prison remained among a significant
          minority of prison staff. These were largely related to the idea that TSO workers might
          interfere with what they still saw as the main task of the prison – to keep people
          contained. Staff mentioned several incidents where third sector personnel, notably
          volunteers, were concerned to help prisoners and build up relationships with them, but did
          not exercise appropriate caution or respect the appropriate boundaries in these
          relationships, potentially endangering the security of the establishment.<disp-quote>
            <p>You tend to get some [volunteers] who don’t see why certain rules exist.[ …] I
              fortunately caught a letter being taken out by a volunteer. I said, ‘Where are you
              going with that, you’ve been told you can’t do…?’ ‘But he only wants me to post it.’ I
              said, ‘You don’t know what’s in that letter, we don’t do that’. (Staff, Prison Y)</p>
          </disp-quote>
          <disp-quote>
            <p>They don’t understand how prison works. [name of TSO] workers used to take girls’
              [sic] clothes home for washing and bring them back and then they were told that
              there’s really no possibility of doing that. Sometimes organizations need to be
              reminded that these girls [sic] are in here for a reason and they should not get too
              friendly or intimate with them. (Staff, Prison X)</p>
          </disp-quote>
        </p>
        <p>In some cases, the methods used by volunteers to provide services were simply unsuitable
          in the prison environment:<disp-quote>
            <p>We had a Buddhist gentleman and he was bringing in all sorts of goodies. They were
              all related to Buddhism, there were blank CDs for them to put chanting on and incense,
              but he didn’t understand the implication of bringing a recordable item into a prison.
              (Staff, Prison C)</p>
          </disp-quote>
        </p>
        <p>Prison staff also raised concerns about information sharing by TSOs, the lack of which
          could leave them uncertain as to whether they were managing risk appropriately. In her
          review of volunteering in the criminal justice system, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0264550512458475">Neuberger (2009)</xref> suggested that tensions are likely
          to emerge in risk-averse settings where professional staff are under statutory
          obligations, in this case to maintain the security of the prison and manage risk, and
          volunteers do not have such obligations under any legal contract. In order to function
          well in the prisons, staff suggested that TSOs needed to consider security, risk and the
          appropriate boundaries in their relationships with offenders and they acknowledged that
          TSOs may need guidance and support to ensure they fully understand the implications of
          working in prison. Several members of prison staff noted that prisons were becoming much
          more adept at hosting third sector personnel and producing appropriate training and
          induction for them. Since the research was carried out, guidance has been issued to TSOs
          working with NOMS to encourage rigorous risk management procedures and reduce the risk of
          serious harm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0264550512458475">NOMS, 2010</xref>).
          Where organizations had substantial experience of working in prisons and demonstrated a
          sound understanding of the context, they were viewed as more professional and more
          respected.</p>

        <title>‘Institutional inconvenience’</title>
        <p>From the perspective of TSOs, the main critical issue affecting relations with prison
          staff and their work in prisons was ‘institutional inconvenience’; times when they were
          prevented from accessing offenders due to a lack of individual staff time or willingness,
          security concerns or regime factors:<disp-quote>
            <p>Until recently we used to see them [prisoners] between eight and nine in the morning.
              We got down at eight o’clock in the morning and they were like ‘No, you can’t have
              them. Your slot was half past seven till eight’, so it’s like ‘Urr’. You’re quite
              aware that you’re in a host environment and you’ve got to fit around them. (TSO,
              Prison Z)</p>
          </disp-quote>
          <disp-quote>
            <p>They [TSOs] sometimes may be the last ones to find out if a person’s been released,
              sometimes they might show up at the gate and someone will say ‘Well, they’ve actually
              been released’. Not so much now as it was but it still happens. (Staff, Prison B)</p>
          </disp-quote>
        </p>
        <p>TSO respondents also noted their frustration at the length of time taken to get security
          clearance and at travelling considerable distances to be turned away at the gate due to an
          unexplained security incident. Prison staff admitted that TSOs could be seen as a
          nuisance, particularly by those working on the wings as they could add to their workload:<disp-quote>
            <p>I think operational staff find them a pain in the arse ‘cos they go onto wings to
              take them off the wings or out of education to work with them. (Staff, Prison Z)</p>
          </disp-quote>
          <disp-quote>
            <p>They are seen both as a great support and as a nuisance – a nuisance partly because
              the women have to be escorted to actually see these people and in some cases a staff
              member actually has to be around or in close proximity. (Staff, Prison X)</p>
          </disp-quote>
        </p>
        <p>The lack of such communication and the reliance on officers to gain access to prisoners
          served to remind TSOs that they were guests in a host environment, dependent on the
          cooperation of prison staff to fulfil their service remit, and several TSO representatives
          spoke of the methods they used to charm and cajole prison officers in order to get the
          maximum co-operation from them. Despite the frustration and inconvenience this sometimes
          caused, both groups of respondents acknowledged the importance of TSOs remaining guests in
          prison and not having cell keys as to do so would compromise their independence,
          potentially leading them to be seen as part of the prison and co-opted into prison work:<disp-quote>
            <p>At the same time, I quite like us not having keys because I think if we had keys then
              as we were walking down the wing, people would be ‘ah, can you open my door for me?’.
              And I’d quite like to stay out of that. (TSO, Prison Z)</p>
          </disp-quote>
        </p>
        <p>To ensure TSOs still felt valued in the prison, both prison staff and TSO representatives
          noted the importance of communication to explain why it was sometimes not possible to
          access prisoners or notify TSOs of changes to the regime which could affect their work. It
          was also argued by a small number of prison staff that many basic grade prison officers
          working on the wing would not know about TSOs and their services. This lack of knowledge
          may go some way towards explaining the low levels of awareness of TSOs amongst prisoners.
          A prisoner survey carried out in all the research prisons found that although on average
          the prisons claimed to engage with approximately 20 TSOs, prisoners were aware of an
          average of only four, and engaged with no more than one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0264550512458475">Gojkovic et al., 2011b</xref>). If staff with whom
          prisoners spend the most time are unaware of TSO services, they will be unable to bring
          them to the attention of potential service users.</p>

        <title>Lingering cynicism</title>
        <p>A small number of both prison and TSO respondents reported that a minority of officers,
          often older and more experienced, remained cynical about the involvement of TSOs as they
          struggled with the idea that prisons could be places of rehabilitation rather than purely
          of punishment:<disp-quote>
            <p>Some [TSOs] are perceived inevitably as do-gooders, and I have to say it’s the older
              members of staff, more stuck in their ways [who] don’t appreciate the work that these
              people do in helping the prisoners because some think the prisoners are beyond help.
              (Staff, Prison D)</p>
          </disp-quote>
          <disp-quote>
            <p>Some and especially more of the old school prison officers are not used to this and
              it is a change… they look at us being softy, softy, fluffy people and some of them
              still believe in the hard regime of prison and that is not how it is anymore… (TSO,
              Prisons B and Z)</p>
          </disp-quote>
        </p>
        <p>This hostility was particularly noticeable when prisoners were working for TSOs as either
          volunteers or paid workers as it was felt this could entail some kind of privilege or
          represent a security risk that officers had little control over:<disp-quote>
            <p>We use peer advisers, who can use the telephone […] initially, there was quite a few
              of the more established prison staff, the older type prison officer who was used to
              dealing with closed conditions, they were very suspicious of what was going on and
              they were looking for any simple breach of prison discipline. (Staff, Prison Y)</p>
          </disp-quote>
        </p>
        <p>In general, there was agreement that negative attitudes to TSOs as a whole were fairly
          minimal and were in the process of changing as prison officers’ jobs became more
          specialized. This was particularly noticeable in Prison Z, where the highest number of
          comments about working relationships between staff and TSOs originated, and where prison
          officers have historically displayed strong adherence to the values of traditional prison
          officer culture with low integration between prison staff and outside specialists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0264550512458475">Liebling et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0264550512458475">Liebling, 2008</xref>). Many interviewees
          in this prison noted positive changes to the prison culture over the last few years, which
          were largely ascribed to strong senior management, and TSOs working there frequently
          commented on how welcome and appreciated they felt. The prison had a part-time Voluntary
          Sector Co-ordinator who worked both in the resettlement department with a variety of TSOs,
          but also as a regular officer on the landings. Although having a dual role such as this
          could potentially lead to role conflict, it allowed her to support TSOs and to publicize
          the benefits of their work to those who may otherwise have remained unaware of them.</p>
        <p>If the integration of specialist workers, including TSOs, is likely to be harder in
          establishments with a strong adherence to the traditional prison officer culture, better
          relations might be expected in private sector prisons where officers are generally less
          likely to adhere to such beliefs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0264550512458475">Liebling et al., 2005</xref>). Several TSOs in the study worked in both a privately run
          establishment and a public sector prison in the sample, and made striking comparisons
          about the way they were treated by both institutions. In the private sector prison they
          felt respected and supported by all levels of staff, but a constant battle with hostile,
          obstructive officers and uncooperative senior management in the public sector prison was
          thought to seriously compromise access to prisoners and the level of service they could
          provide. Firm conclusions clearly cannot be drawn from such a limited sample, particularly
          as relationships in the public sector prison seemed exceptionally bad, but relations
          between TSOs and private and public institutions are worthy of further consideration when
          contemplating the place of the third sector in the growing mixed economy of criminal
          justice.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Current policy places considerable emphasis on TSOs working in partnership with prisons and
        other criminal justice providers to reduce re-offending and to improve standards and drive
        up efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0264550512458475">MoJ/NOMS, 2008b</xref>,
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0264550512458475">MoJ, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0264550512458475">MoJ, 2011</xref>). However, the context in
        which partnership working takes place, and the relationships which may determine its
        effectiveness, have undergone little critical examination in the criminal justice or third
        sector literature. Previous research, such as that on social work in prisons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0264550512458475">Jepson and Elliott, 1986</xref>), and on
        prison suicide prevention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0264550512458475">Liebling et
          al., 2005</xref>), has suggested that prison officers have traditionally felt threatened
        by, and been hostile towards, outsiders who are concerned with the welfare of prisoners.
        This is partly due to a lack of willingness to embrace ideas of rehabilitation but may also
        stem from professional rivalries and the idea that prison officers are the best people to
        help prisoners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0264550512458475">Prison Officers’
          Association, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0264550512458475">Moses,
          2011</xref>). An influx of ‘outsiders’ – including TSOs – can make it harder for officers
        to feel competent in their jobs and valued by management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0264550512458475">Liebling et al., 2005</xref>). In the current research, such
        professional rivalries and hostilities were largely absent and, on the whole, TSOs working
        in prisons were respected. Despite some opposition from a minority of prison staff, who were
        thought to adhere more to the belief that prisons are for punishment rather than any form of
        rehabilitation, the research findings appear to confirm the suggestion that there has been a
        cultural shift in prisons. TSOs were no longer seen as a threat by frontline staff but were
        appreciated for the time and expertise they could offer offenders and the alleviation of
        pressure on staff. It should be noted, however, that the research sample consisted of
        members of prison staff who had regular contact with TSOs, including those with specialist
        roles within the prison, and they may be more likely to hold more positive views of TSOs
        than those who have less contact with them.</p>
      <p>Changing staff attitudes may be linked to the increasing professionalization of TSO staff
        working in prisons. Defined at its simplest, professionalization occurs when a service or an
        activity ceases to be delivered by volunteers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0264550512458475">Geoghegan and Powell, 2006</xref>). In response to the
        expansion of contract funding, TSOs more generally are increasingly employing paid
        professional staff rather than volunteers, and are engaging more in formal, bureaucratic and
        managerialist practices that would traditionally be associated with the business sector,
        often as a requirement of obtaining large amounts of funding from the state and charitable
        foundations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0264550512458475">Hwang and Powell,
          2009</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0264550512458475">Geoghegan and
          Powell, 2006</xref>). Third sector organizations working with offenders tend to be
        remarkably polarized, with the majority of organizations having an annual income of either
        under £10,000 or over £100,000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0264550512458475">Gojkovic
          et al., 2011a</xref>). Larger organizations are more likely to employ paid staff and to be
        considerably more skilled at publicizing the value of their work than smaller, volunteer-led
        TSOs. Alerting staff to the benefits of the work of TSOs is seen as the most effective way
        of gaining their support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0264550512458475">Edgar et al.,
          2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0264550512458475">HM Prison Service,
          2002</xref>), and it was noticeable that when concerns around security and risk were
        raised by prison staff in the study, it was largely in relation to volunteers rather than
        paid TSO staff. Smaller, volunteer-led organizations appeared to be a greater risk of being
        viewed as naïve in the prison environment. However, they are also more likely to bring the
        so-called ‘added value’ to their work with offenders, particularly the building of social
        cohesion through their connections to the local community.</p>
      <p>Whether paid or voluntary, challenges remain for all TSO representatives working in prisons
        and they can still face considerable difficulties getting access to prisoners due to
        ‘institutional inconvenience’, which may be driven by both operational concerns and staff
        attitudes. The nature of working in prisons requires TSOs to continually consider themselves
        guests in a host environment, with requisite expected standards of behaviour. This calls
        into question the equity of any partnership between TSOs and prison providers who have
        considerable control over the environment in which TSOs operate. Co-ordination, management
        and support of TSOs within prisons are highly variable and are likely to depend not only on
        relations between TSOs and criminal justice professionals but also on the agenda of prison
        governors/directors. The challenge for prison providers is to be good hosts and to ensure
        appropriate training and induction procedures for TSOs and better communication so TSOs are
        aware of the operational reasons behind the ‘institutional inconveniences’ and feel that
        both they and their work are valued. Clearly TSOs may also have a vested interest in
        remaining guests. If TSOs start to identify too strongly with the criminal justice system,
        they run the risk of losing their distinctiveness, including their perceived independence
        and trustworthiness, and this may lead to ‘goal distortion’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0264550512458475">Kendall and Knapp, 1996</xref>) where the initial charitable
        goals of the organization are compromised by the need to fit into the goals of the criminal
        justice system.</p>
      <p>The opening up of the criminal justice market represents a potential opportunity to
        considerably increase the involvement of TSOs in criminal justice, but may introduce
        ‘competition at the expense of partnership’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0264550512458475">Fletcher, 2006</xref>: 73), even when that partnership is an
        unequal one. Such dangers were already evident for TSOs working in one of the private
        prisons in the study, where suspicions were voiced that the prison could do a better job for
        less money. Contracts with housing and debt advice TSOs were not renewed, as the prison
        instead employed the housing adviser directly and appointed a prison officer with previous
        experience on personal finance to the debt advisor position. In this instance, the TSOs
        originally offering these services were viewed as just another provider who could be
        excluded from the prison in the interests of improve efficiency and cutting costs.</p>
      <p>Relationships between the public prison service and the third sector may also become
        characterized by less harmonious professional relations as it becomes more focused on
        increasing its own ability to secure a market share of the penal estate. The recent
        expulsion of probation staff by the governor of three prisons currently out to tender in
        South Yorkshire, after discovering the local probation trust had formed an alliance with a
        commercial competitor, demonstrates how such competition may damage relations between
        organizations, with a consequent effect on information sharing and service provision for
        offenders. Whilst HM Prison Service will be bidding for the nine prisons currently out to
        tender, in partnership with Mitie,<sup>
          <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0264550512458475">3</xref>
        </sup> Working Links, the Shaw Trust and other TSOs, the question remains as to the position
        of other organizations working in these prisons which do not join this bid and whether they
        will remain welcome during the competitive tendering processes. It also further demonstrates
        the control that prison providers may have over the organizations that work there and
        highlights the latent vulnerability of TSOs working in the total institution of a
        prison.</p>
