<abstract>
<p>The purpose of this article is to dynamically observe hemodynamic and medium-term pathomorphological changes and to investigate the pathophysiological variation at the vascular anastomotic stoma. Eighteen New Zealand white rabbits underwent right common carotid artery in situ anastomosis, and the hemodynamic changes of anastomotic stoma were recorded by color Doppler ultrasonography before surgery and 5 minutes, 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks, and 16 weeks after surgery. Pathological sections of stoma were made and the pathomorphological changes viewed. Artery anastomoses were preformed successfully in 15 rabbits; 4 rabbits suffered postoperative death. It took 1.22 ± 0.77 hours to complete every operation. All the data involved, mean velocity, peak systolic velocity, and resistant index, had no significant differences between preoperative and postoperative follow-up. The obvious differences were found in the diameters of stoma 5 minutes, 1 week, 2 weeks, and 3 weeks after operation (<italic>P</italic> values were .002, .001, .003, and .008, respectively). The variance of stoma diameters 2 weeks later was also different from those after 1 week, but no other differences were observed during other weeks. The decrease in stoma diameters after anastomosis was clear, with the maximum decrease occurring 2 weeks after the operation, after which the diameters of stoma became stable 16 weeks after the operation. Some collagens around anastomoses could be found by the pathological sections of stoma, which indicated that the deposition of collagen might be related to the decrease in stoma diameter.</p>

<p>It is known that the patency rates of artery bypass graft surgeries decline, which has a considerable effect on the long-term outcome for patients. However, the mechanism leading to postoperative restenosis is still unclear. A large number of experimental studies have suggested deposition of the extracellular matrix concerned mainly with collagen is closely associated with restenosis and that changes in collagen deposition, the main component of the extracellular matrix, is closely associated with restenosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534734612457029">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534734612457029">2</xref></sup> The purpose of this investigation was to further understand the role of collagen in this process by studying pathomorphological and hemodynamical changes in arterial anastomosis stoma in an animal model.</p>

<title>Experimental Animals</title>
<p>Eighteen New Zealand white rabbits (2.1-2.8 kg, age range from 1 to 1.5 years, 8 males and 10 females) were included in the study. This animals experiment was approved by the Animal Research Committee of Shanghai JiaoTong University School of Medicine.</p>

<title>Experimental Method</title>
<sec id="section4-1534734612457029">
<title>Anesthesia</title>
<p>Rabbits were anaesthetized with 3% pentobarbital sodium (20 mg/kg) by stepped injection dose of 5 mg every 10 minutes in auricular vein during the procedure. Two percent lidocaine was also administered for local anesthesia before skin incision.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1534734612457029">
<title>Surgical approach</title>
<p>The right carotid artery of about 5 cm was exposed by making a vertical incision in skin of the anterior neck just right of midline following hair removal and skin disinfection for rabbits. Vessels were transected after blood flow occlusion, then the broken end was washed with heparin saline (100 IU/mL). The end-to-end anastomosis was performed using continuous 8-0 atraumatic suture. Subsequently, the patency of the anastomosis was tested, 80 000 U penicillin was applied topically, and the wound was sutured.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section6-1534734612457029">
<title>Material and Detection</title>
<p>Hemodynamic changes of the right carotid artery were measured before surgery and 5 minutes, 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12weeks, and 16 weeks following the procedure using color Duplex ultrasonography (GE LOGIQBook XP, Wauwatosa. WI).Various parameters including peak systolic velocities (PSV), mean flow velocities (Vm), resistance indices (RI), and stoma diameters (D) were calculated from the frequency extracted values from the ultrasound data. Sixteen weeks after surgery, we serially sectioned the vascular tissue around the anastomotic stoma to lengths of 1 cm along the longitudinal axis. Pathological variations of vessel wall at stoma were observed under a light microscope following sections stained by hematoxylin–eosin (HE).</p>

<sec id="section7-1534734612457029">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 10.0 software. Data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (<inline-formula id="inline-formula1-1534734612457029">

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Currently, artery bypass graft surgery is considered a major therapeutic technique to manage thrombotic diseases, but up to 30% to 40% of the cases restenose, and this high proportion of restenosis seriously affects the long-term prognosis of patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534734612457029">3</xref></sup> Furthermore, since the mechanisms leading to restenosis after surgery are not yet understood, the targeted therapies are not as effective as possible.</p>
<p>Recent research has shown that the extracellular matrix (ECM) played a more important role than the vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) in the forming of restenosis after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA). And the accumulation of collagen, which is the major component of the ECM, might be one of the independent factors for restenosis and constrictive remodeling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534734612457029">4</xref></sup> Some studies found that collagen positive ratio increased from 17 ± 2% (2 days after PTA) to 32 ± 5% (30 days after PTA) before this was reversed. These studies suggested collagen increased first but declined later after vascular injury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534734612457029">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534734612457029">6</xref></sup> Some researchers studied changes in the collagen amount after carotid artery injury in 48 rats and discovered that intimal collagen expression began and gradually increased on the 7th day before becoming basically stable from the 28th day. Nevertheless, the media collagen has no significant difference in amount in the whole process. Adventitia collagen reached the peak on the 7th day and then decreased gradually. Analysis showed that densities of intima, media, adventitia collagen were significantly relevant to the loss rate of lumen area, densities of media, adventitia collagen and were closely associated with reduction of the external elastic membrane area, and densities of intima and adventitia collagen had a relationship with increase of intimal area. And thereby, the conclusion was obtained that the content of intima and adventitia collagen raised obviously in the process of restenosis, but media collagen almost did not change; thus, intima collagen led to intimal hyperplasia, and media and adventitia collagen caused vascular remodeling, all of which participated in restenosis after angioplasty.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534734612457029">7</xref></sup> As with the study by Yu et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534734612457029">8</xref></sup> pathological changes of vessel wall after artery anastomosis may have the same mechanism. They observed arterial anastomosis stoma in 50 rats and found the contents of elastic fiber and collagen fiber on the 3rd and 7th days after femoral artery anastomosis had no significant difference compared with the normal control group, but increased remarkably on the 14th day and the 30th day after operation. Collagen fiber had a rising tendency over time. The ratios of the arterial collagen fiber to the elastic fiber on the 7th and 14th days after the operation were much higher than that on the 3rd and 30th days, which indicated that the ratio of the arterial collagen fiber to the elastic fiber increased gradually from the 7th to 14th day but dropped at the 30th day after operation. The study also revealed that the increase in collagen content and the decline of elastic fiber content decreased vessel wall compliance and caused the formation of a similar scar tissue, which resulted in vascular dilation decline. It was one of the reasons for restenosis. In our research, collagen deposition in varying degrees existed at the anastomotic sites. Based on Doppler data, the anastomotic diameter changed significantly 1 to 3 weeks after surgery, and it seriously declined 2 weeks later. It may have a similar mechanism as previous studies mentioned collagen synthesis and the “stenosis-peak” regularity of anastomotic internal diameter. Simultaneously, the blood vessel diameter did not recover to the normal level after restenosis, which may contribute to restenosis after artery bypass grafting and scar similar tissue that developed from collagen may result in anastomotic stenosis. These findings need to be confirmed in further studies.</p>
<p>Currently, studies on vascular anastomosis and restenosis are focused on the pathological changes in the anastomotic vessel wall<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534734612457029">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534734612457029">10</xref></sup> rather than on the dynamic changes of vessel diameter and its pathomorphological and hemodynamical changes and their relationship. Color Doppler ultrasound can accurately detect and measure the changes in blood flow, determine changes in blood vessel diameter, and map hemodynamic parameters. Compared with angiography, it is noninvasive, atraumatic, less expensive while offering an accurate understanding of hemodynamic changes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534734612457029">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>This study was based on the dynamic observation and analysis of the Doppler ultrasound data, which showed that the anastomotic diameter significantly changed at 5 minutes, 1 week and 2 weeks after vascular anastomosis and tended to be stable after 2 weeks, characteristic of dynamic changes similar to the aforementioned studies. Comparison of adjacent observation points showed that diameter changed most obviously at the second week after anastomosis but with no significant difference between other successive time points. Combined with previous studies, the second week may be the peak period of pathological changes of the vascular wall, so experimental animals were sacrificed at the 16th week and anastomotic pathology slices were collected to confirm that a large amount of collagen deposition was present at local anastomotic stoma; therefore, this finding was similar to the above-mentioned study about collagen, and it suggested that collagen may play an important role in anastomotic restenosis. In our research, changes in vascular anastamosis are similar to other studies, but the points of time has slight difference caused probably by animal species differences, no systemic heparinization, and the continuous suture method.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534734612457029">12</xref></sup> In addition, diameter of the anastomosis changed obviously 5 minutes after the operation, which may be related to anastomosis technique and the continuous suture method, but it remains to be confirmed by further studies.</p>
<p>Previous animal studies showed that the blood flow disturbance and flow rate immediately increasing after arterial anastomosis, causing relative stenosis of the anastomotic lumen and even early thrombosis. The reasons include endothelial cell necrobiosis in anastomotic, vascular membrane rupture and intimal hyperplasia; it also can be caused by postoperative vasospasm and inappropriate suture technique.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1534734612457029">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534734612457029">14</xref></sup> While some argue that the vascular complex accompanying nerve locally, which has been separated and excised during surgery, and increase of postoperative peripheral resistance also participated in the process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1534734612457029">15</xref></sup> All these factors can lead the anastomotic stoma to form local turbulence, result in vessel wall damage, and increase the risk of thrombosis. Furthermore, it will increase arterial blood flow resistance and affect the blood supply to distance parts. In this study, 3 cases of arterial anastomoses failed and 4 cases suffered early death in animal models, which were considered to be the influence of the above-mentioned factors, but it needs to be further confirmed in the subsequent experiments.</p>
