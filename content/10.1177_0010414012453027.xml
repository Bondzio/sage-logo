<abstract>
<p>This study investigates the factors that affect variations in secular attitudes toward politics. The literature suggests that modernization may weaken traditional bonds with religious adherence and the state can assume an important role in this endeavor through mass education, industrialization, and other factors. However, this explanation is incomplete in light of the resurgence of religious movements. This study argues that economic inequality increases the positive evaluation of the role of religion in politics through its effect on religiosity and participation in religious organizations. Employing a multilevel analysis on 40 countries, this study demonstrates that inequality decreases attitudes toward support for two dimensions of public secularization: <italic>the secularization of public office holders</italic> and <italic>the influence of religious leaders in politics</italic>. Simultaneously, the effect of modernization on these attitudes varies. The results also suggest that although inequality diminishes secular attitudes of all socioeconomic groups, its effect is nonlinear, with a greater effect on the poor.</p>

<p>Why is it that secular attitudes toward politics greatly vary across societies? Are secular attitudes peculiar to some societies or but not to all? These questions have evoked a significant interest in the scholarly community regarding the relationship between religion and politics, democracy and secularism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0010414012453027">Esposito &amp; Voll, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0010414012453027">Jamal, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0010414012453027">Kalyvas, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0010414012453027">Stepan, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0010414012453027">Tessler, 2002</xref>). Religion has often been pointed out as a major factor in explaining the durability of authoritarianism in the Middle East and the consolidation of democracy in Europe, Latin America, and Southeast Asia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0010414012453027">Gill, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0010414012453027">Gunther, Sani, &amp; Shabad, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0010414012453027">Huntington, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0010414012453027">Kalyvas, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0010414012453027">1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0010414012453027">Mainwaring &amp; Scully, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0010414012453027">Slater, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0010414012453027">Warner, 2000</xref>), and studies often pointed out the impact of religious beliefs on electoral campaigns in the United States, Mexico, Columbia, and Peru (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0010414012453027">Gill &amp; Keshavarzian, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0010414012453027">McDermott, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0010414012453027">Patterson, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite this growing interest on the relationship between religion and politics, less attention has been paid to the determinants of why, in some countries, individuals assigned more importance to religion in politics, but not in other countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0010414012453027">Gill &amp; Lundsgaarde, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0010414012453027">Jamal &amp; Tessler, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0010414012453027">Norris &amp; Inglehart, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0010414012453027">Stepan, 2001</xref>). Unlike other studies that have sought the determinants of private secularization, which really considers individual religious belief and practices, this study focuses on public secularization, which concerns individual perception of what role religion should play in politics.</p>
<p>This study argues that high economic inequality creates a socioeconomic and political context in which people are more likely to support the role of religion in politics. First, as unfairness increases in the distribution of domestic resources, individuals are more likely to hold religious beliefs and attend in religious activities. Second, in countries with high inequality, religious organizations play increasingly diverse roles in people’s lives, providing not only spiritual but also social assistance for those in need. To capitalize on this opportunity created by high economic inequality, religious organizations, however, have the necessary institutional capacity, which may be undermined by variety of factors, such as long years of repression of religious institutions and the presence of alternative societal organizations. As people find spiritual and materialistic refuge in religious organizations, they become more and more exposed to religious teachings that touch political realm. As a result, more people give greater salience to religious values and norms in politics and, in particular, to religious credentials of the political candidates as citizens perceive political institutions as ineffective. Therefore, citizens of countries with high inequality hold less secular attitudes toward political authority.</p>
<p>Our empirical results confirm the hypothesis regarding economic inequality: Economic inequality has a statistically significant negative effect on secular attitude. We also find that inequality diminishes secular attitudes of all income groups, but the effect of inequality is more dramatic among those of lower income. In contrast, alternative hypotheses, derived from secularization and religious market theories, find only mixed support from the empirical results.</p>
<p>This study’s contribution to the literature is manifold: First, this study introduces an important but overlooked dimension of secularization, public secularization, that is, the declining role of religion in politics. Second, the findings indicate the importance of economic inequality in affecting secular attitudes toward politics. This finding may help explain the weakness of secular political opposition in some countries, such as those in the Middle East, and the increasing role of religious discourse in politics in democratic polities. In this respect, the findings address broader political questions: the role of religion in democracies and democratization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0010414012453027">Diamond, Plattner, &amp; Costopoulos, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0010414012453027">Ertman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0010414012453027">Manow &amp; van Kersbergen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0010414012453027">Stepan, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0010414012453027">Stepan &amp; Robertson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0010414012453027">Wald, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0010414012453027">Wald, Owen, &amp; Hill, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0010414012453027">Wuthnow, 1999</xref>). Finally, this study revises and differs from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0010414012453027">Norris and Inglehart’s (2004)</xref> finding. First, Norris and Inglehart focus on poverty on private secularization, overlooking how economic redistribution affects public secularization. We argue that economic development brings individual public secularity, their key variable, only if it does not increase economic inequality. The following section develops our argument in detail and then discusses competing theories: secularization and religious market theories. The discussion leads to derivation of alternative hypotheses and testing them. The fourth wave of the World Values Surveys (WVS) conducted between 1999 and 2004 in 40 countries in a multilevel analysis provides the only data set to test our theory in a cross-national analysis. The research design section discusses our variables that come from various sources. Subsequently, we present the results of the multivariate statistical analysis.</p>
<sec id="section1-0010414012453027">
<title>Secularism and Its Determinants</title>
<p>The bulk of secularism studies focus on two empirical dimensions of secularism, individual religious practice, and individual belief in religious doctrines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0010414012453027">Halman &amp; Draulans, 2006</xref>). This article aims to direct scholarly attention to a related but often overlooked dimension of secularism: public secularization. In line with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0010414012453027">Chaves (1994)</xref>, public secularization refers to the process by which religion and religious organizations become less and less important in political decision-making processes. This occurs primarily as people assign less and less importance to religious ideas and religious figures in politics.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0010414012453027">
<title>Inequality and Secular Attitude</title>
<p>This study argues that economic inequality creates socioeconomic and political environments in which public secularization declines. First, economic inequality creates a socioeconomic context in which people become more religious, privately, and/or turn to religious organizations as spiritual centers. In countries with high inequality, the have-nots feel powerless and pessimistic about their futures and find in religion a refuge. This bolsters the belief that they do not share the same destiny as their fellow countrymen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0010414012453027">Uslaner, 2002</xref>). As a result, the poorer tend to trust in their close circles or informal networks, whereas they develop less trust in political institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0010414012453027">Anderson &amp; Singer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0010414012453027">Howard, 2003</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0010414012453027">1</xref></sup> Hence, those politically isolated will be more withdrawn into more informal networks, religious organizations being one of the most likely sanctuaries. Therefore, the likely consequence is high religiosity and attendance at religious services in economically highly unequal countries.</p>
<p>Second, religious organizations serve as redistribution centers in economically unequal societies where private redistribution mechanisms become more vital. Religious organizations, through donations from wealthy individuals and the state, mobilize their own resources to help the poor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0010414012453027">Quadagno &amp; Rohlinger, 2009</xref>). The rich may find in charitable activities not only spiritual satisfaction but also a bridge to the poor to alleviate potentially growing tensions in the society. With these resources, religious organizations are able to open urban hospitals, schools, and food centers, not only attracting the poor but also offering jobs to different professional groups, such as doctors, nurses, social workers, and teachers. Hence, growing bodies of individuals who access those services become more affiliated with religious organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0010414012453027">Quandt, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0010414012453027">Sullivan, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0010414012453027">Tal, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>As centers of spirituality and redistribution, religious organizations socialize their members and affect their involvement in political activities, including voting and protest participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0010414012453027">Djupe &amp; Grant, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0010414012453027">Jones-Correa &amp; Leal, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0010414012453027">Verba, Schlozman, &amp; Brady, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0010414012453027">Wuthnow, 1999</xref>). Religious organizations play a particularly important role in socializing the poor. Although nonreligious organizations recruit more people with better educations and higher incomes, religious organizations are more egalitarian (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0010414012453027">Verba et al., 1995</xref>). In this respect, religious organizations endow civic skills on a segment of society, which otherwise would be lacking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0010414012453027">Verba et al., 1995</xref>, p. 18).</p>
<p>As a result of this political socialization, the members of religious organizations assign ever-growing importance to religion in politics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0010414012453027">Layman, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0010414012453027">Wald, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0010414012453027">Wald, Owen, &amp; Hill, 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0010414012453027">1990</xref>). As recent studies have shown, those involved in religious organizations and exposed to religious doctrines are more likely to participate in political activities, including voting, compared to those from the same denomination who are not involved in the religious organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0010414012453027">Campbell, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0010414012453027">Jamal, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0010414012453027">Jones-Correa &amp; Leal, 2001</xref>). The members of religious organizations will support more religiously oriented political views and are more likely to support the politicians who utilize religious “clues” and “codes” during electoral campaigns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0010414012453027">Calfano &amp; Djupe, 2009</xref>, p. 329; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0010414012453027">McVeigh &amp; Sikkink, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0010414012453027">Wald, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0010414012453027">Wald et al., 1988</xref>). As for the politicians, to maximize their vote acquisition, they respond to the expectations of voters, display religious convictions, attempt to influence religious voters by using religious discourse, and enter political alliances with religious groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0010414012453027">Quadagno &amp; Rohlinger, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In countries with higher inequality, religious organizations find more people willing to attend religious services and participate in their organizations. However, the expectation of any significant change in the participation of the rich in political activities and in their views regarding the role of religion in politics is likely to be small or insignificant. Individuals, particularly the poor, have a rising involvement in religion and religious organizations. As religious organizations provide the disadvantaged segment of society with the opportunity to enhance their social capital, individuals engage a new type of political socialization. In highly unequal countries, political socialization within the church affects more people. Therefore, individuals are more likely to develop religious discourses in politics and seek their policy preferences reflected in the political sphere.</p>
<p>Hence, we hypothesis the following:</p>

<sec id="section3-0010414012453027">
<title>Empirical Evidence</title>
<p>Is religiosity/religious attendance higher in countries with high inequality? Is participation in religious organizations more likely especially compared to nonreligious organizations? The first indication that our argument holds is to affirm these two questions positively. For the first question, we calculated religiosity out of the WVS. The measure of religiosity is both belief in common religious dogmas such as God, hell, heaven, and life after death and attendance in religious services.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0010414012453027">2</xref></sup> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0010414012453027">Figure 1a</xref> clearly displays a significant relationship between these two dimensions of religiosity and inequality and suggests that people become more religious and attend more religious services in highly unequal countries. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0010414012453027">Figure 1a</xref> also indicates some variation across countries. In particular, although average religious belief is high in Muslim countries with high inequality such as Bangladesh, Turkey, and Morocco,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0010414012453027">3</xref></sup> their levels of religious attendance slightly lag behind those of Catholic countries with high inequality such as Philippines and Peru.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0010414012453027">4</xref></sup></p>

<p>Does participation in religious organizations change as a result of inequality? Are trends similar for participation in nonreligious organizations? To see the trend in religious and nonreligious organizations, we utilize the WVS again and calculate country mean participation in religious and nonreligious organizations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0010414012453027">5</xref></sup> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0010414012453027">Figure 1a</xref> supports the argument that inequality increases participation in religious organizations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0010414012453027">6</xref></sup> On the other hand, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0010414012453027">Figure 1b</xref> confirms that, on average, participation in nonreligious organizations is inversely associated with high inequality, in contrast to participation in religious organizations. It suggests that citizens find more appeal in participation in religious civil society organizations along with religious worship places in countries with unequal distribution.</p>
<p>How do being more religious, attending religious activities, and participating in nonreligious organizations affect political socialization? In other words, is there a relationship between being religious and supporting the role of religion in politics? A number of studies have found that religious organizations increase the likelihood of political knowledge, efficacy, and participation in political activities for haves and have-nots alike (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0010414012453027">Rosenstone &amp; Hansen, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0010414012453027">Verba et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0010414012453027">Wuthnow, 1999</xref>). As joiners are more socialized into religious doctrines, they are more likely to seek candidates whose views do not conflict on highly salient issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0010414012453027">McVeigh &amp; Sikkink, 2001</xref>). In deciding for whom to vote, some voters pay attention to the religious affiliation and the religiosity of politicians as important clues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0010414012453027">McDermott, 2009</xref>). Such religious identification may extend even to religious differences becoming an important factor for shaping political culture and political coalitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0010414012453027">Layman, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0010414012453027">Layman &amp; Carmines, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0010414012453027">Wald, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>Historical evidence gives further support to the relationship between economic inequality and the role of religious organizations as welfare providers and involvement in politics. In the United States, for example, when the federal government began to withdraw from the provision of welfare services, it was churches that filled in the gap and began to provide their own services. This, in turn, helped churches expand their influence in politics and become more active. For example, churches were critical in the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980. Pursuing an active campaign, churches trained and sent their members to participate in local elections and primary elections to promote their own agendas. They even managed to obtain federal money, especially during the Bush era. As a result, they were able to provide more social services to the poor, which further increased their appeal among lower income groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0010414012453027">Quadagno &amp; Rohlinger, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The role of religious organizations as welfare providers and political actors is not limited to the United States. Historically, churches, especially the Catholic Church, have acted as welfare agencies for the poor, and through alliances with political parties, Catholic and Protestant churches have either delayed or advocated the development of welfare systems in European countries. These religious organizations continue to take an active part in local councils for relief efforts for the poor despite declining influence in social policy at the national level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0010414012453027">Kahl, 2009</xref>). Summarizing a number of case studies of South Asian religious revivalism, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0010414012453027">Pasha (2004)</xref> stated, “An overburdened state now unable to provide either welfare or development to large sectors of the population vacates important spaces now available to civil society. Islamists appear to be filling those spaces, dispensing welfare goods and services as well as salvation” (p. 149). In an effort to combat the rising influence of Protestant churches, the Catholic Church in Mexico developed rapprochement policies with indigenous groups by not only promoting their ethnic identities but also providing provisions for social welfare services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0010414012453027">Trejo, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Similar connections occur in other parts of the world. In Islamic countries, religious organizations, where they are allowed to participate, have incorporated less privileged segments of society into politics. For example, in post-1983 Turkey, the state relief funds for the poor remained limited in the society during economic transformation. As a result, religious organizations filled the gap by providing a variety of community services and recruited new followers and increased their strength and visibility in society and politics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0010414012453027">Gulalp, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0010414012453027">Onis, 1997</xref>). Similarly, Islamic organizations in Morocco have increased their popular support by providing social support services needed as the country experienced an economic crisis and unrest in the 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0010414012453027">Lust-Okar, 2004</xref>, p. 166).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0010414012453027">7</xref></sup> Similarly, in Egypt, the Muslim Brotherhood (MB), long believed to have disappeared, reemerged with new strength and public appeal. The MB (its candidates run as independents) gained significant votes and representation in recent elections, and experts tie its success to the MB’s organizational strengths in providing social and economic assistance to the poor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0010414012453027">Sullivan, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0010414012453027">Tal, 2005</xref>).</p>

<title>Modernization and Secular Attitude</title>
<p>A competing theory is classic secularization theory, which, owing to Max Weber and Emile Durkheim, associates secularism with modernization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0010414012453027">Berger, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0010414012453027">Dobbelaere, 1987</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0010414012453027">1999</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0010414012453027">8</xref></sup> Three forces of modernization bring more secularization. The first two, industrialization and urbanization, help to break the feudal and traditional bonds and replace them with new ones, weakening especially the role of religion in associating people with one another. The last and possibly most important one is the modern state expanding its activities into areas formerly in the hands of religious organizations, such as education, health, and social services, consequently stripping them of their nonreligious causes for existence.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0010414012453027">Norris and Inglehart (2004)</xref> recently revised secularization theory, arguing that forces of modernization secularize people as long as they create existential security, “that is, the feeling that survival is secure enough that it can be taken for granted” (p. 5). However, existential security cannot be guaranteed by economic development or growth alone; fairness of distribution of resources is more important in generating high levels of not only religiosity but also secular attitude toward politics. Hence, if economic inequality also persists in a country, as is the case in the United States, religiosity will persist, especially among the poor.</p>
<p>Previous secularization theorists and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0010414012453027">Norris and Inglehart (2004)</xref> have studied the effect of modernization on individual religiosity. It remains possible to derive all the same implications on religious authority: In a modern society, which guarantees existential security <italic>a la</italic> Norris and Inglehart, people assign no role to religion in the nonreligious aspects of their lives, especially with regard to politics. A subschool of modernization theory, the political development school of thought, is more explicit in the secular nature of the modern politics. As one of its prominent members, Samuel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0010414012453027">Huntington (1966</xref>, p. 378), argued, one of the pillars of political modernization is rationalization of authority, that is, “the replacement of a large number of traditional, religious, familial and ethnic political authorities by a single, secular, national political authority.”</p>
<p>Hence, from all modernization theorists, including the political development school, the following hypothesis arises:</p>
<list id="list2-0010414012453027" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 2</italic>: In countries with a high level of modernization, individuals are likely to develop higher degrees of secular attitudes toward politics.</p></list-item></list>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0010414012453027">
<title>Religious Market and Secular Attitude</title>
<p>The second major approach that proposes an alternative hypothesis is religious market theory.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0010414012453027">9</xref></sup> This theory attaches importance to individual preferences, rational calculations, and structural constraints and explains differences in state–religion relations across countries through these factors. Gill argued that these differences develop as a result of the political ruler’s preferences based on several factors. The rulers calculate opportunity cost based on political survival, aiming to minimize the cost of ruling and achieve economic growth.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0010414012453027">10</xref></sup> This results in policy differences across countries, in turn producing different levels of religiosity across societies.</p>
<p>Scholars of this school of thought have argued that religiosity in a given society at a given time is contingent, dependent on the working of supply and demand in the religious market (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0010414012453027">Finke, Guest, &amp; Stark, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0010414012453027">Finke &amp; Stark, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0010414012453027">Gill, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0010414012453027">Iannaccone, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0010414012453027">Stark &amp; Iannaccone, 1994</xref>). The demand for religious services is constant at a given time; however, people have pluralistic religious demands. The theory then considers the extent to which this pluralism in religious demand is satisfied in the religious market. For this, the supply side becomes crucial. Two basic assumptions drive the conclusion. First, no single denomination or sect or church can provide enough diversity in religious services in the religious market. Second, the religious demands that are not satisfied simply fade away. Hence, this conclusion follows: The level of religiosity in a society depends on the plurality of religious service providers in the religious market.</p>
<p>Religious market theory concerns, more specifically, secularization in religious belief and practice. In a pluralistic religious market, a variety of religious demands can be satisfied; hence, more people have faith, and more people practice religion. As to individual secular attitudes toward religious authority, the theory is less clear. One might claim that because religious demand is plural, if satisfied, some individuals will assign more importance to religion and religious institutions in politics. This is possible only when pluralism in religious service providers increases. Also plausible is that increasing religiosity makes a person more inclined to be sympathetic to the role of religion in politics.</p>
<p>For religious market theorists, the extent of state regulation and activity in the religious market is an important measure of religious market plurality. A good case can be made for this: In some countries, such as Protestant Northern European countries, state building also involved the state-making intrusions into purely religious services. In the most extreme cases, the state monopolized the religious market, nationalizing purely religious institutions such as churches and mosques, employing men of religion to staff them, training them in state schools of religious education, and so on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0010414012453027">Fox, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0010414012453027">Gill, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0010414012453027">Gill &amp; Lundsgaarde, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>As the state regulates and operates in the religious market more and more, different religious service providers are driven from the market. As a result, religious services provided in the market become more and more homogenous. As fewer and fewer diverse religious demands are satisfied, people develop more secular attitudes toward religion.</p>
<p>Thus, the following hypothesis arises:</p>
<list id="list3-0010414012453027" list-type="simple"><list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 3</italic>: The more plural the religious market in a country, the less secular individuals’ attitudes toward politics.</p></list-item></list>

<title>Sample</title>
<p>The current research includes all available countries that participated in the WVS (2000) and that have data on all independent and dependent variables at individual and national levels. Please note that an absence of questions regarding dependent variables necessitated excluding previous WVSs. This study also cannot include the latest wave of the WVS because of the absence of social spending and inequality for relevant survey years (post-2005).

<sec id="section8-0010414012453027">
<title>Dependent Variables</title>
<p>To measure secular attitude, this study adopts a different approach from other studies that analyze the determinants of secularization. Empirical tests of most approaches have so far focused on explaining secularization at two levels: religious belief and religious practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0010414012453027">Chaves, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0010414012453027">Gill &amp; Lundsgaarde, 2004</xref>). This research in interested in explaining why people are different in their attitudes toward the role of religion and religious institutions in politics. We turn to the WVS, as the most comprehensive data set for our research question, and find four statements from the 2000 survey that seek responses on the role of religion in politics.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0010414012453027">11</xref></sup> The respondents are asked for these questions whether they <italic>agree</italic> (1), <italic>strongly agree</italic> (2), <italic>neither agree nor disagree</italic> (3), <italic>disagree</italic> (4), or <italic>strongly disagree</italic> (5). The statements are as follows:</p>
<list id="list4-0010414012453027" list-type="order"><list-item><p>Politicians who do not believe in God are unfit for public office.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Religious leaders should not influence how people vote in elections.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>It would be better for [this country] if more people with strong religious beliefs held public office.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Religious leaders should not influence government decisions.</p></list-item></list>
<p>All four statements intend to measure whether the respondent infers contention between religion and politics. The statements seem to measure two distinct concepts: One is individual attitude toward religious people occupying public offices, and the other is individual attitude toward the influence of religious figures in political process.</p>
<p>We run factor analysis (see Table S2 in the supplementary appendix, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ekremkarakoc.com/data">www.ekremkarakoc.com/data</ext-link>) to test whether or not these questions constitute the same concept. The analysis confirms that these four questions measure two distinct concepts with regard to the relationship between religion and politics. The results show that people distinguish between a religious person holding public office and religion’s influence on political decisions via religious leaders’ influence on people’s voting choices. The factor analysis shows Statements 1 and 3 have high loadings (about .69), gauging individual attitude toward the presence of religious people in public office. We name the factor <italic>religiosity of public office holders</italic>. The high loadings (about .64) of Statements 2 and 4 suggest a second concept that focuses more on how individuals regard religious leaders’ influence on political decision making in general, which we name <italic>the influence of the religious leader in politics</italic>. Recording the original scales and both dependent variables resulted in a range from 2 to 10, 10 being less supportive of religiosity of public office holders and for the influence of religious leaders in politics.</p>
<p>Arguably, the dependent variables and individual religiosity and religious attendance may be proxies for each other, measuring the same underlying concept. However, an equally valid position is that the variables are interrelated but also measure distinct concepts: The two dependent variables measure how one assesses the role of religion in politics, whereas individual religiosity and attendance in religious services concerned more religiosity at the personal level, which may remain in the private sphere and may not affect political attitudes and behaviors of citizens. Modest correlations across the mean level of these variables across countries suggest they are indeed not proxies for one another. The study’s measure of religious belief has correlations of .19 with support for religious leaders in politics and .55 with support for religiosity of public office holders. Attendance at religious services correlates with support for the religiosity of public service holders (.70) and with support for religious leaders in politics (.36).</p>

<title>Independent Variables</title>
<sec id="section10-0010414012453027">
<title>Individual Level</title>
<p>A number of control variables in the analyses coincide with the literature’s perspective for impact on secular attitude. For example, we expect that higher education and income weaken an individual’s connection to religion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0010414012453027">Sherkat, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0010414012453027">Wuthnow, 1988</xref>). Thus, the analyses use responses to the WVS question of the respondent’s highest attained level of education (ranging from 1 = <italic>no schooling or elementary school dropout</italic> to 8 = <italic>higher education</italic>). For income, the response to the WVS question scales respondents’ relative incomes from 1 to 10 and allows the creation of income quintiles (1-5), similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0010414012453027">Solt (2008)</xref>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0010414012453027">12</xref></sup> Previous studies also note that gender and age are important indicators of secular attitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0010414012453027">Stark, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0010414012453027">Walter &amp; Davie, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>The literature also suggested that religious traditions affect the way people perceive religion and its effect on politics. For example, some researchers suggested that Muslims, and to a lesser extent the Orthodox, are less secular because no separation exists between religion and the state in these religious doctrines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0010414012453027">Huntington, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0010414012453027">Kedourie, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0010414012453027">Lewis, 1993</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0010414012453027">13</xref></sup> Others suggest that Protestants are less likely to hold secular opinions for they are more successful in creating civic skills and politically active congregations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0010414012453027">Lynch, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0010414012453027">Verba et al., 1995</xref>). Testing these theories, we use religion dummies and take Catholics as a reference category.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0010414012453027">
<title>Country Level</title>
<p>The main independent variables in this study are inequality, modernization, state-religion index, and public social spending. The inequality measure comes from two different data sets to check the robustness of the results. The LIS (Luxembourg Income Studies) is an ineffective data set for our sample since it does not include some countries, such as Ukraine, Latvia, and Lithuania.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0010414012453027">14</xref></sup> Instead, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0010414012453027">Solt (2008)</xref> and World Income Inequality Database (WIID2b) are the sources for analysis. We used Solt’s standardized Gini coefficient data set and, for checking robustness, WIID2b. For the latter, the chosen Gini coefficients are based on disposable income and all-population/area coverage and the household as the basic unit.</p>
<p>Following the footprints of modernization theory, we measure the level of modernization in a country by looking at three variables: gross domestic product per capita, urbanization level, and the percentage of completed primary schooling. However, since urbanization and level of primary schooling are highly correlated, the analyses exclude urbanization. However, replacing urbanizations with primary education does not change our results. The data come from the The World Development Indicators (WDI). Please note that we use national-level data for the year the survey was conducted for a given country.</p>
<p>To test religious market theory, the state-religion index of Jonathan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0010414012453027">Fox (2008)</xref> provides a more comprehensive index in terms of countries and years. Fox’s index measures the official relationship between the state and religion and provides an index for the degree of separation between the state and religion. For a robustness check, we also use two other major sources regarding a state-religion index, namely the index of the Association of Religion Data Archives (ARDA) index and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0010414012453027">Kuru (2009)</xref>.</p>
<p>Public social spending (% GDP) is a control variable since, arguably, welfare spending may cover the disadvantaged segments of society and reduce the appeal of religious organizations. Such spending may also increase trust in political institutions, thereby, perhaps, indirectly reducing participation in and the growth of religious organizations. As a result, expectedly, secular attitudes will be greater in countries with higher social spending (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0010414012453027">Gill &amp; Lundsgaarde, 2004</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0010414012453027">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>As for social spending (% GDP), public social expenditures data come from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Social Expenditure Database (SOCX), Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, National Statistics Yearbook of the World Bank, and Branko <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0010414012453027">Milanovic (1999)</xref>. Notably, data from different sources may vary slightly as these databases may exclude some social spending items. Public social expenditure data do not include spending on education because half of the data comes from the OECD data set, which does not include spending on education. Rather than using the World Bank or other sources, we decided to be consistent as much as possible for our index and excluded education spending from the social spending variable.</p>
<p>Last, the analysis uses two main control variables, postcommunism and religious fractionalization. Postcommunist countries were ruled by the same totalitarian ideology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0010414012453027">Linz &amp; Stepan, 1996</xref>), and a recent study found that the regime legacies affect citizen behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0010414012453027">Howard, 2003</xref>). Previous communist regimes’ antagonistic policies toward religion and socialization under such regimes may affect how citizens of these countries see religion in politics. Therefore, the expectation is that citizens of postcommunist countries hold more secular views. Finally, religious composition of a country may influence how people perceive the role of religion in national politics. Religious leaders may emerge as political leaders, reducing public secularization. Therefore, to control religious diversity of a country, we add religious fractionalization to our models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0010414012453027">Alesina, Devleeschauwer, Easterly, Kurlat, &amp; Wacziarg, 2003</xref>).</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>Multilevel regression (HLM) is the method for testing hypotheses. Using dummy variables in ordinary least squares to assess the impact of national-level contextual variables would result in the underestimation of the standard errors of the coefficients. This would cause Type I error (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0010414012453027">Steenbergen &amp; Jones, 2002</xref>). In addition, the use of OLS causes one to make individual inferences from aggregate data, which is a known ecological fallacy. Instead, using HLM allows simultaneous control of individual- and contextual-level variables in multilevel models. The advantage of this technique is that individual-level variation in each group has its explanation through an individual-level equation, and group-level variation’s explanation is via a group-level equation.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>We start with presenting the relationship between public secularization and inequality. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0010414012453027">Figure 2</xref> displays the relationship of individual attitudes toward religiosity of public office holders and for the influence of religious leaders in politics at the aggregate level and the main independent variable, inequality. Note that higher numbers mean greater public secularization and less support for the religiosity of public office holders and the influence of religious leaders in politics. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0010414012453027">Figure 2a</xref> shows that income inequality appears to positively associate with this dimension of public secularization. Countries with low income inequality such as Denmark, France, and the Netherlands have low support for religiosity of public office holders. Moving to high inequality countries, apparently, support for office holders’ religiosity reaches a high level in countries such as the Philippines. Some countries do not perfectly fit with expectations. For example, Russia, Argentina, Mexico, and Chile have high inequality; their mean supports for the religiosity of public office holders are low but are much higher than the average.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0010414012453027">Figure 2b</xref> displays the relationship between individual attitude toward religious figures in politics at the aggregate level and for the main independent variables. Once again, inequality reduces support for this second dimension of public secularization; people in higher inequality countries are more likely to support the influence of religious leaders in politics. Sweden, the Netherlands, and Finland seem to have different patterns at the aggregate level. Support for the influence of religious leaders in politics in these low-inequality countries is very high.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0010414012453027">16</xref></sup></p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0010414012453027">Table 1</xref> presents the regression results for both dimensions of secular attitude at the individual level. Since the coefficients for the individual variables remain almost the same over the rest of the models in this study, the coefficients are absent for the remainder of the models. In accordance with secularization theory, education and income have positive effects on secular attitudes on both dimensions. Compared to women, men are more likely to support secularization of public office holders and decrease in religious leaders’ role in politics. No religious affiliation also has a systematic effect: Individuals with no religion are more secular in attitude than Catholics on both dimensions. The other variables do not have systematic effects across both dimensions. Age has a statistically significant effect on one dimension only: Older people are more likely to support religiosity of public office holders.</p>

<p>Likewise, religions do not systematically affect their adherents’ secular attitudes. Compared to Catholics, Orthodox, Muslims, and Hindus do not differ in their (dis)approval of religiosity of public office holders, but Lutherans are less likely to support secularization of public office holders. Only people with no religious affiliation are more secular than Catholics. Although the lower secularity of Lutherans may seem puzzling, this is consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0010414012453027">Lynch (1998)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0010414012453027">Verba et al.’s (1995)</xref> observation that Lutherans are successful in creating politically active congregations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0010414012453027">17</xref></sup> However, they are no different from Catholics in their attitude toward religious leaders in politics. In their attitudes toward religious leaders in politics, compared to Catholics, Protestants and Hindus are statistically not different in terms of approval of the influence of religious leaders in politics. Although Muslims have higher support for the influence of religious figures in politics, the Orthodox are less likely to support such roles. Those who are in the “other category” show a lesser degree of approval for such influence.</p>
<p>The findings for both dimensions of secular attitudes are interesting in the sense that much of the literature emphasizes the high secularity of Lutherans and that Muslims hold different views on religion and politics. This study’s findings are mixed: Compared to Catholics, Lutherans are not less likely to support the influence of religious leaders in politics, but Muslims are more likely to favor their role in politics. These findings along with the result showing that Lutherans are less likely to support secularization of public office holders suggest that attitude toward religion in politics is dynamic and requires more scrutiny and better data to reach conclusive results. Our theory, however, signals one probable avenue of research, which may look at the impact of economic inequality. We believe that Muslims predominantly live in economically unequal countries; therefore, they are more likely to be involved with religious organizations than adherents of other religions. Orthodox Christians also predominantly live in economically unequal societies. But long years of state suppression of religious organizations deprived them of an active religious organization, hence they may not see religious organizations as a solution to their problems.</p>
<p>Turning to the question of how country-level independent variables affect individual secular attitudes on both dimensions, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0010414012453027">Table 2</xref> displays the relationships of country-level independent variables with individual attitudes toward religiosity of public office holders. Model 1 adds secularization variables (GDP per capita and level of primary education) to the two national-level control variables (postcommunism and religious heterogeneity). Both secularization variables are statistically significant: As GDP per capita increases, individuals are more likely to support secularization of public service holders. Similarly, individuals in countries with higher levels of primary education spending are more likely to approve the secularization of public service holders. In sum, both secularization variables are statistically significant and both positively affect individual secular attitude.</p>

<p>Model 2 includes Fox’s state-religion index, which shows that state control over religion has a weak effect on individual secular attitude toward religiosity of public office holders. To verify the robustness, we reran the models using the ARDA’s index and the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0010414012453027">Kuru (2009)</xref> index and found that the results are substantially and statistically similar. Model 3 shows that social spending has a strong positive effect on individual secular attitude. Holding other variables at their means, for a Catholic person a 5% increase in social spending (% of GDP) increases secular attitude by .25 units. Among secularization variables, only primary education still has a statistically significant positive impact. Model 4 introduces the main independent variable, inequality. The result confirms that inequality has a significant and negative effect on this dimension. The findings suggest that one unit increase in inequality reduces secular attitude by .058. In the full model, the social spending variable continues to be positive and to have a statistically significant effect on this secular attitude, coinciding with the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0010414012453027">Gill and Lundsgaarde (2004)</xref> for the effect of social spending on religious attendance. One of the secularization variables, GDP per capita, loses its statistical significance in this model, whereas the state-religion index continues to have an insignificant statistical relationship.</p>
<p>The results displayed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0010414012453027">Table 3</xref> give further support to this study’s theory. Inequality is statistically significant and positively related to individual attitude toward the influence of religious leaders in politics. The findings suggest that a one-unit increase in inequality reduces this dimension of secular attitude by .026. Throughout all models in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0010414012453027">Tables 3</xref>, the variables of secularization and religious market continue to be statistically insignificant. Religious heterogeneity has a more systematic affect on individual secular attitude in this dimension. As religious heterogeneity increases, individuals more likely approve of the involvement of religious figures in politics. This statistically significant finding indicates that ethnic heterogeneity may increase the number of religious figures that represent specific religious groups. Controlling state control over religion, people still give less salience to public secularization in this dimension. Whether or not a country experienced communism is statistically significant in the first three models, suggesting citizens of postcommunist countries are less supportive of religious leaders’ roles. However, communism’s effect is not systematic throughout the models. In the Model 4 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0010414012453027">Table 3</xref>, which includes inequality, postcommunism loses its significance.</p>

<p>Overall, inequality has a statistically significant coefficient and has a positive effect on both dimensions of individual secular attitude and therefore supports our theory. The other independent variables, however, do not have the same systematic effect. Varying the main independent variable, inequality, while holding other variables constant makes interpretation easier. We create different scenarios for a Catholic citizen in a country whose social spending is 10% of its GDP by changing inequality level. As the Gini coefficient increases from 22 to 52, the lowest and highest scores for the Gini coefficients in the sample, respectively, approval for secularization of public office holders decreases; the mean of support for secular attitudes declines from 9.8 to 8.2. Another scenario for individual attitude toward support for the influence of religious leaders in politics is that as inequality increases from 22 to 52, individuals tend to increase their approval of the influence of religious leaders; the mean of support for this dimension of secular attitudes declines from 7.2 to 6.5.</p>

<title>Does the Decline for Secular Attitudes Come From the Poor?</title>
<p>The theoretical and empirical discussion in the earlier section suggests that increasing inequality leads people of lower income levels to assign more importance to religion in politics. Two analyses determine whether or not this is actually the case. We chose Austria and Chile to test this expectation. These two cases provide significant variation in Gini coefficients (26 for Austria and 52 for Austria) and share similar Catholic traditions. Difference in their level of economic development is modest as well, compared to other alternative pairs. Based on earlier theoretical and empirical discussions, the expectation is that the rich should have higher secular attitudes in Austria than the rich in Chile because the Austrian rich reside in a country with more equality. Alternatively, the poor in Chile should have lower secular attitudes toward politics than those in Austria. Also, expectedly, the difference in secular attitudes between the poor and the rich will be much higher in a country with high inequality.</p>
<p>We calculated the mean level of secular attitudes for both dimensions and tabulated them across income quintiles.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0010414012453027">18</xref></sup> The results validate the expectation. For example, the mean level of secular attitudes by the fifth quintile in Austria (8.46) is higher than that in Chile (7.47). Moreover, the difference in the mean of secular attitudes between the first quintile and the fifth in Chile (0.31 for support for the religious leader in politics and 1.63 for the religiosity of public office holders) is much higher than in Austria (0.01 for the former dimension and 0.49 for the latter). Inequality desecularizes the whole society, albeit asymmetrically across income levels, the topic of subsequent analysis.</p>
<p>Second, multivariate analysis shows the robustness of our finding in the sample. To test the asymmetric effect, the study creates an interaction between people with different income quintiles and income inequality.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0010414012453027">19</xref></sup> <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0010414012453027">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0010414012453027">3</xref> include an interaction variable between inequality and income quintiles. Model 5 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0010414012453027">Table 2</xref> shows that all other country-level variables maintain their statistical significance, namely postcommunism and primary education. Inequality and income variables are statistically significant, so is the interaction variable, the substantive effect of which the succeeding paragraphs discuss. Nevertheless, the result suggests that although inequality reduces secular attitudes, its effect depends on income quintiles to which people belong. Model 5 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0010414012453027">Table 3</xref> shows similar findings and interpretations for support of the influence of religious figures in politics with regard to income and inequality.</p>

For example, the mean values for this dimension are 9.01, 9.35, and 9.69 for the first, third, and fifth quintiles, respectively, at a Gini of 22. However, the mean values decrease to 7.3, 7.89, and 8.44 in a country with a Gini of 52. The difference in secular attitudes from the first to the fifth quintile increases from 0.67 to 1.11 when moving from a country with a Gini score of 22 to a country with a Gini score of 52.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This article seeks to explain why citizens of some countries hold more secular attitudes toward politics. It contributes to understanding the relationship between religion and modern mass politics. Most cross-national studies in this genre have focused on private secularization, that is, secularization of individual religious beliefs and practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0010414012453027">Gill &amp; Lundsgaarde, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0010414012453027">Norris &amp; Inglehart, 2004</xref>). In fact, a much more salient dimension of secularism is public secularization, which gauges individual attitudes toward the role of religion in politics. This study finds the presence of two dimensions of public secularization in citizen attitudes: religiosity of public service holders and the influence of religious leaders in politics. And we believe that these two dimensions are more germane to the secularization debate than to private secularization if one seeks to understand the role of religion in politics, as recent studies find that individual religiosity does not account for support for secular democracy in Muslim countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0010414012453027">Ciftci, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0010414012453027">Jamal &amp; Tessler, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Overall, the results show that inequality diminishes all income groups’ secular attitudes toward politics. Further analysis uncovers that inequality has differential effects on income groups. Those at the bottom of income quintiles have lower levels of secular attitudes, with income inequality having a sharper effect on the attitudes of the poorer people. As for the higher income quintiles, the levels of secular attitudes at both dimensions are higher and show lesser levels of decline as inequality increases. As such, the results go beyond <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0010414012453027">Norris and Inglehart (2004</xref>, p. 99), who found, based on a global sample, that poverty, measured by the Human Development Indicators (HDI)index, and inequality reduce the mean level of religiosity and religious attendance. They also provided empirical evidence that the poor are more religious in Western Europe and the United States (pp. 109-110). The current study incorporates developing countries in its sample and shows that not poverty but unfair distribution of domestic resources has an impact that goes beyond private secularization and affects public secularization. In addition, this study adds to secularization studies that inequality affects secular attitudes toward politics among people at all income quintiles, but its effects are asymmetrical. Furthermore, it shows that secularization of the poor is greater in countries with low inequality. In this respect, this study adds to modernization theory by implying that full secularization of society depends not only on economic development but also on economic inequality.</p>
<p>In addition, the findings suggest that state regulation has a weak effect on people’s attitudes toward religion in the public sphere. This is in contrast to previous studies that asserted that state regulation has important effects on policy differences and levels of religiosity. For example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0010414012453027">Gill and Lundsgaarde (2004)</xref> found the effect of state regulation on attendance of religious rituals to be significant. However, their study’s dependent variables are different. The findings extend those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0010414012453027">Kuru (2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0010414012453027">2009</xref>) that the state approach toward religion, whether passive or assertive, has little effect on the two dimensions of secularization. On the other hand, government policies may have an indirect effect on secular attitudes through social policies, though only on the religiosity of public service holders.</p>
<p>Moreover, these findings contribute to democratization literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0010414012453027">Diamond et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0010414012453027">Stepan, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0010414012453027">Stepan &amp; Robertson, 2003</xref>). In particular, the current study’s findings implicate the importance of socioeconomic inequality as an effect on secular attitudes toward politics, facilitating the development of secular opposition in general. Most developing countries suffer from high levels of inequality. In these countries, expecting strong secular opposition may be challenging as high inequality diminishes public secularization among the large segments of society. This challenge becomes more significant in Middle Eastern countries where inequality has been persistently high. Therefore, secular opposition movements do not seem to have a promising role in making democracy possible in the region, unlike Islamic groups, which have parallel social welfare programs and appeal to a larger public. Our study also challenges those who argue that democracy is unlikely because there is no separation of politics and religion in Islam because this argument belies the reality on the ground that democratic regimes have been established in Catholic countries with high public secularization as well as in Muslim-majority countries where former Islamist opposition groups turn into democratizing actors, such as Indonesia, Morocco, and Turkey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0010414012453027">Huntington, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0010414012453027">Kedourie, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0010414012453027">Lewis, 1993</xref>; but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0010414012453027">Esposito &amp; Piscatori, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0010414012453027">Stepan, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Most important, this study, skeptical about the correlation between poverty and secularization, emphasizes the role of unfair distribution of domestic resources and its impact on how people see the role of religion and religious actors in politics. In particular, it emphasizes that in countries with high inequality, religious organizations can serve as a welfare provider, reaching to the disadvantaged segment of society with religious and political messages. The organizational strength of religious organizations shapes the way the public perceives religion and religious actors in politics, which is more pertinent to analyzing the relationship between secularization and democracy than private secularization.</p>

<p>A recent study found that inequality increases electoral chances of leftist parties in Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0010414012453027">Anderson &amp; Beramendi, 2008</xref>). This is an interesting paradox: Latin America, where inequality is high, witnesses the rise of religious movements as well as electoral success of the leftist parties. However, this phenomenon requires more scrutiny and goes beyond this study’s focus. Nevertheless, a tentative explanation may be that one commonality between religious organizations and leftist parties is that both use social programs that have increased their appeal to lower income groups.</p></fn>

<p>The causal story changes in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0010414012453027">Scheve and Stasavage (2006)</xref>, who argue that secular people are likely to support high social spending against the effects of adverse life events, whereas this is not the case for religious people. They find that countries with higher religiosity will have lower welfare spending.</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn16-0010414012453027">
<label>16.</label>
<p>We also created two figures for social spending and the state-religion index (see Figures S2 and S3 in the supplementary appendix). The results show that a strong and negative relationship exists only between the level of social spending and support for religiosity of public office holders.</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn17-0010414012453027">
<label>17.</label>
<p>Our diagnostic tests show that although Lutheran-majority countries show high and Catholic-majority ones low public support for the religiosity of public office holders, Lutherans have less public secularity scores in countries where both Catholics and Protestants make up significant portions of the population, such as the Netherlands, Canada, and the United States. We thank an anonymous reviewer for raising this issue and leave it to further studies to analyze.</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn18-0010414012453027">
<label>18.</label>
<p>We simply calculated the mean values of secularization for these two countries. The substantive interpretations do not change for other comparisons. All results are available on request.</p></fn>
