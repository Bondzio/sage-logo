<p>This paper explores the emotions connected with music performance. Performing music provides the potential to attain wellbeing via the hedonic and eudaimonic routes, appealing to pleasure, engagement and meaning (Seligman, 2002). To date, most research exploring emotions amongst performers has focused on these components separately, exploring positive or negative affect, flow, or the development of performer identity. In the current study, 35 university students (mean age 20.6 years) gave free reports of their strongest, most intense experiences of performing music. Accounts were content analyzed using the Strong Experiences of Music Descriptive System (Gabrielsson &amp; Lindström Wik, 2003), and also analyzed for the components of wellbeing using an idiographic approach. Four basic types of response were characterized, emphasizing: (1) negative and positive emotions and personal engagement; (2) negative and positive emotions, engagement and meaning; (3) positive emotion and meaning; or (4) positive emotions, engagement, and meaning. The emphasis on the eudaimonic route to wellbeing (through engagement and meaning) shows that young musicians do have valuable and rewarding experiences with the potential to sustain long-term motivation to engage with practical music-making. The value of the positive psychology framework is also demonstrated by its applicability to descriptions of strong experiences of performing music.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Research is beginning to demonstrate that performing music has considerable potential to generate wellbeing. Successful performers will derive considerable pleasure from their ability to make music, being able to meet technical challenges with high levels of skill, and enabling them to connect with other performers and with an audience. Involvement in musical activities has been shown to have positive effects on mood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0305735612448510">Valentine &amp; Evans, 2001</xref>), quality of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0305735612448510">Clift et al., 2010</xref>) and engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0305735612448510">Davidson, 2011</xref>), and to be a very rewarding leisure activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0305735612448510">Lamont, 2011a</xref>).</p>
<p>However, performing music also poses many challenges. These include initiating and maintaining motivation and interest in the early stages, the need to develop a musical identity and strong sense of self-efficacy throughout a lengthy training programme, managing transitions between stages of education and between training and professional life, overcoming performance anxiety and musculo-skeletal damage, and meeting the requirements of lengthy amounts of daily practice and repetition. Many music students experience a number of health-related problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0305735612448510">Kreutz, Ginsborg, &amp; Williamon, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0305735612448510">Williamon &amp; Thompson, 2006</xref>), while professional musicians are prone to a number of physical and psychological complaints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0305735612448510">Altenmüller &amp; Jabusch, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0305735612448510">Wynn Parry, 2004</xref>) and almost all professional musicians appear to experience stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0305735612448510">Bartel &amp; Thompson, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0305735612448510">Langendörfer, Hodapp, Kreutz, &amp; Bongard, 2006</xref>). The current paper explores the contradiction between positive and negative emotions in relation to performing music, focusing on memorable experiences from a relatively young sample of adults and drawing on concepts from positive psychology to interpret these.</p>
<p>Positive psychology (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0305735612448510">Seligman, 2002</xref>) approaches wellbeing in a multifaceted manner, combining two different traditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0305735612448510">Ryan, Huta, &amp; Deci, 2008</xref>). First, the hedonic tradition focuses on happiness or <italic>pleasure</italic>, defined as a presence of positive affect and an absence of negative affect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0305735612448510">Kahneman, Diener, &amp; Schwarz, 1999</xref>). The simple fact of experiencing positive emotions such as joy and contentment has been shown to have many psychological benefits, including health and cognitive outcomes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0305735612448510">Fredrickson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0305735612448510">Fredrickson &amp; Levenson, 1998</xref>). Second, the eudaimonic tradition focuses on living life in a satisfying way. Within this, two different routes have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0305735612448510">Seligman, 2002</xref>). First, <italic>engagement</italic> has been shown to be an essential component. Balancing appropriately high levels of challenge and skill is said to lead to an engaged state of flow, where the individual loses self-awareness through complete absorption in the task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0305735612448510">Csikszentmihalyi &amp; Csikszentmihalyi, 1988</xref>). People experiencing high levels of flow in general are found to be more motivated and creative in both work and leisure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0305735612448510">Csikszentmihalyi &amp; Lefevre, 1989</xref>). Second, <italic>meaning</italic> refers to using one’s strengths or commitments towards something larger than oneself, such as voluntary work, social groups or religion, which also contributes significantly to personal wellbeing (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0305735612448510">Wills, 2009</xref>). Autonomy over one’s own actions is also held to be an essential ingredient in the pursuit of both types of eudaimonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0305735612448510">Ryan et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Within positive psychology both traditions, hedonism and eudaimonia, are held to be necessary in the pursuit of happiness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0305735612448510">Waterman, 1993</xref>), and a balance is required between the three components of pleasure, engagement and meaning in order to achieve a state of subjective wellbeing and authentic happiness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0305735612448510">Peterson, Park, &amp; Seligman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0305735612448510">Seligman, Parks, &amp; Steen, 2005</xref>). At a global level, wellbeing varies with genetics (factors such as personality and positive dispositions), demographics and circumstances, but under normal circumstances individuals can control around 40% of their wellbeing through the pursuit of intentional, chosen, effortful activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0305735612448510">Lyubomirsky, Sheldon, &amp; Schkade, 2005</xref>). Research is still lacking into how different activities might engender wellbeing within this framework, although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0305735612448510">Csikszentmihalyi (2002)</xref> identifies a list of different activities which are likely to induce flow in participants, including active participation in dance, theatre and the arts, reading, sex, eating, and even vandalism and joyriding. Active involvement is central to this (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0305735612448510">Argyle, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>The positive psychology framework has already been used to interpret and analyze data on the effects of music listening (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0305735612448510">Lamont, 2011b</xref>). The growing body of research on different beneficial elements of music-making and performing can also be mapped onto this positive psychology framework to explore how music-making leads to wellbeing. As with most previous research with music listening, the different facets of the framework have tended to be addressed by different researchers using different methodologies and theoretical approaches. These are first considered separately and then brought together.</p>

<title>Hedonism through music performing: Positive and negative affect in music performance</title>
<p>Performing music can be a very positive emotional experience. For example, the physical act of singing, whether alone or in a choir, has been found to reduce levels of tense arousal and to increase levels of energetic arousal and positive hedonic tone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0305735612448510">Kreutz, Bongard, Rohrmann, Hodapp, &amp; Grebe, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0305735612448510">Valentine &amp; Evans, 2001</xref>), as well as to improve perceived quality of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0305735612448510">Clift et al., 2010</xref>). Children’s initial motivations to learn instruments are hedonic: 7- and 8-year-olds say they began to learn an instrument because it looked like it would be fun, exciting, or enjoyable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0305735612448510">McPherson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0305735612448510">McPherson &amp; Davidson, 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0305735612448510">Persson (2001)</xref> found that the hedonic motive of playing for enjoyment appeared to be the most influential for adult piano performers (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0305735612448510">Lamont, 2011a</xref>), and ‘peak’ and strong emotional experiences in music are also found in performers relating to their own performances as well as listeners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0305735612448510">Whaley, Sloboda, &amp; Gabrielsson, 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0305735612448510">Gabrielsson and Lindström Wik (2003</xref>) identified a large number of largely positive emotional components in their Strong Experiences of Music (SEM) descriptive system, derived from 1,354 free descriptions of such strong experiences. Volunteer adult participants were asked to write about their strongest and most intense experience of music, and results were content analyzed to outline the components of these experiences in the SEM descriptive system or SEM-DS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0305735612448510">Gabrielsson &amp; Lindström Wik, 2003</xref>). The SEM-DS covers seven aspects: the overall general characteristics, physical reactions and behaviours, perception, cognition, feelings/emotions, existential and transcendental aspects, and personal and social aspects (see also <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0305735612448510">Table 1</xref>). Although the majority of responses described music listening rather than performing, around 19% of the reports address performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0305735612448510">Gabrielsson, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0305735612448510">2008/2011</xref>). Nonetheless, positive emotions dominated the descriptions of these strong experiences of both listening and performing, particularly joy and happiness, rapture and euphoria, and calm and peace.</p>

<p>Considering the negative elements of music performance, a great deal of research has explored music performance anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0305735612448510">Kenny, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0305735612448510">Wilson, 2002</xref>). Performance anxiety affects around a quarter of professional performers to a significant degree (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0305735612448510">Steptoe, 2001</xref>), and is commonly defined by the physical and mental sensations experienced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0305735612448510">Lehmann, Sloboda, &amp; Woody, 2007</xref>). Its symptoms are created by the autonomic nervous system’s response to perceived threat, and include physiological symptoms like increased heart rate/pounding chest, excessive sweating, dry mouth, nausea, trembling hands, and cognitive symptoms such as loss of concentration and negative thoughts about the performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0305735612448510">Lehmann et al., 2007</xref>). All the symptoms of performance anxiety also appear in the SEM descriptive system: muscular tension/relaxation, trembling, shaking, palpitations of the heart, perspiration, stomach reactions, feeling dizzy, sick and in pain can all characterize either a strong positive or negative experience of music.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0305735612448510">Wilson (2002)</xref> identified three sources of performance anxiety: trait anxiety, or pre-dispositions for anxiety or unrealistic thinking about performing; situational stress, such as that created by a given performance context; and (lack of) task mastery over the music to be performed (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0305735612448510">Wilson &amp; Roland, 2002</xref>). Treatments have focused on the symptoms (e.g., relaxation techniques, biofeedback training, or anti-anxiety medication), the performer (therapy for their anxiety levels, developing positive beliefs and goal orientations), the situation (choice of venue, inclusion of group as well as solo situations, and practising the performance as well as the piece), and the musical task (selecting appropriately challenging music; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0305735612448510">Connolly &amp; Williamon, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0305735612448510">Gruzelier &amp; Egner, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0305735612448510">Kenny, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0305735612448510">Lehmann et al., 2007</xref>). The most successful approaches to treating performance anxiety as a trait focus on cognitive and behavioural measures, and flow (see following section) has occasionally been referred to as a desirable state which might help reduce anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0305735612448510">Wilson &amp; Roland, 2002</xref>).</p>

<title>Engagement and flow in music performing</title>
<p>Most literature exploring the development of musical performing skills has highlighted the importance of motivation (both extrinsic and intrinsic) in sustaining children’s and young people’s interest in music as an activity (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0305735612448510">McPherson &amp; Davidson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0305735612448510">Woody &amp; McPherson, 2010</xref>). Particularly in the early stages, the influence of other people has been identified as critical in providing the necessary extrinsic motivation for a child to continue with music (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0305735612448510">Davidson, Howe, &amp; Sloboda, 1997</xref>). Differences in intrinsic motivation and achievement in music performers during childhood and adolescence have typically been interpreted within a framework that emphasizes the learner’s cognitive orientation to learning (for example, self-concept, self-efficacy, attributional beliefs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0305735612448510">Austin, Renwick, &amp; McPherson, 2006</xref>), which relates to the notions of autonomy and self-determination referred to earlier (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0305735612448510">Ryan &amp; Deci, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0305735612448510">Ryan et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>This cognitive approach has also been linked to the psychological state of flow. Playing and performing music has the potential to induce a flow-like state, even in infants and young children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0305735612448510">Custodero, 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0305735612448510">Gabrielsson and Lindström Wik (2003</xref>) uncovered musical performances that reflected engagement with loss of self-awareness, indicative of flow: for example, ‘sometimes it is as if it isn’t me who is playing. The fingers move by themselves’ (p. 176). Flow may also predict long-term motivation and achievement in music performing. For instance, amongst a sample of adolescent musicians, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0305735612448510">O’Neill (1999)</xref> found that higher achieving children reported significantly more flow experiences with music than lower achievers (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0305735612448510">Fritz &amp; Avsec, 2007</xref>). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0305735612448510">Sloboda (1991)</xref> found that adults who described having had peak experiences with music before the age of about 10 were more likely to pursue involvement with music later in life. High levels of engagement and flow in music may thus provide one reason for performers to continue to re-engage with the activity (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0305735612448510">Woody &amp; McPherson, 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>Meaning in music performing</title>
<p>From the perspective of positive psychology, the search for meaning (which has been less explored than the other routes to happiness) is allied most closely with spirituality and religion. However, the notion of searching for meaning and something beyond oneself has two clear parallels in music performing: first, as a passage of self-discovery in terms of identity formation and, second, as a shared experience with co-performers and/or an audience (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0305735612448510">Walker, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Becoming a musician is an important achievement in terms of developing an identity in music (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0305735612448510">Hargreaves, Miell, &amp; MacDonald, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0305735612448510">Juuti &amp; Littleton, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0305735612448510">Lamont, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0305735612448510">O’Neill, 2002</xref>). Becoming a performer is a somewhat separate achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0305735612448510">Davidson, 2002</xref>), with a fundamental goal of communication to an audience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0305735612448510">Bailey &amp; Davidson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0305735612448510">Hargreaves, MacDonald, &amp; Miell, 2005</xref>). Developing a positive identity is important as a motivator: a lack of musical self-concept or musical identity leads many people to disengage from musical activities (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0305735612448510">Ruddock &amp; Leong, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0305735612448510">Wise &amp; Sloboda, 2008</xref>), and managing transitions while retaining a positive identity is important for long-term success in a musical career (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0305735612448510">Juuti &amp; Littleton, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Developing a group or social musical identity is also important. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0305735612448510">Persson (2001)</xref> found social motives and the importance of belonging to be the second most influential factor in motivating pianists to continue playing. These powerful social motives for musical engagement have been studied by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0305735612448510">Faulkner and Davidson (2004)</xref>, showing how members of a male choir feel that singing plays an important role in connecting with other people (family, friends and wider social groups) as well as communicating to others (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0305735612448510">Davidson, 2004</xref>). Even in small ensembles, the influence of others is an important motivator: for example, members of wind quintets reported they had formed the groups out of a desire to work with friends or other musicians whom they liked and respected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0305735612448510">Ford &amp; Davidson, 2003</xref>), and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0305735612448510">Gabrielsson and Lindström Wik (2003</xref>) highlighted a sense of community amongst performers and between performers and listeners in their examples of strong experiences of performing (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0305735612448510">Sawyer, 2006</xref>). Conversely, a lack of such positive social contact through music can lead to performers dropping out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0305735612448510">Moore, Burland, &amp; Davidson, 2003</xref>).</p>

<title>An integrated approach to happiness and wellbeing in music performing</title>
<p>As indicated by the diversity of research reviewed earlier, most of the research focusing on aspects of wellbeing and fulfilment for performers has tackled these concepts separately. However, the positive psychology approach to happiness and wellbeing implies that it is important to consider them in an integrated manner, as parts of a whole. The SEM-DS provides one potential means for doing this. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0305735612448510">Gabrielsson and Lindström Wik (2003</xref>) have identified direct physical and physiological responses to the music such as chills alongside high arousal feelings of rapture and euphoria, ecstasy and intoxication (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0305735612448510">Gabrielsson, 2010</xref>), implying a hedonic state. In addition, these are accompanied by a number of different cognitive characteristics, such as focused attention and complete absorption, feeling embedded in the music, and coming to hear things in a new way, implying engagement and flow. Finally, the more spiritual elements of transcendence such as out-of-body experiences are present, as well as aspects of personal and social development, indicating meaning-making. The combination of elements may account for the power of such experiences in a range of therapeutic outcomes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0305735612448510">Gabrielsson &amp; Lindström, 1995</xref>). However, most of the analysis presented to date has focused on identifying the different elements of SEMs across participants in a nomothetic manner, rather than exploring their co-occurrence within particular accounts in an idiographic way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0305735612448510">Pelham, 1993</xref>; although see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0305735612448510">Gabrielsson, 2008/2011</xref>). Moreover, while examples are given of performers reporting strong experiences of their own performance through illustrative quotes, the analysis has not separated out performing and listening SEMs and so it is hard to know how far the general descriptive characteristics and overwhelmingly positive emotions found in these experiences apply specifically to music <italic>performing</italic>.</p>
<p>The vast majority of research on emotion in performance centres on the communication of emotion to the listener (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0305735612448510">Gabrielsson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0305735612448510">Juslin &amp; Laukka, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0305735612448510">Juslin &amp; Madison, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0305735612448510">Lindström, Juslin, Bresin, &amp; Williamon, 2003</xref>). Indeed, Juslin and Timmers point out that ‘[w]hat counts is the sound that reaches the listener, not what the performer is feeling’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0305735612448510">2010</xref>, p. 478), and very little research has considered the emotional impact of the performance on the performer. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0305735612448510">Van Zijl and Sloboda (2011)</xref> have begun to explore this, finding that personal involvement with emotions varies at different stages of preparation for a performance. Emotional playing featured in the earlier stages of preparation, while an expressive performance was found to consist of more detached and conscious communication, with a small proportion of felt emotion. Research with jazz musicians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0305735612448510">Sawyer, 2006</xref>) has suggested the importance of a link between flow and group cohesion in generating a state of intense emotional empathy through improvisation. These studies both combine the concepts of engagement and meaning, providing support for the fruitfulness of an integrated approach from positive psychology to understanding emotions in music performers. However, they have not considered the long-term impact of such experiences, nor the potential influence of hedonism within the search for wellbeing.</p>
<p>The current study thus addresses the holistic nature of strong experiences of music performing amongst a population of young adults with an interest in music, exploring the kinds of experiences they choose to report and any commonalities in their experiences. It adopts the same self-report methodology as the SEM project, drawing on this and other findings that performers possess an adequate vocabulary for music and emotions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0305735612448510">Greasley, Lamont &amp; Sloboda, in press</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0305735612448510">Sloboda, 1991</xref>) and can accurately describe performance situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0305735612448510">Osborne &amp; Kenny, 2008</xref>). It also focuses on young adult participants as a relatively homogeneous age group who have had sufficient potential opportunities for strong experiences of music through performing in the relatively recent past (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0305735612448510">Gabrielsson, 2006</xref>), strengthening the dependability of the self-report technique. It explores whether performing experiences can be characterized using the tripartite conceptualization of wellbeing from positive psychology.</p>

<sec id="section7-0305735612448510">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>A total of 35 undergraduate and graduate students completed free descriptions of their strongest experiences of or related to music performing. The sample consisted of psychology and music students from a medium-sized university in the north-west of England who had opted to take a course in music psychology. There were eight male and 27 female participants, with a median age of 20 years (ranging from 20 years to 35 years 1 month, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.8). Most participants were White Caucasian (88.6%), and the sample also included two Chinese and two Other Asian participants. All participants had experienced some kind of musical training; a large majority (88.6%) had more than six years of musical training; and 74.3% had more than 10 years of training. The median grade level achieved for the 23 participants who reported this was grade 8 (<italic>SD</italic> = 1.278), with 15 participants having achieved grade 8 or higher. A total of 65% reported having more than three years of performing experience in the last five years. The sample is thus comparable in its variance in musical expertise (taking age into account) with Gabrielsson’s sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0305735612448510">2008/2011</xref>), where 20% were professional musicians and 56% amateur musicians.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0305735612448510">
<title>Materials</title>
<p>Identical instructions were given to participants as in the SEM project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0305735612448510">Gabrielsson &amp; Lindström Wik, 2003</xref>). At the top of one side of A4 paper was printed: ‘Describe in your own words the strongest, most intense experience of music that you have ever had. Please describe your experience and reactions in as much detail as you can. If you need to use more paper, feel free’. The rest of the page was left blank. On the opposite side was set out a series of follow-up questions, following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0305735612448510">Gabrielsson (2006)</xref>, which participants were instructed to complete as necessary if they had not referred to the answers in their free descriptions. These asked where and when the experience took place, whether it was the first time they had experienced the music and whether this strong experience recurred during later experience with the same music, feelings before and after the experience, what the cause of the experience was, and finally, whether such strong experiences were experienced often. Participants were not guided to write about either performing or listening specifically, but allowed to make their own choice of what kind of musical experience was most salient for them; the current paper focuses only on those who chose to write about performing (for analysis of the listening experience data, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0305735612448510">Lamont, 2011b</xref>).</p>

<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Participants were recruited over five years (October 2006 to November 2010) at the start of an optional module in music psychology for which they gave informed consent to take part in a range of studies. They were given response forms and asked to take these away and complete them alone, returning them to the researcher the following week. All participants were given pre-assigned randomized participant numbers to protect their anonymity, and this enabled their responses to be matched to their responses from other questionnaires giving details of age, gender, ethnicity and musical training. Participants gave their consent to be referred to here using their first names only.</p>

<sec id="section10-0305735612448510" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Data were first analyzed using qualitative content analysis drawing on categories from previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0305735612448510">Krippendorf, 2004</xref>). Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0305735612448510">Gabrielsson (2008/2011)</xref> did not specify the precise content analytic techniques used in his analysis, it corresponds to a qualitative approach where text is not simply counted for frequencies of occurrence but is examined closely in order to classify it into a parsimonious number of categories of similar meaning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0305735612448510">Weber, 1990</xref>). The initial coding was conducted using the SEM-DS as elaborated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0305735612448510">Gabrielsson and Lindström Wik (2003</xref>), and a few categories were added and two existing categories expanded to include material relating specifically to music performance situations. Frequency of occurrence of each topic was counted in terms of the number of participants who referred to them, to enable comparison with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0305735612448510">Gabrielsson’s (2010</xref>) results (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0305735612448510">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>Most participants reported positive emotions, with 88.6% reporting some positive emotion in their accounts (compared with 72% in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0305735612448510">Gabrielsson, 2010</xref>). However, there was also a very high proportion of negative emotions (62.9%) compared with only 23% in Gabrielsson’s findings. Unsurprisingly, topics mentioned but not specifically enumerated by Gabrielsson in relation to performance were also frequently found: over half the participants reported a change from negative to positive emotions in connection with performance anxiety (18 of the 20 participants who noted changed emotions, or 51.4% of the total), and a similar proportion (54.3%) reported a specific response from the audience, with a high number (34.3%) highlighting the importance of interacting with other performers. In addition, over a quarter of accounts mentioned the challenge of performing, over a third noted the hard work, effort and time that went into it, and over half mentioned skill.</p>
<p>The current results differ from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0305735612448510">Gabrielsson’s (2010</xref>) findings in three other main respects. First, there are many more responses relating to the topics of community and communication through music in the current data, as 68.6% of performers mention this topic compared with only 18% of respondents in the earlier results. Conversely, while 41% of Gabrielsson’s participants mentioned general insights, possibilities and needs being generated by their SEM, only 5.7% mention this in the current sample (while a very similar number mention specifically musical insights, possibilities and needs in both sets of results); in opposition, many more performers noted confirmation of identity and self-esteem (48.6% compared with 15%). Finally, there are far fewer mentions of most of the perceptual elements and imagery from the current sample compared with the larger sample in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0305735612448510">Gabrielsson (2010)</xref>.</p>
<p>These results provide confirmation of the general transferability of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0305735612448510">Gabrielsson and Lindström Wik’s (2003)</xref> SEM descriptive system across different samples and the relevance of most of the categories to examples of strong experiences of music performing specifically, although there are differences due to the specific nature of music performing (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0305735612448510">Appendix 1</xref>). However, as illustrated earlier, this nomothetic content analysis approach cannot identify particular <italic>types</italic> of respondent or experience, and so an open-ended thematic approach was also adopted here to analyze the free accounts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0305735612448510">Richards, 2006</xref>). An idiographic approach has been applied, taking the individual account as the unit of analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0305735612448510">Pelham, 1993</xref>), as previously done for music listening accounts by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0305735612448510">Lamont (2011b)</xref> and for concert audiences by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0305735612448510">Pitts (2005a</xref>).</p>

<title>Characterizing the strong experiences of performers</title>
<p>Considering each account first in a descriptive sense, a variety of experiences was reported, both in terms of activity and context. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0305735612448510">Table 2</xref> provides an overview of the contexts of the strong experiences of performing. The vast majority (33 of the 35 experiences, 94%) involved other listeners of some kind, and 21 of these (60%) were with non-critical audiences in the form of concerts and gigs or playing for friends, while 12 (34.3%) were for critical audiences in recitals, examinations, festivals, competitions and lessons. The majority (80%, or 28) of the strong experiences were of playing, with 20% occurring with singing.</p>

<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0305735612448510">Figure 1</xref>, over half the strong experiences occurred with classical music. While most participants described the context to provide explicit or implicit clues to the style of music being played (e.g., ‘I had wanted to play in a rock band for so long’), there were a large number of accounts (18) that did not specify particular pieces, artists, or composers. Thirteen participants reported specific pieces or tracks, while four indicated specific moments of performing within a piece or playing a single note. The data thus represent a range of levels of specificity, situations and musical styles, although the emphasis within the performing accounts is of playing an instrument or playing in a group of instrumentalists.</p>

<p>Over half of the participants (18 out of 35) mentioned negative emotions relating to performance anxiety (with another describing a situation which turned from anxiety and anticipation about her first ever experience of playing to overwhelmingly positive emotions once that barrier had been crossed and a second reporting a positive experience which later became negative due to lack of opportunity). These divide broadly into two groups, the first two in the performer typology.</p>
<p>The first group, consisting of 11 accounts, described negative emotions giving way to positive emotions in a highly personal context, with little reference to the audience or to other performers. Participants indicated high levels of stress prior to the performance, reporting being ‘nervous’, ‘worried’ and ‘anxious’ before they played, with anxiety being expressed around the challenges of the music – ‘it was a difficult piece which had taken me approximately a year to learn’ (Emma) – and around the performer’s own state: ‘I felt very nervous, felt like I was not well-prepared for it, even my fingers freezed up [sic]’ (Abia). Most described how they had engaged in solitary hard work through practice as a strategy to overcome these negative emotions. The majority of these experiences led to successful performances: the nerves subsided and performers reported feelings of ‘relaxation’, ‘enjoyment’, ‘adrenaline’ and, occasionally, flow-like states of lack of self-awareness. These subsequently led participants to gain in confidence: ‘It has given me the confidence to know that enough practice <italic>does</italic> pay off eventually’ (Elizabeth), and to continue making music: ‘Although it was really hard and pushed me to the limits, I found it amazing fun and felt really proud of myself when I finished’ (Hannah). As Julia noted after a university music recital, ‘I wanted to do it again’.</p>
<p>For Emma, and several others in this group, the anxiety seemed to be bound up with the exhilaration of the performance:
<disp-quote>
<p>When I started to play it I had a nervous butterfly feeling which became really intense as I continued with no mistakes. I could feel the music and I felt like I wasn’t in control even though I was playing it. As the song went on the sound made me feel an intense feeling of happiness and satisfaction.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This exemplifies the personal challenge and self-reflective understanding that characterized the responses from this group. If any connections were drawn with others, they tended to be negative ones, as Alice explained:
<disp-quote>
<p>Though having looked at the music before arrival, I felt very inadequate when I couldn’t play the music up to speed and to the standard of the majority of the other players. This led to feeling very exposed in sectional rehearsals, though the tutors provided useful fingerings and technique advice. I also found the intense all-day rehearsing tiring as I wasn’t used to playing that much.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Overall, the negative experiences prior to performance for this group were replaced by positive emotions during and after performance. However, one participant reported having been prescribed anti-anxiety medication which gave her a negative reaction, and attempting the performance (a recital) without the medication: ‘I was very nervous before I went in to play, and continued to be nervous throughout. It manifests itself, with me, in sweaty palms, shaking and complete mind blank’ (Amy). These physical features, as noted earlier, are also part of the SEM-DS. Unfortunately the poor level of achievement in the performance led Amy to note that she would probably not perform again until she had mastered her anxiety.</p>
<p>The second group (six in all) also included the negative-to-positive emotional change embodied in performance anxiety, and a confidence boost through conquering this, but alongside it emphasized social relationships with others (both performers and audience) which reflected the social dimension of meaning. The following description shows how the performer sees herself as connected to a wider community, both in terms of the others involved in the production and the audience:
<disp-quote>
<p>Prior to playing I was really nervous. When we began playing I began to relax and stopped shaking. There is one particular part of the song which was really difficult for me to play; but at the same time the most beautiful. I remember that the technique to play it was painful but when I got to the end of the piece I was crying! I think the way my classmates had done the lighting had a lot to do with it, secondly the adrenaline rush of performing in front of a large crowd and lastly performing brings you wholely [sic] in tune with the musicality of the song itself. Plus it was a huge self-esteem boost and I remember just being on a high for weeks. (Kirsty)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Others reported similar connections with their fellow performers and the audience: ‘the buzz I got from playing with a live band and singers/actors in front of a large audience in a theatre was immense’ (Adam). This group viewed the pressure and stress created by performance as somehow responsible for the ‘adrenaline rush’ they experience during and after performing, and the performance itself is the catalyst for converting the negative into positive: ‘a few minutes into the performance, nerves turned into the most fantastic hour of my life’ (Jonathan).</p>
<p>The third group, with 10 responses, overwhelmingly expressed a strong sense of positive emotion. These tended to be shorter and less detailed than the other descriptions in terms of what exactly it was that evoked the strong response. For example, Alanna noted ‘it felt wonderful and my emotions were of extreme elation’ about a performance at the Barbican, while Grant stated ‘It was a great gig and we had an amazing reception’. Seven of the 10 described experiences that included singing (although the participants were not always the ones doing the singing, as in the band gigs), and nine were about performing situations to non-critical audiences. Audience response was sometimes invoked as part of the strong response: ‘once everyone applauds you feel a huge buzz’ (Hayley), and connections between the performers were also prevalent:
<disp-quote>
<p>hundreds of people took part. It was so intense and loud and there were so many great songs with everyone singing in tune. (Ruth)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In one rather unusual example, Jake eloquently described how the audience and the performers came together: ‘the poetic unleashings of freedom experienced when my band, the audience and myself collaborated for perfect microcosms of moment’. Jake and one other in this group spoke about how music <italic>was</italic> their life, and that they had found their passion through this kind of activity and it was what sustained them. In summary, this group was characterized by a strong sense of positive emotion, engagement with others (both performers and listeners), and including a sense of personal growth through music (gaining confidence, finding their direction), with an absence of explicit statements relating to the challenge and skill aspects of flow.</p>
<p>In the fourth group (eight responses), participants clearly illustrated all the features of wellbeing (positive emotions, engagement, meaning, social relationships and achievement). These were the most detailed and longest accounts, reflecting a wide range of features of the SEM-DS from descriptions of physiological reactions all the way through to connections with the audience and personal development. They differed from the second group in that there were no indications given of negative emotion, although challenge and skill was often referred to. Participants reported their experience in terms of a kind of synergy achieved between themselves, other performers and the audience, and these accounts also emphasized the sound quality, the beauty of the music, and a sense of euphoria. For example, one oboist reported in detail about an instance of playing the St Matthew Passion in front of a large audience:
<disp-quote>
<p>There is an aria called ‘Aus Liebe’ (+/− Because of love). During this aria two cor anglais players play accompanying repetitive notes. A flute plays the melody; and a soprano sings the words. I played second cor anglais. For cor anglais this aria is ‘very heavy’, since you need a lot of breath to play it to the end. During this performance in the Jacobi church, it seemed that the four musicians became one. We played as if we were ‘in trance’, as if we were not physically there. The voice of the soprano was so pure, so full of ‘unspoken emotion’. During this aria the audience was totally silent. It was a very deep silence. The atmosphere in the church was very special. When the aria had come to an end, it seemed as if I had to wake up, as if I had to come back from another ‘state of being’. When I looked at the audience many people were crying. Emotionally I was totally exhausted. At the same time I felt an enormous happiness. (Anemone)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Anemone referred to the technical challenges posed by the music (‘you need a lot of breath to play it to the end’), but emphasized the sound quality produced by herself and the other performers and the effect this had on herself, the other performers and the audience. Sound quality was a common feature in all these descriptions, and they also included mentions of physiological reactions more frequently than the other groups. There was also a sense of compulsion shown in these accounts, from Alicia, who reported that she ‘had to step in’ to create a chamber choir for mixed voices to Sian, the orchestra member who felt, after a performance of <italic>Les Misérables</italic>, that she wanted to be ‘up there forever’.</p>
<p>All but one of these accounts mentioned the specific music that was involved, not only by name but in detail. For example, Lydia recalled a memorable performance of Mozart’s <italic>Requiem</italic> and began by describing the music itself:
<disp-quote>
<p>The music is so powerful that it leaves you unable to not be moved; it’s haunting, beautiful and packed with such strong emotion, it’s just impossible to not be left moved by it. It physically affects me even to listen to it now, as soon as I hear the strings and woodwind in the Introitus my spine tingles!</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>She then went on to explain the depth of connection to the specific performance:
<disp-quote>
<p>as soon as it begins you are unable to think about anything other than the wonderful music. It’s almost like the music made me feel powerful, and I think it had the same effect on everybody as it had never sounded so good . . . At the end of the performance I just felt absolutely elated. I felt like we had really done justice to the music.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>These performances were also all characterized by a strong sense of achievement, but this achievement went beyond the individual (as in the first group) and came from a more confident foundation than those in the second group. Ruth illustrated this confidence well:
<disp-quote>
<p>Playing the flute is a real passion, but when put within a performance as strong as this, I find it hard to convey how amazing it makes me feel and how I can completely lose myself in the music itself.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>These four types of performance reflect different emphases on the elements of positive emotions, engagement and flow, and meaning and social relationships. While they all include aspects of each of these in certain combinations, the weighting given to these combinations are different, and may reflect a hierarchy with a progression towards higher levels of wellbeing. The first group was the most negative in the current data, considering their music-making as a very personal and almost introverted activity which could have substantial negative impact on their emotions and their willingness to continue. However, if performance situations went well, the impact was more positive. The second group also suffered from negative expectations but had stronger connections with their fellow performers and the audience, leading to a more robust sense of identity in music. The third group appeared almost to take their positive musical experiences for granted, as although hard work might have preceded the performance, the performance itself was reported in global terms as prioritizing hedonism along with engagement with others. There were no instances of critical audiences in these accounts. Finally, the fourth group did not exhibit any negative emotions in relation to performing, showing a well-developed sense of musical identity and a robustness to their performing which encompassed many positive features.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The current results highlight that, while some of the general features of strong experiences of music highlighted by Gabrielsson’s work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0305735612448510">2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0305735612448510">2008/2011</xref>) are also found in specific investigations of performers, there are different patterns of response when considering performance as a separate activity. Performing often includes a high proportion of negative as well as positive emotions, sets a high level of challenge (either from the performers themselves or from audiences, critical or otherwise) and requires a high level of skill. It has the potential to generate more connections to others, both other performers and the audience. Finally, performing also provides more potential for confirmation of identity and self-esteem in relation to music, which is likely to set the groundwork for future careers in music (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0305735612448510">Davidson &amp; Burland, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0305735612448510">Lamont, 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0305735612448510">Pitts, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>As outlined earlier, the balanced approach to wellbeing is held to be dependent on combining features of hedonism, engagement and meaning. Thus individual accounts were examined for the relative balance of these features, and a typology of four different pathways has been illustrated. Each includes elements of all three sources of wellbeing, but with different emphases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0305735612448510">Seligman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0305735612448510">Seligman et al., 2005</xref>). First, in relation to hedonism or pleasure, almost all the experiences included positive emotions. This confirms earlier findings that performers choose to engage and re-engage through some kind of intrinsic enjoyment of performing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0305735612448510">Persson, 2001</xref>) and supports the importance of the hedonic route (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0305735612448510">Kahneman et al., 1999</xref>). However, hedonism would not be an accurate overall characterization for participants reporting situations of intense negative emotions. These reflect many features of preparation and pre-performance anxiety found in earlier research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0305735612448510">Lehmann et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0305735612448510">Osborne &amp; Kenny, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0305735612448510">Steptoe, 2001</xref>). The discourse around preparation and anxiety indicates that, for some, performing is not inherently pleasurable, although appropriate levels of skill can help performers meet these challenges, generating flow states. Thus every account included a strong emphasis on at least one element of eudaimonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0305735612448510">Waterman, 1993</xref>), including flow, personal and social meaning in differing combinations. It is possible that a degree of arousal is necessary for some performers to achieve high quality performances, just as it also seems necessary for performers to re-inject felt emotion into their playing prior to giving a performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0305735612448510">van Zijl &amp; Sloboda, 2011</xref>). Furthermore, the presence of a critical audience in around a third of the performance accounts suggests that other people can also be responsible for generating a memorable performance situation which may also evoke some negative emotions (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0305735612448510">Brotons, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>The emphasis found here on both elements of eudaimonia, which has been linked to autonomy and intrinsic motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0305735612448510">Ryan et al., 2008</xref>), is encouraging in showing how young performers can develop stable and lasting self-concepts in music (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0305735612448510">Davidson &amp; Burland, 2006</xref>). The current results illustrate the importance of flow and peak experience (present in most of the types identified here) in generating and sustaining motivation for future engagement with music (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0305735612448510">O’Neill, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0305735612448510">Sloboda, 1991</xref>), and future work on identity across the lifespan should consider the importance of flow more closely, as well as how this might be affected by musical training. Most of the long-term effects on individual participants’ performing careers and choices (personal meaning) came from experiences that prioritized challenge rather than pleasure through music. This highlights that the path towards success as a performer need not always reflect enjoyment (counter to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0305735612448510">Persson’s 2001</xref> findings), and supports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0305735612448510">Davidson and Burland’s (2006)</xref> argument that it is important for musicians to develop methods for coping with negative experiences. However, Davidson and Burland also emphasized the importance of having a range of positive experiences with others in order to develop a strong personal musical identity. The relative paucity of entirely solitary experiences in the accounts here indicates that participants felt that strong experiences of music performance were more typically shared with others (generating social meaning), even if the effects of such shared performance might be considered more often in terms of the individual rather than the group. The results also suggest that emotionally connecting to others could be an alternative way to combat performance anxiety.</p>
<p>Research on listening in everyday life has highlighted the importance of self-chosen music in having maximum emotional impact (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0305735612448510">Mitchell, MacDonald, Knussen, &amp; Serpell, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0305735612448510">Sloboda, Lamont, &amp; Greasley, 2009</xref>). However, a further novel outcome from the current data is that the majority of these strong experiences of music performing come from music that is not chosen by the participants (in the context of examinations, lessons, and orchestral and choral concerts), which nonetheless engenders strong experiences. Importantly, this music is still familiar to the participants, since it is extremely unlikely that a performer can experience wholly novel music in the context of a performance. Prior knowledge of the music through performing (combining auditory and kinaesthetic modalities) may thus ‘prime’ a strong experience in a performance setting, where the presence of the audience contributes to the charged atmosphere, in the same way that listeners can prime themselves for strong experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0305735612448510">DeNora, 2001</xref>), particularly in live musical situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0305735612448510">Pitts, 2005b</xref>). This may also account for the comparative infrequency of ‘loss of control’ statements in the current results, since performers who know the music well will be able to anticipate more than listeners always can.</p>
<p>Methodologically, the open-ended approach combined with idiographic analysis adopted here has provided rich data from young adults about a range of musical experiences and enabled finer-grained interpretation of these experiences. While people without musical backgrounds often find it difficult to articulate elements of their emotional response to music, those with musical training and also those with an active and strong interest in music do have access to a vocabulary to express themselves in relation to music (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0305735612448510">Greasley et al., in press</xref>). The current sample all had comparable amounts of musical training to participants in Greasley et al.’s study, and thus should have the same ability to describe their emotional experience in similar amounts of detail. While some chose not to, most of the participants provided accounts which were longer and more detailed than those provided from adolescents using a similar methodology by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0305735612448510">Osborne and Kenny (2008)</xref>. The task context could have influenced this (although participants were given the task to do in their own time, it is possible that some might have not treated this with the appropriate degree of seriousness). However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0305735612448510">Gabrielsson’s (2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0305735612448510">2008/2011</xref>) data, provided freely by volunteers, also varies in length and level of detail, so it seems likely that the depth and detail of the accounts is a relevant feature of the descriptions which merits being taken into account of in the current results. Future research might explore whether variations in the accounts can be explained by other individual difference factors such as personality type, and to test the validity of this methodological approach by comparing it with ratings of subjective wellbeing and emotional state. Finally, a careful idiographic analysis according to context enables this data to go beyond the earlier findings from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0305735612448510">Gabrielsson and Lindström Wik (2003</xref>; Gabrielsson, 2001, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0305735612448510">2006</xref>) to explore features of the performing situation in more detail, since it is becoming increasingly acknowledged that every feature of musical engagement and involvement is highly context-specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0305735612448510">Sloboda et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, the results illustrate that strong experiences of music performance are dominated by the eudaimonic route to happiness, with the hedonic route playing an important role. Like listeners, performers’ strongest experiences are characterized by engagement and a search for meaning, although they occur largely with non-chosen music that is almost always familiar to the participants and in front of an audience. These experiences have considerable long-term effects on performers’ musical lives, and post-event evaluations of those experiences that include some negative elements show that performers recognize the value of performing within their musical careers. These experiences provide valuable and overwhelmingly positive memories of performing which they can draw on to sustain their motivation for music, both from a hedonistic and, more importantly, from a eudaimonic perspective. It would be important to explore these experiences in a wider sample of participants at different levels of musical achievement to investigate how far single experiences can predict a lifetime of musical engagement, and to consider how important the audience is at different levels of performer expertise for providing the appropriate level of motivation for high quality performance experiences.</p>
