<title>Background</title>
<p>The current health care provider is challenged to improve patient outcomes while rationing medical and economic resources. The escalation of drug shortages over the past decade has proven to be a difficult obstacle toward improved care. American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) currently reports over 200 drug shortages, with increasing numbers reported every year since 2007 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0897190013482332">Figure 1</xref>).<sup>

<p>The clinical and economic implications of these drug shortages are substantial. In a recent survey of more than 300 directors of pharmacy, nearly half of institutions larger than 400 beds experienced at least 30 drug shortages in 2010, with an estimated annual labor cost of $216 million for all health systems nationwide.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0897190013482332">4</xref>
</sup> Of the survey respondents, 70% described the information available to manage these drug shortages as “less than good.” Without adequate preparation and knowledge, the management of drug shortages is difficult. Currently, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cannot require manufacturers to provide notification of impending drug shortages or to manufacture any specific drug product.<sup>

<sup>,</sup>
<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0897190013482332">6</xref>
</sup> Therefore, from an institutional perspective, the management of drug shortages is often reactive, awaiting manufacturers or suppliers to reach critically low levels of drug product before information related to a drug shortage is communicated.</p>
<p>Multiple resources are available that detail the mechanism of drug shortages.<sup>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>A PubMed search of English-language literature from January 1990 through April 2012 using the medical subject headings pharmaceutical preparations/supply and distribution and the general search term drug shortages were used to identify potential references. All original prospective and retrospective studies, peer-reviewed guidelines, consensus statements, review articles, and accompanying references were evaluated for inclusion. Relevance was determined considering the therapeutic class, focus on drug shortages, and manuscript type.</p>

<title>Impact on Patient Care</title>
<sec id="section4-0897190013482332">
<title>Risk to Patient Safety</title>
<p>Drug shortages, both past and present, have significantly shaped the care of patients in the United States. Every shortage has the potential to threaten patient safety, resulting in adverse effects of alternative therapeutic agents, compromising medical treatment and/or procedures, delaying therapy potentially resulting in disease progression, and increased incidence of medication errors while using less familiar therapeutic alternatives. The Institute for Safe Medication Practices (ISMP) attempted to better describe the perceived impact of drug shortages on patient safety through a survey of health care practitioners.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0897190013482332">7</xref>
</sup> Of the 1500 responders, 64% believed that shortages posed a significant risk of adverse patient outcomes. Over one-third of the practitioners reported a near miss during the previous year due to drug shortages, with 25% reporting actual errors and 20% reporting adverse patient outcomes.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0897190013482332">7</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The aforementioned ISMP survey provided details of adverse drug events with sedative and chemotherapy agents, illustrating how patient safety within these 2 patient populations has been greatly impacted.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0897190013482332">7</xref>
</sup> One example occurred when a smart pump was programmed incorrectly for a dexmedetomidine infusion due to unfamiliarity with dexmeditomidine use prior to the propofol shortage, resulting in a patient receiving a 20-fold overdose for 5 hours. Similarly, a 1000 mg cytarabine vial was prepared according to a reconstitution protocol for 500 mg vials, which were unavailable, resulting in the administration at twice the intended concentration.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0897190013482332">7</xref>
</sup> The consequences of drug shortages for critically ill and oncology patients extend beyond adverse drug events and will be described in greater detail below.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0897190013482332">
<title>Clinical Implications of Drug Shortages on Sedation</title>
<p>Critically ill patients are particularly vulnerable to drug shortages due to the dire need of certain medications, the timeliness in which they are needed, and the lack of adequate therapeutic alternatives. Recent notable shortages of medications used in the intensive care unit (ICU) include propofol, succinylcholine, vecuronium, nicardipine, 23.4% sodium chloride, epinephrine, norepinephrine, neostigmine, amikacin, intravenous trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and foscarnet.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190013482332">1</xref>
</sup>
<sup>,</sup>
<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0897190013482332">8</xref>
</sup> Unfortunately, although the impact of drug shortages on patient care in critically ill patients is likely apparent, it may be difficult to quantify.</p>
<p>The use of therapeutic alternatives may put a patient at increased risk for adverse effects that may have been avoided had the original product been available. For instance, a national shortage of propofol significantly impacted the sedation practices of mechanically ventilated patients in the United States. While there are multiple sedatives available, propofol is the most common, utilized in more than half of the mechanically ventilated patients.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0897190013482332">9</xref>
</sup> However, in 2009, 2 of the 3 US manufacturers of propofol recalled their products creating a critically low supply.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190013482332">1</xref>
</sup>
<sup>,</sup>
<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0897190013482332">10</xref>
</sup> Particulate matter was found in one or more batches of propofol manufactured by Hospira, Inc; and in May 2010, they expanded their recall to all propofol products in customers’ inventories.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190013482332">1</xref>
</sup>
<sup>,</sup>
<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0897190013482332">10</xref>
</sup> Another manufacturer, Teva Pharmaceuticals, discovered microbial contamination in their product and the following summer announced that they would no longer produce propofol.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190013482332">1</xref>
</sup>
<sup>,</sup>
<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0897190013482332">10</xref>
</sup> During this time, only 1 manufacturer was available to meet the demand for the entire US market.<sup>

</sup>
<sup>,</sup>
<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0897190013482332">10</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Ultimately, this resulted in a critical drug shortage forcing institutions to ration available stocks of propofol and utilize alternative sedatives for mechanically ventilated patients, such as benzodiazepines and dexmedetomidine.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0897190013482332">10</xref>
</sup> When compared to propofol in randomized controlled trials, benzodiazepine use is associated with an increased duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU length of stay, delirium, and associated costs.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0897190013482332">11</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0897190013482332"/>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0897190013482332"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0897190013482332">15</xref>
</sup> Dexmedetomidine and propofol provide similar outcomes in terms of duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU length of stay; however, dexmedetomidine is considerably more expensive and is more often discontinued due to lack of efficacy or need for rescue sedation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0897190013482332">16</xref>
</sup> The potential impact of these differences should be anticipated and monitored during a propofol shortage and increased utilization of alternative sedatives.</p>
<p>Considering no equivalent alternative exists for sedation in mechanically ventilated patients, clinical outcomes during the recent propofol shortage were investigated in a retrospective manner in an attempt to quantify the implications of using therapeutic alternatives. Roberts and colleagues conducted a “before” and “after,” retrospective, single-center study comparing the duration of mechanical ventilation in over 250 critically ill patients prior to (before group) and during the propofol shortage (after group).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0897190013482332">17</xref>
</sup> After adjustment for admitting medical service, Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score, and mode of mechanical ventilation, no significant difference was found in the duration of mechanical ventilation between the 2 groups (7% longer in the “after” group, <italic>P</italic> = .35). This occurred despite a significant increase in the use of lorazepam (7% in the “before” group vs 14% in the “after” group, <italic>P</italic> = .04), midazolam (36% vs 73%, respectively, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001), and dexmedetomidine (9% vs 27%, respectively, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001) as well as a significant decrease in the use of propofol (94% in the “before” group vs 15% in the “after” group, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001). Although results from previous prospective randomized controlled trials have shown a reduction in mechanical ventilation with propofol when compared to benzodiazepines, this may be difficult to replicate in a noncontrolled environment.</p>
<p>Similarly, in a retrospective case–control study of post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery patients, Reichert and colleagues investigated the effects of substituting dexmedetomidine for propofol during the nationwide shortage on opioid requirements and time to extubation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0897190013482332">18</xref>
</sup> Opioid requirements at 12 and 24 hours postsurgery, measured as morphine equivalents, were similar between patients who received propofol and dexmedetomidine (10.7 ± 9.1 mg propofol vs 7.6 ± 5.8 mg dexmedetomidine at 12 hours, <italic>P</italic> = .10; and 19.8 ± 13.0 mg vs 17.3 ± 8.2 mg, respectively, at 24 hours, <italic>P</italic> = .37). Time to extubation was also similar between both the groups, 300 minutes in the propofol group and 318 minutes in the dexmedetomidine group, after arrival to the ICU (<italic>P</italic> = .5). However, extrapolation of the results of this study to noncardiac surgery patient populations should be limited, as a majority of cardiac surgery patients require short-term mechanical ventilation that allows clinicians to use dexmedetomidine based on the prescribing information.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0897190013482332">19</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>As the number of drug shortages that impact sedation practices of critically ill patients continues to rise, practitioners will need to become more familiar with therapeutic alternatives and their nuances of use. One of the most common adverse events with sedative agents is oversedation or drug-induced coma.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0897190013482332">20</xref>
</sup> This is more common with benzodiazepine use, as they have longer half-lives and accumulate, especially in the presence of obesity, renal, and/or hepatic dysfunction.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0897190013482332">20</xref>
</sup> Oversedation may result in prolonged intubation, an increased risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia, the development of venous thromboembolism (VTE), delirium, and increased risk of posttraumatic stress disorder.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0897190013482332">20</xref>
</sup>
<sup>,</sup>
<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0897190013482332">21</xref>
</sup> Delirium has been associated with higher mortality, prolonged mechanical ventilation, poor recovery to baseline functional status as well as an increased length of stay.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0897190013482332">20</xref>
</sup> Employing changes in practice, such as sedation administered per protocol, daily interruption of sedation, and selective use when compared to a continuous infusion, may reduce the risk of accumulation with benzodiazepines and, therefore, oversedation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0897190013482332">21</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0897190013482332"/>

</sup> The most important change in practice, however, is the education of practitioners, nurses, and pharmacists about these therapeutic alternatives and their differences. Prospectively addressing potential adverse drug reactions and appropriate monitoring will also aid in the development of safeguards to prevent unforeseen events.</p>

<title>Clinical Implications of Drug Shortages in Oncology</title>
<p>With an estimated 1.6 million people diagnosed with cancer last year, the shortage of chemotherapeutic agents can have detrimental effects.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0897190013482332">25</xref>
</sup> A recently published report estimated that over 500 000 patients are affected annually by oncology drug shortages.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0897190013482332">26</xref>
</sup> From 2010 through August 2011, approximately 80% of the drug shortages were sterile injectable medications, with oncology drug products accounting for two-thirds of these medications.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0897190013482332">27</xref>
</sup> The root cause of these shortages is likely multifactorial, including economic concerns, manufacturing delays, disruptions, discontinuations, or industry consolidation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0897190013482332">27</xref>
</sup>
<sup>,</sup>
<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0897190013482332">28</xref>
</sup> When one chemotherapy agent is in short supply or unavailable, it impacts multiple treatment regimens for several types of cancer. For example, doxorubicin, which has been in short supply, is used in the treatment of leukemias, lymphomas, sarcomas, breast, gastric, ovarian, thyroid, small cell lung, and bladder cancers.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190013482332">1</xref>
</sup>
<sup>,</sup>
<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0897190013482332">29</xref>
</sup> Clearly, a shortage of a single chemotherapeutic medication can impact thousands of oncology patients.</p>
<p>Chemotherapy shortages may contribute to adverse patient outcomes associated with the use of alternative agents, for example increased toxicities, decreased efficacy, and elimination of a curative regimen. Leucovorin/fluorouracil or capecitabine are used as first-line regimens to treat colorectal cancer (FOLFOX and XELOX regimens, respectively; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0897190013482332">Table 1</xref>).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0897190013482332">30</xref>
</sup> Due to a short supply of fluorouracil and leucovorin, a provider may select a capecitabine-based regimen. Randomized controlled trials have shown equivalent treatment outcomes with both regimens (overall survival [OS]: XELOX 19.8 months vs FOLFOX-4 19.6 months; HR 1.00; duration of response: 7.6 months vs 7.5 months, respectively; HR 1.00).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0897190013482332">31</xref>
</sup> While there was an increase in grade 3 or 4 neutropenia/granulocytopenia with FOLFOX-4 compared to XELOX (44% vs 7%), XELOX resulted in an increase in grade 3 diarrhea (19% vs 11%) and grade 3 hand-foot syndrome. Other studies have confirmed the increased incidence of grade 3 or 4 diarrhea and hand-foot syndrome with the use of capecitabine.<sup>

</sup> Not only would the use of an alternative treatment regimen lead to inferior patient outcomes (7-year OS of 70.8% with the alternative regimen mechlorethamine, vincristine, procarbazine, prednisone [MOPP] vs 88% with ABVD, the standard of care), but it also may not be a treatment option due to the short supply of several medications.<sup>

</p>
<p>Additionally, drug shortages likely contribute to delays in providing chemotherapy, which can have significant consequences. Untreated disease can result in disease progression, metastatic disease, and a worsened prognosis. In a meta-analysis of patients with advanced colorectal cancer, each 4-week delay in chemotherapy was associated with a 14% decrease in overall survival.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0897190013482332">36</xref>
</sup> Similar implications have also been suggested in breast cancer, where a 3-month delay has been associated with an increase in tumor size, advanced disease, and a poorer long-term prognosis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0897190013482332">37</xref>
</sup> While these studies were not conducted with regard to drug shortages, the results demonstrate the clinical consequences of unavailable or delayed chemotherapy regimens.</p>
<p>The most extreme example of a drug shortage impacting patient outcomes is elimination of a cure. Oncologists face a significant challenge in treating acute myeloid leukemia (AML), where treatment can achieve complete remission in 50% to 70% of the patients with standard chemotherapy.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0897190013482332">38</xref>
</sup> The backbone of AML treatment, cytarabine, has been in shortage since 2010, leaving treatment options that do not include the primary effective drug for these patients.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0897190013482332">38</xref>
</sup> For health care providers who are unable to acquire cytarabine, patients are not likely to achieve a complete remission, as there are no well-studied and effective alternative treatment options that do not include cytarabine.</p>
<p>In response to the nation’s short supply of leucovorin, the NCCN guidelines addressed handling chemotherapy regimens that incorporate leucovorin. The guidelines for colorectal cancer were updated to provide 3 possible approaches: omit leucovorin from the chemotherapy regimen, use levo-leucovorin in place of leucovorin, or use a lower leucovorin dose in all patients.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0897190013482332">30</xref>
</sup> While it is helpful to have updated recommendations to guide treatment, it is important to recognize the therapeutic differences that accompany the recommendations. The clinical data used to support these recommendations came from 3 clinical trials, all of which had distinct patient populations and used leucovorin in treatment regimens that did not include a preferred chemotherapy agent.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0897190013482332">39</xref>

</sup> Oxaliplatin, a chemotherapy agent recommended first line in both the adjuvant setting and for advanced or metastatic disease, was not used in any of the 3 randomized controlled trials. Each study also differed in the dosing of leucovorin, making it difficult to determine an appropriate “low dose” of leucovorin in the treatment of colorectal cancer.<sup>

<p>A limited supply of a medication can lead to difficult ethical dilemmas when medication allocation or resource rationing may be necessary. With a chemotherapy agent in short supply, a health care provider may have to select which patient should receive treatment, the patient with early disease versus the patient with advanced disease, a research patient on a specific protocol versus a nonresearch patient or a pediatric patient versus an adult patient. These treatment challenges may be occurring in health systems across the country.</p>

<title>Lasting Impact on Evidence-Based Pharmacotherapy and Training</title>
<p>The clinical implications of the drug shortage crisis will likely be seen for years to come, with the impact on clinical trials extending beyond the resolution of a drug shortage. Clinical research and the advancement of evidence-based medicine will be delayed as investigational studies are halted due to inability to acquire medications. Likewise, if the standard of care used in a clinical trial is in short supply, there may be protocol changes, violations, or decreased enrollment, as providers are hesitant to enroll a patient in a treatment arm with a medication they are unable to acquire. The Coalition of Cancer Cooperative Group is a nonprofit organization that promotes and facilitates participation in cancer clinical trials.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0897190013482332">42</xref>
</sup> They recently announced that of the more than 400 active cancer clinical trials, roughly 50% include a drug currently in short supply.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0897190013482332">42</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Beyond the implications on clinical research, the training of health care professionals and their educational experience is also impacted by drug shortages. Within all areas of pharmacotherapy, the lack of clinical experience and training with a preferred medication may influence future clinical practices, as the provider may be less familiar with agents they have little clinical experience with.</p>

<title>Federal Response</title>
<p>From a regulatory standpoint, the FDA currently has authority to expedite the regulatory review process of facilities and drug approvals. Additionally, they may allow the importation of foreign drug products not currently approved by the FDA for therapeutic use in the United States.<sup>

</sup> In response to the increasing number of drug shortages, in October 2011, President Obama signed an executive order that granted the FDA authority to require manufacturers to report discontinuations or disruptions in the production of medically necessary products and expedite the regulatory review process of new drug suppliers, manufacturing sites, and manufacturing changes.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0897190013482332">43</xref>
</sup> On January 18, 2012, a newly mandated FDA rule went into effect, requiring manufacturers to provide a 6-month advance notice of manufacturing interruptions or discontinuations.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0897190013482332">44</xref>
</sup> Prior to this mandate, companies were only required to notify the FDA 6 months in advance for discontinuations of sole source or medically necessary products. The FDA is working with the Department of Justice to report any actions that potentiate drug shortages, such as stockpiling or excessive drug pricing.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0897190013482332">43</xref>
</sup> Additionally, there are currently proposed bills in both the House of Representatives and the Senate addressing drug shortages. These bills will require manufacturers to notify the FDA of drug shortages that impact all prescription drugs, rather than limit the notification requirement to medically necessary products. It would also require manufacturers to provide a 6-month notification to the FDA when a manufacturing process is interrupted as well as when a medication is discontinued or withdrawn from the market.<sup>

<title>Management of Drug Shortages</title>
<p>The “ASHP Guidelines on Managing Drug Product Shortages in Hospitals and Health Systems” were published in 2009 in response to the increased concern of the clinical impact drug shortages have on patient care and the enormous resource allocation required to address these drug shortages.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0897190013482332">5</xref>
</sup> These guidelines provide strategies for preventing a shortage from an institutional perspective and recommend a 3-phase approach for managing a current drug shortage: an identification/assessment phase, a preparation phase, and a contingency phase.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0897190013482332">5</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>These recommendations have served as a foundation for institutions in developing management strategies for drug shortages, with each institution incorporating individualized strategies or adaptations to the phases. Our expansion of the phased approach includes a preparation, assessment, contingency, and resolution phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0897190013482332">Figure 2</xref>). Pharmacists should champion the efforts in managing drug shortages; however, it is necessary to have an interdisciplinary focus as drug shortages impact each discipline differently. In the preparation phase, the first step should be the creation of a Drug Shortage Task Force. At minimum, this task force should consist of representatives from physician groups, the pharmacy department, and the nursing department. The task force will communicate with leaders in the pharmacy department to identify departmental roles and responsibilities, develop a drug shortage policy, establish guidelines regarding nontraditional suppliers, identify appropriate personnel for handling drug shortages, and create a plan for resource and personnel allocation, specifically addressing budget concerns.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0897190013482332">5</xref>
</sup> Ideally, the preparation phase should occur prior to a drug shortage.</p>

</fig>
<p>Following the preparation phase, the assessment phase requires significant involvement of the pharmacy department. After a drug shortage is identified and communicated to the appropriate pharmacy personnel, the purchaser will attempt to determine the duration and specifics of the shortage in order to ensure an adequate supply of the drug, while avoiding stockpiling. The delegated patient care clinical pharmacists will work to identify therapeutic alternatives through a thorough review of the pertinent literature. During this process, they will determine the patient populations that will be affected and anticipate the impact on patient care. Once a therapeutic alternative has been identified, the purchaser will then determine the supply status of that alternative. Pharmacy directors, or those delegated, will assess current inventory based on recent usage trends and estimate the time to impact on their health system. Furthermore, an estimate of necessary changes in the distribution and preparation processes will be conducted to identify information system updates that may be needed.</p>
<p>Once the pharmacy department has collected the necessary information, the Drug Shortage Task Force should begin working together to assess the overall impact of the shortage on patient care and develop an action plan.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0897190013482332">5</xref>
</sup> This plan should highlight the therapeutic differences, identify changes in the prescribing and distribution processes, address budgetary considerations, and conduct a risk assessment of the patients affected. The plan, and any additional pertinent changes to practice, should then be used to inform and educate the staff. Physicians, pharmacists, and nurses may each experience changes in medication practices and workflow with therapeutic alternatives. A written or electronic action plan should be provided to appropriate clinical staff containing pertinent details of the drug shortage. As mentioned in the ASHP guidelines, within this phase it is important to establish a cooperative, working relationship with other local health systems.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0897190013482332">5</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>When the implemented changes from the previous phases are inadequate, it may be necessary to consider a contingency phase at which point it is necessary to address potential risk management, hospital liability, and patient prioritization. This includes patient education and communication regarding their treatment, expected outcomes of potential suboptimal therapy as well as communication with a risk management team or legal representative for extenuating circumstances. If a drug shortage is expected to impact a large number of patients, or is likely to continue for an extended period of time, prioritization of drug product may be necessary. If available, national organizations and guidelines could be a resource to identify patient populations with the most need. Unfortunately, most national guidelines do not currently suggest therapeutic alternatives when recommended drugs are in shortage.</p>
<p>The final phase, or resolution phase, occurs when and if a drug shortage has resolved. It is important for the Drug Shortage Task Force to communicate the resolution of the shortage to all staff members so that they are aware and able to resume previous practices. Additionally, the task force should review and reflect on the changes that were made in managing the shortage, with documentation of what occurred and what steps were taken. This will allow for an improved response for future drug shortages.</p>
<p>The phased approach described above is a strategy utilized within our health care network and served as a foundation for the drug shortage policy. The following are specific examples of implementation of a drug shortage policy. To effectively anticipate, prepare for, identify, and track drug shortages within a network while allocating drug resources and avoiding stockpiling, a network drug shortage grid is updated daily. When a shortage is identified, the Drug Shortage Task Force, in conjunction with the appropriate clinical experts from multiple disciplines, assesses the overall impact on patient care and develops an action plan to be disseminated via e-mail through the medical staff office. This action plan includes the following: the drug products affected, reason(s) for the shortage, expected resolution time (if available), current inventory on hand, recommended management strategies, available therapeutic alternatives, the date the action plan goes into effect, and the date of the next anticipated communication. Communication is further expanded with dedicated, standing agenda items at relevant interdisciplinary meetings and a drug shortage document updated weekly that is located on the network intranet Web site. As communication is typically the largest barrier, the combination of these strategies serves to effectively provide multiple venues to share information related to the impact and management strategies of current and resolved drug shortages. Our phased approach and drug shortage policy have allowed for successful management of several recent drug shortages, including sodium bicarbonate, lorazepam, and intravenous multivitamins.</p>

<sec id="section10-0897190013482332">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The mounting number of drug shortages has undoubtedly created a health care crisis. Providing optimal patient care is nearly impossible if the first-line treatment option(s) is unavailable. Nationally, the federal government and the FDA are working toward alleviating and preventing drug shortages. National guidelines and recommendations have been published to aid health systems in managing these crises, but no approach eliminates the clinical implications of a drug shortage. The impact of drug shortages extends beyond the pharmacy department, and an interdisciplinary effort is necessary. The expanded phased approach outlined here provides a consistent, systematic approach for the successful management of drug shortages in an interdisciplinary environment, which we have found to be effective within our health care network. Considering the clinical implications of the drug shortage crisis, we encourage each institution to develop a consistent and systematic approach that would fit within the institutional model and workflow for effective management and communication of drug shortages.</p>
