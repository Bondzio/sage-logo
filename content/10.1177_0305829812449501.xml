<abstract>
<p>The concept of hegemony has regained attention from various theoretical perspectives in International Relations. This article argues that IR-poststructuralism can offer an independent perspective on the production of hegemonies in international politics. Based on IR-poststructuralism and poststructuralist discourse theory, it develops a conceptual framework and an associated methodological approach for the analysis of international hegemonies in concrete discourses. Thereby, the article conceptualises international hegemonies as the creation of a specific type of collective identity while arguing that for hegemonies to emerge, both the creation of an antagonistic Other and a vision of the opposed Self are necessary. The workings of the conceptual framework are illustrated with a comparative reconstruction of United Nations discourses on international terrorism and drug prohibition from 1961 to 2011.</p>

<body>
<p>International terrorism has been considered one of the major threats to worldwide peace and stability for nearly four decades. Debates on a comprehensive convention against terrorism were launched at the level of the United Nations (UN) for the first time in the aftermath of the attacks at the Olympic Games in 1972. Yet, irrespective of various global counter-terrorist measures or the current prevalence of the ‘war on terror’, even today no definition of international terrorism exists as a basis for legitimate international measures to counter terrorism. In contrast to this stands international drug prohibition. Drugs have been deemed a major threat to global peace for almost 50 years. Starting in 1961, a series of UN drug treaties not only defined ‘drugs’, as well as the features of the internationally operating drug dealer, but also established why it is legitimate to fight drugs on a global scale. Terrorism and drugs: two major threats – two different fates.</p>
<p>This article takes these two fates as an empirical starting point to pursue a broader conceptual goal. By approaching the diverging outcomes from a discursive perspective, I seek to develop a poststructuralist framework for analysing the politics of hegemony at the international level. Against the background of the different fates of the two threats, the article asks how specific interpretations of social phenomena become hegemonic and how one can grasp these processes of ‘hegemonialisation’ conceptually and methodologically: How is it possible that in the discourse on drugs a definition and a coherent vision of how to counter drug abuse and what the world would look like without drugs have emerged, whereas the discourse on terrorism is lacking such agreement? Since this article conceives of the emergence of an international hegemony as the production of a new, specific type of collective identity – predominantly antagonistic – as the process of determining a Self and corresponding Other(s), I argue that the establishment of hegemonies is a dual process. This process, firstly, can be conceptualised as the constant <italic>attempt</italic> to antagonise and homogenise the interpretation of an Other. Secondly, at the same time, the process involves the creation of a coherent vision of the Self shared by the agents jointly opposing the Other. This interpretation of the Other and the vision of the Self need to be conceived of as the political consensus among those agents concerned to allow for the adoption of internationally accepted measures.</p>
<p>Yet, why should one engage systematically with the politics of hegemony? For a number of years, ‘hegemony’ has regained popularity in contemporary international discourse.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0305829812449501">1</xref></sup> Indeed, a great number of studies in International Relations (IR) use the term, but the overwhelming majority only refer to the relatively trivial idea of the primacy of the United States in vital security issues,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0305829812449501">2</xref></sup> which is conceptually, empirically and normatively unsatisfying. Furthermore, a conceptual fuzziness underscores the need to engage systematically with hegemony. Despite its central role in IR, hegemony ‘has remained a relatively imprecise and underanalyzed concept’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0305829812449501">3</xref></sup> Moreover, current accounts of hegemony are essentially materialistic, as in ‘international politics the idea that hegemony and power are reducible to coercive resources is a commonly held one’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0305829812449501">4</xref></sup> which gets in the way of acknowledging the power inherent in language and meaning, both producing behaviour in accordance with specific hegemonic practices.</p>
<p>This article’s notion of international hegemony ties in with conceptualisations claiming that hegemonies are far more than power relations based upon coercion capacities embodied by a dominant country. By conceiving of the emergence of hegemony as the production of a new collective identity, as shaping an Other and a corresponding Self, the article stresses struggle and resistance as the starting point. After all, it is a question of power which interpretation or meaning of Self and Other becomes dominant. I argue that, firstly, a discourse theoretical approach opens up space for an alternative, critical conceptualisation of hegemonies in IR. It allows the problematising of the process through which specific interpretations of Self and Other struggle to become hegemonic and, thereby, exposes the normative assumptions that these interpretations rest on. Moreover, problematising the constructions of Self and Other and the links between them uncovers the disciplinary character of this process of hegemonialisation (in terms of creating identities by inclusion and exclusion). Secondly, bringing the IR-poststructuralist concept of identity into the context of poststructuralist discourse theory, predominantly in its variant of the Essex School of Discourse Theory, proves to be highly beneficial for offering a distinct perspective on the constitution of hegemonies in IR. This not only allows the advancing of current IR-poststructuralist conceptions of hegemony, as the founding figures of the Essex School, Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe, explicitly aimed at developing a theory of hegemony.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0305829812449501">5</xref></sup> It also integrates the Essex School’s emphasis ‘on political struggle and deliberation in defining and constituting political communities’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0305829812449501">6</xref></sup> with the problem of difference in identity formation that IR-poststructuralist studies have so convincingly addressed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0305829812449501">7</xref></sup> To develop a discourse theoretical concept of hegemony in IR not in the abstract but in light of a particular problem, the conceptualisation goes hand in hand with a comparative reconstruction of the UN discourses on international terrorism and drug prohibition from 1961 to 2011. Thereby, I hope to bring methodological rigour to the analysis of hegemonies in IR-poststructuralism and also broaden the conceptual and methodological remit of discourse theory, since the latter has been more frequently used to analyse hegemonies within the confines of democracies or nation-states.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0305829812449501">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>In what follows, I discuss the main approaches to hegemony in IR with special emphasis on poststructuralist conceptualisations. The third section outlines current poststructuralist understanding of identity and central discourse theoretical concepts – both crucial to advancing an independent framework on international hegemonies – while the fourth section offers an operationalisation of the framework. As the two UN discourses on terrorism and drugs, which serve to illustrate the operations of the framework, developed long before 1961, the fifth section situates them in their political and historical context. The sixth section offers an operationalisation of the framework, exemplified by a comparative reconstruction of the UN discourses on international terrorism and drug prohibition.</p>
<p>The selection of the UN discourses for the present illustrations followed a distinct conceptual rationale. First and foremost, the focus is on reconstructing the emergence of <italic>international</italic> hegemonies, that is, hegemonies that <italic>claim</italic> global dominance in a specific field (irrespective of whether this is contested). Consequently, this conceptualisation requires a global forum to empirically ground its endeavour. Here, the UN is an ideal candidate, in contrast to regional or national fora.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0305829812449501">9</xref></sup> While the UN might not be the forum for final authoritative decisions on counter-activities against terrorism and drug abuse, it is the only global venue within which key discursive agents struggle to push through their own definitions of terrorism and drugs. After all, a UN consensus on the matter along the lines of a state’s specific understanding promises global, universal legitimacy for particular definitions, impossible to obtain in regional fora. Such legitimacy could be used for justifying anti-terrorist and anti-drug practices to respective national audiences and preclude the accusation of disregarding international legal responsibilities while countering terrorism and drugs.</p>
<p>Secondly, the UN discourses allow for empirically saturated reconstructions to illustrate the theoretical and conceptual argument. Since it is central to the present argument to provide a <italic>comparative</italic> reconstruction of the emergence of international hegemonic formations to exemplify how far the conceptualisation of hegemony as an antagonistic type of collective identity is fruitful, different modes of hegemonic formations needed to be traced in the same context, over a sufficiently long period of time and across at least two different issues. Such comparative insights would be highly difficult to obtain in fora other than the UN. Thirdly, a comparative reconstruction also permits me to address why two issues that have been perceived as major threats to nation-states and global security experienced such different fates. Such a perspective is rarely applied since the bulk of the present IR literature deals with efforts to counter international terrorism or prohibit drugs separately. Yet, explaining the anti-terrorist and anti-drug efforts with reference to the convergence and/or divergence in nation-state preferences and interests, institutional constraints, and/or external factors has yielded contradictory results on why no agreement on the nature of terrorism has been found and why countering drugs has been successful on this point.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0305829812449501">10</xref></sup> In reaction, a growing body of literature regards terrorism and drugs as socially constructed phenomena, and the present article ties in with this assumption.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0305829812449501">11</xref></sup> While these works analyse either terrorism or drugs from a discursive perspective, the present article’s framework on the politics of hegemony offers a comparative view, thus shedding new light on the differences between the handling of terrorism and drugs.</p>
<sec id="section1-0305829812449501">
<title>Current Understandings of Hegemony in IR</title>
<p>The two main approaches offering an explicit conceptualisation of hegemony in IR to date – the theory of hegemonic stability and the neo-Gramscian school of thought – are, albeit to differing degrees, materialistic accounts. Hegemonic stability theory employs the term to explain the origins and functions of the post-1945 international economic order, conceptualising hegemony as a structure organised around a single dominant country – the hegemon – with leadership responsibilities and privileges.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0305829812449501">12</xref></sup> The latter account uses Antonio Gramsci’s understanding of hegemony to offer an alternative perspective by rethinking the prevalent ontological assumptions in IR on world order ‘due to a theory of hegemony that focuses on social forces engendered by changes in the social relations of production, forms of state and world order’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0305829812449501">13</xref></sup> Neo-Gramscians define hegemony as a structure of values and meanings about the nature of the order which, in its turn, pervades the system of states and non-state entities. Although hegemony is a form of dominance, it is also the expression of a broadly based consensus that manifests itself in the acceptance of ideas and is supported by material resources and institutions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0305829812449501">14</xref></sup> While successfully broadening the concept and demonstrating its relevance for international studies, neo-Gramscians still conceive of international hegemonies as stemming from capitalist relations of production, which impedes them from scrutinising hegemonies as genuinely political phenomena. In addition, to systematically assess the emergence as well as the inner workings of hegemonies, the neo-Gramscians themselves consider the development of analytical instruments a research desideratum.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0305829812449501">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>To date, IR-poststructuralist literature on hegemony has dedicated considerable space to the study of subjugated knowledge and resistance. Here, international hegemony is interpreted variously as a dominant discourse juxtaposed to a marginalised one,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0305829812449501">16</xref></sup> as a discipline set producing desired behaviour in accordance with the objectives of the hegemony,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0305829812449501">17</xref></sup> or as a discursive framework determining the general conditions of a specific way of life, constructing ideational mindsets and nation-state identities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0305829812449501">18</xref></sup> While highly instructive for the present article, these writings did not aim at coherently conceptualising the notion of hegemony and its inner workings. A smaller, but burgeoning, body of writings has used the Essex School to analyse international politics. In general, however, they employ only certain concepts of the approach (such as empty signifiers, nodal points or the logics of equivalence and difference)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0305829812449501">19</xref></sup> but not the entire framework. Recently, the Essex School has been more comprehensively introduced in to IR. In the latest analyses, the idea of a discursive hegemony served to discern ‘what role a “leader” can play within the structural confines of hegemony’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0305829812449501">20</xref></sup> to analyse the actorness of the European Union,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0305829812449501">21</xref></sup> and to trace ‘how “Iraq” was (re)constructed as a threat through the war on terror’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0305829812449501">22</xref></sup> With its clear focus on the processes of the constitution and persistence of hegemony, the present article integrates and builds on these valuable insights but pushes their application of discourse theory in IR further, firstly, by offering a comprehensive operationalisation of central discourse theoretical concepts while preserving their interconnectedness, leading to a framework of international hegemony missing from the current literature. Secondly, by combining IR-poststructuralist insights on identity and hegemony with discourse theoretical concepts, the article develops an integrative framework to investigate the processes of hegemonialisation at the international level. It is to this combination that I will now turn.</p>

<title>Hegemony and Identity in Discourse Theory and IR-Poststructuralism</title>
<p>Many IR-poststructuralists share with discourse theorists crucial commitments – most importantly, a specific understanding of language, discourse and the role of contingency. To start with, language does not merely reflect reality but constructs reality: by speaking, something is done, for instance, in betting, giving a promise or naming a ship.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0305829812449501">23</xref></sup> Thus, a material ‘reality’ of course exists; however, there is no objective or ‘true’ meaning beyond linguistic representations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0305829812449501">24</xref></sup> Discourse is conceived in analogy, as it is constitutive for the construction of knowledge and the constitution of objects. While there are different notions of discourse, the Essex School conceptualises discourse as a ‘structured totality’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0305829812449501">25</xref></sup> a system of meaningful practices, which relates differences to establish their meaning. In other words, the meanings and the identities of objects and subjects are formed through a system of practices embodied by discourse. These practices are routinised forms of human and societal reproduction, which are material and articulatory at the same time, since ‘human beings constantly engage in the process of linking together different elements of their social lives in these continuous and projective sequences of human action’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0305829812449501">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>This constant process of linking hints at the role of contingency in the Essex School. Although being defined as a totality, discourse is a structure penetrated by contingency and temporality, marked by ruptures and breaches because the relation between differences can constantly change and meaning is organised differently. Attempts to fix meaning around closed structures are in vain: ‘neither absolute fixity nor absolute non-fixity is possible’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0305829812449501">27</xref></sup> However, to allow for identity and social formation, the Essex School argues that meaning needs to be <italic>partially</italic> fixed; that is, partial fixations bind the very flow of differences temporally. Such fixations are achieved as any discourse situates itself as ‘an attempt to dominate the field of discursivity’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0305829812449501">28</xref></sup> and subjects search for a constitutive decision articulating social meaning in one way rather than another. With regard to international counter-terrorist policies and drug prohibition measures, such conceptualisations of language, discourse and contingency imply, on the one hand, that these policies are based on specific, contingent linguistic representations of the security problem they want to address and on specific, partially fixed constructions of Self and Other. On the other hand, these linguistic representations fuel the actions of the respective countermeasures by making them intelligible and legitimate. This is what I mean by conceptualising practices to be articulatory and material at the same time.</p>
<p>In the Essex School, hegemony is conceptualised against this background inasmuch as it builds on Gramsci’s claim that the articulation of collective wills takes place in the midst of political struggles within state, economy and civil society. For Gramsci, hegemony is the genuine political moment marked by an ideological struggle which tries to unify economic, political and intellectual objectives.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0305829812449501">29</xref></sup> Hegemony is no longer confined to the attempt to form a political alliance but aims at the total fusion of different objectives, involving the creation of a collective will. The latter is forged via an ideological struggle which, according to Mouffe, is ‘a process of <italic>disarticulation-rearticulation</italic> of given ideological elements in a struggle between two hegemonic principles to appropriate these elements’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0305829812449501">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>As such, hegemony is a discursive phenomenon produced through specific relations of forces. Typically, these relations articulated in hegemonic practices organise the discursive space by drawing boundaries and creating identities. In the Essex School context, such shaping of the discursive terrain is encompassed by the <italic>logic of equivalence</italic>. While discursive elements are per se different, the logic of equivalence produces ‘equivalential differences’. To explain: <italic>a,b,c</italic> are equivalent with regard to something identical underlying them all; thus, <italic>a,b,c</italic> are equivalent (But not identical!) with respect to <italic>z</italic>. This ‘something identical’ is termed the ‘general equivalent’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0305829812449501">31</xref></sup> By contrast, the <italic>logic of difference</italic> encompasses the opposite movement as it extenuates the equivalential ties between elements, that is, it disperses hegemonic formations and disintegrates current identities. The logic relates discursive elements while preserving their difference – indeed, difference makes them conceivable as elements: <italic>a</italic> is different from <italic>b,b</italic> from <italic>c</italic> and so on. Still, both logics ‘cannot do with or without each other’, as a certain degree of difference is conditional to establish equivalential chains. One is diluted by what the other is trying to fix, but none of the logics dominates a discourse completely as only partial fixations are possible.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0305829812449501">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>Yet, to pursue my argument further, it is necessary to establish a link between hegemony and the article’s relational concept of identity, which states that in the process of identity construction, a Self and corresponding Other(s) are created. While the terminology of a ‘Self’ is rarely employed in the Essex School context, (which rather speaks of the ‘subject’), ties with the relational conceptualisation of identity in IR-poststructuralism are obvious when Laclau claims that ‘[t]here is no way that a particular group living in a wider community can live a monadic existence – on the contrary, part of the definition of its own identity is the construction of a complex and elaborated system of relations with other groups’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0305829812449501">33</xref></sup> This clearly resonates with the IR-poststructuralist thought of difference being a requirement built into the logic of identity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0305829812449501">34</xref></sup> However, IR-poststructuralism has expended some energy trying to outline that speaking of Self and antagonistic Other(s) captures only half the story since the antagonistic Other is ‘often situated within a more complicated set of identities’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0305829812449501">35</xref></sup> Identity construction produces varying degrees of otherness and does not necessarily depend upon a juxtaposition to a radically threatening Other.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0305829812449501">36</xref></sup> Still, the treatment of antagonistic and non-antagonistic Others involves some ‘combination of hierarchy, eradication, assimilation or expulsion’ – and in the moment of a blocked identity ‘the self might be driven by the desire to move from a relationship of mutuality and interdependence to one of autonomy and dominance’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0305829812449501">37</xref></sup> These dynamics show that in IR-poststructuralism, identities are fragmented and can only be partially fixed: identity ‘does not signal that stable core of the self, unfolding from the beginning to end through all the vicissitudes of history without change’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0305829812449501">38</xref></sup> On the contrary, the discursive nature of identity always allows for alternative constructions against which other identity notions are protected and defended: identities are subject to constant (re)writing in the sense of inscribing a particular meaning so as to render more permanent that which is originally contingent.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0305829812449501">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>By taking into account these congruent conceptualisations of identity being based on difference in the Essex School and IR-poststructuralism, I argue that international hegemonies are about creating a collective ‘Self’ juxtaposed to its antagonistic Other, that is, that which the Self deems culpable of blocking its desired identity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0305829812449501">40</xref></sup> Central to this claim are the operations of the logic of equivalence: modelling the discursive topography by outlining what a number of elements have in common <italic>and</italic> drawing frontiers goes hand in hand with separating a discursive space into at least two diametrically opposed entities. In hegemonic relations, the identities constructed are distinct from identities emerging in other contexts (for instance, between cooperation partners).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0305829812449501">41</xref></sup> Identity construction in the context of hegemonies is a process soaked in power, since the entities created by the logic of equivalence are separated by an antagonistic frontier and are constructed as antagonistic camps. Thus, the logic makes ‘reference to an “us–them” axis: two or more elements can be substituted for each other with reference to a common negation or threat’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0305829812449501">42</xref></sup> Indeed, the joint project that the logic of equivalence links elements into consists of countering a common enemy in order to achieve the vision of a world which is blocked by the presence of the Other. According to the article’s conceptualisation of hegemony and identity, this is when a Self and an Other are created – by outlining that elements are not equivalent in terms of sharing a positive property but in terms of having a <italic>common enemy</italic>. And as this Self considers its identity as blocked by the Other, the latter appears to be responsible for the failure of the Self to achieve its ‘full’ identity. The point is not that the Self is ‘nothing’ because it cannot be a full presence of itself. Rather, the political actions of the Self will be shaped by the idea that the annihilation of the enemy will permit the Self to become the fully constituted identity it seeks to be.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0305829812449501">43</xref></sup> A typical assertion in this respect would be: ‘if we only eliminated terrorism, the world would be a peaceful and safe place’.</p>
<p>To summarise, integrating the insights of the Essex School on the close link between hegemony and antagonism and the IR-poststructuralist concept of relational identities proved essential for the article’s central aim to develop a poststructuralist framework for analysing the politics of hegemony. The integration of both approaches brings about the central ‘ingredients’ of the framework and remedies the deplored fuzziness of the concept of hegemony in the current IR literature. Consequently, the article conceptualises an international hegemony as the production of a specific type of identity: hegemonic practices dichotomise the discursive space by conferring a particular meaning upon antagonistic poles, thereby creating a Self and its antagonised Other(s). However, a Self is as much forged by the construction of the Other(s) as by the consensual promise of a different world within which those discursive agents who confront the antagonistic Other regard themselves as non-antagonistic while sharing a consensus on the evil quality of the antagonistic Other. This twofold process forms the article’s central argument: firstly, the emergence and persistence of hegemonies are dependent upon constant attempts to homogenise the interpretation of an antagonistic Other. Secondly, at the same time, the process involves the creation of a cohesive vision of the Self shared by the discursive agents jointly opposing the Other. This interpretation of the Other and the vision of the Self need to be conceived of as the basis of a political consensus by the agents concerned to allow for the adoption of internationally accepted policies.</p>

<title>Operationalising the Construction of Hegemonies</title>
<p>To grasp hegemonic operations, I draw upon the logic of equivalence and the logic of difference outlined above. However, while the two logics explain the overall ordering of the discursive space, they are not precise enough to account for the establishment of hegemonies in concrete discourses. In order to gain a detailed understanding of this process, methodological tools need to be developed to analyse the discursive moves constructing a particular antagonism, a Self and ultimately a hegemony.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0305829812449501">44</xref></sup> It is necessary to adjust both logics to the analysis of a concrete discourse by reconstructing <italic>hegemonic strategies</italic>. While this will be done through an Essex School perspective, a coherent conceptualisation of the notion of strategy is lacking therein. Apart from a few references in Laclau and Mouffe’s <italic>Hegemony and Socialist Strategy</italic>, the notion has rarely been used,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0305829812449501">45</xref></sup> and no efforts have been made to theorise strategy and apply it in concrete analyses.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0305829812449501">46</xref></sup> Therefore, I will develop my own account of hegemonic strategies as the product of a deductive–inductive procedure: they stem as much from my reading of the Essex School as from the reconstruction of the particularities of the two UN discourses under scrutiny and, therefore, are as much theoretically inspired as empirically grounded.</p>
<p>To integrate the notion of strategy into a poststructuralist framework of hegemony, I will conceptualise strategies in light of the notion of the subject in the Essex School by focusing on two central insights.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0305829812449501">47</xref></sup> This best demonstrates that there is no need to resort to a self-conscious subject to develop an understanding of strategy satisfying the requirements of a discourse theoretical approach. So, firstly, speaking of strategies in the present context does not imply the presence of an intentional subject. Strategies – as well as the specific structure or situation in which they are applied – materialise only when they are employed, and at the same time interrupt the spatialised structure in which they are used. However, they do not exist outside of structure: in politics, there is no given ‘theoretical set’ of strategies to which one can resort as strategies are always contingent on power relations. A subject may have intentions in mind whenever a strategic intervention is made, yet the properties and effects of the strategy it employs will depend on many other factors: strategy is never simply a function of intention. Strategies seek to break up a structure of discursive elements in order to rearrange these elements and to thereby achieve ‘better’ solutions that facilitate the envisioned fulfilment of society, that is, realising the vision of it.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0305829812449501">48</xref></sup></p>
<p>Secondly, according to the Essex School, the subject is always a failing subject. In hegemonic relations, the subject’s condition of possibility is antagonism, because the subject identifies with some project of fullness that is opposed to the structure. In other words, in the face of its blocked identity, the subject undergoes a process of (re-)identification.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0305829812449501">49</xref></sup> However, as antagonism is constitutive, no project of fullness, no vision, will ever be able to prevail over it. The full identity of the subject can never be attained, thus rendering it a continuously failing subject. According to this understanding, strategy is made possible by antagonism and at the same time aims at overcoming antagonism. This latter goal cannot be achieved. All strategies ultimately fail, as they are never successful in bringing about the full society.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0305829812449501">50</xref></sup></p>
<p>Not all strategies are beneficial for the establishment of a hegemonic order. Depending on their impact on the construction of hegemonies at the international level, the multitude of potential hegemonic strategies can be differentiated into <italic>productive hegemonic</italic> and <italic>counter-hegemonic</italic> strategies. While the former encompass strategies conducive to the emergence of hegemonies, strategies of the latter kind are concerned with their circumvention. Both types are developed by means of the logics outlined above: following the logic of equivalence, productive hegemonic strategies arrange discursive elements so as to promote the goal, the aims and the objective of a hegemony, whereas counter-hegemonic strategies breathe the logic of difference and thwart these aims. Counter-hegemonic strategies are called counter-<italic>hegemonic</italic> since they constitute attempts to replace a particular hegemony with a different hegemonic order (thus, they are as much counter-hegemonic as they are productive). However, they recede into the background as the present article aims at developing a framework for analysing the politics of hegemony and its focus is on the establishment and persistence of international hegemonies and less on their contestation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0305829812449501">51</xref></sup> Focusing on productive hegemonic strategies and using the logic of equivalence as central theoretical inspiration allow the splitting (For purely analytical purposes!) of the logic into three strategies: establishing an antagonistic frontier, universalisation of subjects and representation. This provides a fine-grained heuristic for the ensuing analysis. But before illustrating the operations of these strategies by reconstructing comparatively the UN discourses on international drug prohibition and terrorism, I will situate both discourses within their wider historical context.</p>

<title>Shifts of Meaning: The History of International Drug Prohibition and Global Anti-terrorism Efforts</title>
<p>We presently witness a specific interpretation of what the drug problem is about and how it should be fought. Drugs, however, were only gradually construed as a danger; they have not been a problem, they <italic>became</italic> one. This also holds for terrorism; it has not always been understood in the way we conceive of terrorism today. Bringing in the historical context of both discourses elucidates not only the contingency of hegemonic formations but also how far societal and political struggle has provoked or hindered partial fixations of dominant meanings and silenced alternative ways to deal with terrorism and drugs.</p>
<p>Looking into the history of drug prohibition, one realises that the familiar interpretation of drugs (understood mainly as psychoactive or mind-altering substances) as illicit and their use as deviant represents a shift in meaning. Individuals have always used drugs to change their state of consciousness; drugs have been consumed in various societies for thousands of years and their consumption played an important socio-cultural role (i.e. for medicinal, ritual or recreational purposes).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0305829812449501">52</xref></sup> Around the eve of the 20th century, the interpretation of drugs as illicit and their trade as a global problem gained ground. According to pertinent literature, the United States played a crucial role in international drug prohibition. Due to external events (US acquisition of the Philippines in 1898 where the US found that opium smoking was problematic) and internal issues (successful pressure from domestic moral anti-opium entrepreneurs),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0305829812449501">53</xref></sup> the US initiated the convening of an international opium commission which met in Shanghai in 1909 and which was followed by a number of international meetings.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0305829812449501">54</xref></sup> Thus, when in 1961 UN debates on the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs began, the interpretation of drugs as illicit had begun to supersede alternative meanings.</p>
<p>While the remit of the Single Convention encompassed natural drugs, the 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances and the 1972 <italic>Conference to Consider Amendments to the Single Convention</italic> on Narcotic Drugs extended the prohibitionist system to include synthetic drugs. During the 1980s, the growing drug traffic spurred the elaboration of the 1988 UN Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances. UN involvement in the expansion of international drug control continued with the 1998 General Assembly Special Session on Drugs. Other international organisations followed suit: for example, from the 1990s onwards, the EU began to develop its anti-drug policies, with the establishment of European anti-drug action plans and strategies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0305829812449501">55</xref></sup> Today, the UN drug prohibition regime is accepted worldwide: currently, 183 states are parties to the 1961 and 1971 conventions, and 185 states to the 1988 convention.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0305829812449501">56</xref></sup> Overall, the 1961 agreement globalised a specific interpretation of drugs (as illicit) and consolidated this interpretation with two further treaties, and despite contemporary contestation of its supply-oriented approach (in particular with regard to addiction and consumption), this interpretation still stands. How this came about will be reconstructed after a brief look into the history of the terrorism discourse.</p>
<p>According to the common reading, the word ‘terrorism’ dates back to the French Revolution, when it was originally used in a positive sense by the Jacobins, a radical faction under the lead of Robespierre. Here, <italic>terreur</italic> designated a state policy of terror, ordering mass executions of suspected traitors to the revolution.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0305829812449501">57</xref></sup> However, once the proponents of Robespierre turned against him, they accused him of <italic>terrorisme</italic>, a word that suggested illegal conduct. By the late 19th century, the term <italic>terrorist</italic> became more strongly associated with its opposite, anti-state violence, when movements like anarchism were regarded as terrorism,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0305829812449501">58</xref></sup> but the Second World War is considered to set the scene for what is nowadays called ‘modern’ or international terrorism. After the war, the stance emerged that civilians could be legitimate targets of aggression, and during the colonial struggles from the 1940s to the early to mid-1960s, Western European governments experienced for the first time attacks inspired by programmes of systematic terrorism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-0305829812449501">59</xref></sup> From the 1970s, in particular, Western European states witnessed a period of revolutionary left-wing terrorism, whereas since the 1990s, the world has spoken of transnational terrorism as perpetrated in various Al-Qaida attacks. These attacks, above all 11 September 2001, and the reaction to them (the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq) dominate the contemporary discourse on international terrorism.</p>
<p>Attempts to define international terrorism do not reach as far back as those to globally prohibit drugs. The first (inconclusive) attempts to deal with terrorism on a global basis emerged in the 1930s under the aegis of the League of Nations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-0305829812449501">60</xref></sup> But it was only after the terrorist attack on Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympic Games that attempts to define international terrorism were set out at the level of the UN.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-0305829812449501">61</xref></sup> Quickly, the General Assembly (GA) established an Ad Hoc Committee On International Terrorism. Its main task was to develop a legal definition of international terrorism as part of a comprehensive convention on the same matter. The committee debated until 1979, when it refrained from demanding the renewal of its mandate without agreement on a definition – major bones of contention were the question of whether to include issues of self-determination and national liberation in the remit of an anti-terrorism convention.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-0305829812449501">62</xref></sup> In the years that followed, the UN pursued an ‘inductive approach’:<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-0305829812449501">63</xref></sup> as of today, 14 UN conventions have addressed diverse facets of international terrorism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-0305829812449501">64</xref></sup> Yet, they have not led to a more coherent view of the problem, since most agreements neither explain why these offences are considered as manifestations of international terrorism nor attempt to define terrorism comprehensively.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-0305829812449501">65</xref></sup></p>
<p>After the end of the Cold War, disagreements about the nature of terrorism softened to a certain extent, visible in UN General Assembly Resolution 49/60 (1994) – most importantly because the issues of self-determination and liberation movements had receded into the background. In 1999, the Ad Hoc Committee restarted work on a comprehensive convention on international terrorism. Although after the attacks of 11 September 2001 a breakthrough seemed in sight, the resumed attempts to reach a comprehensive convention remained inconclusive due, among other issues, to the question about the nature of state terrorism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-0305829812449501">66</xref></sup> And despite various resolutions by different UN institutions<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-0305829812449501">67</xref></sup>–most importantly the support for the definition produced by the UN Security Council in its resolution 1556 (2004); the 2006 Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy by the GA (representing the first agreement on a common strategic and operational approach to fight terrorism); and the fact that a considerable number of states have proclaimed a global ‘war on terror’, leading to interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-0305829812449501">68</xref></sup> – these developments have not led to a shared understanding of terrorism at the international level. The following reconstruction will trace the moments of disagreement and consensus within the UN debates on a comprehensive convention on terrorism, while debates are still under way at the time of writing (May 2012).</p>

<title>Reconstructing International Hegemonies in the UN Discourses on Terrorism and Drugs</title>
<p>In the following analysis, I will concentrate on the above-mentioned three productive hegemonic strategies: establishing an antagonistic frontier, universalisation of subjects and representation. They are best suited to laying open the operations leading to the (non-)emergence of hegemonies which are crucial to the article’s purpose of establishing a poststructuralist framework for analysing international hegemonies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69-0305829812449501">69</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="section6-0305829812449501">
<title>Establishing an Antagonistic Frontier</title>
<p>Looking into the concrete discourses, one discerns constant attempts to dichotomise the discursive space and create enemies. ‘Drugs had become a scourge of humanity’ and are posing a serious threat to ‘the political and economic stability of the international community as a whole’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn70-0305829812449501">70</xref></sup> Since drugs and drug trafficking are endangering civilisation through a ‘drug holocaust’, ‘everything must be done … against the evils of drugs’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn71-0305829812449501">71</xref></sup> and ‘humanity’s war on drugs’ is essential to survive.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn72-0305829812449501">72</xref></sup> Building from the outset on the seldom questioned illegality of drugs, the international discourse on drug prohibition is full of such articulations, which constitute drugs, the internationally organised drug dealers or the individual dealer as antagonistic Other. The dealers are ‘notorious smugglers’ who should be subjected to ‘severe penalties’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn73-0305829812449501">73</xref></sup> and the international drug ‘barons’ – the ‘kingpins of the international traffic’ – are ‘sophisticated gangsters who operated the drugs traffic’, paying ‘no attention to country, religion or flag’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn74-0305829812449501">74</xref></sup> Precisely these moves are encompassed by the productive hegemonic strategy <italic>establishing an antagonistic frontier</italic>, which aims at dichotomising the discursive space by separating a chain of equivalence from the negativity that threatens the subjects of the chain. It indicates the attempt to sharpen and homogenise the interpretation of the antagonistic drugs Other.</p>
<p>However, this production of an antagonistic frontier is not without difficulties; disagreements arose with regard to the drug addict and user. Antagonistic othering is quite obvious when addicts and users are considered the culprits of fostering the global drug trade, in particular in the eyes of producer countries: ‘Demand was the decisive factor in drug trafficking. Consequently, the countries where demand was high must do everything in their power to curb consumption and thus reduce the incentive for production and trafficking.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn75-0305829812449501">75</xref></sup> However, consumption is always considered as only one side of the problem: ‘a legal instrument which would enable activities in the areas of consumption, production and illicit traffic to be combated simultaneously and on an equal footing’ is called for, since ‘[j]oint action bringing together consumer, producer and transit countries was required’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn76-0305829812449501">76</xref></sup> Antagonistic othering is also prevalent when addicts and consumers are constructed as criminals: they need to obtain money to satisfy their vice, spread their ‘morbid habit’ and most often become – if they are not already – drug dealers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn77-0305829812449501">77</xref></sup> Using drugs ‘produces anti-social behaviour which was a threat to the whole community’; addicts are ‘both liars and active proselytizers’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn78-0305829812449501">78</xref></sup> ‘psychopaths’ who spread illnesses such as AIDS.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn79-0305829812449501">79</xref></sup> However, other voices construct the addict and the user as sick people in ‘need of medical care’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn80-0305829812449501">80</xref></sup> or as ‘victims’ of their circumstances with a right to rehabilitation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn81-0305829812449501">81</xref></sup> In this interpretation, addiction is the culprit from which the addict and user needs to be isolated in order to return to society: addiction to drugs is comprehended as a ‘disease of will’ since ‘an addict who had given up his morbid habit might easily resume it’, which means that the individual is responsible for her disease because she does not sufficiently struggle to resist the ‘overpowering desire to continue using drugs’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn82-0305829812449501">82</xref></sup> Yet, whether addicts and users are considered as criminals responsible for keeping the drug trade alive, as medical, psychological cases or as victims of circumstances depends on the stance towards the individual addict and user – it does <italic>not</italic> alter the consensual stance towards drugs in general, since they remain unanimously considered as the evil in the context of ‘universal’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn83-0305829812449501">83</xref></sup> addiction and consumption. Thus, as long as one consumes drugs or is addicted to them for whatever reason, one is equally considered part of the antagonistic Other, just as drug lords, dealers and drugs in general are.</p>
<p>In casting a first comparing glance at the discourse on terrorism, a similar consensual picture about the antagonistic Other seems to emerge. Terrorists employ ‘indiscriminate’ violence, and this ‘indiscriminate killing of innocent civilians could not be justified by any cause’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn84-0305829812449501">84</xref></sup> Wrapped up in a language of demonisation and war – terrorism is an ‘evil’, ‘barbarous’ and ‘heinous’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn85-0305829812449501">85</xref></sup> – it is constructed as a voracious hydra whose nine mouths disgorge an endless series of attacks. As a result, the notion of international terrorism is gradually emptied to the point where it can only be defined as barbaric, as a ‘threat to the civilised world’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn86-0305829812449501">86</xref></sup> and a ‘threat to international peace and security’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn87-0305829812449501">87</xref></sup> Consequently, to fight terrorism is ‘the war in which the international community [is] organized’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn88-0305829812449501">88</xref></sup></p>
<p>This, however, is only half the story as the UN discourse on international terrorism is far from yielding a coherent picture – particularly during the 1970s but also today despite contemporary consensual moments. Among the many articulations heterogenising the interpretation of the terrorist Other, the demand to take the underlying causes of terrorism into account stands out. In 1972, the title of agenda item 92 changed from ‘Measures to prevent terrorism and other forms of violence which endanger or take innocent human lives or jeopardise fundamental freedoms’ to the following lengthy formulation that explicitly states potential reasons for terrorism:
<disp-quote>
<p>Measures to prevent international terrorism which endangers or takes innocent human lives or jeopardizes fundamental freedoms, and study of the underlying causes of those forms of terrorism and acts of violence which lie in misery, frustration, grievance and despair and which cause some people to sacrifice human lives, including their own, in an attempt to effect radical changes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn89-0305829812449501">89</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Associating terrorism with ‘innocent’ causes and relating these to a number of other problems turns terrorism into one (serious) issue among others, thereby stripping it of its unique quality. This opens up the possibility of justifying violence with reference to unfortunate situations that individuals seek to alter, constructing terrorism as the ‘last resort’ of those that have no other alternative but to ‘resort to … terrorist attacks on the civilian population’ to defend themselves.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn90-0305829812449501">90</xref></sup> Accordingly, subjects calling for a study of the underlying causes of terrorism differentiate between two forms of violence: an ‘acceptable’ type, the causes of which are comprehensible, and a type which cannot be tolerated because it does not stem from misery, grievance and despair. Only the latter counts as international terrorism; understanding the causes implies an Other with ‘faults and quirks’ but an Other that deserves a certain degree of empathy. Yet, early on in the second round, the title of the agenda item shifted back to ‘Measures to eliminate international terrorism’, which indicates that the request to study the underlying causes has been watered down.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn91-0305829812449501">91</xref></sup></p>
<p>Alongside the underlying causes, further articulations heterogenise the picture of international terrorism: the hydra terrorism is not only a villain but simultaneously associated with national liberation movements, the right of peoples to self-determination, Western wartime resistance or with Islam and state terrorism. These associations are fiercely repudiated, for instance when it is claimed that ‘the fight for self-determination of oppressed peoples … did not fall within the purview of international terrorism’, since the movements are ‘the struggle of peoples for their national identity’ and, therefore, those subjects can only comply with a ‘definition of international terrorism [that] would not include the just struggles of liberation movements’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn92-0305829812449501">92</xref></sup> As outlined above, the issues of self-determination and liberation movements have receded into the background in the debates at the beginning of the 21st century, but it is now adamantly denied that the causes of terrorism lie in specific cultures or religions. Today, any insinuation that terrorism might be linked to a particular religion – read Islam – is repelled: terrorism ‘should not be associated with any specific race, religion or culture’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn93-0305829812449501">93</xref></sup> as ‘terrorism was antithetical to the teachings of Islam, which advocated peace, tolerance, non-violence and harmony’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn94-0305829812449501">94</xref></sup> Therefore, ‘the defamatory campaigns against Islam’ needed to end.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn95-0305829812449501">95</xref></sup></p>
<p>This pattern of inclusion/exclusion based on a contradictory classification of specific elements such as national liberation movements as either ‘terrorist’ or ‘non-terrorist’ points to a general trend of differentiating the picture of the terrorist Other. Such dynamics impede the construction of a clear-cut frontier between terrorism and the subjects wishing to fight it. Overall, the reconstruction of an antagonistic frontier and of an Other that is made responsible for the blocking of the identity of the Self in the two discourses yields different results. While the UN discourse on drug prohibition is marked by an unambiguous antagonistic frontier and a homogeneous interpretation of the drugs Other as antagonistic and threatening, the terrorist Other remains heterogeneous, obscure and contentious.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0305829812449501">
<title>Universalisation of Subjects</title>
<p>From the outset, the UN discourse on drug prohibition pursued the goal of freeing humankind from its ‘bondage to narcotics’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn96-0305829812449501">96</xref></sup> Humanity and the international community are constructed as suffering from drugs and their effects, and as long as narcotics are abused, the world will not be a peaceful and healthy place. In consequence, it is necessary to ‘create a society free from drug abuse and … illicit traffic’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn97-0305829812449501">97</xref></sup> This articulation of a fundamental lack is embedded in a range of demands aimed at healing the lack through the realisation of a drug-free world. It clearly echoes the interpretation of drug traffic, consumption and addiction as antagonistic Other referred to above: they are the vice from which the individual can be separated, that is, drugs are the ‘parasite’ that impedes the individual consumer or addict becoming part of the drug-free world. To free the world from drugs, the international community needs to prohibit and ultimately abolish drugs and agree on a ‘universally acceptable’ and ‘essential’ international drug control to dry up the traffic since the control would work as ‘an effective instrument serving the interests of the entire world’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn98-0305829812449501">98</xref></sup> It is this undisputed necessity of international drug control that turns it into the general equivalent needed for establishing a collective Self opposed to the drugs Other: there is a consensus among the subjects that international drug control is desirable and necessary.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn99-0305829812449501">99</xref></sup> Highlighting this consensus equalises differential agents, universalising and aligning those subjects that are in favour of drug control and aiming at a drug-free world. Thus, subjects are considered universal (i.e. equivalent) with regard to ‘something underlying them all’, and this universalisation establishes a chain of equivalence by stressing what they all have in common:<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn100-0305829812449501">100</xref></sup> a movement captured by the productive hegemonic strategy <italic>universalisation of subjects</italic>.</p>
<p>Again, at first glance the international discourse on terrorism seems to reveal a similar picture. When the UN debates were launched in 1972, delegations highlighted that terrorism ‘was above all a condemnation of international society’; it is the task of the world to confront this threat in a ‘concerted effort’, and until today, ‘cooperation was the most efficient way of moving forward’ in the fight against terrorism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn101-0305829812449501">101</xref></sup> From 1972 onwards, the ultimate vision became ‘a world free of terrorism’. Only this would counteract the lack of freedom and peace that the world was experiencing: without terrorism the world would be a safer place.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn102-0305829812449501">102</xref></sup> Moreover, ‘terrorism would fail when global stability, based on prosperity, peace and a culture of human rights and tolerance for all, was established’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn103-0305829812449501">103</xref></sup> But while the urgency of the fight against terrorism is so vigorously expressed, it is at the same time embedded in a mesh of specific reservations and restrictions. Most importantly, delegations indicate that they could only agree on a specific way to fight terrorism (either investigate, first, its underlying causes and then devise concrete measures or the other way round) and only accept a particular type of definition – and here we find definitions which are more often than not diametrically opposed to the suggestions of other delegations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn104-0305829812449501">104</xref></sup></p>
<p>Since the mid-1990s, issues like self-determination and liberation movements have lost their contentiousness. Instead, contemporary debates struggle with the question of whether terrorism is religious in nature and, most importantly, with the issue of state terrorism. ‘[T]errorists included not only those who committed terrorist acts but also those who harboured terrorists’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn105-0305829812449501">105</xref></sup> and ‘state action to enforce domestic policies by terror might endanger the maintenance of international peace and security, and might thus become international terrorism’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn106-0305829812449501">106</xref></sup> Accordingly, it is requested that ‘[s]tates must ensure that their territories were not used for terrorist installations or training camps or for the preparation or organization of terrorist acts to be committed against other States or their citizens’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn107-0305829812449501">107</xref></sup> since the world will only be able to overcome terrorism when ‘those powers [that are accused of state terrorism] cease … to resort to expedients and to act in accordance with their special interests’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn108-0305829812449501">108</xref></sup> Both issues are still hampering a shared, consensual understanding of what terrorism is about and embed the goal of fighting terrorism so extensively in different reservations concerning <italic>how</italic> to counter it that there is little potential for constructing ‘something identical that underlies all subjects interested in fighting terrorism’. These reservations heavily disturb the operations of the productive hegemonic strategy <italic>universalisation of subjects</italic>, thereby forestalling the linking of subjects into a chain of equivalence.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0305829812449501">
<title>Representation</title>
<p>As has been outlined, hegemonies are in need of a common vision of what the collective Self is about and this needs to be represented in the discourse. This function is assumed by an empty signifier which simultaneously represents the whole chain of equivalential subjects and is itself part of the chain. Which signifier ends up representing the chain of equivalence as a whole is ultimately contingent, yet not arbitrary.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn109-0305829812449501">109</xref></sup> The strategy <italic>representation</italic> is about such creation of empty signifiers, as it signals ‘that one difference, without ceasing to be a <italic>particular</italic> difference, assumes the representation of an incommensurable totality’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn110-0305829812449501">110</xref></sup> and, in light of this moment, we can speak of hegemony.</p>
<p>How can this empty signifier be reconstructed in a concrete discourse? In light of the common vision of a drug-free world, the question of who should free the world from drugs is left open. Since drugs are a ‘risk to the community’ and affect ‘humanity at large’, it is the duty of the international community to safeguard ‘the integrity of the world’s societies’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn111-0305829812449501">111</xref></sup> and ‘to tackle the drug problem on a world-wide scale’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn112-0305829812449501">112</xref></sup> Indeed, individual states can no longer cope with drugs unilaterally, because drug traffickers via their ‘tentacles now infiltrated all regions of the world’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn113-0305829812449501">113</xref></sup> Consequently, the international community becomes the genius loci, which represents those subjects united in their interpretation of drugs as antagonistic Other and in their desire to control drugs internationally. By eliminating drugs, the world could overcome the lowly spheres of addiction and human greed, and develop into a community that represents the values dear to all countries and individuals.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn114-0305829812449501">114</xref></sup> While a perfect drug-free community does of course not exist (since it is a vision), the international community symbolises such a perfect society; it represents this collective Self and introduces the vision of it into the discourse. The international community is the absent but imaginary fullness of the discourse. Indeed, the productive hegemonic strategy <italic>representation</italic> can be reconstructed in the international discourse on drugs – hence the central moment bespeaking of the emergence of an international hegemony is present in the material. Drugs are the antagonistic Other, and it is through a consensually agreed international control of drugs that the Self’s vision of a drug-free world can be achieved.</p>
<p>When attempting to reconstruct the strategy <italic>representation</italic> in the discourse on terrorism, it is near impossible to discern a bearer of the common vision of the terrorism-free world. Despite the contemporary more coherent views on major bones of contention of the past, neither a vision nor a consensus on how to achieve this world can be detected since issues like state terrorism and the association of terrorism with specific religions are still impeding a consensus. True, the international community is called upon to fight terrorism collectively, to adopt a comprehensive convention on terrorism,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn115-0305829812449501">115</xref></sup> and while references to the community have become more prevalent in the discourse, particularly during the 1970s, this increase comes at a price. The credibility of the international community to ‘truly’ represent the collective Self, that is, all subjects that consider terrorism as their antagonistic Other, is subject to doubt. These doubts are mainly invoked when the willingness of subjects to identify with the international community and to cooperate at the international level is drawn into question. Delegations suspect each other of lacking a ‘desire for cooperation’, which is ‘not conducive to the collective struggle against terrorism’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn116-0305829812449501">116</xref></sup> In the 1970s, representatives did not hesitate to single out particular countries, accusing them of being the source of terrorism and implementing a double standard: ‘in the minds of certain people terrorism was only that which was directed against them. The terrorism which they themselves perpetrated was not supposed to be terrorism.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn117-0305829812449501">117</xref></sup> In the contemporary discourse on international terrorism, the accusation of state terrorism as reconstructed above is primarily impeding the construction of a collective Self, since it not only associates suspected subjects with international terrorism but even considers them terrorists. Moreover, through such accusation of others of not identifying with the international community and its task of fighting terrorism, one re-emphasises one’s differential character and delivers a range of positive self-descriptions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn118-0305829812449501">118</xref></sup> Ultimately, as the protection of one subject can only take place at the expense of others that are being associated with the terrorist Other, a potential cooperation partner is nearly automatically related to terrorism, even accused of being a source of terrorism. Given that the meaning of the antagonistic Other is so heavily disputed and amorphous, anyone, and the practices she stands for, can easily be associated with terrorism.</p>
<p>Hence, while we witness a growing presence of the international community in the discourse on terrorism, it is not considered to be the ideal locus for fighting it. Since no clear-cut antagonistic frontier has been discerned, and the construction of the Other remains heterogeneous, the vision of a world free of terrorism struggles with the different interpretations of the nature of and, above all, <italic>how to</italic> fight terrorism. Given that the potential general equivalent of a fight is interpreted in so many different ways, the international community can hardly symbolise in a credible and equivalential manner the absent, perfect community in which humankind is not threatened by terrorism. Thus, no collective Self has emerged that opposes a terrorist Other; accordingly, the productive hegemonic strategy <italic>representation</italic> cannot be reconstructed.</p>
<p>The comparison of both discourses yields the key insight that an international hegemony has emerged in the UN drugs discourse, whereas the discourse on terrorism is devoid of such an order. The analysis has highlighted the importance of a homogeneous Other, as well as the necessity of a coherently shared vision and a consensus among those subjects forming a collective Self. While the drug discourse conveys a homogeneous, dominant picture of drugs as illicit and their use as deviant, the discourse on terrorism has been marked by a long-lasting struggle between different hegemonic projects that assign different meanings to terrorism. The agreement <italic>that</italic> terrorism has to be fought is not sufficient to construct a chain of equivalential subjects sharing the same understanding of the nature of terrorism. Moreover, the analysis was unable to reconstruct a political consensus on <italic>how to</italic> fight the phenomenon, and the subjects do not conceive of the international community as a collective Self and bearer of the consensus on the vision of a terrorism-free world. Since no pattern or meaning has become dominant in this field, we are left with the impression of an extremely heterogeneous discourse that is criss-crossed by inner lines of conflicts and exclusions within which the demarcation of international terrorism is only one among many: it is a ‘battlefield of meanings’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn119-0305829812449501">119</xref></sup></p>
<p>While these processes have a number of problematic political implications, two merit brief mention here.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn120-0305829812449501">120</xref></sup> Firstly, the antagonisms rely on a language of demonisation and war meant to create and stabilise a hegemonic order. Yet, despite the terrorism discourse’s martial language demonising the Other, this is not sufficient to establish agreement on the Other’s exact ‘nature’ and ‘quality’. And as a potential Self remains equally diffuse in the terrorism discourse, a hegemonic order cannot emerge. While this highlights that identity is dependent on difference, it also elucidates that antagonistic othering has become an end in itself. Secondly, stabilising hegemonic orders with the help of the language of eradication and elimination hampers the search for non-violent, alternative measures, that is, measures that are <italic>outside</italic> the parameters of the current discourse. This is particularly visible in the treatment of the drug addict. Confronted with rising drug-related death rates in recent decades, European states are trying to diverge from the international drug prohibition discourse by considering controlled consumption of narcotics in drug-injection rooms as a useful way of minimising the harm inflicted on drug users.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn121-0305829812449501">121</xref></sup> However, the consensus on the international drug discourse is so highly sedimented today that it shuts out such alternative practices: that drug consumption should be made legal ‘was a frivolous and defeatist [idea], founded on false premises’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn122-0305829812449501">122</xref></sup> Overall, the antagonistic interpretation of the terrorist and drugs Other makes it hard to think about measures other than annihilating, eradicating the enemy. It becomes enormously difficult to de-securitise an issue by shifting it out of the emergency mode and into the normal bargaining processes of the political sphere.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn123-0305829812449501">123</xref></sup></p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This article has aimed at developing a poststructuralist framework for analysing the politics of hegemony, by asking how specific interpretations of particular phenomena – here, international terrorism and drug prohibition – have become hegemonic at the global level and how one can grasp these processes of ‘hegemonialisation’ conceptually and methodologically. I argued that the emergence of an international hegemonic order can be conceptualised as the production of a predominantly antagonistic type of collective identity. Thereby, the ontological starting point was the conceptualisation of hegemonies as dichotomising the discursive space by establishing a frontier between at least two entities. Drawing a frontier implies conferring a particular meaning upon these entities, which produces new collective identities, that is, a Self that confronts its Other(s). The identities deem themselves blocked by an external force which fundamentally negates them, and it is this force which is constructed as enemy, as antagonistic Other. Part and parcel are the attempts to homogenise the interpretation of the enemy Other, as this broadens the remit and viability of the hegemony based on this construction. The second part of my argument emphasised the importance of creating an unambiguous vision of the collective Self shared by the subjects jointly opposing the Other. This common vision of the Self requires a political consensus that unites subjects in their common interpretation of the Other as antagonistic, as enemy. The analysis has underscored the significance of this second process by tracing hegemonic strategies aiming at universalisation and representation in the two international discourses under discussion. While they were present in the discourse on drugs, neither of them could be reconstructed in the discourse on terrorism. The comparative analysis of both discourses has highlighted the importance of both a homogeneously constructed Other and an unambiguously shared vision among those subjects represented by a collective Self for the establishment of a hegemony at the international level.</p>
<p>Overall, the analysis exposed the potential in IR-poststructuralist thinking on hegemonies that awaits further exploitation outside security discourses. Key concepts developed by the Essex School of Discourse Theory have proven highly beneficial for outlining the main conceptual contours of a poststructuralist framework: the logic of equivalence and the array of productive hegemonic strategies allow for a reconstruction of how a discursive space is dichotomised and offer insights into the way in which a particular meaning is conferred upon a Self and its Other(s). They furthermore highlight the extent to which a common vision is crucial to the creation of a collective Self.</p>
<p>The conceptualisation of international hegemonies put forward in this article thus very much counters the common-sense view of hegemonies being based upon coercion alone, or referring to the domination of a single country in international life. Conceiving of hegemonies as the capacity of discourses to unite people in a temporally shared and unstable mode of interpretation that at the same time establishes relations of domination<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn124-0305829812449501">124</xref></sup> allows the poststructuralist enterprise in IR to make an independent contribution to the study of primacy in international politics. Of course, hegemonies, which do not silence alternative meanings to reinforce relations of domination, are difficult to conceptualise if one holds the assumption that disagreement and conflict reflect a deeper ontological condition and therefore form the core of the political. This also means that fundamental antagonism cannot always be avoided, and that it is difficult to think of political orders without limits. However, their constitutive nature does not mean that dissent and conflict are simply given; rather, they are subject to <italic>negotiation</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn125-0305829812449501">125</xref></sup> In this respect, it is imperative to nuance the picture of the antagonistic Other by making a case for antagonists that need not necessarily be enemies. Considering conflicts as constitutive but also as subject to negotiation alters the parameters of disagreement.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn126-0305829812449501">126</xref></sup> After all, the historical development of both discourses, with their different interpretation of drugs and terrorism, highlights that meaning can only partially be fixed and that seemingly stable orders can wither away and be superseded by different, even opposite, hegemonies. Yet, while reflections on the possibility of different types of hegemonic orders are still in their infancy, this article has shown that IR-poststructuralist thinking on the emergence of hegemonies offers a viable starting point for this endeavour which is both aspiring and inspiring.</p>

<p>As the aim of this article is primarily a conceptual one, the focus on an international elite-discourse should be regarded as proxy for a broader discourse on both issues. Hence, while the UN is a unique place to reconstruct <italic>global</italic> hegemonic formations within an elite-discourse, one could also focus on regional or national fora for attempts to hegemonise a discourse on a non-global level. Besides, intertextuality teaches us that every text is located in a wider universe of other texts, making (implicitly or explicitly) references to previous ones, and in doing so each text turns into a single interpretation of the reading of previous texts while at the same time being the product of earlier ones.

<p>The assumption that collective identities presume an Other has raised discussions in IR and political theory, in particular with regard to the possibility of global democracy. It is argued that insisting on the need for an Other in collective identity formation ‘leads to a conceptual or metaphysical misdescription of the empirical phenomena’, which ultimately impedes a cosmopolitan democracy: Arash Abizadeh, ‘Does Collective Identity Presuppose an Other? On the Alleged Incoherence of Global Solidarity’, <italic>American Political Science Review</italic> 99, no. 1 (2005): 59. This may be debatable with regard to democracies; however, the case of hegemonies, with which this article is preoccupied, is different. The need for an external Other is integral to the formation of hegemonies as they are based on a pattern of inclusion and exclusion to establish an order in a specific field.</p>

<p>Most important are UN Security Council (SC) Resolutions 1267 (1999) and 1373 (2000), monitoring the sanctions against the Taliban (subsequently Al-Qaida). The Counter-Terrorism Committee created by the SC to monitor the implementation of Resolution 1373 has since become the UN’s leading body to promote collective action against international terrorism.

<p>Overall, the text corpus consists of 440 documents: 252 documents from the drug discourse and 188 documents from the terrorism discourse. Unless indicated otherwise, the documents of the drug discourse have been taken from the following four volumes: United Nations, <italic>Official Records of United Nations Conference for the Adoption of a Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, New York, 1961, Vol. II</italic> (New York: United Nations, 1964); United Nations, <italic>Official Records of United Nations Conference for the Adoption of a Protocol on Psychotropic Substances (Vienna, 11 January–19 February 1971), Vol. II</italic> (New York: United Nations, 1973a); United Nations, <italic>Official Records of United Nations Conference to Consider Amendments to the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, 1961 (Geneva, 6–24 March 1972), Vol. II</italic> (New York: United Nations, 1973b); United Nations, <italic>Official Records of United Nations Conference for the Adoption of a Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, Vol. II</italic> (New York: United Nations, 1991). The documents of the terrorism discourse have been taken predominantly from the UN Sixth Committee and the Ad Hoc Committee on International Terrorism, as the central debates on the matter took place in these committees in the years between 1972 and 1979 and again since 1999. The analysis was carried out using the MAXQDA software, allowing inter alia the systematising of large amounts of text.
