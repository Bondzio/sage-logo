<abstract>
<p>This study explores the referral experience of physicians who refer Latinos to end-of-life care and challenges associated with the referral process. Qualitative data were collected in New Jersey through semistructured, open-ended interviews. Six physicians participated in this study: 1 oncologist, 2 internists, 1 gerontologist, and 2 infectious disease specialists. The study reveals that language barriers, level of family involvement, and generational group of the patient and the family contribute to the complexity of the physician’s experience. Physicians’ comments evidence the importance of culturally competent training in medical school and continued education on this topic for physicians who did not receive such training. Bilingual bicultural hospice admissions’ staff available at the physician’s office could enhance the referral experience.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The Latino population is the fastest growing population in the United States. The Latino population increased from 14.6 million to nearly 48.4 million between 1980 and 2009, and they now make up 16% of the US population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049909111418777">1</xref></sup> However, reports from the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049909111418777">2</xref></sup> show that Latinos are underrepresented in hospice programs. This organization estimates that 1.56 million patients received hospice care in 2009. The racial and ethnic composition of these patients was 80.5% Caucasian, 8.7% African American, and 5.3% Latino. Thus, Latinos are particularly underrepresented in hospice programs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049909111418777">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049909111418777"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049909111418777">5</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Studies have established racial and ethnic disparities in health care<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049909111418777">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049909111418777">7</xref></sup> and have pointed out that there may be differences in how different groups utilize health care services.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049909111418777">8</xref></sup> Hispanics have been found to have more difficulty getting into the health care system than Whites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049909111418777">9</xref></sup> Various factors may affect the desire or ability of Latinos to utilize hospice services. Researchers who have investigated Latino utilization of hospice care suggest a variety of factors that affect hospice use by Latinos. Among these factors are beliefs about health care, death, and end-of-life care, language difficulties, lack of insurance, lower referral rates by physicians, hospice caregiver requirement,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049909111418777">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049909111418777"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049909111418777">12</xref></sup> acculturation,<sup>10(p16)</sup> and experiences in the health care system prior to hospice admission.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049909111418777">13</xref></sup> However, research about the influence of these factors in the use of hospice by Latinos is limited and requires additional study.</p>
<p>A lower referral rate by physicians is particularly important because physicians are the only ones who can sign a hospice certification, document needed for patients to receive hospice care. As a result, a salient research question is physicians’ experience in referring Latinos to hospice. A literature search showed that little is known about this theme. Researchers such as Ogle et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049909111418777">14</xref></sup> and Brickner and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049909111418777">15</xref></sup> address physicians’ referrals to hospice care in general but not specific to Latinos. Findings by Colón and Lyke<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049909111418777">3</xref></sup> and Karim et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049909111418777">16</xref></sup> do not reveal any difference in the hospice referral rates of physicians according to patient ethnicity. In another study, investigators found that “even among physicians who see at least one but no more than four terminally ill patients half of them report no discussion of hospice…. Among those who see larger numbers of terminally ill patients, more than a quarter report no such discussions.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049909111418777">17</xref>(p47)</sup> While this finding is noteworthy, the study did not indicate whether Latinos were among patients treated by these physicians.</p>
<p>The studies mentioned above have provided highly specific quantitative findings; however, they do not examine the complex factors that contribute to the character of the exchange between physicians and terminally ill patients regarding hospice care. Equally important, the complex factors that contribute to discussion or lack of discussion about hospice services with terminally ill patients and their families, and to a physician’s decision to refer or not refer to hospice, are underdeveloped in the literature. Only one additional study surfaces the referral experience of physicians with Latinos; in that study, the author employed qualitative methodologies and explored factors that affect communication of terminal diagnoses with Latinos and hospice referral.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049909111418777">18</xref></sup> The present study seeks to further explore the referral experience per se; the form and nature of the referral experience of physicians who refer Latinos to end-of-life care and challenges associated with the referral process.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>Qualitative data were collected through semistructured, open-ended interviews by the researcher. A convenience sample of 6 physicians agreed to participate in this study: 1 oncologist, 2 internists, 1 gerontologist, and 2 infectious disease specialists, 1 female, and 5 males. Their years in practice ranged from 10 to 25. Ethnically this sample included 3 Asians, 2 whites, and 1 Latino. These physicians are solo practitioners or own a private practice in New Jersey. The snowball sampling approach was used.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049909111418777">19</xref></sup> This investigator contacted 2 referral coordinators for end-of-life care that suggested names of physicians who refer patients to hospice. This investigator also spoke with 2 social workers: one who is a hospital discharge planner and another one who facilitates bereavement support groups for a hospice program. These social workers provided the same names of physicians already suggested by the referral coordinators. As noted, this investigator chose to interview physicians whose names were repeatedly mentioned. These physicians’ medical specialization, ethnicity, and years in practice should yield high-quality, detailed descriptions for the purposes of this study.</p>
<sec id="section3-1049909111418777">
<title>Data Collection and Analysis</title>
<p>The research for this study was done over a 3-month period. Each physician was interviewed once and interviews recorded with permission of the physician interviewed. Interviews took place at the physician’s office. After the interview, the recordings were transcribed into computer files. Respondents were assured that their name or other identifiers would not be disclosed in any subsequent reports.</p>
<p>The researcher conducted the interviews. Verbatim transcripts of 6 audiotaped, semistructured interviews were transcribed into computer files. To avoid familiarity that might affect the process of analysis, the researcher did not transcribe the recordings. Using the grounded theory approach to data analysis, the researcher read and coded the transcribed data.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049909111418777">20</xref></sup> Data were analyzed seeking themes about the referral experience of physicians who refer Latinos to end-of-life care and focusing on challenges associated with the referral process. Two independent researchers verified the accuracy of codes and thematic categorization that emerged.</p>

<title>Steps in the Referral to Hospice</title>
<p>The referral to hospice care entails more than just a signed certification by the physician. There are steps that physicians follow in order to reach a successful referral to hospice. First, the physician discusses the patient’s prognosis with the patient and family and presents hospice as an option of care. Two physicians describe how they begin a hospice referral:<disp-quote>
<p>Basically I start with what they have been through. I remind them that I always mentioned to them that this is the outcome that was expected. It wasn’t completely clear when because you have to go through treatment, but they will accept they are not responding [to treatment] and we have to think about the fact that they’ll die from this problem, and then we discuss the hospice service. (Asian Oncologist)</p>
<p>Your prognosis is poor, there’s no treatment, really, that can extend your life or by any means, give you any kind of quality of life. There is an organization called Hospice. It’s paid for by Medicare. The people are wonderful and their goal is to provide comfort from pain, and dignity. (White Internist)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Following the physician’s presentation about patient’s prognosis and the concept of hospice, the second step is to explore whether hospice is feasible for the patient. “Feasibility” is a term physicians used when alluding to the steps of referral. To determine feasibility, physicians make sure the patient understands that hospice “… is not just a home care service.” Hospice’s philosophy of care involves palliative or comfort measures rather than aggressive measures. The patient stays in his or her home until death and the family provides the care with the support of hospice. Thus, in the second step of the referral process, the physician explores whether the patient has a 24-hour caregiver. According to one physician, “You can’t just put somebody on hospice without the family” (Asian Infectious Disease Specialist). Another physician elaborates, “When they’re [patients] at that stage of life they need the support of the family” (Asian Oncologist and White Gerontologist).</p>
<p>The last step formally completes the referral. This entails following institutional protocols: a phone call to hospice, forms generated by hospice, and physician approval. Physicians related that once hospice admits the patient, their involvement with the patient decreases. Physicians remarked that after the patient enrolls in hospice:<disp-quote>
<p>I can’t bill them or anything. Once hospice has taken over—then hospice takes over, Medicare … they have their own funding. So, I’ll stay involved and I still have to sign the orders, you know, take phone calls but basically, hospice takes over. (White Internist) </p>
<p>At that point it’s a matter of medication refills, paperwork to be signed, faxed back, maybe a house call or two. (Latino Internist)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In discussing the steps of a hospice referral, it became apparent that physicians focus on making sure the patient understands both that his or her condition is terminal and the hospice philosophy. Interestingly, physicians did not seem concerned about a patient’s health insurance. For example, one physician stated, “I don’t ever look at their insurances. Usually it’s Medicare or Medicaid that covers it” (White Internist). Exploring whether a patient has health insurance or not is important because not all hospice programs provide charity service, and this could impede a referral to hospice.</p>

<title>Challenges Physicians Encounter in the Referral Process</title>
<p>Although the steps of a hospice referral seem straightforward, there are challenges to overcome. According to physicians, these challenges stem from patients’ and or families’ resistance, religious beliefs, the perception patients and/or families have of the word “hospice,” and patients’ difficulty in accepting their life expectancy is 6 months or less. Physicians find they are challenged when referring any patient to hospice. However, physicians encounter an especially complex range of challenges in referring a Latino patient.</p>
<p>Language barrier, family involvement, length of time a referral takes, and generational group of the patient deserve individual consideration, given the striking underrepresentation of Latinos in hospice programs. Reports by the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049909111418777">2</xref></sup> estimate that of the 1.56 million patients who received hospice care in 2009, only 5.3% were Latino. Additionally, the literature about the experience of physicians referring Latino patients to hospice is limited.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1049909111418777">
<title>Language Barrier</title>
<p>A language barrier can impede access to health care in general<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049909111418777">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049909111418777">22</xref></sup> and hospice services specifically.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049909111418777">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049909111418777">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049909111418777">24</xref></sup> An inability to speak Spanish represents a challenge for physicians in their exchange with Latinos about hospice care as it is impossible for anyone who uses an interpreter to assure the content does not change in the translation process. As a couple of physicians put it:<disp-quote>
<p>… When a patient is monolingual [Spanish speaking only] then it’s really a big problem because you need to have an interpreter involved. I think I have one patient who is monolingual. And you have to go to the interpreter and it’s … basically sometimes if you go to a third person you can’t express exactly what you meant, you know, like it changes probably. (Asian Infectious Disease Specialist)</p>
<p>Sometimes it can be that the barrier of the language may add a little bit of mistrust or not sure about what certain things mean. (Asian Oncologist)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Noggle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049909111418777">12</xref></sup> points out that hospice is about choices and language barriers limit these choices for patients and families. Language barriers may limit the choices for physicians as well. If physicians cannot hold a formal exchange with Latino patients in Spanish about patients’ wishes regarding end-of-life care, as one physician notes:<disp-quote>
<p>I know that with the language barrier sometimes it’s really hard… when you are discussing this [hospice] through an interpreter it’s really hard to understand what the patient’s wishes really are. (Asian Oncologist)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Physicians who do not speak Spanish need to use an interpreter and trust the interpreter’s ability to communicate the information as accurately as possible. Additionally, the interpreter might not be bicultural and this presents a concern as one physician makes the remark that “understanding the language is one thing—understanding the culture is another” (Latino Internist). A lot can be lost in translation if the interpreter does not understand the patient’s culture.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1049909111418777">
<title>Family Involvement</title>
<p>The level of involvement of the Latino family in the care of the terminally ill patient is another challenge that influences the referral process. Interdependence, affiliation, and cooperation characterize Latino families.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049909111418777">21</xref>(p250)</sup> Therefore, it is noteworthy that in Latino families, the entire family including the patient makes the health care decisions, not any particular family member.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049909111418777">21</xref>(p250)</sup> One physician corroborated this observation:<disp-quote>
<p>[With regard to hospice] I hope I am not wrong but the family knows the patient will defer to the family. The family will always make the decision, not the patient. The patient is in the passive seat. (Asian Oncologist)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The challenge for the physician is to understand the relationship of the Latino patient with his or her family. It is only through such understanding that the physician will communicate with both patient and family in order to make a hospice referral. When this writer asked a physician if it is more upsetting to refer a Latino patient to hospice than refer a patient from a different culture, this doctor answered:<disp-quote>
<p>Umm, I guess that in some ways it is just in that there is a lot more, umm, I mean, you know, compared to my culture it just seems that there’s more turmoil around it. It’s just, there’s so many people to talk to. (White Infectious Disease Specialist)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Other physicians commented:<disp-quote>
<p>When we ask to meet with family we see a good ten people showing up. (Asian Oncologist)</p>
<p>You always have a family member who works in the health care system who will always call you and they’ll expect you to discuss the whole thing with them. (Asian Oncologist)</p>
<p>Well, there’s definitely more family involved with Latinos. No doubt. You know, if I say something there’s 15 calls I’ve just generated. Anybody who speaks English is going to be on the phone with me asking. You know, they definitely are a tighter knit family. (White Internist)</p>
</disp-quote>
Furthermore, some families do not want the patient to know that he or she is terminally ill. These families ask the physicians not to disclose the medical prognosis to the patient. While such dynamic occurs in families that are not Latino, this physician makes the following observation:<disp-quote>
<p>I’ve been in a couple of situations where the patient has been brought to me, with the terminal diagnosis, that I have referred to hospice and they have come to me under the pretense of, ‘the patient doesn’t know, don’t tell him,’ and it’s usually the Latin, the Hispanic culture. (Latino Internist)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>This observation coincides with remarks made by De Paula al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049909111418777">25</xref></sup> and Juarbe<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049909111418777">26</xref></sup> about how Mexicans and Puerto Ricans, respectively, deal with terminal illness. These writers state that family often keeps terminal illness in secret as a way to protect the patient from suffering and maintain an optimistic atmosphere for the patient.</p>
<p>Paradoxically, while family involvement can be a challenge it can simultaneously facilitate the referral. As a couple of physicians put it:<disp-quote>
<p>I think family members being involved and being on your side and they all understand what the situation is, that’s a big help …. (Asian Infectious Disease Specialist)</p>
<p>… Once they understand my position [regarding hospice referral] and if they agree with it then sometimes that helps because then they can help make the decisions. (White Internist)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Consequently, the point made by another doctor is noteworthy:<disp-quote>
<p>I think if there is extended or supportive family for the Latino that it’s really helpful to talk to the whole family as opposed to just talking to the patient. (White Infectious Disease Specialist)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1049909111418777">
<title>Length of Time of the Referral Process</title>
<p>The referral of Latinos to hospice is also influenced by the length of time the referral process takes. Critically for Latinos, language barrier and the fact that more family members request to communicate with the physician often delay the referral.</p>
<p>Pertaining to length of time of the referral process and family involvement, 1 physician stated, “I figure there’s going to be more family involved and probably a little more time spent on my talking to family members, you know” (White Internist). Overall, 1 physician observed that Latinos do not accept hospice immediately, “… it becomes a delay process for them” (Asian Oncologist).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1049909111418777">
<title>Generational Group</title>
<p>The generational group to which patients belong, whether they are first, second, or third generation in the United States, also influences the referral process. Patients who belong to the first generation may interact with the doctor according to traditional views held in a country of origin. Second- or third-generation patients, however, have been exposed to the mainstream American culture for a longer period and consequently are more likely to interact with the doctor according to mainstream American views. One physician observes differences between first-generation and second- or third-generation of Latinos:<disp-quote>
<p>This is—I’m taking to you off the top of my head. My gut is first generation Latinos more than second or third seek more compassionate care. They really do; they really want to be kind of hand-held more, umm, they’re more dependent. (Latino Internist)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Generational Group also seems to influence Latino’s view of physician:<disp-quote>
<p>I think the monolingual patients that have been less time [in the United States] or that tend to be older definitely do see me as an authority figure (White Infectious Disease Specialist)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>

<sec id="section11-1049909111418777">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study revealed the complexity of the referral experience for physicians referring Latinos to hospice. Cultural challenges such as a language barrier, level of family involvement, and generational group of the patient contribute to the complexity of the physician’s experience. In analyzing comments about language barrier, it is essential that the physician speaks Spanish or finds a bilingual bicultural interpreter who is knowledgeable about hospice and health care. Such intervention is important to prevent miscommunication about complex or sensitive issues vital to the success of the referral and to maintain the trust of all parties involved in the referral process.</p>
<p>In analyzing physicians’ comments about family involvement, it is evident that a major challenge for the physician is to accept that in Latino families, patients by themselves do not have the autonomy to make decisions about end-of-life care; decisions are made within the family unit. Therefore, more family interaction is expected. Contrary to mainstream cultural beliefs that speak to patients’ self-determination and autonomy in health care decisions, physicians need to convince not only the patient but also the family to accept hospice care and be open to the not-so-distinct boundaries between Latino patients and family members. Physicians in this study acknowledge the importance of including the family in the process as they realize that a Latino referral is not a phenomenon that occurs in isolation.</p>
<p>In examining physicians’ comments about generational group, it is apparent that physicians have to be sensitive to patients’ generation and generational tensions that stem from traditional versus mainstream American cultural views. Perhaps the most crucial part of this challenge, in light of the earlier discussion about Latino family involvement, is for physicians to communicate with first-generation patients and their second- or third-generation family members without creating generational conflict between patients and family members. Juarbe,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049909111418777">26</xref>(p233)</sup> referring to Puerto Ricans and health care, cautions health care providers to be aware of generational differences. She points out that such differences may influence health care decisions. This is so because the views of first-generation patients may tend to be traditional, while the views of the second- and third-generation family members may tend to be mainstream American.</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that physicians did not allude to the managed care climate, which has dominated health care for 2 decades,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049909111418777">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049909111418777">28</xref></sup> as a factor influencing the referral experience. While Medicare reimburses on a fee-for-service basis, managed care Medicare does not.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049909111418777">29</xref>(p3)</sup> In a study on the use of the hospice benefit in Medicare fee-for-service and Medicare health maintenance organizations, Virnig et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049909111418777">29</xref>(p5)</sup> found that more deaths occurred in hospice in the health maintenance organization option than in the fee-for-service option. Virnig and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049909111418777">29</xref>(p10)</sup> concluded that these differences reflect the financial incentive physicians receive from these 2 programs. When a fee-for-service patient enters a hospice program, the referring physician has no expectation of receiving additional income from patients; thus, the physician might be less motivated to refer the patient to a hospice program.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049909111418777">29</xref>(p10)</sup> By contrast, a physician treating a patient enrolled in a Medicare health maintenance organization might be more motivated to refer the patient to hospice because the patient’s needs might exceed the benefit amount allocated by the health maintenance organization. This means that the physician would not receive compensation for treating the patient, once the insurance reaches its financial capacity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049909111418777">29</xref>(p10)</sup> It would seem that physicians would mention managed care and its implications in referring to hospice. However, such was not the case, the physicians interviewed never mentioned managed care.</p>
<p>Physicians’ comments evidence that referring a Latino for hospice care is not simple; it requires sensitivity to Latino cultural elements, which most of the interviewed physicians claimed their medical education did not address. Cultural elements such as the level of family involvement are weaved throughout the challenges physicians encounter referring Latino patients to hospice. Such information, although it requires further exploration, can help create training for physicians and other health care providers about the Latino culture and how to engage in a hospice referral within the Latino cultural context.</p>
<p>The challenges identified by physicians help to explain the underrepresentation of Latinos in hospice programs. These challenges impose constraints physicians need to overcome in order to complete a referral. Although the challenges are presented as separate categories, each speaks to Latino cultural elements and argues for physicians making a greater effort to understand and work within Latino cultural elements.</p>
<sec id="section12-1049909111418777">
<title>Directions for Future Research</title>
<p>Similarities in physician’ responses are noteworthy, and they are consistent with recent findings from the exploratory study of Carrion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049909111418777">18</xref>(pp4-6)</sup> about communicating terminal diagnosis to Hispanics; however, due to the small and nonrandom sample, this study is limited in generalizability. Factors that challenge physicians in their referral of Latinos to hospice deserve further study. What remains unclear is the extent to which generational group of the patient and the family influences the referral and/or whether this is a factor regardless of the nationality of the Latino patient. The reasons why physicians do not distinguish differences in the referral process of Latinos based on their nationality deserve additional study. Additionally, further exploration will help to clarify whether differences are not mentioned because they are minimal or simply missed.</p>
<p>Facilitating factors also need to be explored. Physicians alluded to religion and the level of patients’ academic education as factors that make the referral easier. The dynamics of these factors in the referral process were not apparent, thus this writer excluded them from the narrative. The next stage of inquiry should focus on both factors that facilitate the referral and factors that challenge the physician, as well as developing a deeper and more dynamic understanding of the referral process.</p>
<p>The role of managed care and patients’ health insurance in the hospice referral sparks curiosity. In this era of managed care in which physicians’ interventions seem to be regulated by health management organizations (HMOs), one ponders the extent to which HMOs influence a hospice referral. The study of this aspect would elucidate additional knowledge related to the hospice referral experience of physicians.</p>
<p>Reflecting on the findings of this study one comes to realize the importance of culturally competent training in medical school and continued education on this topic for physicians who did not receive such training. It is also essential to acknowledge the extraordinary challenge for monolingual (English only) physicians referring Latinos to hospice care. As the Asian oncologist puts it, “I know that with the language barrier sometimes it’s really hard … when you are discussing this [hospice] through an interpreter it’s really hard to understand what the patient’s wishes really are.”</p>
<p>Lack of medical, culturally competent training and the language barrier physicians experience require the attention of the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization; directors of hospice care programs, nurses, social workers, and other health care providers who deliver end-of-life care. These professionals need to actively collaborate with physicians in order to provide them with resources to ensure the success of the Latino referral. For instance, hospice programs could make bilingual, bicultural admissions’ staff available to facilitate referrals of Latinos at the physician’s office. It is likely that such support would meet physicians in their interest to refer Latinos to hospice care. Physicians in this study appear genuinely interested in referring Latinos to hospice; it is up to the rest of the hospice team to make it happen.</p>
