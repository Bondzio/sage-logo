<abstract>
<p>The article discusses the concept of procedural administrative transparency and aims to investigate the extent to which the legal provisions of Law no. 52/2003 on transparency in decision-making are actually implemented by the local administrations from the rural communities in the Transylvania region, Romania. The main research questions are: Where are the weaknesses in the implementation of Law no. 52/2003 in the rural settings in Romania? Why do they occur? What could be changed to alleviate these weaknesses? Based on a mixed method approach – surveys followed by direct observation and informal interviews – we determined that the implementation of procedural transparency requirements is low and in many cases local public authorities comply only ‘for the record’ with the provisions of the law. The main challenge with regard to implementation is the existence of universal provisions for all local public authorities, irrespective of their administrative capacity, existing cultural and social characteristics of public participation and communication in rural communities as well as the relationship between central and local tiers of the government. In conclusion, the authors argue that the implementation level of these requirements could be enhanced by their inclusion in a general procedural administrative law.</p>
<sec><title>Points for practitioners</title>
<p>Very often, countries from Eastern Europe adopt state-of-the-art legislation which is then difficult to implement due to factors such as limited administrative capacity at the local level coupled with differences between urban and rural areas, resistance to change within the bureaucratic machinery, passiveness on behalf of the citizens, etc. In 2003, Romania adopted the law on transparency in the decision-making process of public authorities in an attempt to create a more open, transparent, accountable, and predictable government. Since its adoption, studies conducted by NGOs have proved that the implementation level is relatively low. This research assesses how the legal provisions of Law no. 52/2003 are implemented in the rural areas of Transylvania, one of the most significant regions of the country from an economic and cultural standpoint. Based on their findings, the authors argue that implementation in rural areas could be enhanced provided that local authorities are given more discretion with regard to how to implement certain provisions (flexibility in the choice of policy tools); and more discretion should be complemented by increased sanctions for non-compliance and their enforcement. These two goals can be achieved by including the procedural transparency requirements in a general administrative procedure law/administrative code.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0020852311430283"><title>1. Introduction</title>
<p>In 2006 the Romanian government initiated a process of codifying the main administrative procedural rules in an attempt to simplify public administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0020852311430283">Ziller, 2008</xref>) by generating better protection of the basic civil rights, curbing corruption, and enhancing administrative efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0020852311430283">Harlow, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0020852311430283">Huaide, 2006</xref>). This renewed an important debate with regard to the role of ‘procedural’ mechanisms that guarantee administrative transparency and foster public participation in the decision-making process of public authorities.</p>
<p>The article aims to investigate the extent to which the legal provisions of Law no. 52/2003 on transparency in decision-making are actually implemented by the local administrations from the rural communities in the Transylvania region, Romania and suggests that the implementation level could be enhanced by including these provisions in an administrative procedural code. Our decision to focus exclusively on rural communities was triggered by some earlier NGO reports that identified significant differences in the level of implementation between urban and rural communities, without, however, being able to explain this situation in the framework of a properly constructed methodology and theoretical background.</p>
<p>The article is structured as follows: Section 2 presents the concept of procedural transparency from a theoretical perspective, trying to identify its place among other strains of transparency. It then moves to the Romanian context by analyzing the scope of Law no. 52/2003 and the broader context in which it was adopted. Section 3 provides a brief analysis of the main paradigms used to interpret the major findings. Section 4 comprises the methodology and the research questions. Section 5 describes the data gathered using a mixed-method approach. Section 6 discusses the major findings and frames them in terms of challenges to the implementation of Law no. 52/2003 and possible solutions. The last section offers some brief conclusions and ends with the authors’ recommendation concerning the inclusion of the procedural transparency requirements in a general administrative procedure law.</p>

<sec id="sec3-0020852311430283"><title>2.1. Defining ‘procedural’ administrative transparency</title>
<p>Hood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0020852311430283">2006</xref>: 3) refers to transparency as being a term that has attained ‘quasi-religious significance in debate over governance and institutional design, being used almost to saturation point’. A distinction needs to be made between transparency as a value or democratic ideal and transparency as an instrument (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0020852311430283">Dror, 1999: 62</xref>). As an ideal, transparency is part of the value system of any liberal democracy and of human rights. It provides each citizen with the right to know about public affairs in government and creates the reference framework for the government’s duty and responsibility to act toward promoting these principles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0020852311430283">Birkinshaw, 2006a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0020852311430283">2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0020852311430283">Dror, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0020852311430283">Florini, 2007</xref>). As an instrument, transparency offers the promise of enhancing the functioning of the government. Thus, it is seen as an enabling factor for good governance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0020852311430283">Hood, 2006</xref>), for making government officials perform better, for preventing corruption and enhancing legitimacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0020852311430283">Camp, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0020852311430283">Curtin and Meijer, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0020852311430283">Heald, 2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0020852311430283">OECD, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Administrative transparency is narrower and focuses on dealings between executive government (public administration) and citizens or citizens’ representatives. Hood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0020852311430283">2006</xref>: 14) states that defined in this way, transparency includes ‘the idea of government operating according to predictable rules, the idea of openness of government information to citizens, and the idea of government accounting as well as institutional arrangements that prevent cross-subsidization or opaque relationships between governments and their satellites, particularly state-owned enterprises’. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0020852311430283">Prechal and De Leeuw (2007)</xref>, while commenting on the idea of the government operating according to predictable rules, talk about some additional principles – clarity of procedures, clear drafting, publication/notification of regulations, and the duty to give reasons.</p>
<p>The definitions above lead to considering administrative transparency as having a procedural nature. It is the ‘rule book’ of a public organization, comprising rules, regulations, and procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0020852311430283">Heald, 2006a</xref>: 31). It comprises both a regulatory and a voluntary dimension. Some minimal procedural requirements are mandated by national regulations, and public authorities must comply because generally there are sanctions associated with non-compliance. Public organizations can also implement additional transparency mechanisms on a voluntary basis. The balance between these two types of procedure depends on the general political-administrative climate and traditions in every country. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0020852311430283">Creighton (2005)</xref> distinguishes among different types of commitment on the part of public sector organizations regarding transparency. The lowest end of the continuum corresponds to regulatory transparency and includes mechanisms such as public hearings, at which the public can comment on proposed actions; and increased access to information, by issuing various reports or establishing information repositories, locations where the public has access to all relevant information. Public sector organizations need to go through these requirements and make sure they comply with them. These mechanisms serve an important function in the absence of other kinds of public participation, but they can easily become simply procedural hoops through which the agency must jump without having much impact on the decision and no chance for collaborative problem-solving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0020852311430283">Creighton, 2005</xref>: 9). The higher end of the continuum corresponds to voluntary transparency and includes mechanisms geared toward collaborative partnerships between citizens and public administration.</p>
<p>Based on the distinctions presented above, a major difference can be identified between Western democracies and countries in transition. While the former are currently striving to promote voluntary transparency-related mechanisms that foster the empowerment of citizens and consensus-building in local decision-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0020852311430283">Andrews et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0020852311430283">Blunkett, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0020852311430283">Marinetto, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0020852311430283">Piotrowski and Van Ryzin, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0020852311430283">Rose, 2009</xref>), the latter are struggling to meet the mandatory procedural requirements of transparency legislations, often adopted under the influence of Western actors, facing major challenges with regard to their implementation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0020852311430283">Roberts, 2006a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0020852311430283">2006b</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0020852311430283"><title>2.2. Latest development on Law no. 52/2003 on transparency in decision-making by public institutions</title>
<p>Access to public sector information as well as procedural requirements regarding the drafting and notification of administrative acts and public hearings/consultations are usually placed under the umbrella of transparency mechanisms. In Romania, free access to public information is regulated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0020852311430283">Law no. 544/2001</xref>, while Law no. 52/2003 refers exclusively to transparency in the decision-making process, applying each time public institutions adopt administrative acts, organize public hearings or open up the sessions of the deliberative bodies to the public. Our research assesses only the implementation of transparency in decision-making as defined by Law no. 52/2003.</p>
<p>Law no. 52/2003 makes a distinction between citizens’ participation in the drafting of local regulations and citizens’ participation in the local decision-making process. For each of these two dimensions, there are corollary obligations established for the local public authorities:
<list id="list1-0020852311430283" list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item><p>Publicity. Law no. 52/2003 requires local authorities to inform citizens about any local regulation currently pending adoption and about public meetings to be organized in the community (local council meetings and public debates). There are three mandatory methods imposed by law for publicity: online posting on the official website of the local authority, posting inside the building in an accessible place, and publication in a local newspaper. In addition, local authorities can use other methods: TV broadcasting and announcements, and posting in locations other than the building of the local authority.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Receiving recommendations from the public vis-à-vis the drafts of regulation pending adoption. Both individuals and legally established entities can make recommendations, and the public authorities need to organize this process of receiving input and discussing the suggestions made.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Organization of public meetings. This is required every time when a legally established entity or another public authority requests a public discussion about regulations pending adoption. In addition, public authorities can initiate public consultations whenever they deem it necessary, especially in cases when topics of general interest are debated. As a general rule, all the meetings of the local council are public, and every interested party as well as the media can participate.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Drafting of the annual self-evaluation report on implementation of Law no. 52/2003. At the minimum, the reports should include a number of compulsory items specified in the text of the law (number of public meetings organized, of recommendations received, of complaints for non-compliance with the provisions of the law, etc.).</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>In 2006 the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Administrative Reform proposed that the main provisions of Law no. 52/2003 should be included in a new code of administrative procedure, and in 2010 the issue was again brought into discussion. Currently, Law no. 52/2003 is considered <italic>specialized</italic> legislation in the sense that it focuses only on specific issues of administrative procedure (transparency related). Its provisions are not perceived necessarily as part of the day-by-day procedure of adopting administrative acts by public organizations, such as those of a general administrative procedure law would be.</p>
<p>As a response to the draft code, several national NGOs protested against the inclusion of the transparency provisions in the administrative code. These NGOs had initially lobbied for the adoption of the law and have subsequently become involved in the monitoring the implementation of the law. They argued that subjecting these laws again to the Parliament for approval would give the legislator an opportunity to reconsider them. Some of the practitioners involved in drafting the code stated that the motivation of the NGOs for opposing codification was rather different (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0020852311430283">Dragoş and Neamţu, 2007</xref>). Numerous NGOs had received grants from foreign donors in order to conduct assessment studies of the status of implementation of Law no. 52/2003. By codifying its main provisions, NGOs would have had a harder mission in gathering all the data needed for these studies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0020852311430283"><title>2.3. Previous studies in the field of implementation of Law no. 52/2003</title>
<p>The only previous studies in this field are represented by monitoring reports issued by national NGOs. These reports have been widely publicized. The public authorities who had not complied with the provisions of the law received a lot of negative media. Some of their major findings include:
<list id="list2-0020852311430283" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>No self-evaluation reports or incomplete ones on the implementation of Law no. 52/2003. In 52 percent of the cases in the sample the report did not even exist/was not publicly disseminated; no notification of pending regulations (38 percent); incomplete notification about pending legislation (40 percent); non-compliance with the rules regarding the organization of public hearings (81 percent) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0020852311430283">Pro Democracy Association and Transparency International Romania, 2008</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>In a more qualitative study, important problems were discovered with regard to public hearings; in many cases they were organized without proper notification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0020852311430283">APADOR-CH, 2007</xref>).</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>As a result of these studies, public sector organizations have become more responsive and aware of their responsibilities (this is true especially in the case of those organizations criticized in the reports). This was proven by the fact that organizations which had been evaluated in 2004 and then again in 2007 showed signs of improvements. The motivation factor may have been the fear of being exposed by NGOs as being in non-compliance. Second, citizens have become more educated and aware of their rights in their relationship with public authorities. Representatives of local public authorities in urban areas claimed that the citizens are becoming more demanding and tend to hold them accountable for how decisions are made at the local level. While some improvements may have taken place, citizens’ demand for transparency remains problematic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0020852311430283">APADOR-CH, 2007</xref>).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0020852311430283"><title>3. Framework for the analysis</title>
<p>The assessment of the implementation of the provisions of Law no. 52/2003 is framed around three main paradigms: policy implementation in developing countries with a focus on barriers to implementation (limited administrative capacity being most significant); social change in the context of institutional and administrative reform processes; and rural communities as close-knit and open communication systems.</p>
<p>There is a vast literature available on policy implementation that can be grouped into three main generations. The very first researchers began with the assumption that implementation would happen ‘automatically’ once the appropriate policies had been adopted. The second generation was mostly concerned with specific cases of implementation ‘failure’. The third generation no longer focuses just on specific implementation failure but rather on understanding how implementation works in general and how it could be enhanced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0020852311430283">AAPAM, 2005</xref>: 6). Our research on the status of implementation of Law no. 52/2003 is placed in the context of the third paradigm.</p>
<p>For the purpose of this article we define implementation as the accomplishment of policy objectives through planning and carrying out specific actions, which are either mandatory or executed by local authorities voluntarily, so that agreed-upon outcomes, in our case stated in a law, are achieved. This definition is based on the work of second-generation scholars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0020852311430283">Pressman and Wildavsky, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0020852311430283">Van Meter and Van Horn, 1975</xref>: 447). However, our inquiry departs from their efforts by not only trying to identify implementation problems but also how macro-level variables (policy and legislative initiatives at the central level, broader reforms of public administration, as well as the response of the civil society) and micro-level variables (administrative capacity at the local level, citizens’ demand for transparency and openness in government, etc.) can be manipulated in order to increase the success of implementation.</p>
<p>Our inquiry is in line with similar developments in the literature. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0020852311430283">Brinkerhoff (1996</xref>: 3) argues that ‘currently many developing countries are entering a second round of policy reforms that are characterized by incremental, long-haul adjustments rather than the dramatic, stroke-of-the-pen measures taken in the first round to deal with economic crisis and/or democratic transition’. In his opinion, implementation during this second phase becomes more complex and driven by bureaucracies at the lower levels of government. Most countries in Central and Eastern Europe as well as in other parts of the developing world, during the public policy-making process, focus on adopting a state of the art legislative framework and forget about the importance of implementation, which becomes the ‘missing link’ of the process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0020852311430283">Dunn et al., 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0020852311430283">Makinde (2005)</xref> also argues that barriers to policy implementation such as corruption, lack of continuity in government policies, inadequate human and material resources lead to an implementation gap, i.e. the widening of the distance between stated policy goals and the realization of such planned goals.</p>
<p>The concept of capacity is often mentioned by numerous authors in connection with policy implementation challenges. According to them, effective implementation should perhaps start by developing administrative capacity at the local level – by administrative capacity we mean all the different types of resources, human, material, mentalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0020852311430283">Honadle, 2001</xref>); otherwise, by focusing exclusively on the development of the legal framework, the premises for a ‘strained transparency’ are created – inability to cope with transparency due to an absence of resources or misunderstanding of information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0020852311430283">Pasquier and Villeneuve, 2007</xref>). At the local level, public authorities experience additional challenges with regard to administrative capacity. In the case of Romania, there seem to be three main causes of this situation: fragmentation of local government coupled with a low associative culture; lack of trained human resources; and limited access to ICTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0020852311430283">Dragoş and Neamţu, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0020852311430283">Government of Romania/Ministry of Interior and Administrative Reform, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The second paradigm refers to the concept of social change as it applies to the institutional/administrative reform process. Most of the reforms in the former communist countries took place in a context guided by international actors who provided the principles for good governance and ‘exported’ models of best practices regarding democratic governance, transparency, and citizen participation. Very often the countries in transition saw the reforms as an end in themselves (meeting the requirements of international organizations; the EU in the case of new candidate countries), and less as a means toward achieving a more efficient government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0020852311430283">Frost, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0020852311430283">James, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0020852311430283">Obradović, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0020852311430283">Sandu (1999)</xref> discusses two different contexts in which institutional change takes place. First, there is a justificatory context in which change takes place in order to remedy a negative state associated with the past. In this context, change is oriented toward a clear finality, a state considered desirable in contrast to the past. Means are perceived as having only secondary importance. Second, there is a pragmatic context to change in which decision-makers first evaluate the institutional, material, human and cultural environment/resources in order to determine the field in which change is needed and how to proceed to achieve the desired results. Usually, the justificatory context is related to countries which experienced communism or other totalitarian regimes and are currently pursuing democracy; the pragmatic context is usually found in societies with a consolidated democracy and administrative system.</p>
<p>The third paradigm employs the concepts of close-knit and open communication systems in describing rural communities. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0020852311430283">Farley et al. (1982)</xref> refer to one of the main characteristics of rural communities, namely the lack of anonymity, and argue that it creates an open communication system. ‘Within an open communication system, news and information travel fast, and people generally are aware of each other’s comings and goings. Because of this system, rural life is sometimes described as a “fish bowl”. An important aspect of communities with small population is that the residents tend to be acquainted with each other in multiple ways’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0020852311430283">Carlton-LaNey et al., 2005</xref>: 408). Members have easy access to reliable information through direct and informal communication with other members. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0020852311430283">Ginsberg (1998)</xref> argues that this open communication system in rural areas is the direct result of the low density of population, the high density of social networks, and the high proportion of acquaintanceship, in addition to the more traditional values and norms of behavior in rural areas. While the type of communication described earlier can be an asset for the community, it can also act as a hindrance when government organizations try to develop new institutions and mechanisms within that community.</p>

<sec id="sec8-0020852311430283"><title>4.1. Research questions</title>
<p>The main research questions are: Where are the weaknesses in the implementation of Law no. 52/2003 in rural settings in Romania? Why do they occur? What could be changed to alleviate these weaknesses?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-0020852311430283"><title>4.2. Research hypotheses</title>
<p>Our research hypotheses are: (a) low administrative capacity at the local level acts as a major hindrance toward the implementation of the procedural requirements of the transparency law; (b) cultural, communication, and social practices within rural areas could complement some of the mandated procedural requirements that are not currently implemented; and (c) there are significant differences among rural communities in terms of implementation based on two variables: the distance from a major urban center and the size of the community in terms of population. We hypothesized: a positive relationship between the size of the community and the implementation level of the provision of Law no. 52/2003; and a negative relationship between the distance from an urban center and the implementation level of the provision of Law no. 52/2003.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-0020852311430283"><title>4.3. Research methods and instruments</title>
<p>We used a mixed-method approach to answer our research questions. This included a quantitative survey, direct observation, and follow-up interviews after the observation took place. The survey was used in order to determine which provisions of the law are implemented and how. It was based on 12 items that roughly correspond to the provisions of the law as well as three more general questions regarding the activity of the local public authority. Six questions were open-ended, while for the rest the respondents were given predetermined multiple choices. In each administration, the civil servant in charge of implementation of Law no. 52/2003 or the legal secretary filled out the survey in the presence of a field researcher.</p>
<p>The second method used is direct observation. First, the field researcher had to double-check if the implementation status reported by the civil servant was accurately portrayed. Based on an observation check-list, the field researcher had to identify if there were any inconsistencies between what was declared and observed (multiple observations at various times). It was possible to check most of the items from the survey against the observation check-list. When discrepancies were found, field researchers carried out informal discussions with the civil servant to see why this happens. The motivation for using both self-reporting and direct observation for assessing the status of implementation was determined by the previous studies done by NGOs which described the existence of discrepancies between self-reporting and what occurred in reality. Second, the field researchers sat through three Local Council meetings and observed whether the provisions of the law regarding public meetings were respected.</p>
<p>A third method is represented by interviews. During the interviews the researchers were interested in getting motives, explanations about why certain provisions of the law were not implemented and what could be done in order to change this. Interviewers also checked findings from the survey and observations when they spoke with these individuals.</p>
<p>Data gathering was carried out from January to December 2007 in 60 rural communities from the Transylvania region (this is the largest, in terms of territory, historical province of Romania; together with Muntenia, the region that comprises the capital city, they represent the most economically developed regions of Romania). Some of the communities were revisited during the course of 2008 and 2009, mostly for clarification of incomplete data gathered during the initial stage of the research as well as for additional interviews. The sample was developed as follows: The region comprises 15 counties; thus four communities were chosen from each county based on two selection criteria: (1) distance from an urban center (<italic>municipiu</italic>) (communities close to an urban center – distance less than 20 km and communities far from an urban center – distance more than 20 km); (2) size of the community (small communities – population 5000 or fewer and large communities – population over 5000). By combining the two criteria, the following categories of the sample were established: 1.1. small communities close to an urban center; 1.2. small communities far from an urban center; 2.1. large communities close to an urban center; and 2.2. large communities far from an urban center. All the rural communities in the 15 counties of the region were classified according to the aforementioned criteria; then for each county one community was randomly chosen from each category.</p>

<sec id="sec11-0020852311430283"><title>5. Major findings</title>
<p>This section offers a detailed description and analysis of the data gathered using the mixed-methods approach. Sub-sections 5.1 through 5.4 each starts with the data obtained from the survey which are analyzed using frequencies. More in-depth explanations are provided from the interviews and the direct observation. The implementation of the provisions of Law no. 52/2003 is assessed in relation to four main dimensions: publicity, participation of the public in the drafting of local regulations and in public meetings, the self-evaluation report on the implementation of the Law no. 52/2003 (these are described more in detail in Section 2.2), and complaint resolution in this field by the local public authorities. The law itself is structured along these lines; therefore, for clarity, we kept the same structure in the analysis of the empirical findings. Sub-section 5.5 deals with misreporting by local public authorities which surfaced from comparing data from the survey with direct observation.</p>
<sec id="sec12-0020852311430283"><title>5.1. Publicity</title>
<p>The data from the surveys showed that the most frequent method for publicity is to post announcements and documents inside the village hall building. In addition, only a very small number of the communities that were analyzed used all three methods required by law: five communities for communicating the drafts of acts pending adoption and three for announcing the local council meetings (see Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0020852311430283">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0020852311430283">2</xref>). During follow-up interviews, local authorities stated that it is impossible for them to comply with all the publicity requirements since in some communities there is no local newspaper or/and an official website.

<p>With regard to publicity, the law also requires local authorities to include certain items of information in their announcements – i.e. the announcements of the local council meetings need to include in addition to minimum elements such as the day/date, the hour and the place, information about the agenda of the meeting and a brief description of the main topics. However, in more than half of the communities (32) the announcements did not include the agenda of the meeting.</p>
<p>In many communities the standard practice of the local authorities is to use publicity to announce their intention to adopt a certain regulation, but then to immediately proceed to its adoption without waiting the minimum ten days for receiving recommendations. During interviews we were told that ‘there is no point in waiting’, because very often there is no feedback from the citizens or NGOs. When such feedback arrives, there are ways to get around it since these recommendations are only consultative. The final regulation does not need to make reference to them.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec13-0020852311430283"><title>5.2. Receiving recommendations and organizing public meetings</title>
<p>These two obligations of the local authorities are discussed together because they can be assessed only in relationship to the demand of citizens for transparency and participation. The data from the survey showed that the demand for transparency and participation in the rural communities analyzed is limited. The demand for transparency includes the involvement of the citizens/civil society organizations in the process of drafting the local regulations by requesting a copy of the draft of the local regulations pending adoption, by making recommendations and by requesting the organization of public meetings for the discussion of these regulations. In the last two years in 38 communities nobody requested a copy of local regulations pending adoption. In addition, in 46 communities there was no request for the organization of public meetings. Also, in only 12 communities did citizens/civil society organizations make recommendations for the altering of the proposed regulations (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0020852311430283">Table 3</xref>). In the majority of the communities where recommendations were drafted, their number varied between one and nine.

<p>Public administration appears to be responsive in those limited situations when citizens/civil society organizations make recommendations for altering the regulations pending adoption. Out of the 12 public authorities that received recommendations, only one ignored them altogether, while four others incorporated them partially.</p>
<p>During interviews public servants were asked to offer their opinion regarding the citizens’ low demand for participation and involvement in the drafting of local regulation. Several interviewees stated that public affairs are often too complex for the rural residents and that the former communist regime fostered a culture of reliance on state authorities mixed with limited trust in the other community members.</p>
<p>The data from the survey also show that most local public authorities do not organize public meetings (in other situations than those mandated by law). The law gives them the opportunity to organize these meetings when issues of public interest arise in the community. In 45 communities no public meeting had been organized in the last two years (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0020852311430283">Table 4</xref>). When such public meetings are organized, participation is low, with an average of 18 citizens per meeting. Issues that commonly triggered participation in these rural communities are related to everyday life. The most common matter that brought people together was the management of the resources held in common, i.e. grazing lands. No specific topic seems to trigger a huge interest and participation in all communities (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0020852311430283">Table 5</xref>). During interviews most public servants referred to the ‘apathy’ of the citizens in order to justify the lack of public meetings. One public servant stated, ‘Why organize these meetings if people do not show up? We only seem to attract the typical complainers who do not have anything specific to say.’

<p>Citizens’ participation in local council meetings (which are held on a regular basis, with a certain frequency) is somewhat more significant than other types of participation. In only 11 communities had there been no civic participation in local council meetings in the last two years. Average participation in most communities (as declared by public officials) is below 25 citizens per meeting; however, it is slightly higher than in the case of public meetings. The issues that triggered participation in local council meetings are similar to those for public meetings. In this case, however, the management of the commons appears to be more often mentioned, followed by the budget and roads maintenance (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0020852311430283">Table 5</xref>).</p>
<p>Field researchers attended three local council meetings in each community in the sample. In 44 of the communities monitored there were no citizens at any of the three meetings observed. The number of citizens who participate generally varies between one and 20, consistent with what has been found so far from the other data collected. In most cases citizens have had passive participation, merely sitting through the meeting without expressing any personal comment or opinion. Public authorities in most cases responded positively to the citizens who participated and tried to comply with the requirements of the law. In only three cases out of 25 did the chair of the meeting not invite the citizens to express their opinions. Issues that triggered participation are also similar with what was discovered so far: resources held in common, the budget, public safety and roads.</p>
<p>During interviews we were told that in many communities, in addition to the formally organized public meetings, there are other informal public consultations. Oftentimes 10 to 15 citizens would show up in front of the mayor and make inquiries about a specific problem. In some communities the civil servants interviewed stated that sometimes council members or the mayor make the staff draft the minutes of public meetings that never took place. The field researchers were able to verify this statement in only three communities where there were more minutes posted that the number of meetings organized formally.</p>
<p>The relatively low demand for transparency as well as the small number of proactive initiatives on the part of local public organizations that could foster participation take place in an institutional context that is specific to rural areas: on average, there are up to five times less general administrative acts adopted than in a large urban area (in 37 communities the number of general acts adopted varied between one and 100, while the average number of general acts adopted by the cities that are county seats for the 15 counties in the sample was 1320 in 2008). In addition, only in two communities were there active NGOs.</p>

<sec id="sec14-0020852311430283"><title>5.3. Self-evaluation report on the status of implementation of Law no. 52/2003</title>
<p>From the entire sample, 36 local authorities declared in the survey that they had prepared the annual self-evaluation report on the status of implementation of Law no. 52/2003. Different methods were used for publicity, with most of the communities choosing to post it inside the village hall building (22 communities). The information included most often by the local authorities in their reports is: the number of participants at public hearings, the number of recommendations received from citizens and NGOs and the number of recommendations included in the final acts (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0020852311430283">Table 6</xref>).

<p>The reports are in many cases very schematic, not meant to provide an actual account of what was done in that community. During interviews in several communities, the civil servants admitted that the mayor asked them to be as brief as possible, to have a report in case somebody checks, but ‘not to overdo’ the information offered.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec15-0020852311430283"><title>5.4. Complaint resolution</title>
<p>In addition to the procedural requirements described above, the transparency law also contains provisions regarding the legal remedies available to citizens in cases when their rights to participate in and be informed about the local decision-making process have been infringed upon by the local public authorities. In such situations, the citizens can lodge a complaint first with the public authority, and then, if the problem is not solved, they can bring the case in front of a court of law. The large majority of the communities included in the sample (58) declared in the survey that they had not received any complaints from the citizens in the last three years. Two communities declared that they received complaints from citizens but tried to solve them out of court. Only two citizens in one community were dissatisfied with the decision of the public authorities and challenged them in court.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec16-0020852311430283"><title>5.5. Misreporting</title>
<p>This sub-section describes one aspect that surfaced from our mixed-methods approach, namely misreporting by the local public authorities in the survey. Direct observation was used in order to determine the accuracy of what local authorities reported in the survey. Significant discrepancies were observed with regard to certain mandatory requirements of the law (publicity for example). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0020852311430283">Table 7</xref> shows these discrepancies with regard to publicity for regulations pending adoption, announcements of local council meetings and the drafting and publication of the transparency report. During follow-up interviews, local authorities offered two reasons for misreporting: they feared that either the institution or the public servant responsible for implementing the procedural requirements of the transparency law might be found liable; they feared negative publicity and being portrayed as non-transparent in the media. With regard to the second motivation, some of the communities in our sample had also been monitored by NGOs. Once the results of this monitoring were made public, the local authorities received a lot of bad publicity. They were extremely nervous about any new research even though we repeatedly stated that anonymity would be ensured.

<p>By comparing the data in the survey with what was directly observed, another tendency was identified: local public authorities seem to comply only formally with the requirements of the law, even if in reality there are challenges. The transparency law requires every local public authority to designate a public servant to be responsible for the implementation of the provisions of the transparency law. Generally speaking, for large local public authorities such a requirement is easy to comply with; in rural communities, however, where there is a constant lack of personnel, such a provision poses great challenges. In order to comply with this provision of the transparency law, most local public organizations decided to designate the <italic>secretary of the commune</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0020852311430283">1</xref></sup> as the liaison person between the community and the institution. The secretary holds an important position in any local public authority but even more important in rural communities where he (or she) is very often the only person trained to understand and apply the law. From direct observation it resulted that in 14 of the researched communities nobody was designated to deal with issues related to the implementation of transparency law requirements. In the rest of the communities it is not clear, however, how many of them really have a person in charge and how many just consider the secretary to be responsible for everything involving legal matters, including transparency.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec17-0020852311430283"><title>6. Discussion</title>
<p>The level of implementation of the procedural provisions of Law no. 52/2003 in the surveyed rural communities is low – the majority of the communities (43) comply with less than half of the mandatory requirements. The challenges faced by local authorities as well as the reasons why these occur are discussed below.</p>
<p>The main problem appears to be the existence of universal provisions in the text of Law no. 52/2003 for all local public authorities (by universal provisions we mean that all public authorities, irrespective of their size, location, and capacity have to implement the same requirements of the law; moreover, the law clearly states the means to be used during implementation). These provisions establish in detail how the transparency requirements are to be carried out, irrespective of the administrative capacity of these local authorities and the characteristics of the communities in which they are located. We will briefly refer to these two variables separately.</p>
<p>With regard to administrative capacity, the most frequent problems cited by local public authorities are: limited number of trained civil servants – when they exist, there is a tendency to fulfill multiple positions that require their skills, thus the implementation of transparency provisions becomes an additional task, often considered by the public organization as less important than the other ones (a ‘hassle’, as stated by one of the interviewees); and sparse financial resources that in some cases are not enough to finance e.g. a website – numerous public authorities received grants from the national government to create a website; however, once the grant money was exhausted, no other resources were identified to keep the website updated.</p>
<p>With regard to administrative capacity, important intra-rural variations were discovered. Past reports and the literature already cited have addressed the issue of important differences regarding administrative capacity and implementation between urban and rural areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0020852311430283">Dragoş and Neamţu, 2007</xref>). An overall implementation score was computed for each community. One point was given for the complete implementation of each of the mandatory requirements of the law. For doing more than what the law required they earned extra points (half a point for each non-mandatory initiative). Based on the scores obtained, we ranked all the communities in the sample and looked at the communities that ranked in the first ten and respectively in the last ten. We were interested in how this score relates to the size of the community and the distance from an urban center. In the communities that ranked in the top ten, one had a population below 5000 (the threshold for small); all of the communities in top ten were close to an urban center. In the communities ranked at the bottom, two were large communities, population over 5000, while one was close to an urban center.</p>
<p>During interviews, we asked the civil servants to speculate on this topic. With regard to size, we were told that large communities can usually afford to have a specialized person who deals with the implementation of Law no. 52/2003. These public authorities usually also have more money to invest in training and in publicity. In the case of communities close to an urban center they tend to emulate the model of the metropolis. In five communities we were told that there is a transfer of personnel between city public authorities and the rural ones – people who move to the suburban communities, people who are no longer employed by the city government, and young graduates, usually highly trained, who stay for a short period of time until a position opens up in the city.</p>
<p>The second variable discussed refers to the characteristics of communication and public participation in rural communities which sets them apart. With regard to publicity, we were told during the interviews that citizens tend to get informed using less formal channels. In several communities, leaflets announcing Local Council meetings are placed inside the general store, post office or church. Also, in smaller communities, important public announcements are made directly, by a civil servant who goes from house to house (or by using a megaphone on the main streets). Demand for transparency, though low when measured against the criteria from the law, can be substantial. We were told that in many communities verbal recommendations are a frequent practice and that public meetings are sometimes held in a less formal setting. This is facilitated by the fact that most citizens know the mayor, the local councilors, and the civil servants.</p>
<p>Significant variations in administrative capacity not only between urban and rural communities but intra-rural as well, coupled with the existence of specific characteristics of communication and participation in rural communities, seem to support the idea that universal provisions on how to carry out procedural transparency requirements may result in limited implementation. One option would be to allow for more flexibility with regard to the very procedures and/or means used for achieving the goals of transparency.</p>
<p>A second main problem refers to the discrepancy between the overall goal of transparency (as defined in the law) and the specifics of how transparency procedures are to be carried out. From our research it surfaced that the means (transparency procedures) are not adequate for meeting the goals of the law. For example, in some rural communities the Internet is used for publicity. Though this means that the provision of the law is met, in fact it has limited impact on the citizens. In rural communities in general, Internet access is limited (less that 15 percent of the total rural population is covered by two broadband internet networks) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0020852311430283">National Authority for Management and Regulation in Communications in Romania, 2009</xref>) and computer literacy is even lower. Another example related to publicity refers to the publication of announcements in the mass media. In many communities there is no newspaper. Formally, the requirement is met by publication in a municipal/county newspaper or in an official journal, which does not reach all the citizens. This understanding of the relationship between the goal of the law and the procedures attached to it is consistent with the paradigm of reform that takes place in a justificatory context – authorities become more concerned with the law itself and less preoccupied about whether or not the implementation contributes toward a more transparent and open government. Numerous interviewees claimed that economic and infrastructure problems are the main issues public authorities should tackle; these types of legal requirment are only secondary and should be met when possible.</p>
<p>A third main problem is related to the relationship between the central government and local authorities on the one hand and local authorities and their constituencies on the other hand. According to local authorities, higher tiers of government are aware of local problems (limited administrative capacity) but are indifferent and/or helpless in offering solutions. Our interviewees told us that very often central government claims that local authorities are autonomous so it cannot interfere. Another argument put forth by the central government refers to the assistance available to local authorities mostly in the context of assistance programs financed by international organizations (the World Bank and the EU). Higher level government authorities also blame local authorities for conditions they sometimes create or facilitate, mainly territorial fragmentation (existing administrative units split into smaller units that fight to gain local representation and their own budget; administrative capacity is almost never a prerequisite for deciding whether to split or not). All these factors seem to encourage local authorities to go through the procedural requirements as if they were a check-list. Because other tiers are aware of a limited administrative capacity in rural areas, local authorities can always claim that there are exterior factors to be blamed for not complying with the provisions of Law no. 52/2003. In this way, the premises for ‘strained transparency’ are created: public authorities use their limited capacity as a justification for complying only formally with the legal requirements. This situation is worsened by the fact that in Romania in general, and in rural areas in particular, there is a limited culture geared toward public participation and holding local authorities responsible for their actions. Currently local authorities, despite numerous instances of non-compliance, are not held accountable by either other tiers of the government or by the citizens.</p>

<sec id="sec18-0020852311430283"><title>7. Recommendations and concluding remarks</title>
<p>This section deals with the last part of our research question, namely what can be done in order to overcome the challenges discussed above? In light of the issues discussed in the previous section, our recommendations are structured around two key ideas: (a) First, to offer some discretionary power to the local authorities regarding specific procedural requirements. This implies more flexibility regarding the means used for achieving the result, and, at the same time, the abandonment of the universal procedural provisions. (b) Second, as a corollary of discretion, to establish more severe penalties for those authorities which do not comply with the provisions of the law. In our opinion these two goals can be attained by the codification of the procedural requirements of transparency into a code of administrative procedure.</p>
<p>The codification process would result in the inclusion of the transparency requirements in the regular administrative procedures for adopting administrative acts, which can have as an effect better implementation and enforcement. This implies that the penalty for not complying with the law (nullity of the acts adopted) would be more drastic in an objective sense, because it would relate to the acts that are adopted, and not to the persons that are implementing the law. This will engage local authorities to pay more attention to how the provisions are implemented and, most important, to shift attention from the procedure of transparency to the scope of the transparency rules. The codification would imply some discretion given to the local authorities with regard to how they choose to implement the transparency requirements, coupled, however, with an obligation of diligence, so that courts can review the abuse of discretion. In this way, communities will be able to choose the best methods for being transparent, methods that fit the profile of the community and the citizens, and, in the case of abuse, the courts can have a say in the matter.</p>
<p>In the draft project of the Administrative Procedure Code of Romania (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0020852311430283">Ministry of Interior and Administrative Reform, 2007</xref>), the provisions regarding public hearings, public debates, participation in drafting general administrative acts, and public meetings of deliberative authorities, were inserted among the general requirements of a lawful administrative procedure. This idea came up in the context in which Romania has adopted Law no. 52/2003 regarding transparency in the decision-making process, and has only recently made definitive steps toward adopting a general administrative procedure code. It is argued, thus, that the principles of Law no. 52/2003 should govern the whole administrative procedure, and cease being just another ‘specialized law’ that is implemented in practice only if some state authority is supervising its implementation. In our opinion it is merely a myth to believe in standardized procedures (as it concerns Law no. 52/2003) for both urban and rural areas, because of the different administrative capacities, different demands on the part of citizens, and different ways of public participation. It is far from clear, however, at this point in time if such a solution would be accepted, given the strong opposition of the NGOs.</p>
