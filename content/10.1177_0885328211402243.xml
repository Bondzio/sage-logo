<abstract>
<p>Hyaluronic acid (HA) and fibrin glue (FG) are effective hydrogels for tissue engineering applications as they support tissue in-growth, retain growth factors, and release them slowly with time. The scaffolds, in combination with a hydrogel, effectuate a successful graft. However, the survival of a graft entirely depends upon a functional vascular supply. Therefore, hydrogels must support the in-growing vasculature. To study and compare the vascular patterns, HA and FG hydrogel<bold>-</bold>containing PLDLLA-TCP-PCL scaffolds were implanted in the groin of male Lewis rats and supplied with a micro-surgically prepared arterio-venous (A-V) loop. The rats were perfused with a vascular contrast media after 4 and 8 weeks and sacrificed for further analysis. The specimens were scanned with micro-CT to find the vascular growth patterns. Corrosion casting of blood vessels followed by SEM demonstrated a high vascular density near the parent blood vessels. Histologically, HA and FG implanted animal groups showed significant angiogenetic activity, especially within the pores of the scaffold. However, formation of new blood vessels was more conspicuously observed at 4 weeks in FG than HA implants. Furthermore, by 8 weeks, the number and pattern of blood vessels were comparable between them. At this time, HA was still present indicating its slow degradation. The finding was confirmed by histomorphometric analysis. This experimental study demonstrates that HA containing composite scaffold systems permit stabile in-growth of blood vessels due to sustained degradation over 8 weeks. HA is a potential matrix for a tissue engineered composite graft.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0885328211402243" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>The supply of nutrients and oxygen is the most limiting factor for the survival of a graft in tissue engineering applications. Most of the cells cannot survive if they are located beyond 200–500 µm distance from a capillary.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0885328211402243">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0885328211402243">2</xref></sup> The central core of an implant is most likely to be jeopardized without vascular development and depending on the size of the implant, needs weeks of time. A functional micro-vascular network of a graft is an integral component for cells to grow, differentiate, and function. Therefore, for tissue engineering application<bold>s</bold>, three-dimensional (3D) scaffolds supplied with cultured cells or growth factors necessitate a fast development of functional vascular supply.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0885328211402243">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>For the induction of vascularization from the host blood vessels, the cascade of events starts from endothelial (precursor) cell (EC) migration in response to angio-inductive growth factors, especially VEGF. Needless to say, a number of approaches have been attempted either with EC or VEGF <italic>in vitro</italic> for a vascularized graft though they usually require additional factors for vasculature development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0885328211402243">4</xref></sup> At present, most approaches to support or induce vascularization of engineered tissues are based on the so called ‘extrinsic’ mode of vascularization, which does not allow transfer of vascularized grafts to a distant site.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0885328211402243">5</xref></sup> Therefore, from a practical point of view, an axially vascularized tissue is preferable, where a central core of vessels supply the graft from inside out in a centrifugal manner. Clinically they can be immediately vascularized upon transplantation to a defect site either as a pedicled graft or using microsurgical techniques similar to free flaps.</p>
<p>Recently, a number of methods have been advised for successful induction of axial vascularization: An arterio-venous (A-V) shunt loop, typically made by an anastomosis between an artery and a vein by microsurgical techniques with inter-positional artery or vein graft;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0885328211402243">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0885328211402243">6</xref></sup> A-V bundle with distally ligated vessels, or flow-through configuration of intact vessels have been successfully applied. Though all of these techniques allow generation of new tissue and blood vessels, the shunt loops especially with a venous graft showed a greater potential for vascularized tissue formation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0885328211402243">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0885328211402243">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Different components of the 3D scaffolds affect its degradation and angioinductive potential.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0885328211402243">9</xref></sup> A number of biomaterials such as synthetic polymers, bioceramics, and some natural substances have been evaluated for bone engineering applications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0885328211402243">10</xref></sup> Saturated poly-hydroxy esters such as poly(<sc>l</sc>-lactide-co-<sc>d,l</sc>-lactide) (PLDLLA) have high mechanical strength, controllable degradation with metabolizable byproducts, and significant osteo-conductive potential.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0885328211402243">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0885328211402243">12</xref></sup> Poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL), another elastomeric polyester, can be used to enhance bone regeneration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0885328211402243">13</xref></sup> In combination, they effectuate an optimum scaffold, because PLDLLA degrades fast, while PCL degrades slowly. In addition to them, β-tri-calcium phosphate (TCP) is incorporated to provide hydrophilicity and counteract any pH alteration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0885328211402243">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although the above-mentioned scaffolds provide mechanical support, they may not actively aid in cell integration and differentiation, because the synthetic polymer does not provide adequate chemical signals for transplanted or host-derived cells. To achieve this, ECM-components can be incorporated or other functional domains can be enriched on the surface.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0885328211402243">15</xref></sup> An alternative technical approach, which mimics the physiological environment, is to use a biomimetic temporary cell carrier in the form of a hydrogel around the scaffold. A significant advantage of hydrogels compared to the relatively hydrophobic polymers is that cell receptor ligands and other molecules can be easily incorporated in them to achieve cell adhesion, migration, and differentiation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0885328211402243">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0885328211402243">17</xref></sup> They can also act as a temporary reservoir for growth factors and allow sustained and controlled release of these bioactive molecules over time.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0885328211402243">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>Fibrin glue (FG) is one of the commonly used hydrogel for such applications. It has been used for delivery of growth factors for wound healing, bone induction, and angioinduction in numerous tissue engineering applications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0885328211402243">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0885328211402243">19</xref></sup> Hyaluronic acid (HA) plays an important role in cell proliferation, morphogenesis, wound repair, and inflammation. In addition, HA oligosaccharides promote angiogenesis, while high molecular weight HA retards it.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0885328211402243">20</xref></sup> A modified HA hydrogel is reported, which is a nonsulfated glycosaminoglycan, distributed widely in extracellular matrix.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0885328211402243">21</xref></sup> Both hydrogels have promising properties that might allow generation of biologically active engineered tissues for different types of applications.</p>
<p>The aim of the present study was to develop a polymer-hydrogel composite that might be used for generation of axially vascularized bioartificial bone tissues. The biocompatibility of PLDLLA-TCP-PCL scaffolds to osteoblast-like cells was evaluated <italic>in vitro</italic>. The influence of two different hydrogel matrices (HA and FG) in composite porous polymer scaffolds on vascular in-growth was investigated in an axial isolation chamber vascularization model and resorption kinetics of these matrices were assessed.</p>

<sec id="sec4-0885328211402243"><title>Scaffold fabrication</title>
<p>The scaffolds were fabricated using an in-house rapid prototyping (RP) system, namely the screw extrusion system (SES), utilizing three different materials: Poly(<sc>l</sc>-lactide-co-<sc>d,l</sc>-lactide) (PLDLLA, Boehringer-Ingelheim, Ingelheim am Rein, Germany), Poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL, Absorbable Polymers, US), β-tri-calcium phosphate (TCP, Progentix, MB Bilthoven, Netherlands), in a ratio of 64%, 16%, and 20%, respectively by weight. The details of the fabrication method are described elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0885328211402243">22</xref></sup> Briefly, it exploits a layer-by-layer fabrication technique to assemble 3D structures by depositing two-dimensional (2D) supporting struts based on specified lay-down patterns to assemble the whole structure. Material is fed into the top of the barrel chamber, heated to a molten liquefied state at 120°C and transported towards a 400 µm nozzle with aided displacement and pressure from the turning screw feed.</p>
<p>Scaffold sheets of 50 × 50 × 1.5 mm<sup>3</sup> were fabricated with a 0°–90° lay-down pattern. Discs with 8 mm diameter were punched out from it and fabricated into bobbin-shaped constructs using cylindrical pieces of 1.5 mm radius and 1.5 mm height for <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments using minimal amounts of chloroform (JT Baker, NJ, US), after which they were dried in a vacuum oven for 12 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0885328211402243">Figure 1</xref>(a)). The scaffolds were treated with 5 M sodium hydroxide for 5 min and rinsed with de-ionized water to yield a hydrophilic and corrugated surface. They were sterilized in 70% ethanol overnight followed by UV light for 2 h. Scaffold pieces of 5 × 5 × 8 mm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0885328211402243">3</xref></sup> were cut for mechanical tests and porosity measurement.

</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0885328211402243"><title>Porosity and mechanical properties of the scaffolds</title>
<p>Scaffold porosity was measured as a ratio of true volume to apparent volume. The true volume (<italic>V</italic><sub>t</sub>) was determined by a gas pycnometer (Accupyc 1330, Micromeritics Instrument Corp., US) at 25°C in pure Helium. The apparent volume (<italic>V</italic><sub>a</sub>) is the geometrical volume. The porosity was confirmed by micro-CT (Skyscan1076, Kontich, Belgium) using 5 µm spot size at 100 kV with a resolution of 35 µm. Mechanical compression tests were conducted by a uniaxial material testing system with a 5-kN load cell, in accordance with ASTM D695-96 guidelines (Instron 3345, Grove city, PA, US). The scaffolds were compressed at a rate of 1 mm/min up to 0.6 strain level. They were tested both in dry and wet states (<italic>n</italic> = 5 for each). In wet state, they were soaked at 37°C in a water bath for 60 min prior to the testing. The stress–strain (σ–ε) curves were obtained to evaluate the compressive stiffness (modulus) and yield strength of the scaffolds. The stiffness was calculated from the σ–ε curve as the slope of the initial linear portion of the curve. The compressive yield strength was taken at the yield point (if any) or at the end of the linear region.</p>

<sec id="sec8-0885328211402243"><title>Biocompatibility with osteoblasts</title>
<p>To analyze the biocompatibility of the scaffold materials <italic>per se</italic>, an osteoblast-like human osteosarcoma cell line (MG-63, ATCC, Manassas, VA, US) was used. The cells were cultured using expansion media (DMEM with 10% Foetal Bovine Serum, 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin, and 2 mM L-glutamine - all from Gibco, Invitrogen, CA, US). Each scaffold was seeded with 300,000 cells. The cell-scaffold constructs were further cultured in differentiation media with 25 mM HEPES (Gibco, Invitrogen, CA, US), 10 mM beta-glycerophosphate, 100 µm L-ascorbic acid-2-phosphate, and 10 nM dexamethasone (all from: Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). The culture was maintained until 6 weeks at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> with twice weekly media change. The cell-seeded scaffolds were observed by an inverted microscope (Nikon Eclipse TE2000-U, Kanagawa, Japan).</p>
<p>To analyze the cell proliferation and the protein content, cell-seeded scaffolds were washed with 1x PBS and then treated by lysis buffer containing 0.1% Triton-X in 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). The lysates were frozen at -80°C and later analyzed. Cell proliferation was evaluated using PicoGreen DNA quantification assay (Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, US) as advised by the manufacturer. The fluorescence was measured at excitation and emission wavelength of 485 and 520 nm respectively by a fluorescent microplate reader (Fluostar Optima, BMG Labtech, Germany). The values are converted to DNA amounts in ng/mL, corrected with blanks. The total protein content was assessed by BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL, USA), as advised by the manufacturer.</p>
<p>To visualize the viable and nonviable osteoblasts, cell-seeded scaffolds were washed with 1×PBS and incubated with 2 µg/mL fluorescein diacetate (FDA) (Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, US) at 37°C for 15 min. They were rinsed twice in 1×PBS and placed in 20 µg/mL propidium iodide (PI) solution (Invitrogen, CA, US) at room temperature for 2 min. Subsequently, they were viewed under a confocal laser scanning microscope (Nikon Eclipse TE2000-E, Kanagawa, Japan). The viable-cell cytoplasm was labeled green, while nonviable cell nuclei were labeled red. Additional cell-seeded scaffolds were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde (Carl Roth GmBH, Germany) in cacodylate buffer (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) and dehydrated in a gradient ethanol series up to 100% and left to dry at room temperature. They were then observed by a scanning electron microscope (Hitachi TM 1000, Tokyo, Japan).</p>

<p>With approval by the animal care committee of the University of Erlangen and the government of Mittelfranken, Germany, 20 inbred male Lewis rats (Charles-River, Sulzfeld, Germany) weighing 200–300 g were used. Animals were kept in 12 h dark–light cycle with free access to standard chow (Altromin, Hamburg, Germany) and water at the veterinary care facility of the University of Erlangen Medical Center.</p>
<p>The rats were divided into two groups, each consisting of 10 animals. The PLDLLA-TCP-PCL scaffold was loaded with either 1 mL of FG (group A) or 1 mL of hyaluronan-based hydrogel (group B) prior to implantation. In group A, a clinically approved fibrin gel (Tissuecol, Baxter, Vienna, Austria) was used with 1:1 mixture of fibrinogen (20 mg/mL in aprotinin) and thrombin (4 IU/mL in 40 mM calcium chloride). The hyaluronan-based (HA) hydrogel (Extracel-HP, Glycosan BioSystems, Salt Lake City, Utah) was supplied as a kit consisting of three components, namely thiol-modified hyaluronan and heparin, thiol-modified gelatine, and thiol-modified cross-linker, polyethylene glycol diacrylate. The components were prepared with distilled water at 37°C under aseptic conditions and were mixed at 2:2:1 ratio, respectively, according to the manufacturer's recommendations. After all components were thoroughly mixed, the hydrogels were added as such to the AV loop-scaffold constructs.

<p>All surgical procedures were performed by experienced microsurgeons using a surgical microscope (Karl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) under general anaesthesia with Isoflurane (Baxter, Unterschleißheim, Germany). The surgical technique has been described previously by our group.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0885328211402243">23</xref></sup> In brief, the femoral vessels were exposed by a longitudinal incision from the inguinal ligament to the knee.

An A-V loop was created by interposition of the vein graft between the left sided femoral artery and the left femoral vein with interrupted nonabsorbable 11-0 nylon stitches (Ethilon, Ethicon GmbH, Norderstedt, Germany). The A-V loop was placed around the PLDLLA-TCP-PCL scaffold and submerged in the hydrogel as per the groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0885328211402243">Figure 1</xref>(b)). The whole construct was placed in a sterile cylindrical teflon-chamber (inner diameter 10 mm, height 6 mm, constructed by the Institute of Materials Research, Division of Glass and Ceramics, University of Erlangen). The chamber was then capped and fixed to the underlying muscle. The skin was closed using interrupted 3-0 vicryl sutures (Ethicon GmbH, Norderstedt, Germany). All animals received 0.2 mL benzylpenicillinbenzathine (Tardomycel; Bayer, Leverkusen, Germany), buprenorphine (0.3 mg/kg rat weight) (Temgesic; Essex Chemie AG, Luzern, Switzerland), and heparin (80 IU/kg) (Liquemin; Ratiopharm, Ulm, Germany) postoperatively.</p>
<p>Explantation of the specimens was performed after 4 and 8 weeks. The aorta was cannulated and the vascular system was rinsed with heparinized Ringer solution (100 IU/mL) under hydrostatic pressure, until fluid escaping from the severed inferior vena cava was clear. One specimen from each group was used for corrosion casting as described later. The other rats were perfused with a vascular contrast media, Microfil (MV-122, Flowtech, Mass., USA) under general anesthesia for micro-CT analysis. The distal vascular system was then injected with 20 mL of Microfil containing 5% of MV Curing Agent as advised by the manufacturer. Finally the aorta and caval vein were ligated and the rats were cooled at 4°C for 24 h. Specimens were explanted <italic>in toto</italic> and fixed in 3.5% formalin.</p>

<p>For each experimental group, two specimens were randomly selected. They were scanned on a high resolution ‘ForBild’ scanner developed by Institute of Medical Physics, FAU Erlangen-Nuremberg, Germany. The constructs were scanned with following parameters: Al-0.5 mm filter, tube voltage of 40 kV, 15 µm pixel size, and 15 µm slice distance between consecutive slices.

The vascular system was then perfused with 20 mL of methylmethacrylate (MMA) resin in a mixture of 4:1 pre-polymerized oligomer to MMA monomer (Sigma Aldrich Chemie GmbH, Munich, Germany) and benzoyl oxide as a catalyst (Mercox; Ladd Research Industries, Burlington, Vt.). The rat was left in a warm water bath (50°C) for 6 h to form the poly-MMA vascular replica after complete polymerization. The construct was then left for 12 h in 7.5% sodium hydroxide at 60°C. The cycle was repeated three times. The sample was decalcified by keeping it in 2.5% hydrochloric acid at room temperature for 12 h.

In FG, the number of blood vessels was maximum at 4 weeks, which decreased nonsignificantly by 8 weeks.

<p>On the contrary, in hyaluronan hydrogel, the newly grown vessels were obviously shorter at 4 weeks with branches only along the vascular axis without deeper penetration into the matrix.

<p>The SEM images of corrosion cast replica of the vascular networks showed the detailed architecture inside the graft.

At 8 weeks of angiomorphogenesis, the neo-vascular network displayed a clear hierarchical arrangement of vessels in different orders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0885328211402243">Figure 4</xref>(f)), from arterioles to pre-capillary arterioles and gas exchanging capillaries (CL), post-capillary venules draining into venules and veins.

<sec id="sec26-0885328211402243" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>We have shown that PLDLLA-TCP-PCL, a composite polymeric scaffold, is biocompatible with osteoblast-like cells. The cells with the scaffold not only multiply but also produce proteins and extracellular matrix for a harmonious growth. Furthermore, the scaffold en bloc in presence of different hydrogels <italic>in vivo</italic> can function as a vascularized graft. To accomplish this, we have introduced two different hydrogels such as fibrin gel and hyaluronan around the scaffold, along with an A-V loop that makes the scaffold bio-integrated with the <italic>in vivo</italic> vascular system eventually producing a highly vascularized graft even without any growth factors in an ectopic site. The whole construct can be attractive, especially to create surgically implantable bone tissue engineered grafts.</p>
<p>A major drawback of using a pure biomaterial is that it can never mimic the complex nature of any tissue, especially bone. Therefore, a composite of polymer and ceramic is fabricated in this study by SES to avail the suitable properties of each of them. The mechanical properties of the scaffold are in the range of normal cancellous bone that has stiffness of 90–400 MPa and strength of 2–5 MPa.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0885328211402243">26</xref></sup> Water makes the polymer chains plasticized and the embedded ceramic particulates solubilized, which could result in weakening of the reinforcement effect in wet conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0885328211402243">27</xref></sup> Along with highly interconnected pores, a typical porosity of 60–80% and pore diameter of at least 200 µm are known to be crucial to support vascularization and tissue in-growth.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0885328211402243">28</xref></sup> The scaffolds have similar porous structure.</p>
<p>The scaffold <italic>per se</italic> demonstrated <italic>in vitro</italic> growth compatibility with the osteoblast-like cells and supported their replication, as observed in light microscopic pictures and corroborated by PicoGreen assay until week 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0885328211402243">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0885328211402243">3</xref>(a)). Thereafter, the minimal decline in PicoGreen assay might be due to maturation phase of cell growth cycle. However, the total amount of deposited protein is increasing continuously during the observation period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0885328211402243">Figure 3</xref>(b)), which might be related to the formation of extracellular matrix. Confocal and SEM microscopic pictures show the osteoblast-like cells grow well on its surface with complete colonization and producing abundant extracellular matrix. Most of the cells are healthy and alive at all time points as seen by FDA/PI staining in confocal microscope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0885328211402243">Figure 2</xref>(f) and (g)).</p>
<p>The composite scaffolds were successfully vascularized as demonstrated by micro-CT and histological analysis. In micro-CT angiograms, group A specimens displayed similar numbers of new blood vessels between 4 and 8 weeks. However, in group B, the observed number of blood vessels at 8 weeks was comparatively more than that at 4 weeks. Even so, by 8 weeks both the hydrogels showed a similar picture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0885328211402243">Figure 4</xref>(a)–(d)).</p>
<p>In the histomorphometric analysis, though the numbers of vessels among different groups are not significantly different, the number of vessels per mm<sup>2</sup> of FVT is significantly higher in group B (hyaluronan) than that in group A FG at 4 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0885328211402243">Figure 6</xref>(c)); the difference is alleviated at 8 weeks. This indicates sprouting vessels are tightly packed in a smaller volume of FVT in group B at 4 weeks. By 8 weeks, however, vessels are evenly spaced with temporal degradation of hyaluronan. Interestingly, in group B between the two time points, the FVT area and the number of vessels per mm<sup>2</sup> of FVT were reciprocally different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0885328211402243">Figure 6</xref>). This might be explained by the decreasing amount of remaining hyaluronan matrix at 8 weeks. The data correlated well with histological cross-sections.</p>
<p>In this experiment, two different kinetics of hydrogel degradation are highlighted, which have been shown to influence the type and generation of ECM.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0885328211402243">29</xref></sup> The degradation allows migrating cells to produce ECM to replace the hydrogel. The byproducts may stimulate angiogenesis subsequently. FG is degraded <italic>in vivo</italic> primarily through cell-mediated serine-protease plasmin, which is competitively inhibited by a peptide, aprotinin. However, even with its presence, the constructs are typically resorbed within 5–10 days, when the aprotinin is not specifically bound by covalent linkage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0885328211402243">30</xref></sup> In FG specimens, there was a quick resorption of the matrix and the maximum uniform formation of blood vessels, starting from the beginning, which does not change subsequently. On the contrary, the modified hyaluronan is degraded slowly by hyaluronidase of the cells. Therefore the degradation promotes both cell mobility and proliferation while supporting tissue morphology in an equivalent pattern.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0885328211402243">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>The findings have significant practical implications. The formation of invading differentiating functional tissues can be guided by the rate of degradation of hydrogel.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0885328211402243">32</xref></sup> The quick fibrinolysis and the rapid angiogenesis are helpful for a quick generation of FVT in FG matrix. This graft, when seeded with tissue-specific cells or angio-inducing factors, is useful as a pre-vascularized graft.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0885328211402243">1</xref></sup> However, with the quick release of its contained growth factors,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0885328211402243">33</xref></sup> the fast degrading hydrogels like FG may not be effective directly for bone healing. When it degrades rapidly, the empty space is usually filled by fibrotic tissue without any properly differentiated tissue. A clear example was shown that faster degrading hydrogel do not synchronize with natural healing rate in a bone defect which typically requires 4–5 weeks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0885328211402243">32</xref></sup> Slowly degrading matrices achieve better bone healing, because continuous supply of osteogenic signals are assured.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0885328211402243">34</xref></sup> In such cases, Hyaluronan hydrogel might be helpful. It may help for slow and sustained delivery of active biological cues that is an important benchmark for a mature tissue development. However, such speculations need to be properly investigated.</p>
<p>Riley et al. had shown the potential neo-vascularization ability of HA, which not only contained the growth factors by covalent bonding, but also released them slowly <italic>in vitro</italic> for 4–6 weeks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0885328211402243">35</xref></sup> However, few shortcomings are encountered for the application of the hydrogel, especially with a composite scaffold in the A-V loop chamber model. First, this activity was shown in ear pinnae of mice, where the vessels can grow randomly from anywhere around it as extrinsic vascularization. On the contrary, A-V loop model shows the axial vascularization and predicts precisely and quantitatively the inherent angioinductive nature of the hydrogel, avoiding random interference from the variable number of vessels present around. Secondly, they had shown the <italic>in vivo</italic> effect for 4 mm discs for a few weeks. However, HA is used for its longer stability <italic>in vivo</italic>. In many instances, the use of a hydrogel along with a hard scaffold is one integral component of a suitable graft. Therefore, our study necessitates the addition of PLDLA-TCP-PCL composite scaffold in wider dimensions for 4–8 weeks. Thirdly, we used a standardized protocol for counting the vessels after Microfil perfusion. The assessment of micro-vessel number might be erroneous and difficult to comment just from histology without injection techniques or specific immunostainins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0885328211402243">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>The A-V loop model in an isolation chamber setting has not only experimental but also therapeutic implications. Currently, it offers opportunities to study 3D vessel in-growth into matrices of different origin and its modulation by either pro-angiogenic or anti-angiogenic agents. By appropriate alterations of the conditions around the A-V loop, one may also be able to create a standardized, isolated environment to study matrix behavior and angiogenetic phenomena.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0885328211402243">3</xref></sup> Furthermore, the consequence of additional growth factors or cells on angiogenesis can also be precisely examined. In plastic surgery, the conventional prefabricated osteomyocutaneous flaps do not always meet the requirements of a composite defect. Therefore, utilizing patient's body as a bioreactor, a composite flap can be created as per the defect to meet such demand.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0885328211402243">5</xref></sup> The tissue component can be fed by an A-V loop for microsurgical transfer after its complete development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0885328211402243">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>The current study describes a composite pre-vascularized scaffold for tissue engineering application with continuous degradation and in-growth of vessels over time. Surgical free graft transfer with micro-vascular anastomosis is in practice for a long time in regenerative medicine to repair the diseased or damaged site with a healthy graft tissue, limited only by the availability of autograft. Our method is to create the donor graft, engineered to possess the complete functional vascular network to enable them as an ideal tissue engineered graft. In this study, a graft was prevascularized at different rates to the full extent with parental blood vessels.</p>

<p>In this study, we demonstrated that the SES system fabricated PLDLLA-TCP-PCL scaffolds possess suitable mechanical properties and are well compatible with osteoblast-like cell. An A-V loop can make the scaffold axially vascularized, which may be used for microsurgical graft transfer at a defect site. The FG hydrogel was degraded quickly with fast generation of supporting tissue, which seems attractive to apply with cells that require quick supply of nutrition. On the contrary, hyaluronan hydrogel was gradually degraded that guided slow and sustained growth of blood vessels and FVT. On this basis, it can be concluded that the PLDLLA-TCP-PCL-hydrogel scaffolds can possibly be explored for vascularized bone engineering application.</p>
