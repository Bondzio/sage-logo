<p>Journalism studies is a crowded field these days, and increasingly predominant are tomes focused on new media technologies and the new frontiers of news, reporting and journalism. It is all the more welcome then to find a book that recognizes that despite the hyperbole around online journalism, for the vast majority of the global population it is more traditional media forms of journalism that dominate news provision and consumption. This edited collection offers a necessary and timely overview of the rise of 24-hour news television in global context. This collection includes several chapters addressing British and American news channels, and Al-Jazeera, but also looks beyond these usual suspects, addressing European news channels with chapters on France, Germany and Finland, Latin America, the Arab world, India, China and Australia. The collection also gathers together an eclectic combination of authors, providing spaces for newer voices alongside some of the most established figures in the British and international media and communication landscape.</p>
<p>After an introductory chapter by the editors which notes how the rise of 24-hour news channels is as much about ‘corporate/national ideology and prestige’ (p. 9) as commercial imperatives, the book’s chapters are structured into four sections, dealing respectively with the ‘history and context of 24-hour television news’, the move ‘towards an increasingly live, breaking news service’, issues of ‘competing for regional influence and audiences’, and closing with a section on ‘national agendas and editorial strategies’. Stephen Cushion begins the first section with a chapter outlining the three phases of 24-hour news channels, identifying a nascent phase linked to the launch of CNN in the early 1980s; a second phase when rivals to CNN’s emerging global influence developed, also seeking ‘transnational reach and influence’ (p. 19) through the 1990s, such as Al-Jazeera; and a current third phase of regionalization, with channels produced and aimed at regional or national audiences rather than global audiences, though Cushion cautions that ‘the political economy of a 24-hour news station … polices the boundaries of how local, national or international a rolling news station’s news agenda is’ (p. 24). After a chapter from Michael Bromley tracing the parallel turns to the visual in newspapers and television news during the time period in which news channels have emerged and proliferated, Mugdha Rai and Simon Cottle present a chapter detailing the extent and nature of news channel provision globally, endorsing Cushion’s emphasis on political economy. Rai and Cottle point out that while there are, as of 2009, over 100 news channels extant globally, only a handful of these are truly global in reach and approach, and these channels remain dominated by western organizations and news agendas (p. 66). The majority of news channels are regional or national in scope, although there are patterns of regional media organizations dominating in some areas (p. 67), and a significant issue lies in the difference between <italic>reach</italic> and <italic>access</italic> (pp. 69–70) in that many channels are available only via subscription services within satellite or cable providers such that <italic>access</italic> is often far harder to achieve for audiences. Rai and Cottle conclude that the potential for a global public sphere through increasing plurality of news channels remains, with often dynamic regional/local level activity evidence of this, but political economy concerns about western dominance of global news flows remain valid. These concerns, they argue, should not be seen as a simple either/or between homogenization on the one hand and diversification on the other, but rather a more complicated interplay between global and regional influences on the political economy of news channels (p. 76). Justin Lewis’s chapter concluding this section takes a more contextual and normative approach, looking primarily at the UK case, and considers the missed opportunity for 24-hour news channels to provide for democratic communication in how they have ended up conforming to the dominant model of ‘disposable news’ in consumer culture, reproducing the ‘built-in obsolescence’ of news as a commodity. Lewis highlights how structuring news in the form of rolling chunks, the emphasis on ‘breaking’ news and liveness all undermine the potential for news channels to make use of the time and space available to them to provide depth, analysis and explanation that might better serve democracy.</p>
<p>The second section of the book takes up this theme with a series of chapters critically examining the focus of news channels on rolling news, breaking news and the live report, with the political economy concerns remaining a consistent underlying theme. Chris Paterson discusses the little researched impact of television news agencies on news channels provision, indicating how just two global agencies (APTN and Reuters) significantly plan, structure and dictate the nature and format of many apparently live, breaking stories, in ways that are rarely acknowledged to audiences. CA Tuggle, Peter Casella and Suzanne Huffman explore US news channels in terms of producer and audience attitudes, and find that commercial imperatives rather than journalistic ones drive producers to concentrate on live reporting even when it results in so-called ‘black hole’ reports (p. 133) where reporters are at locations of events long after the event is over and all the participants have gone home. Their research shows that audiences actually ‘disdain’ these kind of reports while recognizing the occasional justification of live reporting when the story merits it (p. 148). A second chapter by Cushion traces the growth of competition between the two main British news channel providers, the public service broadcaster the BBC and the commercial broadcaster Sky, and how public service principles have been over-ridden in competition for breaking news and live reporting become the dominant mode of competition for news channel audiences in Britain (p. 127). John Sugden and Alan Tomlinson’s chapter illustrates how the poverty of the structures of rolling news, breaking news and ‘liveness’ both enables dedicated sports news channels to emerge (writing about Britain) but also reproduces the superficiality of content that arises from the book as a whole as a central critique of the missed potential of 24-hour news channels. The final chapter of this section, by Laura Juntunen, offers an interesting case study of journalistic attitudes in Finland, where no domestic 24-hour television news channel exists, and how global trends for a ‘need for speed’ in journalism are nonetheless influencing journalistic practices in Finland. Focusing on two school shooting incidents in 2007/2008, Juntunen’s interviews with journalists reveal clear evidence of their sense of the pressures of technology, audiences and competition on an increasing emphasis on immediacy and ‘real-time’ delivery of news (p. 178).</p>
<p>This chapter signals the third section of the book, which moves beyond the US/UK focus in a series of chapters concerned with other regions and countries, and where the book really becomes distinctive and valuable. Mohamed Zayani’s chapter provides an historical overview of news channels in the Arab world, highlighting the influence of Al-Jazeera and the politico-economic constraints on the potential development and impact of regional television news channels in the Arab world. Reading this chapter after the ‘Arab Spring’ it is interesting to see the concerns expressed about the limits to the potential for an emerging regional public sphere via news channels (p. 195). Muhammad Ayish’s chapter on Al-Jazeera’s coverage of the conflict in Gaza offers a useful case study illustrating the potential of news channels to contribute in this sense, as a close content/frame analysis of the coverage suggests that while the channel’s moral sympathies were evidently with the people of Gaza, and a propensity for an emphasis on the graphic and visual, the predominant approach taken by the channel conformed to professional journalistic values (p. 238). Also in this section Claudia and Oliver Boyd-Barrett use the case of TeleSUR in Latin America, to examine the extent to which providers other than the dominant western players (labelled as ‘hegemonic’) and their local agencies (‘subaltern’) can operate as ‘counter-hegemonic’ agencies (p. 200). Providing an in-depth instantiation of the regional providers identified earlier in the book as distinguishing the latest phase of development, their consideration of TeleSUR highlights the tensions between challenges to the globally dominant players, and their ideological agendas (which are primarily US-driven in Latin America), and the limits on the independence of these channels from their domestic paymasters, in TeleSUR’s case, Latin American governments’, particularly Venezuelan, interests (p. 214). The last chapter in this section, by Sally Young, is the only chapter in the book to look in any substantive detail at the audience for news channels, something of a missed opportunity. In the Australian context, Young acknowledges that the regular audiences for such channels are tiny (with typically less than 1% share of the audience) and composed of ‘news junkies’ (p. 250). As with Juntunen, Young notes that Australia’s relatively recent entry into news channel provision hasn’t prevented the global trends and pressures on television news in general from impacting on Australian news provision. Even the launch of news channels in Australia itself is seen as more of a response to global competitive trends, rather than out of audience demand – especially given the very small niche audience for news channels (p. 258).</p>
<p>The final section of the book takes up the notion that the current phase of news channels relates less to global news provision aims, and rather more to the corporate/governmental interests within particular countries. Raymond Kuhn’s chapter on France 24, for instance, highlights how that channel’s late emergence (in 2006) really reflected an absence of desire among French broadcasters (state or commercial) to enter that market, and how it essentially was a ‘top-down state initiative’ (p. 267). As such France 24’s mission statement is quite different to, say, CNN or the BBC, with an explicit goal to provide a French ‘perspective’ and to export ‘French values’ (p. 270), although there’s little evidence so far of any intended ‘France 24 Effect’ to combat the ‘CNN Effect’ having been achieved (p. 278). John Jirk’s chapter on CCTV news channels in China shows how, in a quite different politico-economic framework to France, very similar desires and approaches are present, couched in terms of seeing news channels as vehicles for enhancing China’s ‘soft power’ (p. 282). Channels in foreign languages such as Russian and English, clearly aiming at external elite markets, illustrate a perceived importance of television news channels as part of China’s global status and position. Again, notions of presenting the ‘Chinese perspective’ (p. 282) on global events seem core to the mission of CCTV news channels. Jirk’s chapter also discusses also how western programme formats both within and beyond news have had consequences for television production, and news production, within CCTV. While that discussion concurs with a running theme through the book of competition having specific, and largely detrimental, effects on the nature of news channels, Carsten Reinemann and Nayla Fawzi’s chapter on news channels in Germany offers an interesting corrective to possible assumptions about the nature of these effects. In Germany, the specific market context in which 24-hour channels have emerged has created a distinctive set of market pressures, whereby news channels are actually replacing news content with other types of cheaper to produce content, such as magazine programmes and documentaries (p. 304), and a lot of re-runs of these other types of content (p. 305). Another consequence of the German market is an emphasis on content favouring an elite, educated, ‘opinion leader’ audience – suggesting a push upmarket rather than down compared to, say the UK or USA (p. 314). The final chapter, by Nalin Mehta on India, similarly demonstrates how the intersection of culture, politics and commerce can be idiosyncratic within countries. Mehta provides an overview of the extraordinary shift from outright government opposition to news channels as recently as the mid-1990s in India, to an explosion of private news channels addressing the diversity of regions, languages and political affiliations extant in modern India.</p>
<p>It would have been useful for the collection to have had a summary concluding chapter, highlighting the consonances and dissonances evident across the work presented here, but overall this is an important and instructive collection of use to researchers, teachers and students.</p>
