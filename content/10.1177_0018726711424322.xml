<abstract>
<p>This article suggests that by regarding the semantics of storytelling, we are able to explore how dominant stories influence and may contribute to organizational inertia. Using data from two change projects in large Scandinavian companies, it is shown that in the negotiation of meaning those stories that display semantic fit with the dominant story are perceived as more convincing, while those stories that lack this attribute appear oxymoronic and fail to have an impact. As a result, the organization is only able to change in a manner congruent with the dominant story and becomes inert in other respects. We suggest that a dominant story fixes not only the meaning of events, but also the meaning of the labels available for sensemaking. By this appropriation of language, the dominant story circumscribes sensemaking and storytelling possibilities, and thereby restricts organizational flux.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In recent years, the narrative approach, regarding organizations as ‘discursive spaces’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0018726711424322">Brown, 2006</xref>: 733) or ‘storytelling systems’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0018726711424322">Peirano-Vejo and Stablein, 2009</xref>: 444), has become established within organization studies, and thereby the study of how, with the help of narratives and stories, organizations construct and re-construct themselves (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0018726711424322">Boje, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0018726711424322">Brown, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0018726711424322">Martin et al., 1983</xref>). The need for narratives and storytelling arises from the fragmented and contradictory nature of organizational events: stories serve as a device to bring order to the flux of organizing, and thus instil meaning and connection, which would otherwise be largely absent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0018726711424322">Tsoukas and Hatch, 2001</xref>). By means of this process, everyday experiences are translated into stories, where events form simple chains of cause and effect, and characters and groups are attributed fixed qualities, thereby enabling organizational sensemaking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0018726711424322">Gabriel, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0018726711424322">Weick et al., 2005</xref>). Since sensemaking is in some respects an individual process, it leads to a multitude of narratives, as everyone constructs their own story about the events that have taken place, resulting in a number of different accounts that mirror the discrete positions of the speakers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0018726711424322">Brown et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0018726711424322">O’Leary, 2003</xref>). Storytelling, however, has a double-edged potential: it may lead to increased polyphony and a multitude of stories, but equally well serve as a tool for achieving hegemony, being used to establish a ‘regime of truth’ that favours one story at the expense of others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0018726711424322">Currie and Brown, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0018726711424322">Geiger and Antonacopoulou, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>However, such stories never become absolute and finite, but rather part of an ongoing process whereby the meaning attributed to past and present organizational events is defined and redefined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0018726711424322">Dawson and Buchanan, 2005</xref>). In this, storytelling mirrors the nature of organizations, which from a process view are sites of immanent flux, and thus potentially characterized by continuous change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0018726711424322">Tsoukas and Chia, 2002</xref>). Therefore, the natural state of organizations would be ongoing change, whereas stability and constancy require continuous sensemaking efforts, with the help of narratives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0018726711424322">Peirano-Vejo and Stablein, 2009</xref>). Following this view, it is inertia, rather than movement, which requires explanation – inertia in this context being defined as ‘the relative speed of organizational change in terms of its responsiveness to change and the time it takes to obtain, process and evaluate information from the environment’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0018726711424322">Van der Steen, 2007</xref>: 738), that is to say that the inert organization is not so much completely stable, as that its stream of organizing moves more slowly. Distinguishing between routine and resource rigidity, it is the former that we wish to address in this article, that is, the inertia that stems from the unwillingness or inability to alter norms and routines, rather than the inertia caused by failure to invest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0018726711424322">Gilbert, 2005</xref>). Organizational inertia may also imply an unwillingness to alter residing stories and language, as from a narrative approach organizational change entails conversational shift (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0018726711424322">Ford, 1999</xref>). If it is through language that organizing is attained and reproduced, then it is through focusing on language use that we may understand organizational change – or lack thereof (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0018726711424322">Currie and Brown, 2003</xref>). Change, in this view, is a linguistic accomplishment, which may be hampered or promoted by storytelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0018726711424322">Brown et al., 2009</xref>). Combining a narrative approach with a process view on organizations, a source of inertia might be found in an organization’s storytelling practices, which may be restricted by a dominant story (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0018726711424322">Buchanan and Dawson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0018726711424322">Geiger and Antonacopoulou, 2009</xref>). Arguably, a hegemonic story may be able to fix the meaning of the concepts and labels available to narrate events in the organization, and thereby circumscribe organizational sensemaking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0018726711424322">Brown, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>This is not to say that an organization harbouring a dominant story will be completely inert – only that change will be restricted to a direction concordant with the sentiment of that story (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0018726711424322">Aaltio-Marjosola, 1994</xref>). Therefore, by regarding the semantic aspects of storytelling, the meaning affixed to the concepts available to tell stories and make sense within the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0018726711424322">Fairclough, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0018726711424322">Van Dijk, 1995</xref>), we are able to contribute to the current discussion on the role of dominant stories in the interplay between organizational stability and change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0018726711424322">Brown, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0018726711424322">Dawson and Buchanan, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0018726711424322">Gabriel, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0018726711424322">Geiger and Antonacopoulou, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0018726711424322">Murgia and Poggio, 2009</xref>). Furthermore, a semantic approach also allows us to advance our understanding of the label-making aspect of authoritative sense-making, and therefore the role of storytelling in restricting and enabling the sensemaking process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0018726711424322">Brown, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0018726711424322">Jordan and Mitterhofer, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0018726711424322">Pye, 2002</xref>). Thus, the aim of this article is to explore the role of semantics when storytelling acts as a source of organizational inertia. If the organization is a storytelling system, then stable organizations require stable stories. Given that stories are by nature ever-changing and fragile, how might a story become sufficiently stable and resilient to bring this flux to a halt (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0018726711424322">Brown, 2004</xref>)?</p>
<p>We propose that in order to understand the resilience of dominant stories, which enables them to resist deviant or alternate stories, we need to address not only their narrative content, but also how labels and concepts are used and assigned meaning through the stories. Dominant stories exercise their power by fixing meaning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0018726711424322">Brown, 2004</xref>), and arguably this meaning is fixed not only at story level, but also at a semantic level, giving words and concepts a certain, local meaning, which restricts the storytelling possibilities in that organization. To this end, we suggest that storytelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0018726711424322">Boyce, 1995</xref>) and sensemaking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0018726711424322">Weick, 1995</xref>) be complemented with a semantic approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0018726711424322">Fairclough, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0018726711424322">Van Dijk, 1995</xref>), which allows us to take into consideration the micro-level of storytelling and sensemaking: the words used to tell a story and to label its actors and events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0018726711424322">Jordan and Mitterhofer, 2010</xref>). This follows the suggestion by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0018726711424322">Whittle and Mueller (2012)</xref> that focusing on micro-linguistic tools allows us to explore how collective sensemaking is achieved through contesting storytelling. Earlier research has shown the importance of verisimilitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0018726711424322">Brown, 2004</xref>) and the reinforcement of congruent storytelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0018726711424322">Murgia and Poggio, 2009</xref>) for the construction and maintenance of dominant stories, but the semantic aspects of dominant storytelling remain comparatively unexplored. This article seeks to address this gap, arguing that by focusing on the semantic level of sensemaking, we are able to address a more subtle and fundamental level of discursive dominance. Far from being a transparent and neutral tool of description, language produces, reproduces and transforms social structures, and its label-making properties provide one possible explanation for how dominant stories become resilient (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0018726711424322">Brown, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0018726711424322">Fairclough, 1992</xref>). We are thereby able to expound on the resilience of dominant stories and their impact on organizational inertia, and furthermore the role of label-making as a link between storytelling and sensemaking.</p>
<p>In managerial attempts at counteracting inertia, external experts have increasingly become expected to function as agents of change and development, a view that has made management consulting services part of everyday life in many organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018726711424322">Allcorn and Godkin, 2011</xref>). As they transgress organizational boundaries and potentially challenge established sensemaking patterns, these external experts may, albeit unwittingly, challenge dominant stories within the organization by providing new labels and metaphors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0018726711424322">Brown, 2006</xref>). Therefore, in order to study how dominant stories are maintained, even when challenged by external forces, we will use change projects where management consultants were involved as our empirical arena. More specifically, we build on two case studies of the stories told around change projects in large Scandinavian companies. In both cases, the attempted changes were directed at structures and routines, and therefore at routine rigidity, which to some extent characterized both companies.</p>
<p>The article begins with a discussion on sensemaking, semantics and storytelling, with the intention of showing how language and stories make up the fundamentals of sensemaking, and are therefore intertwined with change and inertia in an organization. We then turn to our research design, before presenting our two case studies, discussing how semantic fit with the dominant story affected the credibility of the stories told within the case study organizations. We conclude by summarizing the main findings of the study.</p>

<title>On sensemaking, semantics and storytelling</title>
<p>Our theoretical framework draws on sensemaking combined with storytelling and semantics, arguing that in order to make sense of organizational events, actors tell stories about the events, and in telling these stories, meaning is assigned to the concepts used for sensemaking and storytelling (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0018726711424322">Brown et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0018726711424322">Thatchenkerry, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0018726711424322">Weick et al., 2005</xref>). In other words, the processes of storytelling and sensemaking are by nature iterative and recursive, assigning meaning to concepts that are then used for further sensemaking and storytelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0018726711424322">Buchanan and Dawson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0018726711424322">Peirano-Vejo and Stablein, 2009</xref>). Sensemaking therefore suggests a process view on organizations, regarding them as processes rather than entities, describable by verbs rather than nouns, and consisting of interaction between their members rather than set structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0018726711424322">Bakken and Hernes, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0018726711424322">Langley and Tsoukas, 2010</xref>). When the members of an organization try to understand and interpret what is taking place around them by labeling and categorizing events, actors, situations, etc., this is not only an internal, passive process of sense<italic>making</italic>, but also in effect a process of sense<italic>giving</italic> or <italic>authoritative</italic> sensemaking, as these meanings are communicated to others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0018726711424322">Brown, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0018726711424322">Gioia and Chittipeddi, 1991</xref>). By these means, the actors are able to bring order to the flux of organizing, and transform the stream of experience into neatly packaged stories, relating the present to past and future events, which are then used as a basis for further action and sensemaking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0018726711424322">Weick et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, in organizing, making meaning is part of the process, rather than a separate level of description (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0018726711424322">Hernes and Maitlis, 2010</xref>). In this process, semantics is a principal tool, which enables and restricts the sensemaking and sensegiving processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0018726711424322">Pye, 2002</xref>). Therefore, actors are ‘reflexive within the discursive quasi-constraints imposed on them by language in general, and in particular by the narratives on which they draw, and to which they are subject’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0018726711424322">Brown, 2006</xref>: 738). The ultimate effect echoes Wittgenstein’s well-known assertion that ‘whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent’: language restricts what sensemaking is possible. Consequently, language is more than a tool with which to describe organizations, but rather such stuff as organizations are made on, as ‘phenomena in and of language’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0018726711424322">Boje et al., 2004</xref>: 571). Organizational change might be seen as shifts in conversation, generated by and requiring communication and new speech (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0018726711424322">Ford, 1999</xref>). Change, from this perspective, is a linguistic accomplishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0018726711424322">Brown and Humphreys, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Although sensemaking as a cognitive process is individual, its dependence and influence on collectively constructed frames means that it cannot be seen in isolation. With the help of narratives, these collective frames of reference are constructed. They then form the basis for sensemaking, which as a result to some extent becomes a collective process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0018726711424322">Currie and Brown, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0018726711424322">Weick et al., 2005</xref>). Arguments and storylines must be grounded in the discourse within which they are told in order to appear plausible and convincing, because when they are interpreted, it is by drawing on their context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0018726711424322">Tsoukas and Hatch, 2001</xref>). In this respect their semantic context is significant, for when employing labels, speakers make use of the meaning assigned to these labels by others, and in turn renew or adjust this meaning. An utterance, although made by an individual, inevitably draws on what has been said by others, and therefore language is inescapably dialogic by nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0018726711424322">Bakhtin, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0018726711424322">Langley and Tsoukas, 2010</xref>). A unitary language is the result of laboriously constructed and reproduced linguistic norms, which serve to stem its potential heteroglossia, rather than any inherent unity in language itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0018726711424322">Bakhtin, 1981</xref>). Power in this context then becomes the ability to fix meaning, as the discursive practices of an organization may be used to establish a semantic hegemony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0018726711424322">Brown, 2004</xref>). Since sensemaking requires linguistic labels, such fixing of meaning is not confined to assigning meaning to an event, but also encompasses the meaning assigned to the words and concepts available to describe the event. By appropriating the labels available to describe a certain phenomenon, one also appropriates what sense can possibly be made of it. In such cases, the appropriation of discourse in effect poisons the language, rendering words and expressions impossible to use unless one wants to reproduce a certain order. In this respect, the gesture of namegiving – labeling an event and thereby establishing what sense should be made of it – always carries an element of symbolic violence in the potential to govern and restrict sensemaking possibilities (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0018726711424322">Learmonth, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>This potential of power is arguably inherent in all uses of language, as an effect of the arbitrariness of the sign. In Saussurian linguistics, language has two fundamental levels: the signifier and the signified. The former refers mainly to words and symbols, the latter to the world of concepts and ideas. Together, signifier and signified constitute a sign, consisting of, for example, a word, and the idea to which the word refers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0018726711424322">Brannen, 2004</xref>). There is no inherent link between the two – an arbitrariness that forms the basis for semantics, the study of how meaning is conveyed by words and sentences. This meaning might be described in terms of conceptual (the basic, literal meaning of a word) and associative meaning (its connotations, which to a larger degree are locally determined) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0018726711424322">Yule, 1996</xref>). It is the associative meaning that may be primarily assigned by local discourse, which gains all the more importance as normal language use is incomplete, in the sense that much information is not explicitly stated, but rather inferred by the listener. In short, a lot goes without saying – which means that without a shared cognitive frame, the listener will not understand what is said as intended by the speaker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0018726711424322">Van Dijk, 1995</xref>). Therefore, all human communication is based on shared codes. Without semantic fit between speaker and listener, a story will not be understood, let alone believed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0018726711424322">Brannen, 2004</xref>). Furthermore, denomination is to some extent an ambiguous process, since the listener may refute the denotation, and thus influence the effect of the utterance. Therefore, sensegiving cannot be absolute, since the social properties of language mean that speakers are rarely able to decide exclusively what words should mean (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0018726711424322">Pye, 2002</xref>). To achieve change requires not only ‘an alteration in what people say, but also the myths, rituals, symbols and signs associated with those changes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0018726711424322">Ford and Ford, 1995</xref>: 563).</p>
<p>Since storytelling is an ongoing process, continuously adjusted and negotiated, the finite truth of ‘what really happened’ will never be established, other than as a local construction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0018726711424322">Dawson and Buchanan, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0018726711424322">Van Dijk, 1995</xref>). Organizations present a kaleidoscope of alternate stories, as each organization member constructs their version of what happened as part of their own sensemaking process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0018726711424322">Boje, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0018726711424322">Gabriel, 1995</xref>). Should the organization appear unitary, it is a result of careful construction within the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0018726711424322">Robichaud et al., 2004</xref>) or from the researcher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0018726711424322">Buchanan and Dawson, 2007</xref>). As organizational storytelling rarely presents fully fledged narratives, we follow Boje’s definition of a story as being ‘an exchange between two or more persons during which a past or anticipated experience [is] being referenced, recounted, interpreted or challenged’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0018726711424322">Boje, 1991</xref>: 8). This definition does not make heavy demands for stories to have a full chronology, theme or saga, and allows for more subtle and fragmented stories to be included in the analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0018726711424322">Whittle et al., 2009</xref>). Indeed, reflecting the stream of organizational events they depict, organizational storytelling is perhaps more likely to be fragmented and ever-changing, with fragile and flexible stories, than to present complete and definite accounts of what took place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0018726711424322">Buchanan and Dawson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0018726711424322">Peirano-Vejo and Stablein, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Although storytelling has the potential to turn the organization into a cacophony, this is rarely the case, as storytelling becomes part of a culture of power struggles and internal politics. Groups within an organization use storytelling to serve their own purposes, reflecting their position in the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0018726711424322">Brown and Humphreys, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0018726711424322">O’Leary, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0018726711424322">Whittle et al., 2009</xref>). As a result of these power struggles, some stories may become dominant, establishing guidelines and norms for how events should be interpreted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0018726711424322">Brown, 2006</xref>). In this sense, a dominant story may constitute an ‘invisible prison’, which restricts sensemaking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0018726711424322">Brown and Humphreys, 2003</xref>). Once established, such dominant stories will provide a backdrop and sounding board for any other stories told within the organization, and therefore contradictory stories will lack the verisimilitude necessary to make them seem plausible and convincing. In short, we prefer the story that confirms what we knew already to the story that challenges our beliefs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0018726711424322">Brown, 2004</xref>). Consequently, the dominant story may become sufficiently powerful to establish a ‘regime of truth’, where deviant stories do not make sense, or even become unthinkable, as they would contradict the implicit and taken-for-granted assumptions of the dominant story (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0018726711424322">Geiger and Antonacopoulou, 2009</xref>). The coherent and well-polished story, lacking contradictions and complexities, is all too alluring. As an audience, we delight in deception, being told a story of coherent and appealing surfaces, and a dominant story therefore presents a tempting and uncomplicated sensemaking alternative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0018726711424322">Gabriel, 2008</xref>). A story that is not believed risks becoming a story not told, as the audience’s incredulity will make the speaker loath to tell it. In effect, a monologic organization becomes deaf to deviant voices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0018726711424322">Brown, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0018726711424322">2006</xref>). In such cases, the content of the dominant stories will be commonly told and freely shared within the organization. Their ‘dominance’ thus refers to their prevalence within the organization, not primarily to the position of the actors who tell them. Deviant stories, on the other hand, risk becoming marginalized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0018726711424322">Murgia and Poggio, 2009</xref>). Such alternate or contradictory stories then turn into sequestered stories, which are ‘set apart from the mainstream’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0018726711424322">Clair, 1993</xref>: 114), and do not receive the same amount of public exposure, legitimization or respect as their dominant counterparts. Then, storytelling risks becoming a tool for silencing alternatives and resisting change, rather than enabling the organization to fulfil its polyphonic potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0018726711424322">Murgia and Poggio, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The presence of a dominant story will therefore cause inherent polyphony to be silenced, making alternative stories seem unpalatable or even unthinkable. This regime of truth is not absolute, but the object of constant renegotiation, as deviant stories are temporarily marginalized rather than eradicated. While in place, however, a dominant story may restrict the sensemaking possibilities of the organization, requiring change to be congruent with this story. In other respects the organization risks becoming inert, due to the cognitive limitations imposed by the dominant story (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0018726711424322">Geiger and Antonacopoulou, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0018726711424322">Tripsas and Gavetti, 2000</xref>). As we shall see in the following section, these limitations pertain not only to the meaning ascribed to events within the organization, but also to semantics – the meaning affixed with concepts and words.</p>

<title>Research design</title>
<p>This article builds on a qualitative case study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0018726711424322">Yin, 2009</xref>) in which empirical data in the form of interviews and documentation was collected over a period of one year from two large and well-established Scandinavian companies, Alpha and Beta (pseudonyms). Both hold strong positions in their respective industries: Alpha is a service company in the logistics industry and Beta is a production company in the transportation industry. At the time of the interviews, Alpha had 40,000 employees and a turnover of €2.5 billion, whereas Beta had 70,000 employees and a turnover of €19 billion. The companies were chosen because they were involved in a series of organizational change processes and projects, where external expertise was employed. The initial focus of the study was to explore the role of external change agents in facilitating change. However, when we enquired why changes had been initiated, why they were hindered or successful, and why external change agents had been hired, different and often conflicting explanations were given. There was a multitude of stories, serving as sensemaking vehicles, around the change projects. To increase the opportunity of collecting as many of these stories as possible, we interviewed employees occupying different positions in the companies and links to the projects. In total, 24 semi-structured interviews were conducted with employees in Alpha, and 18 with employees in Beta.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0018726711424322">1</xref></sup> The interviews lasted between 45 minutes and 2.5 hours, with an average time of 1.5 hours, and were audio-recorded. The interviews were then fully transcribed, the length of the transcripts ranging from 3100 to 12,800 words, with an average of 7700 words. Two analyses of the data were performed, with the intention of identifying stories in the material, and studying the language used therein.</p>
<p>In the first analysis, the transcripts from all interviews were analyzed with regard to the stories employees told about their company. The transcripts from the interviews were read and reread several times, in order to get an overview of the material, followed by a more thorough comparison of the transcripts in order to determine differences and similarities. In this process, patterns began to emerge in which certain descriptions of the two companies recurred more frequently than others. This was shown not only by similarities in the accounts, or by the frequency with which they occurred in the interviews, but also by the confidence with which they were expressed. Special attention was paid to the central words and concepts of these stories, the use to which they were put and the connotations they were given. The first analysis resulted in the identification of two dominant stories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0018726711424322">Geiger and Antonacopoulou, 2009</xref>), one in Alpha and one in Beta, describing the organization and the legitimate way of organizing change projects. These stories were told and referred to by most, if not all, interviewees in Alpha and Beta respectively. The dominant stories were not more frequent among managers than among other employees, but rather seemed to be expressed as part of collective memory. As discussed earlier, dominant stories may become hegemonic and function as a stabilizing force in organizations, but they are often challenged by other stories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0018726711424322">Brown, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>This was highlighted in the second analysis, which examined two projects, the Analysis project in Alpha and the Change project in Beta. They were chosen because they were frequently mentioned in the interviews – often without prompting by the interviewer – and because they seemed to be a source of multistoried sensemaking. Out of the 42 interviews performed in Alpha and Beta, 15 interviewees from Alpha mentioned the Analysis project and six interviewees from Beta mentioned the Change project. These interviews were analyzed again, following the procedure described above, but this time focusing on the stories told about the two projects, especially the concepts used, and how they related to the dominant stories in Alpha and Beta.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the outcomes of our analyses are a result of the interpretations made by ourselves as authors, as well as by our interviewees as they have made interpretations both of their organizational life, the interview situation and of what they thought was expected of them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0018726711424322">Brown et al., 2008</xref>). The stories presented here should therefore be viewed as constructions, although built on a thorough analysis of the interview transcripts, thereby providing empirical grounds for our interpretations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0018726711424322">Currie and Brown, 2003</xref>).</p>

<title>The two projects</title>
<p>This section introduces the two case-study change projects, based on information gathered from documentation and interviews with employees in Alpha and Beta respectively.</p>
<sec id="section5-0018726711424322">
<title>The analysis project in Alpha</title>
<p>After a long period of profitability and prosperity, Alpha was in a predicament. Due to changes in market conditions and rapid technological development, Alpha’s leading position in the Scandinavian logistics market was under threat: services and products had become outdated and even previously loyal customers were leaving. Against this background, the CEO decided to analyze all businesses in Alpha, their profitability and growth potential, in order to determine which should be kept, and which discarded. To this end, he instigated the Analysis project. A small project group consisting of five senior consultants and five senior managers worked intensely with the analyses and used the boardroom as their project office. The project resulted in a report that was presented to top management and the board of Alpha. However, it faced internal criticism from management, employees and union representatives, and this critique eventually became so strident that the CEO and the consultants were forced to leave the company. Shortly afterwards a new, internally recruited CEO was appointed. He decided to implement the solutions that the Analysis project had recommended, but informed the organization that ‘this time, the managers would implement the solutions without the help of external consultants’. This decision was widely accepted in Alpha, and a new project aimed at implementing the solutions was launched.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0018726711424322">
<title>The Change project in Beta</title>
<p>In the preceding years, Beta had acquired several companies. To realize potential synergies, senior management started up a large change project, involving over 100 consultants and employees. The aim was to create a new organizational structure, establish common processes throughout their subsidiaries and reduce the workforce. A senior manager from the parent company was assigned ownership of the project, and a newly recruited manager with long experience of change projects was appointed project manager. To supplement the project, Beta hired consultants from a consultancy they had worked with previously. The consultants’ role was to assist the project manager, structure and lead project activities and provide creative ideas on how to improve Beta’s organization. At first, the project was described by the employees as ‘incredibly glamorous and prestigious’, and they fought to participate in it. But after a while, the image of the project began to change. Since Beta had already been downsized, it became difficult to find enough personnel to staff the project, leading to more consultants being hired to reduce the employees’ workload. Many employees perceived this as ‘the consultants taking over the project’, and they developed an aversion to the project, which made it difficult for its ideas to win acceptance. Ultimately, the manager who had initiated the project left the organization, the project manager was replaced, and the consultants fired. The project’s reputation deteriorated to the extent that some of the interviewees refused even to talk about it.</p>

<title>Storytelling in Alpha and Beta</title>
<p>In this section, the stories told around these projects in their organizations are presented, beginning with Alpha.</p>
<sec id="section8-0018726711424322">
<title>The dominant story in Alpha</title>
<p>This story described Alpha as characterized by a strong culture, which did more than written rules and policies to guide the employees in their actions. Knowledge of this culture was seen as essential in order to understand Alpha, and gain legitimacy within the organization. The culture was described as being built on consensus, with significant employee involvement in important decisions, and a coaching and listening leadership style. Following a long tradition of in-house recruitment, externally recruited managers were regarded with scepticism, discounted because they lacked sufficient understanding and respect for Alpha culture. Although the employees regarded themselves as very competent, and accustomed to working with change projects, self-esteem was nevertheless described as being (unjustly) low: ‘There’s a strange tradition in Alpha of thinking we can’t do anything by ourselves, without consultants to help us’ (Purchasing Manager 1). These external experts were seen as superior in terms of experience and knowledge, and therefore, in lieu of the consensual culture, close, trusting working relationships were sought with the experts. To achieve this, change projects were expected to have an open and welcoming atmosphere with high levels of interaction and knowledge transfer, inviting all to contribute and learn.</p>
<p>If we regard the labels used in the sensemaking process underlying this story, and the meaning affixed to them, <italic>culture</italic> was given much weight, primarily used to separate internally recruited employees from those externally recruited, and imposing a hierarchy whereby internal recruits were seen as superior. A <italic>good leader</italic> was supportive rather than authoritative, involving the employees in decisions. A <italic>good change project</italic> was open, inviting both internal and external actors to work closely together. A <italic>consultant</italic> was knowledgeable, bringing new ideas to the organization, whereas an <italic>employee</italic> was a skilled person, who should be treated gently owing to his/her low self-esteem. As we shall see, these meanings stuck even when these labels were used in alternate sensemaking processes, to tell other stories.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0018726711424322">
<title>The ‘bad project’ story</title>
<p>Shortly after the Analysis project had begun, a story emerged that questioned and criticized the project. This story was told by members in the organization who had not been directly involved in the project but either felt that they should have been, or feared its outcome: ‘It makes you really scared, what’s going to happen? Are they going to close down the company? Are we to disappear? There are only negative effects’ (Chief of Staff 1). The project was described as secretive and potentially dangerous, dealing with sensitive issues. Employees gave several reasons for this interpretation. First, the CEO’s decision to allow the project group to use the boardroom located close to his office was seen as a sign of the CEO marking a distance between the project and the organization. This was partly blamed on the consultants involved, who ‘kept the project for themselves and regarded it as <italic>their</italic> project and <italic>their</italic> results instead of involving management and the organization members’ (Vice CEO, Alpha). Second, the CEO was accused of trying to keep the project secret, ordering the consultants to ‘dress down a little’, to make them ‘less easy to spot’, in order to avoid attention from the employees, rather than inviting them to participate (Chief of Staff 2).</p>
<p>This behaviour was depicted in the story as inappropriate and odd, breaking the code of conduct established by Alpha’s culture. Instead of acting as a ‘good leader’ should, the CEO was described as behaving in an omnipotent manner, going behind his colleagues’ and the unions’ backs, neither informing them nor seeking their consensus for his decision to start the project and hire consultants. ‘You can’t act like that’, one of the managers explained, ‘you’ve got to get support for your ideas, you have to’. The CEO was also criticized for his lack of confidence in his employees: ‘To be honest, the reason why the CEO [did that] was that he thought that the employees in Alpha were not skilled enough nor had the capacity to perform that kind of analysis, so he thought it was better to hire consultants’ (Vice CEO), thus opposing the prevailing idea in Alpha of highly competent but insecure employees needing to be treated gently.</p>
<p>Overall, his behaviour was seen as indicative of the CEO ‘being wrong about the project and not understanding his own organization’ (Senior Adviser 2). The reason for this was, according to this story, that the CEO was not internally recruited. Therefore, maybe ‘in his world’, in the company he came from, this was the usual procedure; perhaps he had only acted ‘as he was used to from his previous jobs’ (Union Representative). By using the dominant story as frame of reference, the tellers of this story were able to make sense of the CEO’s inappropriate behaviour: it was only to be expected from an externally recruited manager, unfamiliar with Alpha culture.</p>
<p>Neither had the consultants behaved in the way one would expect of external experts: ‘What they tried to do was to milk Alpha for information. They seemed to know less than we did . . . They suggested measures which were a bit headless, not properly thought through, they hadn’t done the accounting’ (Vice CEO). In addition to accusations of being ignorant, the consultants were also said to have acted arrogantly, ignoring the advice they received from employees, and instead giving ‘foolish’ suggestions with no proper plan for implementation or communication: ‘You can’t just throw [a suggestion to outsource the company’s core business] out without talking to the unions or anything first, that would’ve been like putting gasoline on fire’ (Vice CEO).</p>
<p>This story was told and retold not only internally, but also externally via media and the unions. Consequently, many organization members associated the Analysis project with failure, a connotation that also clung to the CEO:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>A really bad example [of consulting projects] is this Analysis project; that was really bad. It was completely meaningless, doomed to failure from the very beginning. It wasn’t anchored in the organization. [Did it yield any results?] Yes, there was a report that was presented to the board of the company, but then everything turned into chaos. The CEO had to leave after that. (Top Manager 1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As the story ends with the forced resignation of the CEO, it would seem that it became a powerful weapon for those who were opposed to the Analysis project, in their attempt at authoritative sensegiving. Largely concordant with the dominant story, it appeared verisimilitudinous, and thereby convincing and plausible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0018726711424322">Brown, 2004</xref>). The meaning it attached to the Analysis Project and the CEO subsequently stuck, and became part of the collective frames of sensemaking in the organization.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0018726711424322">
<title>The ‘good project’ story</title>
<p>Although the ‘bad project’ story was widely spread within the organization, it was not the only one told about the project. Somewhat defensively, the project members and the CEO related how they viewed the project as ultimately successful, even though it had been met with scepticism and resistance: ‘It’s really the same thing that we’re doing now. We’re now completing what we set out to do [in the Analysis project]’ (Top Manager 2). In defence of their understanding of the project, this group told quite a different story about the events, contesting the critique voiced in the ‘bad project’ story about the project being secretive and non-inclusive:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It was when the project report was presented to top management that the project became well-known in the organization. Before that it had been a small project. But then it just exploded and suddenly it had turned into this secret, sensitive project. But it wasn’t a secret project; more than 100 persons in Alpha have been involved in it in one way or another, and we were just revising the visions in Alpha to see whether they were still accurate or needed to be adjusted somewhat. And we didn’t need a very large project to do that. (Chief of Staff 3)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Far from being accused of arrogance and ignorance, the consultants were described as being ‘impressive’ and ‘amazing’, working ‘three times as hard as regular employees’, and providing Alpha with ‘razor sharp’ analyses, new information and suggestions for how to improve its business. They were also said to have added efficiency and rigour, which made the project results more reliable than if they had been determined solely by Alpha employees, ‘because when you talk to, say, a production manager, there will be a lot of talk, feelings, ideas, etc., but very few numbers’ (Top Manager 3).</p>
<p>In the ‘good project’ story, the blame for the CEO’s downfall was shifted from the project to the unions. Their critique of the Analysis project, one chief of staff explained, should be interpreted primarily as part of the union’s political manoeuvrings; the whole ‘hullabaloo’ was ‘to prove a point’ about their right to be consulted in such matters, rather than owing to any fault with the project per se. Being ‘the best media workers of all’, as one manager acidly remarked, they had found something to pick up on in the project, and then used that. Outsourcing businesses had just been put forward as an idea, a topic for future discussions, ‘but this little idea suddenly got lots of attention and was described in media as if it were a real suggestion and even something we had planned for’ (Chief of Staff 4).</p>
<p>This story might be seen as a counter-attack on the critique the Analysis encountered, and an attempt at alternate sensemaking about what meaning should be attached to the project and its main characters. However, its advocates seemed less confident in the power of their story. As one interviewee remarked: ‘I think [the consulting company] have been very good for Alpha. There are a lot of people who wouldn’t agree, but I think so’ (Top Manager 3).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0018726711424322">
<title>The struggle over the meaning of the Analysis project</title>
<p>These two stories might be seen as part of the negotiation of meaning following the Analysis project, as to how it should be interpreted. Furthermore, it would seem that the interpretation suggested by the ‘bad project’ story gained the upper hand, while the ‘good project’ story was reduced to a sequestered story. The dismissal of the CEO also demonstrates that the first story ultimately served as a base for deciding what action should be taken as a consequence of the Analysis project. In the struggle for what meaning should be attached to the Analysis project, it seems that the ‘bad project’ story emerged victorious.</p>
<p>We would argue that one reason for the success of the ‘bad project’ story was that it presented a better semantic fit with the dominant story than the ‘good project’ story. In the ‘good project’ story, culture did not seem to play a part, as opposed to its prominent position in the dominant story. Employees, easily duped by the union’s ministrations, appeared gullible rather than skilled. However, in concordance with earlier research on organizations where dominant stories have been established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0018726711424322">Aaltio-Marjosola, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0018726711424322">Geiger and Antonacopoulou, 2009</xref>), even the deviant, alternate stories in some respects adhere to the logic of the dominant story. Thus, in its defence of the consultants and the CEO, the culprits of the ‘bad project’ story, the ‘good project’ story argues that they did in fact both behave as prescribed by their respective labels, ‘consultant’ and ‘good leader’. The CEO was not secretive, but inclusive and consensus-seeking, and the consultants were skilled, not ignorant. However, the argument for shifting the blame to the union seems less consonant with the dominant story. The union, the ‘good project’ story argues, only used the project as part of their struggle for power, maintaining their right to be consulted – but according to the dominant story, this would in fact be perfectly in accordance with Alpha culture, where consensus-seeking was a cornerstone. Defending Alpha culture would hardly make you a villain in the dominant story, and therefore the attempt by the ‘good project’ story to cast the union in that role on those grounds would not seem convincing.</p>
<p>To conclude, while the ‘good project’ story was not completely independent from the meanings of labels established by the dominant story, its key arguments were nevertheless based on different meanings given to, for example, ‘culture’ and ‘employee’ than suggested by the dominant story. The ‘bad project’ story’s better semantic fit with the dominant story made it more likely to appear plausible, and was therefore ultimately also more successful in the struggle for meaning. After the CEO had been replaced, and the suggestions made in the project were presented in a manner more adherent to the dominant story, the proposed changes were eventually implemented. In order to make others follow, you have to provide a message they can identify with – which would seem to depend as much on the way the story is told, as on the nature of the proposed course of action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0018726711424322">Humphreys et al., 2012</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section12-0018726711424322">
<title>The Change project in Beta</title>
<p>We now turn to our second case, Beta, and the stories told there.</p>
<sec id="section13-0018726711424322">
<title>The dominant story in Beta</title>
<p>Beta’s dominant story was in many ways different to that of Alpha. In Beta’s dominant story, employees were described as highly competent with high self-esteem, identifying more with their professions (i.e. controllers, engineers, etc.) than with the company as such, resulting in a highly skilled organization, where culture was not considered to play a major part. There was, however, a clear idea of the ideal Beta leadership style: an authoritative manager who had the strength and ability to make decisions without having to seek consensus from everyone. An ideal manager, as related by Beta employees, should not require external help to handle their job and make decisions, but instead steer the company forward with a firm hand, lest he were to be perceived as weak or unskilled. Similarly, a change project should be handled internally, with limited use of external help, and management had to ‘have ownership’. In cases where external actors were involved, they should only be used for smaller tasks such as data collection and analyses, while the more sensitive parts should be carried out by employees, thereby using and developing their already high competencies and restricting the external actors’ access to valuable information.</p>
<p>Although the dominant stories in Alpha and Beta made use of similar labels, these were given quite different content. Both stories would agree that <italic>good leadership</italic> was important, but the notions signified by this label had little in common. In Beta, <italic>a good leader</italic> meant being authoritative and strong enough to make decisions without having to seek the advice of others. <italic>Employee</italic> also carried connotations of confidence, and because of their perceived high competence level, they were thought to be able to rely on their professional knowledge rather than organizational culture in order to know what should be done in a given situation. In an organization that describes itself in such confident, independent terms, it is perhaps not surprising that <italic>consultants</italic> were regarded more in terms of assistants useful for minor tasks who ‘should only do what the organization wants them to do’, and that <italic>changes</italic> involved a minimum of external help and clear ownership of management.</p>

<sec id="section14-0018726711424322">
<title>The ‘naïve consultants’ story</title>
<p>This story was told by employees not directly involved in the Change project, and to a large extent concerned the consultants involved in the project. They were described as ‘a bunch of youngsters running around in dark suits’, relying ‘too much on their theoretical models’ and lacking experience and knowledge of Beta and its industry. They ‘inspired no confidence’ among Beta’s staff, the manager of one of Beta’s subsidiaries explained, since the employees were old hands, having ‘been around for quite some time’. As the consultants were more interested in delivering ready-made solutions than in being loyal to their customer and adapting their suggestions to suit Beta’s specific needs, the advice they gave was often impractical: ‘There’s not much of Beta’s soul in their suggestions, their suggestions come from their templates’ (Senior Manager 1). In these accounts, Beta and its competent employees stood in stark contrast to the group of largely irresponsible and ignorant consultants, and examples were given of how the employees had seen through the consultants’ ill-advised suggestions:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>And the employees felt this [that one of the proposed solutions from the consultants did not work], they are not stupid. They see the kind of things that the consultants don’t want to see. The consultants just went on with the project, focusing on reaching its goals and following their plans exactly. Whereas the employees said that this isn’t going to work, someone needs to change this; it won’t work. (Senior Manager 1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The project owner and the project management did not escape blame in this story, as they were criticized for not taking on responsibility or ‘standing on the barricades’ for the project – for example, they had ‘let the consultants distribute all the material in their name, rather than letting it come from management. Then it’s quite easy to think, well, what’ll happen to this when the consultants are gone?’ (Senior Manager 2). They were accused of hiding behind the consultants and letting them ‘take over in the project’, not daring to question their ideas, which had led to ‘some less than intelligent decisions’ and was interpreted as a sign of managerial weakness: ‘I want to get this straight: I don’t want to criticize the consultants; it’s the managers who’ve let them take over the project. They haven’t stopped the project and said, “OK, from now on we’re going to run this project on our own”’ (CEO, Beta subsidiary).</p>
<p>In short, the ‘naïve consultants’ story depicted the project members (especially the project owner) as weak, allowing inexperienced and over-theoretical consultants to call the shots, and then lacking the intelligence to see through their impractical suggestions. Luckily (the story went on), other Beta employees were less gullible; in fact, they were better equipped than the consultants to see what needed to be done and how.</p>

<title>The ‘stubborn organization’ story</title>
<p>The fierce critique of the ‘naïve consultants’ story was not met with silence, however. The project members launched a counter-attack in telling their story, where the blame for the project’s shortcomings was shifted to the ‘organizational culture’ of Beta, which was characterized by ‘saying no rather than yes’. In this story, the organization was described as ‘traditional’, rigid, and generally very sceptical about new ideas – especially when they came from younger people, dressed in dark suits instead of jeans and T-shirt – which made it difficult for the organization to incorporate new ideas and ways of thinking:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>[What created the problems?] Well, our industry is rather old-fashioned and traditional. And I guess it’s the same in many companies, but there’s distrust here against younger people, especially those wearing suit and tie . . . I’m not sure that it’s always a good thing to try and import new ideas here; we’re rather slow in this company. (Middle Manager 1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Furthermore, the Nordic subsidiary director explained, Beta had failed to see the importance of the Change project – even though the understanding was ‘basically there’, nevertheless it had not been given sufficient resources in terms of time and personnel. In projects such as this, she continued, it is vital ‘that you have a clear idea of the resources needed, that you’ve got the key personnel. That you know who they are, and also that you make the time for those who have been chosen to spend time on the project’. Since this did not happen, it was argued, the project manager was forced to hire more consultants to keep up. Therefore, the project’s bad reputation was seen as unfair, as project management really had made the best of the circumstances: ‘When the organization can’t even provide the project with enough resources, then you may start wondering what they’re doing . . .’ (Senior Manager 3). In this story, the consultants were certainly not to blame, since they were loyal, competent and eager to help their client. In fact, were it not for their assistance with resources, structure and knowledge, the project would never have been completed at all: ‘I don’t see how such a big project could have been completed with the resources we have in the organization today. You need [external experts] who are specialists in process management’ (Senior Manager 3). Also, it was described how the consultants had been very eager to make sure that the Beta employees were involved and understood what was happening, as well as very quick to change anything which was not to their client’s liking, or make any other adjustments needed: ‘If they noticed that something didn’t work, quickly more resources were added.’ All in all, ‘our relationship with the consultants was very good’ (Middle Manager 1).</p>
<p>In summary, the ‘stubborn organization’ story gave a picture of heroic consultants and project members trying to reach their goals despite a lack of resources and support from a stubborn and unwilling organization. However, this was to little avail – the project manager described how the project ‘is still mentioned as something negative’, and as ‘synonymous with failure’, which would indicate that the attempt to justify the project and the consultants involved in it largely failed. The ‘stubborn organization’ story turned into a sequestered story, told only by those who had been directly involved in the Change project.</p>

<title>The struggle over meaning in the Change project</title>
<p>As in the case of Alpha, the stories told around the Change project might be seen as negotiations of the meaning of this project, as part of the actors’ attempts to make sense of what had taken place in the organization. In this case, however, the very idea behind the project, expressed in the ‘stubborn organization’ story, seemed at odds with the dominant story. In the ‘stubborn organization’ story, the organization hardly seems skilled and competent – rather, project members expect to rely on external experts to provide the competence necessary to run the Change project, from which the employees could then learn. Obviously, this implies very different meanings to the labels ‘consultant’ and ‘employee’ than stipulated by the dominant story. The failure of the project was attributed to Beta’s culture of rigidness and scepticism towards new ideas – however, according to the dominant story, culture did not play a prominent part in Beta. Hardly surprising then, that the ‘stubborn organization’ story failed to convince, given the collective frames for sensemaking established by the dominant story. Instead, the ‘naïve consultants’ story, which had an almost complete semantic fit with the dominant story, was preferred. There, employees were as they should be, wise and competent, and saving the company from the disastrous suggestions of inexperienced consultants. While this might be expected from ‘consultants’, according to this story, the real blame lay with the project manager, who had failed utterly to demonstrate ‘good leadership’ in the sense given by the dominant story. Since the story’s semantic fit made it convincing, the connotation of failure and ‘bad leader’ that it assigned to the project manager subsequently stuck, and eventually led to his dismissal.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the introduction, it was argued that the presence of dominant stories in an organization may contribute to organizational inertia, since they serve as collective frames that enable, but also restrict, sensemaking. As an effect, alternate sensemaking, which would otherwise be able to trigger change, appears implausible or even unthinkable, and therefore the organization is able to change only in a direction congruent with the dominant story. This restrictive effect of dominant stories on the potential for organizational change is well known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0018726711424322">Aaltio-Marjosola, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0018726711424322">Geiger and Antonacopoulou, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0018726711424322">Murgia and Poggio, 2009</xref>), but as we have argued in this study, it may be further understood by regarding the semantic level of storytelling, and how a dominant story is able to fix the meaning of the concepts or labels available for sensemaking in the organization. This in turn affects the possibilities of storytelling – more specifically, which stories become sufficiently verisimilitudinous to appear convincing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0018726711424322">Brown, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>In both cases, the projects created arenas, where through the relative seclusion of the projects and the participation of external actors, the dominant story was less prominent, and alternative storytelling emerged. While not developed with that intention, these alternative stories were nevertheless perceived as threats by the remainder of the organization, which reacted quite aggressively in its attempts to maintain the dominant story in its hegemonic position. In both Alpha and Beta, it appears that the dominant stories had fixed the associative connotations of some of the central concepts needed to label and make sense of organizational events, such as <italic>good leadership, employee, consultant</italic> or <italic>project</italic>. Telling a story about either the Analysis project or the Change project without using these labels would be very difficult. However, as they had in both cases been given a specific meaning by the dominant stories, this meant that they could not be used to tell any story, at least not in a convincing manner. The plausibility of a story can thus only be understood if the linguistic context within which it is told is taken into consideration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0018726711424322">Van Dijk, 1995</xref>), as the associative connotations of these labels were locally constructed in the context of Alpha and Beta respectively.</p>
<p>As we have seen, in order to make sense, a story would have to display a good semantic fit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0018726711424322">Brannen, 2004</xref>) with the dominant story. Otherwise, it would become a sequestered story (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0018726711424322">Clair, 1993</xref>), which few organizational members, regardless of position, would choose to tell. A dominant story thus not only influences the narrative content of an organization’s storytelling, but on a linguistic level it may change the organizational language, creating local language games. In the case studies presented here, these language games primarily engage the associative meaning of words, which makes them not overtly visible to outsiders and new employees, but noticeable mainly in the reaction of the listeners when telling a story. Thus, a focus on the interplay between semantics and storytelling provides further explanation for how storytelling is intertwined with politics and power struggles within an organization: by affecting sensemaking not only directly through narrative content, but also indirectly through the labels necessary for the sensemaking process. The symbolic violence of namegiving means that authoritative sensemaking not only affects the collective frames of reference, but also the local language, and thereby what can be said with credibility within the organization (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0018726711424322">Brown 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0018726711424322">2006</xref>). The semantic element thus highlights the dialogic nature of storytelling, at its most fundamental, linguistic level.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it would appear that the semantic fit of the story told is more important for its impact than the position of the actors who tell it. Although it was the CEO who told the ‘good project’ story in Alpha, it was nevertheless overtaken by the dominant story already in place. In these cases, story seems to trump position, and sheer numbers seem to matter more than the positions of those giving voice to the stories. The strength of a story would seem to depend on its integration with collective frames of reference and local language, as mirrored in the number of people who tell it, rather than on the storyteller himself.</p>
<p>The subsequent change that did take place in Alpha, after the Analysis project was concluded, also suggests that while dominant stories may contribute to inertia, they do not render the organization completely immobile – rather, they restrict organizations, and have to be taken into account when constructing a story that is sufficiently convincing to lead to change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0018726711424322">Tripsas and Gavetti, 2000</xref>). It would seem, therefore, that the view that inertia denotes a general tardiness in organizational flux (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0018726711424322">Van der Steen, 2007</xref>) may be nuanced, as organizations seem more likely to be inert in some instances of attempted change, while non-resilient in others. In Alpha and Beta, inertia would seem to be linked to cognitive processes of sensemaking mediated by language, rather than a general inability or unwillingness to change (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0018726711424322">Schwartz, in press</xref>). As indicated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0018726711424322">Geiger and Antonacopoulou (2009)</xref>, if organizations are ‘storytelling systems’, then organizational inertia is to some extent a narratively constructed phenomenon. Including the semantic aspect of storytelling, as can be seen from the case studies presented here, allows us to explore how this construction may come about through the appropriation of language by a dominant story.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In this article, we have explored how the storytelling practices and thereby the sensemaking processes of an organization may be related to organizational inertia. If organizations are in a state of continuous flux, and its members use stories as a means of making sense of this flux, to label and categorize the events taking place, then the concepts used to label and categorize are a central part of the sensemaking process. We argue that a dominant story may be able to fix the meaning of central concepts required to construct stories about the events in an organization, so that they are given specific associative connotations in the local linguistic context of the organization. Thus, if these concepts are then used to tell an alternate story that contradicts the dominant story, such a story will appear oxymoronic – if ‘good leader’ denotes a person who independently makes decisions without relying on others, then ‘the CEO displayed good leadership by engaging outside expertise to reach the best decisions’ will not make sense. As successful authoritative sensegiving requires a verisimilitudinous story (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0018726711424322">Brown, 2004</xref>), this means that a story that can influence the sensemaking of other actors must use these labels with the same meaning as they are given in the dominant story, which in turn restricts what stories can be told. The dominance of a hegemonic story thus lies not only in the fact that it is able to fix the meaning of events, but also in that it is able to fix the meaning of the concepts needed to create alternate stories about these events. This explains how dominant stories may become comparatively resilient, and appear stable even though storytelling is inherently fragmented and fragile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0018726711424322">Dawson and Buchanan, 2005</xref>), for they render deviant stories oxymoronic, which makes it likely they will be sequestered. Thus, dominant stories have the potential to govern sensemaking, so that change is only possible as stipulated by these stories, which in turn contributes to organizational inertia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0018726711424322">Geiger and Antonacopoulou, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0018726711424322">Tripsas and Gavetti, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>The proposed contribution of this article is thus twofold: first, we suggest that by regarding the label-making aspect of sensemaking, the semantics of storytelling, we are able to further our understanding of how organizational sensemaking is enabled and restricted. These collectively constructed labels constitute the link between the individual and collective aspects of sensemaking, and thereby the centripetal and centrifugal forces of storytelling (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0018726711424322">Humphreys and Brown, 2002</xref>). Second, the hegemony of dominant stories results from their ability to appropriate language, and thereby to restrict sensemaking. Bereft of words, the deviant storyteller is in effect rendered mute and any attempts at alternate sensegiving are subverted. As a consequence, dominant stories may contribute to organizational inertia, enabling only such change as concurs with them.</p>
<p>One implication of these findings for further research is the insights that may be gained from literally making a linguistic turn in organization studies, including not only narrative aspects of organizing, but also linguistic tools and concepts, such as semantics. More detailed studies of the linguistic context within which stories are told may thus fruitfully extend our understanding of the micro-level of organizational storytelling. Such a linguistic approach may thus complement a more narratively-inspired analysis, which focuses more on the narrative content of the stories told (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0018726711424322">Whittle and Mueller, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, it should be noted that when regarding the struggle for meaning manifested in the stories told around organizational events such as the case-study projects of Alpha and Beta, it becomes apparent that not only are the concepts used only understandable if regarded in their context, the stories themselves also share this dialogic nature, drawing on and referring to the stories already told by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0018726711424322">Bakhtin, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0018726711424322">O’Leary, 2003</xref>). Stories are created in response to, as defence against, or as attacks on each other, and thus share the processual nature of the organization of which they form an intrinsic part.</p>
