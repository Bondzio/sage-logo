<title>Using Technology to Unlock Musical Creativity by Scott Watson</title>
<graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_0027432112456955-fig1.tif"/>
<p>by Scott Watson. New York: Oxford University Press, 2011; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.oup.com">www.oup.com</ext-link>.</p>
<p>In his thought-provoking and motivating book <italic>Using Technology to Unlock Musical Creativity</italic>, Scott Watson opens a portal to a fresh and inspiring realm of ideas that take music education to new levels. The book presents ideas for handling the lack of creativity in the traditional music classroom through the philosophical and practical application of music technology. Watson’s strong background in composition and wealth of teaching experience provide an expert perspective on how music educators at all levels can implement creative projects.</p>
<p>The book is organized into two major parts. The first handles the philosophy behind creativity in music education, summarized by Watson’s eight principles for unlocking musical creativity: (1) allow students to share themselves, (2) offer examples to imitate and inspire, (3) employing parameters that keep students focused, (4) removing parameters that stifle creativity, (5) facilitate improvisation, (6) coaching interaction, (7) feedback and critique, and (8) performance (p. 6). This section is chock-full of meaningful thoughts and ideas that draw the music educator into hours of contemplation and are delivered via Watson’s conversational approach.</p>

<p>The second section includes practical lesson ideas for deploying Watson’s eight principles using various types of music technology such as creativity with keyboards, sound recording, multitrack music production, and computer notation software. A more practical resource, this section allows the teacher access to the activities as needed. Substantial methodology and deployment tactics are offered that equip the educator to plan and implement each project with efficiency. As an educator in an individualized musicianship program at the high school level, I have had instant success applying these projects to my curriculum, and my students find the projects challenging, educational, and enjoyable.</p>
<p>The book includes access to online resources through the publisher’s website that offer examples of many of the projects in the book. Watson offers these examples of his own students’ work, which help the reader to view the projects as realistic and worth the effort. Examples include videos of project performances as well as audio files of students’ recorded projects.</p>
<p>Watson is well aware of how quickly technology becomes obsolete. Therefore, he deliberately focuses his attention on the philosophy of employing creativity rather than on the technology itself. Specific examples of technological hardware and software are mentioned, yet Watson leaves the projects open to adaption as music technology evolves (p. 12). Throughout the book, definitive footnotes for “techie” jargon are given to help readers who are not as technically experienced, and each chapter concludes with a fantastic set of summative reflective questions.</p>
<p>Scott Watson has created a treasure trove of ideas for taking the doldrums out of the music classroom while facilitating technology implementation. This book is a highly recommended resource for any music teacher looking for a fresh atmosphere in the classroom. It could also be required reading for college students of music education to prepare them for future creative exploits in their classrooms.</p>
