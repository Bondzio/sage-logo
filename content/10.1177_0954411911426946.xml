<abstract>
<p>Functional magnetic resonance imaging analysis has made major strides in recent years, both because of the development of new scanners and owing to magnetic resonance compatible systems that make it possible to stimulate parts of the human body during analysis. The significant gains in our knowledge of the brain that can thus be achieved justify efforts to construct machines with control circuits suitable for this purpose. This paper presents a magnetic resonance compatible mechatronic device with electropneumatic control that can be used to move one or both feet during functional magnetic resonance imaging analysis of the cerebral motor zones. The system is innovative and original. The results obtained at the end of the investigation were good, and demonstrated that the design is feasible.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Over the last few years, advances in robots<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954411911426946">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954411911426946">2</xref></sup> and medical science have led to new mechatronic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954411911426946">3</xref></sup> devices that can be used in a variety of operations, including noninvasive analysis with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954411911426946">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954411911426946">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Basically, such magnetic resonance (MR) compatible devices can be classified as follows: external stimulators for analyzing cerebral activation with fMRI, mechanical vibrators that use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) analysis to measure wave propagation in tissues to diagnose cancer, robotized or assisted systems for assisted surgery intraoperative Magnetic Resonance Imaging (iMRI),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954411911426946">6</xref></sup> and haptic interfaces for fMRI investigations in fields associated with neurosciences or rehabilitation after trauma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954411911426946">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>There are various types of MR-compatible robot<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954411911426946">8</xref></sup> or haptic interfaces,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954411911426946">9</xref></sup> which make it possible to move the upper limbs during fMRI analysis of the associated motor zones. Some of these produce active or passive movements of the patient’s wrist, arm, fingers or hand.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954411911426946">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954411911426946">11</xref></sup> Other devices featuring a variety of geometries and types of actuation have been used that activate certain zones of the brain by moving the patient’s feet to investigate motor neuroplasticity in both healthy and disabled subjects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954411911426946">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954411911426946">16</xref></sup> As most of these analyses use MR scanners, it is essential that the materials, actuators and sensors used be MR-compatible.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954411911426946">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0954411911426946">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>Pneumatic or hydraulic actuators<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0954411911426946">20</xref></sup> have long been widely used for these applications, as the fluids they employ are magnetically inert and thus MR-compatible, and they provide a number of advantages: power can be transmitted from the exterior to the interior of the resonance chamber, even when large distances are involved.</p>
<p>Pneumatic actuators in particular are simple, clean and safe, and also use relatively low pressures in contact with the patient.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0954411911426946">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0954411911426946">22</xref></sup> Because of the compressibility of air, on the other hand, they are less precise than hydraulic actuators and entail delays between command and actuation, especially when lines are very long.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0954411911426946">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0954411911426946">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>The sensors, which are usually force and/or position units, must also be constructed especially for these applications,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0954411911426946">28</xref></sup> as electric circuits cannot be installed near the scanner for reasons of MR-compatibility and in order not to cause interference with data acquisition. In general, these sensors make use of optical principles to carry the signal outside the MR chamber via fibre. In particular, optical encoders have been widely applied for these purposes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0954411911426946">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>This paper presents a prototype test device designed and tested as part of an extensive lower limb rehabilitation protocol.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0954411911426946">30</xref></sup> The main focus of this paper is on the analysis and optimization of the pneumatic control circuit applied to the new fMRI investigation device. The paper thus discusses an innovative pneumatically actuated mechatronic system for fMRI analysis of cerebral motor zones following active or passive movement of the patient’s feet. The problems addressed in developing the system will be presented, together with the approach used for optimizing the control circuit, for which a fully pneumatic MR-compatible design was selected.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0954411911426946">31</xref></sup> In general, as fMRI analysis requires a higher magnetic field than MRI research, it is fundamental to ensure the absolute MR-compatibility of mechatronics devices used during tests.</p>
<p>The main innovative characteristics of the machine include: adjustment capabilities, ease of handling and prompt control, potential for investigating motor cortex by moving one or two feet, ability to work with both active and passive patients, and presence of a synchronism circuit between prototype and MR scanner to improve experimental tests.</p>
<p>A pneumatic control system was selected for three main reasons. First, it is compatible with the environment of the resonance chamber, where it is not possible to use electric/electronic controls or components that could be damaged by or interfere with the magnetic field and jeopardize the test. Second, it makes it possible to modulate the force on the foot by regulating operating pressure. Third, pneumatic control is clean, and thus suitable for hospital environments, where compressed air is available directly from the mains.</p>
<p>Some of the technical requirements for this prototype are thus: MR-compatibility, patient safety, ease of use, various working configurations, anthropometric regulations, etc.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0954411911426946">
<title>Description of prototype</title>
<p>To investigate the cerebral motor areas through fMRI analysis, a one degree of freedom machine was designed that is capable of rotating two pedals to which the patient’s feet are secured. Movement is produced by means of a commercial pneumatic cylinder consisting of nonmagnetic materials. The motion imposed on the feet either actively (i.e. with the machine operating in ‘passive-patient mode’) or passively (i.e. with the patient moving independently, ‘active-patient mode’) makes it possible to determine the angle travelled by the ankle, while the scanner analyzes the activated cerebral zones.</p>
<p>The prototype was synchronized with the fMRI scanner software using a specific electronic circuit. In fact, when the prototype start button is pushed, the scanner start signal waits for the experimental test procedure to be fully operational.</p>
<p>The entire machine was constructed of nonmagnetic materials such as aluminium, brass, polymer, etc. These materials were chosen in order to satisfy the clinical protocol that analyses the MR-compatibility of a device in the scanner on the basis of image clearness. It should be emphasized that this preliminary prototype works in an open loop, with no feedback position control or force modulation.</p>
<sec id="section3-0954411911426946">
<title>Pedal assembly</title>
<p>The pedal assembly is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954411911426946">Figure 1</xref>. Pedals (1) can be coupled to each other or decoupled by means of pins so that analysis can be conducted on one foot or on both feet simultaneously. The feet rest on pads whose position relative to the hinge can be adjusted by means of the slots (2) shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954411911426946">Figure 1</xref>. A T-bar (3) connects the pedals to the nonmagnetic technopolymer and aluminium pneumatic actuator (4), which moves them through an angular stroke (5) that is mechanically limited by means of stops positioned on two perforated angular brackets (6). This establishes the angle to be used in plantarflexion and dorsiflexion. The angle is measured by an optical potentiometer (7), which detects the pedals’ angular position. The pneumatic cylinder (4) is supported by an upright retained to the base of the device (8).</p>
<fig id="fig1-0954411911426946" position="float">
<label>Figure 1.</label>

<p>Pedal assembly schematics</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954411911426946-fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>The prototype also features several anthropometric regulations. Cylinder stroke makes it possible to establish a rotation of 20 °+5 ° (safety margin) in dorsiflexion and 30 °+5 ° (safety margin) in plantarflexion.</p>
<p>An optical potentiometer (accuracy 1% full scale) was developed in order to determine the pedals’ angular position. In this potentiometer, a shaft positively connected to the pedal assembly turns a gear, which meshes with a rack to move a mirror. The optical signal arrives at the potentiometer via an optical fibre consisting of two cables. The upper cable transmits the signal generated by a red light-emitting diode (wavelength 660 nm), which is reflected by the mirror and transmitted to the management software outside the resonance chamber via the lower cable. The intensity of the light beam, which is reflected and transmitted to a processing unit, is proportional to the mirror’s distance from the optical fibre input, and hence to pedal rotation.</p>
<p>The prototype was tested in the laboratory as well as at Centro Clinico Sperimentale (CCS)-fMRI, Koelliker Hospital and University of Torino, Italy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0954411911426946">
<title>Pneumatic control circuit</title>
<p>The electropneumatic circuit that controls machine operation is located outside the resonance chamber and is connected to the pedal assembly via 7 m long optical fibres and pneumatic lines.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954411911426946">Figure 2(a)</xref> shows the final layout developed for the electropneumatic control circuit after numerical simulation and testing in the laboratory and at the hospital. Air enters from filter F and passes through pressure reducer R1, set to 4 bar. It is then divided into three branches. The top branch supplies 4 bar pressure to emergency valves SE, OE and PE, i.e. software emergency, operator emergency and patient emergency. The central branch, after passing through valve E, which interrupts supply in the event of an emergency, and valve A, which enables machine operation in passive-patient mode when switched by the electric signal, supplies solenoid valves F and D, which control the cylinder via power valves PF and PD. The bottom branch, which further reduces air pressure by means of R2, passes through valve P to enable machine operation in active-patient mode. When electric signal P is applied, the front chamber of the cylinder is supplied by valve PD to compensate for pedal weight and to make it easy for the patient to move their feet freely. Valves PF and PD can be used inside the magnetic chamber because of their nonmagnetic technopolymer and aluminium construction. Flow regulators Rf1 and Rf2 (on PD and PF vent ports) are used to regulate cylinder speed during machine operation in passive-patient mode.</p>

</fig>
<p>The general behaviour of the prototype is based on the fact that the passive patient is equivalent to a load that is not adjustable during the test cycle. Thus, the flow regulators are used to establish a flow rate to the pneumatic actuator whereby its chambers reach a pressure capable of guaranteeing cycle time.</p>
<p>Valve RE is used for reset after an emergency, while T<sub>1</sub>, T<sub>2</sub>, T<sub>3</sub> and T<sub>4</sub> are pressure transducers. These are class 1 transducers, used for noncorrosive gases and pressures from 0 to 10 bar. Accuracy is ± 2.5% of the full scale reading. The transducers are necessarily located outside the MR chamber and respectively measure pressures in the cylinder chambers, pressure at valve outlets (T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub>), supply pressure at inlet (T<sub>3</sub>), and pressure downstream of valve E, which is fundamental in circuit emergencies (T<sub>4</sub>). In a preliminary version of the machine, valves PF and PD were not used, and valves F and D were connected directly to the cylinder.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0954411911426946">
<title>Management software</title>
<p>The machine can be used by accessing management software, which controls operating logic through a user-friendly graphical interface. Together with the electronic circuit, the computer for the management software is located outside the resonance chamber.</p>
<p>The software is designed to control the pedal cylinder at various operating frequencies, control emergency situations (via software and pneumatic circuit), save patient ID data, export data and provide a graphical interface for the physician.</p>
<p>In particular, referring to the circuit shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954411911426946">Figure 2(a)</xref>, it should be emphasized that the pressure transducer T<sub>4</sub> level is used to check supply pressure for emergency situations. A flow chart of the management software is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954411911426946">Figure 2(b)</xref>. As can be seen, each test starts with a general check on the whole system before the start button is pressed. The physician must then adjust cylinder velocity and pedal angle variation, followed by the test parameters.</p>
<p>After this, it is necessary to choose between ‘active-patient mode’ and ‘passive-patient mode’. If ‘passive-patient mode’ is selected, the operating frequency and test protocol must be set. Each screen form has a virtual emergency button to enable the operator to stop the program during analysis.</p>

<sec id="section6-0954411911426946">
<title>Laboratory tests and simulation</title>
<p>In accordance with a medical test protocol, the machine must cause the patient’s foot to rotate at an average frequency of 0.5 Hz for 12 s, with a cycle pause of 12 s.</p>
<p>The first tests, conducted with a pneumatic circuit that was not provided with valves PF and PD, demonstrated that the considerable length of the lines (7 m, 4 mm inside diameter) between the control system and the machine, together with the compressibility of the operating fluid, made it impossible to exceed 0.2 Hz. In addition, as Rf1 and Rf2 are located at a distance from the actuator, speed regulation was ineffective. The circuit was thus thoroughly analyzed and modified after numerical simulations and experimental tests carried out in the three stages described below.</p>
<sec id="section7-0954411911426946">
<title>Stage 1: preliminary investigation of circuit dynamics</title>
<p>The bench test set up to check the dynamics of the circuit with remotely located valves is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954411911426946">Figure 3</xref>. The circuit includes two solenoid valves F and D with pressure transducers T<sub>2</sub> and T<sub>3</sub> installed downstream, while transducer T<sub>1</sub> is installed directly in the cylinder chamber. The electrical command for these valves is provided via a programmable logic controller (PLC), so as to generate a variable-frequency square wave. Output from F and D is connected via lines identical to those on the actual unit (7 m length, 4 mm internal diameter (ID), 6 mm outside diameter (OD)) to the test cylinder, which is identical to that which moves the pedals on the complete prototype.</p>

</fig>
<p>Pressure was measured by using test tubes constructed as per ISO 6358:1989.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0954411911426946">32</xref></sup> To simulate a load, tests were conducted with two types of weight (1 and 2 kg) connected to the cylinder, and with several supply pressures Ps (3.0, 3.5, 4.0 bar). Masses were chosen by analyzing the weight of the pedals and legs on the pneumatic cylinder in the real prototype. Supply pressures were selected on the basis of levels available in the hospital.</p>
<p>Experimental results show that the long lines between pneumatic actuator (inside resonance chamber) and control circuit (outside resonance chamber) delay the cylinder control signals. The maximum operating frequency achieved in this condition is 0.2 Hz. Consequently, careful control circuit redesign is required.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0954411911426946">
<title>Stage 2: simulation and analysis</title>
<p>The problems of the initial circuit were analyzed by conducting computer simulations that preceded the final experimental tests. The software used for this purpose makes it possible to select components from an internal library and to create new functional blocks, simulating various kinds of pneumatic, hydraulic or mechanical devices. Only the portion of the circuit that controls valves PF and PD and actuator dynamics was simulated. The remaining parts of the circuit have no influence on system dynamics.</p>
<p>A number of different layouts were then tested until the optimal design schematized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954411911426946">Figure 2(a)</xref> was identified. During simulation, valves F and D were represented by software library components, setting functional parameters verified through experimental tests. Pneumatic pilot stages of valves PF and PD were simulated by means of specific models to provide a more realistic simulation of their dynamic behaviour. The pneumatic pilot stage is simulated using two pneumatic commands on a mass (valve poppet) moved by friction. Displacement (x) is then used as the command signal for valves PF and PD. Pneumatic capacities and resistances of PF and PD control chambers were also considered in the theoretical model.</p>
<p>A complete schematics of these theoretical components is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954411911426946">Figure 4(a)</xref>. By way of example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954411911426946">Figure 4(b)</xref> shows experimental results and the solution provided by the model of the pilot stage during a positive step response time test carried out by supplying valve PF (or PD) at 2.5 bar (valve limit operating pressure) and piloting it with 2.5 bar. As can be seen from this plot, the model provides a response which is very similar to that obtained in the laboratory, especially in terms of response time. The pressure oscillations measured in the laboratory are due to variations in supply pressure during valve switchover. This disturbance does not exist in the simulation.</p>
<p>In addition, the pneumatic cylinder is simulated by mass, capacity and experimentally obtained friction coefficient.</p>
<fig id="fig4-0954411911426946" position="float">

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954411911426946-fig4.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>A resistance–capacity (R–C) model was used to simulate tubes because inductance effects were negligible for the low dynamic effects in these control tubes. Both simulation and experimental tests were used to validate performance of each component (valves F, D, PF and PD; cylinder; tubes), investigate the dynamic behaviour of each element and of the circuit, analyze results, select the optimal configuration, and carry out final tests on the complete machine in the laboratory and at the hospital.</p>
<p>Parameters varied during both theoretical and experimental tests included: mass connected to cylinder m (1–2 kg), operating frequency f (from 0.2 Hz to 0.7 Hz), duty cycle d (0.15, 0.25, 0.40, 0.50), and relative supply pressure Ps (3.0, 3.5, 4.0 bar). The electric commands for valves F and D are complementary to each other.</p>
<p>In particular, as power valves PF and PD used are bistable components, the advantage of controlling them using different duty cycles (d) and different operating frequencies was investigated. In fact, with a low duty cycle, discharge time in the tubes between F/D and PF/PD valves could be reduced, with a dynamic improvement in the circuit.</p>
<p>Some of the theoretical and experimental results obtained are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954411911426946">Figure 5</xref>, with an operating frequency of 0.5 Hz and three different duty cycles: d = 0.5 (100% of opening half-period), d = 0.4 (80% of opening half-period), d = 0.25 (50% of opening half-period) and d = 0.15 (30% of opening half-period). The diagrams on the left illustrate theoretical results, while experimental results are shown on the right.</p>

</fig>
<p>Electrical control signal and output pressure P<sub>c</sub> (valve D) are shown at the top left. Pressure P<sub>c</sub> (from valves D or F, respectively) is the control pressure for the pneumatic valves PF and PD. As can be seen from pressure P<sub>c</sub> behaviour, the switching phases of valves PF and PD (see circuit in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954411911426946">Figure 4(a)</xref>) are in full agreement with experimental tests. The maximum P<sub>c</sub> value is also comparable in the two situations indicated here.</p>
<p>The plots in the second row of the figure show Puf pressure behaviour (see circuit in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954411911426946">Figure 4(a)</xref>). Theoretical and experimental results are still similar. As can be seen from this behaviour, there is an immediate pressure rise after PF/PD valve switching (see P<sub>c</sub> graphs). Subsequently, Puf decreases at the beginning of the cylinder movement, causing an increase in volume. Finally, Puf rises again during the last part of the cylinder stroke, in which volume variation is reduced. The lowest figures show Pud behaviour (see circuit in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954411911426946">Figure 4(a)</xref>). It is complementary to Puf behaviour and refers to the opposite cylinder movement.</p>
<p>Theoretical and experimental results are similar for each d value. These tests make it possible to establish that the optimum working condition is obtained with d = 0.4. In fact, this duty cycle ensures both quick PD/PF valve switching times and suitable tube discharging times.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954411911426946">Figure 6</xref> compares theoretical and experimental results with a different operating frequency. As Figure 6 indicates, the model is effective in simulating actual circuit behaviour, and can thus be a useful design tool. In particular, f equal to 0.5 Hz is the optimum frequency required in the medical protocol, but this parameter must be varied from 0.2 Hz to 0.7 Hz. Here again, theoretical and experimental results are good and in full agreement. As indicated earlier, the part of the circuit with the greatest influence on circuit dynamics is that of the pilot lines for valves PD and PF. Accordingly, the simulations sought to assess the actual influence of the 7 m long lines connecting pilot valves F and D to power valves PF and PD. The machine’s dynamics with line lengths of 7 m and 0.5 m were thus evaluated.</p>

<p>For this purpose, a lumped parameter model of a purely resistive line was used that simulates pressure variations following displacement of the air mass. Of the several models tested, this is the theoretical result that best approximates the experimental ones. In fact, with 0.5 m long tubes, the delay between voltage step Vc and power valve PF and PD switchover is thus sharply reduced. It can be concluded that, without valves PF and PD, the length of the lines connecting the case and the power section significantly reduces the machine’s maximum operating frequency.</p>

<title>Stage 3: final circuit definition and experimental tests</title>
<p>After verifying the optimal behaviour of the final circuit through simulation, nonmagnetic valves were sought on the market. Two bistable three-way nonmagnetic valves were finally selected and tested as PD and PF components. The MR-compatibility of the device is guaranteed by the choice of materials used in its construction and verified directly from the imaging obtained by the scanner during preliminary tests carried out with expert operators.</p>
<p>A bench test was set up to assess the dynamic performance of the final control circuit (see circuit in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954411911426946">Figure 2(a)</xref>). Pressure measurement tubes complying with ISO 6358:1989 were used to ensure correct dynamic pressure acquisition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0954411911426946">32</xref></sup> The experimental method was chosen in order to simulate actual conditions during fMRI analysis. The experimental circuit was improved, reaching an operating frequency of up to approximately 0.7 Hz with a weight of 2 kg on the pedals.</p>

<title>Preliminary clinical results</title>
<p>The system developed through simulation and laboratory tests was then used to conduct several preliminary clinical tests. These tests were carried out on around 10 healthy subjects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954411911426946">Figure 7</xref>), following the clinical test protocol. The paradigm was 12 s of plantarflexion/dorsiflexion at 0.5 Hz frequency followed by 12 s of rest, for a total acquisition time of 6.6 minutes. Data acquisition was performed on a 1.5 Tesla INTERA™ scanner with a SENSE high-field, high-resolution (MRIDC) head coil optimized for functional imaging.</p>

<p>In particular, an MR-compatible device must be MR-safe,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954411911426946">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954411911426946">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954411911426946">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0954411911426946">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0954411911426946">23</xref></sup> without interference with fMRI analysis. The prototype presented here is both intrinsically safe and MR-compatible.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954411911426946">Figure 8</xref> illustrates selected fMRI results: passive movement activations are at the upper left, while active movement activations are shown in the upper right panel. The time span for an region of interest (ROI) in the left primary somatomotor cortex in the two paradigms is illustrated at the bottom. These preliminary results from fMRI analysis (properly correlated with the motion parameters mapped here) suggest a cortical reorganization in motor areas, such as the supplementary motor area (SMA), precuneus and cerebellum, after training, which may show the effect of rehabilitation on the reorganization of somatotopic maps; more advanced fMRI analysis is now under way. During analysis, 40 independent components (ICs) were extracted with the independent component analysis (ICA) plugin, and each ICA plugin time span was correlated with the stimulation protocol and the six motion parameters resulting from the three-dimensional motion correction algorithm. For each paradigm, the four ICs found to be better correlated with the stimulation protocol and those that were better correlated with motion parameters were mapped. The passive stimulation-related IC, although affected to some extent by motion noise, as expected, shows a robust sensorimotor, supplementary motor and cerebellar activity plus some temporal and parietal clusters. The mean M1 time course shows that the activity in this area is strongly correlated with the stimulation paradigm. The active stimulation-related IC is less affected by motion noise, and shows a less robust sensorimotor and supplementary motor activity, a cerebellar activation plus some thalamic, frontal and cingulated clusters. The mean M1 time span shows that the activity in this area is less correlated with the stimulation paradigm and with motion parameters.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The development of an innovative prototype involves performing many different tests in order to introduce improvements and achieve good results. The preliminary results obtained are good because they demonstrate the suitability of the medical protocol used with the device. Overall, the MR-compatible device presented here is useful for examining brain activation through motor circuits during various lower limb movements.</p>
<p>The current system employs open loop control, but can be improved by making use of the optical potentiometer for position feedback. In the future, research will be continued, both on healthy subjects and on patients, studying motor learning tests and various types of pathology.</p>
