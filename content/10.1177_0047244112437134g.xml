<p>The paradox is well known of the novelist awarded the Nobel Prize in 1952 while a major part of his literary output – his journalistic writings, on literary, religious, personal and political topics, which would amount to several thousands of articles by the time of his death in 1970 – remained unappreciated and relatively little known. John Flower’s selection of 46 articles is a valuable addition to the growing number of editions in recent decades in which Mauriac specialists have sought to reveal his ‘second career’ – if it was not, in truth, his first. Representing the earliest period of these writings, and drawn from 13 different publications, they offer a judicious sample of Mauriac’s literary and theatrical reviews, eye-witness accounts of religious pilgrimages and retreats, ironical sketches of an increasingly irreligious French society, moving evocations of the dead (and survivors) of the Great War and incidental musings on subjects as widely ranging as censorship and sport. Arch-specialists will know many, or all, of these writings from their original publications in long since yellowed journals of the period; some, including Mauriac’s first ever publication in the Bordeaux journal of the Christian Democrat <italic>Sillon</italic> and his exercises in polemic against the leftist opponents of the abbé Fontaine in Clichy, have been reprinted before; but most of the material here will be new to modern readers. The subtitle of Flower’s collection, like the title of Jean Touzot’s 1977 edition <italic>Mauriac avant Mauriac</italic>, invites this new readership to enjoy a foreshadowing of the later and greater journalist; but the intrinsic interest of many of these articles, apart from the future they herald, speaks for itself. They are permeated, necessarily, by Mauriac’s Catholic faith, which is the basis on which he is most often drawn to literary texts – especially when their authors are friends and fellow Catholics like Jammes, Lafon or Claudel – but without closing his eyes to the greatness of Proust, Gide and Valéry, who did not share that perspective. Nor does his deep moral seriousness stand in the way of the humour which characterizes many of these articles, softening his often bitingly ironical demolition of unoriginal young poets or of the modern commercial theatre, whose products he invariably finds intellectually vapid. His aesthetic preferences, as well as his social origins, draw him to the conservative and traditionalist right. He can admire Russian literature, but not the American culture which − as French cities were flooded by new-world servicemen in the closing months of the war − threatened French values; nor the American president who has built his Temple of the League of Nations by the ‘Calvinist’ (p. 238) lake of Geneva and has come to teach Europe how to graze its flocks, usurping the authority of the true pastor who lives across the Alps. At this distance in time, such observations do not offend as once they might; rather, they throw an enjoyable light on a French culture shock. Standing out among these articles are Mauriac’s review of Fromentin’s <italic>Dominique</italic>, closely relevant to the first novel he was then writing, his pilot study of Lacordaire, and his 1912 survey of the pre-war literary scene, which deserves to be read and known. Flower’s 80-page Introduction links the texts into a cohesive narrative of Mauriac’s beginnings, quoting in addition from several further pieces which, presumably for reasons of space, are not included in full. He also gives an excellent account of the journals themselves, their creation, their rivalries, their mergers and their disappearance. Regrettably, the book contains a number of printing faults which produce grammatical and spelling errors, even of some proper names. There is a series of wrong dates (wrong years, wrong months) in the Introduction (p. 12), although the correct dates – verified from the original journals – are given in the main text and in the table of contents. These minor blemishes will not prevent new readers of these texts from enjoying them, or die-hard <italic>mauriaciens</italic> from welcoming their appearance within a single cover.</p>
